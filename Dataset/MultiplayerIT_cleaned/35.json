{"name": "Freak Out: Extreme Freeride - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freak-out-extreme-freeride-recensione.html", "text": "Crisis As soon as we started the game, we selected our skier and immediately chose to engage in a single race, before dedicating ourselves to the real career. There are four modes that can be tackled: Mission, Downhill, Bone Race and Downhill Style. The Mission mode consists of a race in which you have to carry out various missions distributed on the track. We will therefore have to perform acrobatic jumps trying to accumulate as many points as possible, collect stars in sequence, slide along logs and slopes, make long jumps trying to land in specific areas and collect dogs scattered around the track. At the end of each race, a summary sheet appears in which the passed and failed objectives are summarized. The aim is obviously to center as many as possible. The Free Descent mode consists of a race against time in which you have to perform stunts to keep the risk level high (the meter for which appears at the bottom left). Here, speed and accurate knowledge of the track count a lot. The Bone Race mode, on the other hand, is much more technical. Various bones are distributed on the track and must be collected in sequence. Missing even one means failing miserably. The Downhill Style mode, on the other hand, consists of performing various stunts in sequence to accumulate as many points as possible. Making it is an epic feat since the slightest mistake will result in the failure of the test. After various quick games, carried out with various skiers, we could see that the specific characteristics of the characters have little influence on the races and the differences are only noticeable after having acquired many points in the different skills... unfortunately we have not noticed only this. soon the question that definitively sinks this production comes to mind: is that all? Crisis Freak Out: Extreme Freeride has so many flaws that they clearly overshadow its strengths. In fact, right from the start, it is clear that it is a ~hard~ title ... in the sense that two out of four modes are of a humiliating difficulty. The Mission mode, for example, could be really addictive, were it not for the short tracks and some forbidding objectives that require religious dedication to be overcome. The same goes for the Downhill Style mode in which, moreover, the big problems of the control system emerge thanks to the need to perform stunts like world champions. Having to press three or four keys in rapid succession is not the best of life, especially if you don't have a joypad with many keys. Even in this case, however, you may find problems due to the game's difficulty in recognizing the various keys; for example, on both joypads used for the review, it was not possible to map the button assigned to the ~back~ function of the menus... in short, the game takes advantage of the beauty of seven keys (one for jumping, one for sliding, three for stunts and two for lateral movements) of which at least a couple are useless and only make the gameplay heavier, which never manages to be completely fluid. To further increase the difficulty, a rather imprecise collision system takes care of it. On many occasions, jumps and stunts require millimeter precision to be performed, without crashing into the various elements that decorate the slopes (rocks, trees, poles and other rather hard things). The same argument is feasible for the execution of the slides. In short, by combining all these factors, being able to control our skier and, above all, being able to pass the various tests, is a company worthy of Nirvana. In some cases, the frustration reaches unprecedented levels and causes the emission of drool and unrepeatable curses from the mouth, as well as the invocation of the protective deities of gamers. Obviously the difficulties increase the satisfaction for the victory Reshuffle at least until this becomes so high, in advanced matches, that chamomile drips are needed to be able to continue playing without risking ending up in the street yelling at passers-by. Fortunately, the other two modes are more balanced and compensate for the frustration by allowing for more carefree fun ... but this too does not last long. Soon the question that definitively sinks this production comes to mind: is that all? The career mode is made up of a series of races to be faced in order to unlock advanced equipment and be able to progress in the game. Too bad it's structured in a limited way and doesn't have a real sense of existence: there are no championships, there are no general classifications, there are no personalized competitions, there is no training mode...in short, moving forward in the career, or carrying out the same races in sequence in the fast mode does not change anything. We players are now used to something else and such poverty is not justifiable. But at least there are some very juicy extras? You are wondering no. I said no. There is practically nothing. Unlocked all circuits and equipment Freak Out Extreme Freeride is dead code that can only be revived from multiplayer mode provided you can find someone online to play with. Luckily there is the possibility of facing off against a human opponent on the same computer (the infamous hotseat mode), so if you bought the game and you have a friend you want to fight with, let him play with you. All that is missing is to talk about the technical part. How to define it? The SSXs released for older generation consoles are clearly superior to them, except for the higher resolution and the presence of the Pixel Shader 2.0. The snow is soft and well made as are the tracks left by the skis, a pity for the poverty of the three-dimensional models of the characters and the various elements and for the lack of a greater sense of speed. On the other hand, the fluidity proved to be exceptional on all occasions without ever showing uncertainties. The soundtrack deserves a separate note which offers pleasant songs by DRUNK WIZARD, Point Leonard, Jelly Beat, 3 Feet Smaller, Alone and Acoustic and Alien 101. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 1.8 Ghz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: Direct 3D compatible with 64 Mb, supporting Pixel Shader 1.1 Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Card Video: Direct 3D compatible with 128 MB, supporting Pixel Shader 2.0 Test configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3,4 Ghz RAM: 2 Gb Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Conclusions Telegraph: leave it on the shelves. Freak Out Extreme Freeride went inexorably off the track crashing on the rocks. Pros I don't remember games that simulate off-piste skiing worthy of the name Doing stunts is fun, as well as crashing The soundtrack is composed of very nice tracks Cons Some modes are very frustrating, mainly because of the control system Few game modes Very few extras worthy of the name Freak Out: Extreme Freeride is available for PC and PlayStation 2. The tested version is the PC one. fugitives Since the snow is missing from the Italian mountains this year, what could be better than a nice off-piste ski simulator? In fact, the idea is quite intriguing and I don't think there are any such games. There are plenty of crazy snowboarding simulators (on consoles on PC much less) and series like SSX lay down the law. Skiing is less beaten but it too has more than a few dedicated titles; above all the German market is very active in churning out simulators of the various ski disciplines which, unlike snowboarding, are available above all for PCs. If desired, there is also a game dedicated to curling, the sport that so intrigued the Italian public during the 2006 Winter Olympics; it's called Curling 2006 and it was distributed only in German-speaking countries why did I tell you about it? Simple: Ludovica and Melani will never dedicate a news story to this misunderstood masterpiece and therefore I decided to mention it in this article to let you know about its appearance on this planet (what strength was the vodka I drank at dinner? Dunno I'm raving). Brrr, it must be said while remaining on the snow theme. Back to us, Freak Out: Extreme Freeride comes to fill a gap, also allowing fans of extreme skiing to engage in a video game dedicated to them. But will it be worth it?", "date": "2007-03-13", "grade": null}
