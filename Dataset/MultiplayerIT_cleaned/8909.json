Thanks above all to a great charisma and an excellent implementation of the Wiimote. Nonetheless, the most familiar public of the Nintendo console hasn't proved to be the most appropriate target for a game that made some of its strong points of scurrilities, bad taste, blasphemy and machismo, so much so that the reception in terms of sales has been exceedingly lukewarm. Fortunately for Sega, the arrival of Playstation Move represented a godsend, an opportunity to make up for it by offering one of the best shooters for Wii to a more receptive user, exploiting the features of PlayStation 3 to offer an Extended Cut in high definition and with several exclusive contents. Between strip clubs and butchers Being mainly an aesthetic restyling, the heart of Overkill: Extended Cut has remained exactly the same as two years ago: the game is a very classic rail shooter, in which the player's only concern is to aim at the screen and blow up the head to (almost) everything that moves, enjoying in the meantime the irreverent chatter between the characters. Unlike any other chapter in the series, however, Overkill stops taking itself seriously and offers an exhilarating storyline  la Grindhouse, made up of an over-the-top external narrator and characters that seem to come out of the worst b-movie. Particularly apt is the combination of agent G with Isaac Washington, a stereotypical African-American policeman who never misses half an opportunity to hit rock bottom with his colorful dialectic. Varla Guns, a sex bomb already present in the original version, is joined this time by the unprecedented character of Candy Stryper, a stripper as naive as she is uninhibited, emblem of stereotypes and sexual perversions whose jokes go from funny to bad taste in the blink of an eye . Two new game levels are dedicated to her with as many boss battles, one set in a filthy stripper club teeming with mutants, the other in an enormous butcher's shop. The bosses at the end of each of the two scenarios are arguably some of the most disgusting and revolting the series has ever seen, though they remain fairly straightforward to take down, with time-sensitive weak points to hit and trivial QTEs to solve by shooting on-screen targets . The four unlikely protagonists thus find themselves going through a series of settings in search of Papa Caesar, the cheap psychopath who spread the mutant epidemic, in a fairly short adventure despite the addition of two unpublished episodes. Among the most successful levels there is undoubtedly an abandoned circus in which, passing through rides, tents and stalls, freaks and zombified clowns face off. Small mini-games, an additional mode, weapons to buy and extra content to unlock try to add meat to the fire, but for those who have already played the original version there are very few reasons to buy this Extended Cut as well. After all, once the dialogues lose the surprise effect and the ability to make people smile, the balance ends up leaning only towards bad taste. Playstation 3 trophies As for the 40 trophies list, Overkill: Extended Cut is rather linear and very little varied. The proposed challenges are mostly limited to proceeding in the adventure, eliminating mutants and upgrading one's weapons, while the most original trophy asks to ~complete a level without ever using automatic reloading~. The Facelift of the Living Dead Instead, those approaching the title for the first time find themselves faced with one of the few games that give meaning to the existence of PlayStation Move: of course, Overkill also supports the traditional controller, but considering its nature as a lightgun game and the successful implementation of Move makes very little sense. After a very quick initial calibration, the aiming system is as precise and responsive as, if not even superior to, that of the Wiimote; where the PS3 controller comes out defeated is instead in the action required to reload the weapon, since the low sensitivity forces the player to shake Move in a perhaps too pronounced way. Finally, there are few notes relating to the aesthetic restyling of Overkill, which even if it exploits the power of PlayStation 3 to offer more detailed and high definition graphics, is not sufficient to mask the fact that the game was developed on a less powerful platform . Pleased however are the various optimizations and stabilization ofthat dancer framerate which represented one of the weak points of the original version, while someone will appreciate the vast support for 3D, both stereoscopic, for TVs that support it, and anaglyphic, for those who can instead put on the classic red / blue goggles. Precisely to take advantage of this new depth effect, the developers have enriched the game with various more or less successful gimmicks, adding a whole series of enemies who throw knives and bottles at the player or a boss who comes out of the screen along the lines of The Ring.", "date": "2011-11-25", "grade": "8.0"}
