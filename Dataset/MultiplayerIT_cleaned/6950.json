Everything seems to be going exceptionally well in her life, but something threatens her happiness: recently three girls disappeared on campus, found days later in a daze without being able to tell what had happened to them. Before the truth was discovered, all three left the university, shocked by what had happened. The dialogue system is typical of the genre Despite the fear of being kidnapped too, Nicole has a strong and determined character and does not let herself be frightened. On the contrary, she decides to spend part of her student days looking for clues to understand what is happening. On his way he will meet four boys, Darren, Kurt, Jeff and Ted, all fascinating in their own way and all potential partners. How to seduce them? What if the kidnapper is hiding among them? This, in short, is the plot of Nicole, a Winter Wolves dating simulator that catapults us once again into a story made up of mysteries and love affairs, all told by long dialogues between the characters, which give life to different situations throughout the course of the adventure. We will talk about the game system in a dedicated paragraph. Here we specify that the narrative system is the typical one of the genre, with the drawn characters that appear in the various places, also depicted by static drawings, and overlap with others during the dialogues. So expect long texts to read and some choices to make to please the four boys (or to annoy them), with Nicole who will be led to make several mistakes, fortunately not irreparable, while trying to understand who is behind the disappearances. From here on we will try to avoid giving you further details on the plot, which as you will understand is fundamental for the game economy. The only aspect that should be treated is the quality of the texts, which are indeed good but not excellent. We see that the reference target is a very specific audience, but something more could have been done to avoid certain stereotypes. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is very beautiful, with well-played dramatic pieces that contribute enormously to creating the right atmosphere, oscillating between the pink of love and the yellow of the thriller. Will Nicole be able to find out what is happening in her school and find the missing students? The Alternatives In recent years, several interesting appointment simulators have also come out here in the West, even if the bulk of production remains relegated to Japan alone. If you like the genre, however, you can choose from various titles in the Winter Wolves catalog, certainly the most active publisher here in the West. For example, you could try Always Remember Me, perhaps the best dating sim we've reviewed, or Roommates, which allows same-sex love stories. If you are not particularly interested in the dynamics of seduction and you just want an excellent visual novel, the choice can only fall on Steins;Gate, one of the best titles of the genre in recent years. game system Nicole's gameplay is very classic in the dating simulator genre. It simply requires you to select the girl's daily activities from time to time, choosing places from a list of icons that appear on the screen. Each place has several activities associated with it. Thus, for example, staying at home in the evening it is possible to study or tidy up the room, while going to the cinema one can watch a film or observe the customers to try to get some clues about the disappearances and so on. The choices are many and apparently it can displace not knowing what to do exactly. Don't be alarmed, because the important thing is that, as the genre rules, you keep an eye on the characteristics of the character, always visible on the left side of the screen. Each feature is in fact linked to one of the four possible love stories. If you know a little about appointment simulators, you will have already understood how it is worth playing: the favorite feature of one of the coveted boys happens (you can guess it from the dialogues), you make it grow with the activities. Once a certain amount has been reached, seduction is almost certain, given that you always need to find the right gifts to give to every boy. Of course, Nicole's physical and moral energies need to be recharged from time to time, perhaps with a good night's sleep or an expensive restaurant lunch, otherwise some activities become counterproductive (especially at the highest difficulty level of the three selectable ones). From time to time you also need to keep an eye on your wallet, because by running out of the budget available to the girl some attactivities become impossible to accomplish. However, said in general, the title of Winter Wolves respects the schematic of the genre, without the slightest desire to create imbalances. After all, the fans of these games, or it would be better to say the fans, given that they are aimed above all at a female audience, want nothing more than to see beautiful love stories unfold on the screen, with beautiful drawings depicting passionate kisses and barely coitus mentioned (there are also erotic dating simulators, but this is not the case). From this point of view, Nicole does not disappoint, with ten possible endings, linked not only to the four seductive boys, but also to the thriller plot that develops throughout the adventure. This means that you have to replay it several times to complete it and unlock all the images in the gallery where the progress made is collected. That's not cheap, even compared to some competitors. Upcoming Male Protagonist and Complete Edition of the game For those who want to play a boy instead of a girl, know that Winter Wolves is developing a version of Nicole with a male protagonist who has to seduce four girls. That is, it is probable that the title of the game will be different, given the change of protagonist, but the setting will be identical. We honestly don't know if the plot will have changed as well. Also note the existence of an extended version of the game, which has several extra contents, including the beautiful soundtrack in MP3 format and some wallpapers.", "date": "2014-08-27", "grade": "8.0"}
