This is the case of Foursaken Media, which with Puzzle to the Center of the Earth adds an ~adventurous~ dimension to a super-tested formula. You broke my blocks The user takes on the role of an explorer who has the goal of reaching the center of the earth, and to do this it is necessary to eliminate the colored blocks that make up the subsoil from the screen to create a passage that allows you to reach the exit of each level, obviously positioned in the lower part of the picture. By swiping a finger on the lower part of the display it is possible to move the protagonist directly, moving him to the right or left or making him jump, while to make the cubes of the same color disappear, it is sufficient to draw a line that includes three or more of them, being able to act indifferently horizontal, vertical or oblique. Foursaken Media has made sure to combine these basic mechanics with a whole series of elements that contribute to creating a good level of challenge that makes Puzzle to the Center of the Earth a challenging but rarely frustrating title. In fact, the protagonist begins the levels with a set amount of energy that decreases every time he interacts with the blocks, giving the player the choice of aiming directly for the exit or exploring the stage in search of the various bonuses. The latter is a path as risky as it is profitable, given that there are different reasons of interest within the scenario: each scheme in fact has a hidden switch and chest that increase the overall score, as well as special blocks containing green crystals that flesh out the energy and gold coins that can be used to buy new characters, upgrades and one-time use items in the shop. As with many other similar titles, Puzzle to the Center of the Earth also lends itself to two different ways of fruition: if you don't care too much about the results, you can advance through the levels without major problems, while the depth and complexity increase exponentially if the aim is to obtain the maximum evaluation for each internship. Puzzle to the Center of the Earth offers a new take on the match-three puzzle genre It must also be said that, especially in the more advanced stages, being able to reach the coveted 100% without ever purchasing any paid content becomes a truly difficult undertaking: in fact, the game requires you to pay 99 cents to immediately recharge the energy run out or start again immediately if you run out of lives, and the three most useful consumable items are only available upon payment of the same amount. Then there are the packages of gold coins that can be purchased by credit card, essential if you want to access the offers in the shop without having to waste a lot of time grinding. However, this is an acceptable compromise, far more honest than the money-sucking solutions adopted by certain particularly ~smart~ free to play games. However, it would be a shame to snub Puzzle to the Center of the Earth just because it belongs to a category that (unfortunately) includes many red herrings among its ranks, considering the good playful qualities fielded by Foursaken. Specifically, the game shines for an even more accentuated strategic component compared to other titles that share the same basic mechanics: part of the merit must be given to the formulas that can be purchased in the shop, which allow you to generate certain effects if you combine a certain number of pre-set color blocks. An aspect that stimulates the user to act carefully, looking not only at the combinations of identical cubes, but also at the possible chances of exploiting the formulas, often capable of turning the tide of an entire stage. In the overall more than positive picture of Puzzle to the Center of the Earth, the only slightly out of tune notes fall within the scope of the technical realization, with graphics that leave quite indifferent and really very monotonous music that doesn't even seem particularly in in line with the style of the game.", "date": "2014-11-13", "grade": "8.4"}
