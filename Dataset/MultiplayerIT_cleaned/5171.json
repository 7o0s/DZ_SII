Naturally, it was Ubisoft's attempt to create its own Grand Theft Auto, however introducing different themes closely linked to the gameplay, in this case the world of hackers, smart cities with all their contradictions and a protagonist, Aiden Pearce, who acted out of revenge: tired, tried by life, he abandoned his habits to pursue a single purpose, and that is to annihilate those responsible for the death of his niece. Of course, also trying to clean society from bad apples in the meantime. In short, a ruthless punisher who used technology to his advantage to control vehicles, traffic lights, cameras and of course computers. That mix of storytelling, atmosphere and gameplay worked, allowing Watch Dogs to establish itself as the best-selling day one game ever in Ubisoft's history. It is therefore surprising that for this second episode the French house has thought of changing practically everything: we have a new protagonist, Marcus ~Retr0~ Holloway, a twenty-four year old who is as skilled in hacking as he is athletically gifted; a new setting, represented by the San Francisco Bay Area, twice the size of Chicago in the opening chapter; new mechanics related to computer violations, also enriched by the introduction of two different drones; and, above all, a very different approach to storytelling, which abandons the serious atmospheres of the original game to offer something decidedly more frivolous and light-hearted. Watch Dogs 2 is a very different game than the first episode, rich and fun despite the plot What a special group The incipit of Watch Dogs 2 sees Marcus intent on deleting his personal data from the ctOS servers as a ~baptism of fire~ to join the San Francisco DedSec and therefore join a group that includes Sitara, a skilled street artist far wiser than her years; Wrench, a very strange guy, who always wears a mask with an LED display to communicate his mood; Josh, shy and taciturn but damn good with computers; and Horatio, employee of Dudle (fictitious version of Google) by day, executioner hacker by night. The story revolves around how the Blume Corporation is using ctOS 2.0 and the famous social network Invite (aka Facebook) to manipulate people, steal their information and even influence their vote. Marcus himself was years earlier a victim of the system, wrongly accused of crimes he hadn't committed just because the powerful multinational's software deemed him capable of committing them. The DedSec group opposes these aggressive profiling techniques by launching its own app and inviting its followers to share computational capacity to allow the violation of Blume's servers and thus reveal the truth about its work. Now, if one of the defects of the first Watch Dogs was the lack of insight into the supporting actors, we can safely say that the sequel remedies this deficiency and portrays Marcus' adventure companions quite well, perhaps even more than it does with him. The problem is, however, that the plot always remains rather inconsistent: a particular event occurs after the first half of the campaign, but we are very far from Aiden's motivations. The atmosphere is generally light-hearted, designed for a specific audience, and although some cutscenes make you smile, there is a real risk that some of the users do not recognize themselves in these characters, who ultimately fight evil with evil : they obtain money by transferring it from the bank accounts of random people, steal vehicles on the street, read messages and listen to private phone calls, and often clash with the police. Hard impact Although the Watch Dogs 2 system represents the natural evolution of the mechanics seen in the first episode, the initial impact with the game is not the best and it takes some time to understand where the developers want to go. Here too there is a great emphasis on stealth and the possibilities have multiplied for Marcus to activate the ~tactical view~ to exploit manhole covers, engines and electronic devices to his advantage, transforming them into stun charges, thus removing a nice a few enemies before even going personally to the location of a mission. In this sense, the two drones play a fundamental role: the Jumper, equipped with wheels and a spring to make leaps, allows the protagonist to also complete physical hacking and is therefore tremendously comfortable for completing tasks rischy, perhaps in an office full of guards; the Quadcopter does not boast these characteristics, but it is really useful for stealing access codes on the fly (literally) and carrying out a reconnaissance of the places to identify threats and strategic points. We can say that the behavior of the enemies is not trivial, and indeed the degree of challenge is quite significant, especially in the advanced stages or in certain side quests, so much so that you will find yourself having to repeat them several times. Succeeding in a seemingly impossible feat produces great satisfaction, as does understanding how a certain point can be reached or a system breached. We found the mechanisms related to the traps a lot of fun and well implemented, a sort of strategic variation that finds fertile ground especially in some secondary missions, when we are provided with an outline of what the situation will be in a few minutes and we will have to prepare the location best to deal with threats. The ~circuit~ puzzles are also beautiful in which you have to lead the energy along a path to access a device, regulating the various branches and unlocking nodes to get the signal to its destination. We should also applaud the quality and variety of missions, without distinguishing between main and secondary: beyond the sorties in the bases of some gangs, you always find yourself doing different things and new mechanics are introduced from time to time, such as those concerning the control of cranes and mechanisms, or even the production line of robots designed for military use. In this regard, a funny quote from the first Watch Dogs also stands out, but we don't want to spoil the surprise for you. So stealth and its implementation are good, but unfortunately there are no alternatives, in the sense that silent action is in most cases the only possibility, even when perhaps the game encourages us to take up a grenade launcher and unleash the hell without caring about anything. In those cases the clear numerical superiority of the adversaries and their ability to surround us (and even to quickly call for reinforcements) means that our chances of survival are close to zero. Let's also add an unconvincing gunplay and a decidedly lower emphasis on the arsenal than everything else (primarily the skills that we can unlock using the points earned during the campaign), and it is clear why the solution we have always preferred in the game was to distract enemies by making their phone ring and quickly take them down. Sure, as long as they didn't shoot in groups... All mine the city If the smart city concept hides many threats, in the same way Marcus can exploit the peculiar computer system that regulates the functions of San Francisco (and of the vehicles that roam its streets) in order to control the scenario almost completely. Strengthening the hacking of cars allows them to be stolen without even triggering the alarm, but it is the traction control of other vehicles that makes the difference, allowing us to have the road clear of any obstacles thanks to a simple push of a back button. which causes the vehicle in front to swerve sharply to the right or to the left. Similarly, if chased we will be able to trigger bombs using the manhole covers to eliminate the car that we have on our heels, or even in that case use hacking to make it skid or brake and thus gain a bit of an advantage. The variety of vehicles present in the game is formidable, and although the physics tend to be a bit light and the driving approach inevitably arcadey, there is a good differentiation depending on the car or motorbike we drive, passing from more nervous to others precise and easily manageable. The setting naturally plays a fundamental role: the San Francisco of Watch Dogs 2 is splendid and includes surrounding areas such as Silicon Valley, Oakland, Civic and Marin. Among the many places present there are also numerous easter eggs and more or less autobiographical quotes for Ubisoft, which are added to the usual, full-bodied hours of sandbox-based productions like this. You can set a destination on the virtual smartphone and leave, or go around for the pure pleasure of doing it, perhaps going to clothing stores to give the protagonist a look in line with our tastes. Speaking of smartphones, as in the first chapter it is a fundamental device, through which we can access the missions, the map and secondary functions such as the driver's duties or the ScoutX app, which rewards us with new followers if we take selfies in certain location. Added to this is the inevitable Media Player, where to selectthe songs from the soundtrack that will accompany our adventures between different genres or thematic radio stations. Dynamic multiplayer Watch Dogs 2's approach to online multiplayer is very interesting, as activities that you can do together with other users are seamlessly inserted into the standard action. For example, it happens that we are near a player that we have the task of hacking, and at that point it is possible to decide whether to pursue this activity or to move away and stay on the campaign. There are many types of online events, both competitive and cooperative, and in the first hours of testing we had the opportunity to try different ones, with the only exception of the more structured one, ~Bounty Hunter~, in which a player wears the clothes of the wanted man and the others chase him, moreover with the support of the police force. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty Trophies of Watch Dogs 2 are obtained by completing activities that follow the events of the single player campaign, but the sandbox could only open up a series of extra opportunities: being photobombed during a selfie, stealing a bus, petting a certain number of dogs, complete a regatta, participate in speed races and so on. From a technical point of view Beyond a fluctuating characterization for the characters, with Marcus in the first place who is a bit anonymous, it must be said that technically the developers of Watch Dogs 2 have done a great job. We notice less attention with regard to the many non-player characters, as is normal, but as mentioned the San Francisco scenario is splendid and is well enhanced by a solid and convincing lighting system, good effects (the reflections of the water in the puddles, while the rain is only moderate), by an excellent rendering of the water and by a fairly wide visual horizon, even if there is some pop-up from time to time. The textures are clear and succeed in the arduous task of not being repetitive, with a view to a setting full of personality even in its suburbs, with suggestive cross-sections that actually make you want to open the protagonist's camera app and take a picture selfies. The many vehicles that can be used boast a convincing design, referring to real models of brands that are not actually represented in the game, and are damaged in a variable manner depending on the impact. The huge world created by Ubisoft Montreal moves well on PlayStation 4 (more on the rendering on PlayStation 4 Pro separately), maintaining the thirty frames per second in most situations, whether you turn on foot or in the car. The dips occur during particularly messy firefights, between explosions and volleys, or while driving in traffic and making a hairpin bend, forcing the graphics engine to quickly recalculate the landscape. There is some aliasing on the cars, but nothing major. As far as the sound sector is concerned, some clarifications must be made: the soundtrack is fairly varied and it is even possible to find new songs around the map, but it tends to be a bit too intrusive and we preferred to deactivate it during our hours of game. Since this is a completely personal matter, it is clear that to your ears it could instead be exciting and indispensable. We found the Italian dubbing excellent, but there is a big problem with the audio levels that afflicts the early stages of the game and that heavily undermines the rendering of the dialogues, with volumes that are too low compared to ambient sounds or obvious differences between one level and the other: we hope that this can be fixed with an update, because we are talking about an inconvenience that significantly affects the first impact with the experience.", "date": "2016-11-14", "grade": "8.5"}
