{"name": "Deadly Skies III", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deadly-skies-iii.html", "text": "Aviation anime or arcade shooter? Airforce Delta drags us into the frankly rinsed storyline of an anime set in a military universe, but it does so without too many pretensions in terms of depth. Alternate between the fights, divided into missions and richly illustrated by real-time dialogues and substantial introductory briefings, and the enjoyment of the plot itself, which develops mostly within the operational base where we will be able to have access to all the additional component to the game in the strict sense. Inside the bases it is possible to dialogue with the characters, get an overview of the plot and the situation of the fights, access to the various and many aircraft, to the missions with relative briefings and to the aircraft repair and upgrade locations. Once the aircraft have been repaired, purchased and learned of the details of the plot, we will be ready to move around the map towards a new mission. The more points we earn, the more money we will have to buy goods. But even defeats will affect game progress, in the form of penalties and lost profits. All the dialogues are presented in a pleasant narrative style which breaks up the monotony of the character portraits by presenting them with a series of portraits which match the different content of the dialogues (halfway between avatars and animations). However simplistic the storyline, and however anonymous and pervaded by that somewhat indifferent aesthetic in which many unoriginal or authorial souls take refuge, the model works as a pleasant diversion and enrichment of the gaming experience, to the point that this it wouldn't be the same without the dialogue and narration component. Interludes, however, are not enough to define gameplay, and Airforce Delta must also present itself as a solid and fun shooter. If compared to its predecessors it is undoubtedly improved, however, it still fails to make the leap in quality capable of bringing it, metaphorically speaking, to the heights of titles such as Lethal Skies or Namco's superb Ace Combat. What is missing is not the control, solid and functional. In the planes, many and varied and all well made: this time they range from the infamous Aurora experimental aircraft or Sea King helicopters to World War II aircraft, passing through the various MIGs and reaching a total of over 130 different trinkets. Even the construction of the planes, and the related ad hoc armaments, are well done, with a great level of care in their characterization and a more than discreet aesthetic realization. After all, Airforce Delta does not lack a good technical realization either: despite the non-miraculous number of aircraft polygons and backdrops, which reveal a minimum of architecture when flying low, the texture mapping is never excessively grainy and is generally of excellent resolution, while the effects of heat, light and condensation are particularly enjoyable (and also used in abundance in the rendered sequences of the intro). The audio is excellent, with a good selection of musical pieces capable of keeping the pace high and above all the inclusion of fully spoken dialogues between the numerous characters of the missions, through which it is also possible to anchor the game to the plot in an engaging (perhaps sometimes a bit chaotic). Aviation anime or arcade shooter? So what is missing from Airforce Delta? It is soon said. Firstly, a decent feeling of speed. The game's physics are consistent but hardly spectacular or engaging, and even at full throttle it's hard to feel truly imbued with the sense of speed that such a mile-per-hour level should deliver. The most serious shortcoming, however, is the weak level design. On balance, the missions are very similar, and all translate into the same method of execution (elimination of enemies, targeting, circles to evacuate the last healthy outpost of enemies, etc.) despite the often quite marked differences in the method aircraft control. Combined with the absence of a sensation of speed, the banality of this level design transforms the abundance of missions (about sixty) into a sentence to repetitiveness. Too bad, then, that often the use of aircraft is anchored to certain characters, making the development of the game even more linear. If all the narrative and audiovisual apparatus works, and if the vast choice of excellently made aircraft can decisively attract enthusiasts, it is however the playable nucleus of Airforce Delta that imposes itself with all its limitations in front of the player who is not fond of the type. Airforce Delta is a title of good technical realization and excellent audiovisual presentation. The plot and the dialogic and narrative sector make it a shooter with an anime vocation, which can please all those looking for more than just a shoot and run. The amount of aircraft available is very high and can please all fans of aircraft and the like: characterization, weapons and presentation do not disappoint. Nonetheless, in terms of gameplay it is bland and repetitive, a negative feature that makes the many missions superfluous and is aggravated by the chronic lack of a decent sense of speed. Enthusiasts can derive much more satisfaction from it than an omnivorous player, prone to boredom as early as the sixth mission. Even enthusiasts, however, should keep in mind the comparison with titles of the same genre: perhaps more close-knit in the case of Lethal Skies, certainly and far superior in the case of Namco's superb Air Combat 4. Airforce Delta is the direct descendant of the shooters that saw the light on Dreamcast and Xbox: Konami's model seemed to be clean enough to be presented to the masses of players and not just those who frequent the genre. On the other hand, the Sony console now has a good choice, which specifically includes the spectacular Air Combat 4 quasi-simulators. Airforce Delta is a shooter that settles much more on the arcade side than on the simulation one. The purely flight component is in fact combined with an almost adventure concept which, although the crossroads are practically non-existent and the development is linear, foresee a lot of recourse to the narration, the storyline and the connecting components between the missions. If the narrative component and the beautiful aesthetic presentation (more than discreet also the technical realization of the game) are well done and enthralling, unfortunately it is the repetitive game mechanics, as well as the absence of a real sensation of speed, that disappoints. Bland and repetitive, the third Konami effort in this saga still fails to come close to the more formidable Namco competitors.", "date": "2004-08-17", "grade": null}
