This is an expansion sold for about forty euros through the Origin portal, a rather high price from which we therefore expect a good amount of content... let's see together if it's worth it! Second expansion for The Sims 4: with Let's Get Together we explore the new neighborhood of Windenburg! Welcome to Windenburg! Windenburg is the new district added by Usciamo Insieme and includes three different zones for a total of a dozen residential and community lots. The first area is the one dedicated to the gardens, characterized by green meadows and picturesque houses, complete with a mansion and a hedge maze: the Sims who visit this place will find scattered throughout the maze numerous plaques bearing the history of Windenburg, they will be able to participate in sumptuous dances and the most in love get married under the beautiful wedding arch. The second area is that of the island not far from the coast, dotted with residential lots and luxurious modern villas with impressive windows overlooking the sea, while on the northernmost tip of the island you will find a community lot dedicated to relaxation and nature. Third and last location is the town itself, full of squares, services and meeting places: the town, clearly inspired by Europe (German in particular), despite the modernity of its premises, is very ancient and this is demonstrated by the lot dedicated to ancient ruins, full of collectibles by day and the perfect location for night-time rave parties. The only con of the new community lots is that navigating the spaces can sometimes be difficult: while in Build mode the perimeter of the lot is clearly visible, in Live mode it is very often difficult to understand how far our Sims can go, sometimes putting several clicks to set the destinations. Is it drinkable? Three very important new objects are introduced within the community lots of the neighborhood: the natural pools, the bonfire and the DJ console. You will find the first one in the pools tool of the Build mode: in addition to the chlorinated one you will find new types of water (crystal clear, with flower petals and two natural variants... with a dubious greenish and brownish color) and, finally, the automatic curbs for edging the pools. The yield of the water is really excellent and, in this regard, you can find the interaction ~swim without clothes~ and ~swim without clothes with~. Furthermore, after a nice ~free~ swim, our Sims will be able to lie on their backs and scan the sky completely naked. The bonfire, on the other hand, can be placed on each lot and is an excellent meeting point for our Simmers, who can all gather together around the fire. Two interactions in particular related to the bonfire are very interesting: the first is the one that allows us to throw the objects of our inventory into the fire, and the more sensitive Sims will have different reactions when they see burning objects, while the second involves several Sims together and it is the voodoo ritual... ideal for taking revenge on one's enemies! Third and last is the DJ console, which will allow the Sims to enliven every party; each Sim can train in front of the mirror and the higher our skills, the better the performances will be, even going as far as inserting the songs requested by the crowd and influencing their mood. Obviously we will have the opportunity to enjoy the party on the dance floor too, bringing our Sims to never-before-seen dance levels or throwing ourselves into funny group dances. Don't wake the sleeping llama There must be a reason why this expansion pack is called Let's Get Together and the reason is soon explained by the introduction of clubs. In fact, affiliation to a club is the new dynamic introduced in this expansion and will be as important as the management of the profession and needs, precisely carving out a dedicated button in the interface at the bottom right. To join a club you will have two options: create one from scratch or manage an existing one, first entering it as a member until you become its leader (always indicated with a crown icon on the head) climbing its social peak. Each club has various common aspects: first of all, it has a name, a symbol, a series of admission requirements (to be met if you want to join an existing one or to be imposed if you create a new one), a dress code to follow, an established meeting place and a series of activities allowed during the gatherings (such as playing a board game or doing physical activitiesca). Particular attention should be paid to this last element of the list because the more collective activities are totalised, the greater the club points that we will be able to accumulate and subsequently spend to purchase new advantages, always within the club. The meeting place can instead be either a specific place or a pre-established type of lot (such as a bar or a disco). Once you become club leader, your members will hang on your lips: remember that anyone can add new members to a club up to the maximum number of members, but only its leader can decide to expel them! Also for this expansion the developers went fishing in a great classic of the history of The Sims: if for At Work they had dusted off the old dynamics of Funky Business, for We go out together they went fishing hands down within The Urbz, re-proposing club affiliation and refining its dynamics. The result in terms of gameplay is excellent but lacks that strong inspiration typical of The Urbz which transformed small groups of Sims into real clubs, almost making it lead to a tragicomic war between gangs to the sound of reputation. On the other hand, the clubs of Let's Go Together are much more reminiscent of American fraternities or American high school groups (do you know the Barbies from Mean Girl? Something like that). However, we are satisfied with the result and with the new test that the development team faced, hoping that the next must of the saga to dust off is that of pets!", "date": "2015-12-15", "grade": "8.0"}
