{"name": "Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-heroes-2-recensione.html", "text": "The war-themed first-person shooter genre is still far from exhausting its vein, and while Call of Duty has recently abandoned its historic WWII glamor in favor of more modern-day situations, for Medal of Honor it's still time to fight the Nazis. In the specific case of Medal of Honor: Heroes 2, developed only for PSP and Nintendo Wii, we will find ourselves reliving some of the salient phases of the conflict through seven engaging missions full of spectacular phases. In full action! After an accurate briefing, excellently dubbed into Italian, which explains what we must do and why, we will find ourselves in the middle of a fierce exchange of blows between our battalion and the enemies. It is clear that we will have to make the difference: the comrades advance and shoot, but rarely score any shots, leaving most of the work to us. Moving between the various shelters to hit the Nazi soldiers will immediately make us familiar with the control system and the character's energy management, which is not based on a bar but, as in the last FPS, on the intensity of the attacks suffered: if we are hit, the screen begins to take on a red hue, which increases as we suffer the attacks until game over. Finding shelter and escaping from enemy fire will allow us to recover in a few seconds, returning to a normal situation. The use of weapons follows a similar logic: do not expect to be able to aim the machine gun and hit the target with absolute precision, as we will have to deal with a recoil such as to make long-lasting bursts useless, together with the low capacity of the magazines. It will soon become clear that the key to continuing in the game and getting the better of the enemies lies in short bursts and continuous reloading of the weapon, so as not to find ourselves unprepared in the face of an ambush. War offers alternatives... The control system chosen by the developers is the one already tested with the first MOH: Heroes, with the analog stick assigned to the movement of the character (who cannot run, but moves quickly enough) and the Square, Triangle, Circle and X buttons which in fact make up for the lack of a right stick, controlling the direction of movement and therefore the viewfinder of the equipped weapon. This is not an exceptional solution in terms of success and will never compete with a joypad equipped with double analog control, but on PSP it is the best that can be done so as not to have to simplify the mechanics of the FSP too much, perhaps by inserting the automatic aim. The back buttons are used to aim and fire, while the d-pad is used to crouch, reload and switch weapons. There are three ~slots~ available for equipment, two for firearms (initially a machine gun and a pistol) and one for grenades. However, after eliminating the enemies, nobody forbids us to pick up their rifles and use them instead of the simple pistol, for example. As far as the combat system is concerned, the rules are the classic ones and therefore there is also room for aimed shots to the head, which however are very difficult to carry out if you do not have a precise sight. When the enemy is very close, we can also hit them with the rifle butt. One of the most interesting elements present in Medal of Honor: Heroes 2, however, concerns the large number of situations in which we find ourselves during the missions, which considerably increase the variety of the action. Each stage has primary and secondary objectives that must be achieved, and often this translates into the use of particular devices such as bazookas, rotating cannons, stationary machine guns or explosives, to be placed in certain key points on the map. Technical realization The Medal of Honor series has always accustomed us to high quality music, and also in this case we are faced with songs full of atmosphere, with an epic and, in some way, cinematic tone. The noises of the various weapons and explosions are also excellent, accompanied by a very well done Italian dubbing. As far as graphics are concerned, we have a frame rate that always remains anchored to thirty frames per second and good quality polygonal models, even if the character animations aren't very convincing. There is always the limit of textures on PSP, but the settings are generally rich in elements and boast a good level of detail. In addition to the local multiplayer, the game has a very interesting online multiplayer mode that allows us to try our hand at even very crowded matches, for a maximum of 32 participants. You can create your own EA Nation account or use an existing one with pall the steps and using the PSP directly, then launch yourself into frantic single or team deathmatches, or try the ~Infiltration~ mode. Even in the presence of many players, no particular lag phenomena are noticed and it is possible to play easily even in large teams, just a pity that in this case the graphics may lose some shots. The control system, which in the single game responds promptly to our needs, unfortunately shows all its limits during online games: we will have to act on the settings to increase the speed of aim movement, or we will hardly be able to be competitive. Comment Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 for PSP is an excellent first-person shooter, characterized by a good technical realization and a series of gimmicks that make the gameplay quite varied: you don't always proceed in the same way, but you have to deal with very different from each other, which represent a challenge not to be underestimated and which, in some way, justify the low number of total missions in single player. The control system is quite effective, also thanks to the not exactly clever behavior of the enemies, who limit themselves to taking refuge and shooting without worrying even when you are a few centimeters away. Things change quite drastically during online matches, though, where buttons fail to mimic the effectiveness of a real stick in the presence of intelligent opponents. The ability to challenge a large number of players with online multiplayer is still a welcome extra and of a certain value, capable of increasing the longevity of a product otherwise destined to be put aside after only a few hours. In conclusion, if you liked the first MOH: Heroes, this sequel certainly won't disappoint you. Pros: Quite varied situations Technically well done Online multiplayer Cons: Poor enemy AI Solo mode too short Online, control system is limited", "date": "2008-01-11", "grade": null}
