We have seen numerous adaptations of classic video games on iOS and Android, perhaps technically flawless but often lacking in terms of playability, mainly due to the control system which, by default, is always a strong limitation on smartphones and tablets. Beyond complicated solutions such as the use of special controllers, the best way to ensure usability in the mobile context is to build games by placing the control system at the centre, therefore developing them around the touch screen, rather than adapting the latter to the classic gameplay. Bombastic Brothers, the protagonist of this review, tries to find a middle ground between the two different solutions, going to retrieve classic dynamics inspired by milestones such as Metal Slug, but modifying the gameplay in order to better accommodate the device control system mobile. The result is quite convincing, as long as the distances from the obvious sources of inspiration are kept in mind. The SNK masterpiece remains a long way off, as well as many run and gun shooters for arcades and consoles, but in the context of mobile platforms Bombastic Brothers manages to be a fun and enjoyable game, even in the general simplification implemented to the classic principles of the genre to meet the control system and the way to play on smartphones. Also in this case, it is a question of controlling various characters with slightly different characteristics within numerous levels, in a fight without quarter against an army of invading bio-mechanical aliens. The references to Metal Slug are evident from the fundamental structure of the game to the settings, up to various side elements: also in this case it is a shooter with marginal horizontal scrolling platform nuances, which puts us to grips with hordes of various aliens with power -ups to collect and also vehicles to use. To underline the connections with the classic SNK also some trifles such as civilians who flee in fear and the same characterization of some playable characters. Shooter with management elements To enrich the structure and distance it from that of the classic arcade, however, there are various additional elements to the Bombastic Brothers gameplay that clearly bring it closer to certain canons established for mobile video games. There is a constant progression of the characters, complete with experience level, additional skills and ever more powerful weapons and equipment to apply, as if to infuse RPG characteristics to the classic 2D shooter. There is also a baseship with rooms to unlock and upgrade dedicated to character training, weapon management, daily challenges and more, adding another layer of strategy and management that can vary the standard action of the various levels. Of course, all this is part of the game's free-to-play mechanics, which is closely linked to the general progression system: the economy is based on the collection of gems that can be used to reduce waiting times in building and upgrading ship rooms or the ability to open prize chests, as well as being able to buy dog tags and other alternative currencies that are needed to level up characters. It is quite clear where Bombastic Brothers wants to go with this complex superstructure made up of upgrades, experience and power-ups: to play even the standard mode a certain level of experience is required for each scenario, which soon imposes a bit of grinding to meet the entry requirements. In one way or another, in some cases you find yourself hitting paywalls, which force you to pay some money or wait for the chests to be unlocked and for additional rewards. It is not a particularly perverse system, also because the use of daily challenges and similar solutions certainly helps in the evolution process, but it is practically impossible to simply continue from level to level in normal mode without running into forced breaks. As for the standard mechanics of the shooter phases, Bombastic Brothers tries to be a cross between a classic shooter and a mobile game: the controls are entrusted to the classic virtual pad on the touch screen but to simplify life the aiming system and the lock-ons on enemies are fully automated which works well for someone who wants a game to take lightly but might be abeRant for the true shooter lover. The graphic component, beyond the usual ~flash game~ effect that non-pixelated high-definition 2D titles often have, is cured and with a good characterization.", "date": "2019-04-25", "grade": "7.2"}
