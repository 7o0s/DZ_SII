At the time the game had struck us for a whole series of reasons, first of all a gunplay capable of offering a solid and exciting impact rendering, but also a very valid level design and a considerable degree of challenge. The sensation was of being faced with a ~hardcore~ production, characterized by decidedly above-average graphics, if we consider the practically indie nature of the title. The release of the Extended Edition, the following year, enriched the campaign with a set of levels set outside the walls of Bezoar, the fortress-city that in the game we had the task of defending from the attack of the machines, repairing the sin original of a challenging but too short story mode and bringing the hours needed to complete the adventure to eight. Taken by the enthusiasm for the excellent reception given preliminary to their new project, Shadow Warrior 2, the guys at Flying Wild Hog have decided to bring Hard Reset to PC for the third time, with an optimized Redux edition and with some new feature (85% discount for owners of any previous version), and to debut the game also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Hard Reset Redux feels the weight of the years technically, but it's still a great FPS Imminent impact The protagonist of Hard Reset Redux is Major Fletcher, a former veteran equipped with bionic implants in the pay of the CLN, a government unit that is responsible for defending the walls of Bezoar, the last city in the world, from the attack of an army of sentient machines. When a breach occurs, with some murders perpetrated by robots, Fletcher is sent to investigate and suddenly finds himself having to face a large number of androids, whose instigator seems to be the mysterious Dr. Novak. But is that really how things are? We will find out during a campaign which, as mentioned, can be completed in eight hours but which reserves very demanding sequences and three spectacular bosses, taking the user by surprise on more than one occasion with the sorties of various robotic enemies and dangerous: from the ~minions~ armed with electric saws to those that explode on contact, passing through the mighty ~gorillas~ that charge the target to the androids armed with missiles and swords, to get to the lethal flying units and the new entries of the edition Redux, the cyborg-zombies. What better way to get rid of them than by pulling out the brand new katana? The sword represents a welcome addition to an arsenal that until now did not include the possibility of making melee attacks, and which provides us with two modular rifles, one conventional and the other energy. By collecting packs of credits around the levels and spending them at special stations, we will be able not only to enhance the basic modes of the two weapons, but also to add a whole series of transformations. The machine gun thus becomes a devastating shotgun, grenade launcher, missile launcher or mine launcher, while the energy rifle transforms into an electric cannon, shock emitter, railgun and smartgun capable of striking targets even through walls, with homing pulses. All these phases, which alternate by acting on the controller's directional pad (perfectly supported on PC) and switching from one weapon to another with the X and B buttons, can be individually enhanced to obtain greater effectiveness and extra features, such as a zoom, the ability to fire a charged shot, and so on. Outside the city The first part of the Hard Reset Redux campaign sees us explore the streets and buildings of Bezoar, while the second part takes place outside the city walls, in a sort of huge ~industrial area~ completely in the hands of robots. The design of the first maps feels the weight of the years a lot, and if in 2011 it was able to convince, despite the evident constraints of the budget available to the developers, five years later it can only be obsolete, also thanks to a slightly distorted perspective too marked and the use of generic textures, which prevent an effective characterization of the locations. Fortunately, things improve outside Bezoar, also thanks to a greater variety of color tones and more advanced effects, also and above all as regards the lights. The enemy robots make up for the aesthetic shortcomings and non-extraordinary animations with their wickedness, since even the smallest opponents prove to be able to worry us, especially when they arrive in large numbers.an number and put us on the ropes. The new shooting maneuver, which can be activated by pressing the right back button, allows you to dodge the devastating charges of the ~gorillas~ and any missiles in a much more effective way, but this addition appears well balanced and therefore does not create an excessive simplification of the gameplay indeed it enriches it. The technical improvements of the Redux edition unfortunately don't catch the eye and there are situations, such as in the main menu, in which it seems to be running a 2011 game on current hardware, the animations ~splash~ so much. It goes without saying that the graphics settings, not very numerous, allow for sixty frames per second at 1080p with all effects at their maximum on the test configuration, but it remains to be seen whether or not the developers were able to obtain the same results on consoles . The sound, on the other hand, is convincing in terms of effects and dialogues in English (albeit with some less brilliant traits), but more could have been done for the music. Once the campaign is completed, some new modes are unlocked, in this case a survival in which we face waves of enemies within various maps, a new game plus called EX Mode and Heroic Mode, a mode without checkpoints and with a very pumped challenge: pleasant extras, also considering the very affordable purchase price.", "date": "2016-06-03", "grade": "7.0"}
