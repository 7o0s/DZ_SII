Well, some ideas have proved to be really effective and have brought success to those who have implemented them, as in the case of Halfbrick Studios. The Australian development team has worked on several conversions of games for consoles in its early years, and then pulled out of the hat, in quick succession, two projects such as Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride. The rest, as they say, is history: the titles in question have totaled hundreds of millions of downloads, even leaving the confines of mobile gaming to land on consoles. As often happens, the studio has never managed to repeat these successes, which however have remained well engraved in the minds of many people. And so, after eleven years, here we are grappling with the review of Jetpack Joyride 2, published exclusively on Apple Arcade: even from the parts of Cupertino they have heard of this series and from there it was a short step to signing an agreement. Structure: no longer endless Jetpack Joyride 2, shooter action in the first scenario How to improve an experience that over the years has totaled something like 750 million downloads? Revolutionizing its mechanics would have been a mistake, and so the developers opted for a different structure, no longer linked to the original endless setting but divided into levels with a starting point and an arrival point, distributed within a campaign that counts currently thirty stages and three different scenarios. The protagonist of the adventure, who can be Barry or Betty depending on the skin we choose to equip, will therefore have the task of completing increasingly difficult paths, full of enemies and traps which, however, ruthlessly determine game over after a single contact as in the original Jetpack Joyride, where our goal was simply to get as far as possible in a single attempt without ever taking damage. No, this time we will have a health bar available, although subject to emptying very quickly in case of blows suffered (but there are still the precious stones to be used to obtain a single ~continue~), and a whole series of systems related to upgrades temporary: an aspect of the first episode that Halfbrick Studios has taken over and upgraded to the maximum. In fact, between one mission and another we will be able to use the coins collected, the projects obtained and the special tokens in order to unlock new upgrades randomly distributed in the scenarios, upgrade them because last longer or are more effective, but also improve the character's resistance and offensive capacity, which in this sequel takes on a very important role, like a traditional horizontal scrolling shooter. Gameplay: between old and new Jetpack Joyride 2, one of the many variations on the theme: the UFO At first glance, the gameplay of Jetpack Joyride 2 may seem identical to that of the original chapter, but just face a few stages to grasp the differences. Our character rises in the air shooting downwards while we touch the screen, trying to be as precise as possible to avoid hitting traps and enemy fire: this mechanic has not been changed. However, situations where you shoot forward at the same time, towards possible opponents, they have practically become the norm and transform the classic action of the game into a curious mix between Flappy Bird and any shoot'em-up, initially a bit trivial due to the low degree of challenge but then capable of renewing itself and add thickness in time for the transition to the second and third scenarios. Jetpack Joyride 2, one of the boss fights The aforementioned power-ups then become the absolute protagonists and there are truly spectacular ones: from the simple three-way cannon to the meteor shower, from the well-known exoskeleton to real variations on the theme, such as when you get on board a UFO or sections with reversible gravity. It is these elements, together with the outline of unlocks and improvements, that make Jetpack Joyride 2 different but at the same time faithful to its formula, and therefore able to arouse interest again. If we then consider the variety of enemies fielded, which also include different boss fight at the end of the paths, it is clear how the authors are committed to finding a way to re-propose an experience that many people may have become nauseous precisely because of its incredible success. Ah, obviously there are absolutely no microtransactions, as is the practice for the Apple Arc catalogHades. Graphics and sound: practically a remaster Jetpack Joyride 2, the inevitable exoskeleton The technical sector of Jetpack Joyride 2 is completely redesigned, although the style of the original game has been preserved. This means that we will find the same graphics, but improved from every point of view: higher resolution, greater fluidity, redone animations and with a greater number of frames, in addition to the nice dialogues between the protagonist and his enemies before each mission. It is a it's a shame that the sound didn't take much advantage of this operation, given that the music continues to seem a bit generic and never proposes solutions capable of remaining imprinted in the mind. Finally, the touch controls seem precise and responsive, as one would expect from such a product.", "date": "2022-08-23", "grade": "8.0"}
