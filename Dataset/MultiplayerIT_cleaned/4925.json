More than other strategic and managerial ones, who have managed to adapt to different needs by developing sub-genres and dedicated versions, city builders have always had a rather difficult relationship with consoles. The reason is obvious: the need to adapt the interface to the use of the controller represents an almost insurmountable obstacle for games that sink their roots between the mouse and the keyboard, relying on the analysis of countless menus and the precision of the cursor to go to act on tiny elements on the screen. Another issue is also the supposed lack of compatibility between the console user and the genre in question, whose cadenced and contemplative rhythm seems to be badly associated with the classic use of gaming machines, while the typical rigidity of mayor/builder simulators seems to prevent a effective adaptation to different styles, which often results in an oversimplification of its structure. For these reasons, the adaptation of Cities Skylines attempted by Tantalus and Colossal Order takes on the contours of a kind of experiment to be followed with particular interest, because in fact it paves the way for a genre that has very few exponents on consoles, practically none in this generation . The chosen approach was rigorous: instead of finding a compromise solution, as done for example by 2K with Civilization Revolution to bring Sid Meier's famous strategy game to consoles, the developers decided to simply offer the complete Cities Skylines experience on Xbox One, adapting it to the controller but without changing its basic structure and contents. A choice that on the one hand derives from the limited budget regime with which the project was carried out, but on the other hand also demonstrates a certain confidence in one's own means, evidently well placed. Now cities in Cities: Skylines can also be built and managed with a controller, on Xbox One The absolutist mayor We have come to know and love the bizarre logic of city builders and Cities Skylines does not deviate from the classic canon of the genre, putting in the hands of the player a sort of urban plenipotentiary that allows you to manage every single aspect of the city. Therefore, starting from the choice of free land, we find ourselves building a new urban agglomeration on this starting from the streets, passing through the dislocation of the different neighborhoods and arriving at the management of more subtle elements such as taxation, education and the various policies between economy and social supports. For the structural elements of the game, we refer to the exhaustive review of the PC version, given that there are no substantial differences in terms of contents and purposes, confirming how Cities Skylines is probably the most complete city builder on the market since SimCity 4, collecting that legacy of Will Wright which only grazed the SimCity of 2013, a legitimate successor which however seems to have betrayed the original spirit to adapt to a Zeitgeist contaminated by social networks, clickers and casuals which has modernized it but also distorted it, at least in the eyes of more traditionalist fans. The beauty of the Paradox game is that it continually offers elements of challenge, stimulating the player to continue to act on his own city without indulging too much in the aesthetic contemplation of the terrarium effect typical of these games, but working hard to respond to the constant citizens' demands and the problems they run into all the time, layered among the many facets of the gameplay. The absence of a real tutorial could disorient the less accustomed to the genre (which could be several on consoles), but this too falls within the strictly classicist spirit of the game, moreover the progressive organization, which unlocks further options and elements in correspondence expansion of the city, is also a nice way to give a sense of discovery and evolution towards an increasingly vast and complete control of the creative and managerial possibilities. Power to the controller Much of the work done on the Xbox One Edition has been done on the adaptation of the interface, transformed enough to be used entirely through the controller. The absolute fidelity to the original structure and spirit has led to a rather classic and at first glance also rather uncomfortable solution, having decided on a sort of semi-direct re-proposition of the mouse pointer: with the left analog stick you move a sort of pointer which assumes various forms and functions depending on the chosen instrument, actingin coordination with the keys. A sort of intelligent support partially automates the movement by making slight jolts in correspondence with sensitive elements and thus helping the player to make cursor movement more precise and faster, a system that generally works well and allows you to use the same variety and complexity of options of the PC version on Xbox One too, although it is not without its problems. The precision obviously cannot be the same as that allowed by the mouse and this is quite evident when there is a need to draw ~freehand~ elements such as in the case of roads or the organization of bus lines, just to give two examples which can also test the patience of players in this version. Radial menus, keys that trigger alternative controls and a general streamlining in the organization of the options still do their best not to feel the weight of a control system so deeply tied to another type of input than the Xbox One controller and with with a little practice and patience the situation improves significantly over time. Xbox One goals Cities Skylines: Xbox One Edition contains 36 achievements for the usual total of 1000 points to unlock. Given the nature of the game, most of these are linked to the performances achieved in city management, based on the performance of some statistical data and on the behavior maintained as ~mayors~, while some are unlocked by reaching the various progressive stages in terms of the extension of the city and the game. City lights Cities Skylines on PC has gone through a process of evolution that has led it to be considerably enriched in content a few months after its launch, and on this front the Xbox One Edition tries to keep up while remaining clearly behind in some aspects more advanced Windows environment. As for the official expansions, this version includes the first DLC ~After Dark~ which introduced greater depth in the management of nightlife in the city and greater continuity in the city's activity from day to night, as well as some options related to public transport and tourism, but the subsequent ones such as Snowfall and Natural Disasters are missing and the intentions on the implementation of these and the next expansions are not clear at the moment. Another penalizing element is the absence of mods, a real pillar of the PC experience which over the months has led to a substantial enrichment in the construction possibilities, as demonstrated for example by the introduction of the possibility of terraforming. Since there is now some experience in the field, it is not said that the Xbox One version will not be subsequently opened to support for mods, but the complexity of the work required for this introduction is badly associated with the semi-indie budget regime that characterizes Cities Skylines, therefore the question remains rather dubious. On the other hand, the transition to Xbox One from a technical point of view was practically painless: the game was already quite optimized and scalable on PC and this led to a well-balanced console version from a graphic point of view, updated to the latest official evolutions of the edition original with a remarkable wealth of details and particulars that emerge in the closer shots. The complexity that can be achieved in the construction of the city obviously tends to make the frame rate unstable, but this is almost exclusively noticeable at higher zoom levels, while the situation always remains quite manageable with the more distant shots, necessary for a game vision optimal. We note that the version tested for the review is in English but it is not clear whether the retail edition arriving on April 28 in Italy is intended to be localized in Italian.", "date": "2017-04-21", "grade": "8.7"}
