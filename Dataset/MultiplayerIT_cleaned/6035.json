It was released in the summer of 2008, during the first and historic Summer of Arcade that brought the digital service delivery Microsoft other pearls such as Braid and the second Geometry Wars, effectively sanctioning the clear evolution of the digital and indie (or semi-indie) market on Xbox 360 and on consoles in general, with Castle Crashers leading the charge of new ~lightweight~ games ~ as a quality alternative to the classic retail landscape. This is the weight of The Behemoth title in the memory of those who bought it at launch: not a very refined and complex product, on the contrary it seemed to scream its nature of production on a limited budget in the face of the player, with its flash game aspect which well remembered the background of the developers in fiercely alternative fields such as Newgrounds. The simplicity of the rough design had an almost iconoclastic strength against the clichs of the scrolling action genre, but the mechanics of the game, conversely, were particularly solid and traditionalist, designed to captivate the player well beyond the short session that flash mini-game seemed to want to inspire. A historical shot is necessary to understand the importance of Castle Crashers in the console panorama, also because in the current richness and variety of the indie market the disruptive force of the game The Behemoth, at this point, has been largely lost and who encountering this game for the first time might consider it just another 2D action game with hand-drawn graphics and a nostalgic style. It is a bit like that in fact, but it is not difficult to see something particularly vivid and substantial in this title. Castle Crashers returns in a remastered version, bringing with it the usual dose of action and craziness Something classic Castle Crashers Remastered is a side-scrolling action game in the style of old-fashioned brawlers, in which we find ourselves facing various levels alone or in the company of three companions in the cooperative mode (as regards the main Campaign) essentially striking against everything what moves on the screen, advancing through the scenarios and occasionally facing bosses that offer very special game situations. The story sees a group of knights (or just one, if you play solo) to rescue kidnapped princesses and a war-torn kingdom in a setting that is something of a demented caricature of the classic fantasy. Nothing actually new, therefore, but a revival of historical themes and mechanics of arcade video games with elementary role-playing integrations in the personalization and evolution of the characters but all characterized by an excellent balance in the rhythms, density and variation of the fights, managing to easy task of always being stimulating and not very monotonous, despite the intrinsic repetition of the same actions. The crazy and humorous different situations in which you find yourself actually play an excellent role of variation but it is also the mechanics of the clashes that balance the action, forcing you to alternate between attack and defense strategies due to a good amount of different enemies resulting in different characteristics and attack patterns. However, it is clear that it is a question of pressing buttons in rapid succession, trying to perform combos and alternating defense, light and powerful attacks with weapons and spells rather than reflecting on the actions to be performed, also considering that sometimes the large number of characters and events on the screen tends to make the action a bit confusing, in some cases covering the protagonist and making it difficult to read the events. To appreciate Castle Crashers it is therefore necessary to have a little nostalgia for the healthy scrolling beat'em up of the past. The presence of a real progression of the fighters, with the possibility of distributing experience points on the classic parameters (strength, magic, defense, dexterity) and unlocking ever more powerful weapons and companions represents an important element capable of giving greater depth to the horizontal scrolling pure action structure. Revision The graphic reworking carried out with this Remastered is not the most evident to tell the truth, above all due to the graphic style adopted from the beginning by The Behemoth and characteristic of the team's productions, as we will analyze later. Therefore, the technical aspect is not the quid that gives meaning to the return to the scene of this game. In fact, its presence is mainly justified by the validity ofbasis of a game that relies on structural elements of imperishable value as regards video games, which make Castle Crashers practically always appreciable. From a content point of view, the team's proposal is decidedly honest, offering all the original content plus further additions between characters and equipment originally released in DLC in a package that is now more complete and balanced than before. In addition to the classic Campaign, which can be tackled in single or cooperative multiplayer, the Arena is back, offering the possibility of varying the action by focusing on pure combat against a continuous wave of opponents with progressive difficulty, ideal for testing weapons, earning money and making some experience points. The only real novelty is the ~Back, Barbarians!~ mode, so strange as to leave you initially dumbfounded. It involves moving the character within an arena divided into square boxes, with pressing each key corresponding to moving a box in the four possible directions. The aim is to resist as long as possible without being touched by the enemies who, gradually, are placed in increasing numbers within the level, trying to move as quickly as possible from one part to another. It is a very elementary game but which somehow manages to keep us glued to the controller to try to improve the resistance times, once we enter the mechanism. Xbox One goals 12 achievements for a total of 1000 points demonstrate a rather tight distribution of rewards for Castle Crashers Remastered. In fact, it seems that the team has simply transferred the same scheme of the achievements present in the original version, but this time with a loot of 1000 points instead of 200. As a result, the previous objectives are now much richer and are unlocked above all by advancing in the Campaign and achieving particular performances in the levels. Polished The simple and clean design, in line with the classic trait of productions designed for the Flash platform, makes the increase in definition to 1080p made on this remastered edition less obvious, despite the fact that the developers have changed the assets using textures with quadruple resolution compared to the original ones. On the other hand, such stylized graphics go beyond any historical context and it is also understandable that The Behemoth has decided not to rework the entire imagery studied for Castle Crashers to forcefully insert additional graphic elements to justify a technological evolution of which the game essentially does not need. Far more important and sensitive is the increase in general fluidity that brings the game to 60 frames per second, an element that in an action game of this shape is pleasant and effective also in terms of playability. The deliberately simple graphic system, almost crude in many respects, is in short closely related to the Castle Crashers experience but the idea remains that the team has made a very minimal effort to re-propose their greatest success on Xbox One, considering that the official price is then 14.99 euros, excluding the advantageous conditions offered to owners of the original who could download the Remastered version for free until 20 September and at the reduced price of 4.99 euros thereafter. The response to the commands is always excellent and prompt, which together with the increase in the frame rate makes the action even more enjoyable, while there are no particular variations in the audio sector which remains the usual, crazy accompaniment worthy of this setting.", "date": "2015-09-21", "grade": "8.2"}
