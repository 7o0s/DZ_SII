{"name": "Lilo & Stitch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lilo-stitch.html", "text": "History The story of the game begins shortly after the end of the movie Lilo and Stitch! This means that a completely new adventure will present itself to your eyes and not a succession of scenes from the film. Stitch, who was originally created to wreak havoc throughout the universe, has now become a quiet resident of a Hawaiian beach community. He has learned the value of Ohana, the Hawaiian concept of family unity, and lives peacefully with Lilo and her sister Nina. Although the entire galaxy and the Earth are experiencing a period of peace, however, something mysterious is about to happen. In fact, in the initial movie you will witness the kidnapping of little Lilo by two shady individuals who will later disperse their tracks first in the forest and later in space. In the role of Stitch you will first have to follow the two shady figures in the forest and then cross the space to save Lilo and defeat the gang headed by the evil Dr. pestus. Stitch the alien! After choosing to start a new game you will find yourself in command of Stitch. The adventure is divided into thirteen different game levels, each of which contains numerous challenges and many enemies to defeat. There will be many locations to explore: you will start the game on the beaches of Hawaii and then get on a starship to cross the galaxy and reach Metropolon where you will visit the Dump, the Mother Spaceship and the City, until the final showdown with Dr. Pestus, the king of mosquitoes. In the first level you will be busy with Stitch intent on taking out the various enemies armed with a firearm capable of firing two bullets at a time. However in the game you will be required to use Lilo as well. In this case you will have to help the girl escape from the Mothership. You will only have Limbo, a doll that you will have to shake to keep the mosquitoes away. The levels have different degrees of difficulty and the further you go the more the enemies will be angry and nefarious towards you. In the game you will also have to take the controls of some vehicles to complete certain levels: for example in one level you will be required to pilot the spaceship while dodging and destroying enemy ships. If you are hit by enemies, you can always repair the damage suffered by your spaceship by looking for power-ups. The best vehicle for Stitch however is the capsule, which has a cannon that can fire in all directions. It is well suited to situations where you have to shoot enemies that come from all over the screen of the GBA. The locations are filled with useful items to collect such as pineapple-shaped grenades and partial and full health boosters. Furthermore, if you collect the eight photos scattered throughout the various levels, you will have access to an additional movie. Dr. Pestus will be your main enemy, but not the only one since there will be other bosses like Bob the Claw and the Dump Monster who will give you a hard time. Finally, whenever you finish a level, you will receive a bonus based on your exploits. In search of the lost Lilo! Lilo and Stitch is structured graphically as a side-scrolling two-dimensional platformer. The game features many different environments. The designers indulged themselves ranging from typically Hawaiian scenarios to the vast intergalactic sidereal spaces. All the locations have been made in 2D even if ultimately they are a bit poor in details. The characters, on the other hand, are well made and you will easily recognize Lilo and Stitch moving on the GBA screen. Worthy of note is the particular care used in the creation of the soundtrack which faithfully reflects the Disney tradition of always composing successful music for one's own productions: all the melodies are cheerful and underline the spirit of pure fun of the game, taking full advantage of the the audio section of the GBA. Save the little Hawaiian girl from the evil Dr. pestus! Lilo and Stitch is a good game that has several action and adventure elements that an average gamer would like to engage with. The action is frenetic and in the first level you will feel like you are playing popular action arcade games from the past such as Rushin'Attack which appeared some time ago on Nintendo 8 bit and I still jealously keep a copy of it today! However, each level has its own difficulty even if we don't really talk about strategy here, but just go on shooting wildly at the enemies who will stand in your way. Ultimately a game suitable for all those who do not want to rack their brains, but also do not want to waste time with something too shoddy for their beloved GBA. Pros: Gcolorful and bright graphics Really well done music Fun and varied Cons: A bit too easy It does not add anything new to what has already been seen in games of the genre The plot is the usual: to save someone from something Lilo and Stitch Disney Interactive turns everything Disney produces into a video game as a film. So it couldn't have been otherwise with Lilo and Stitch, an animated film being screened these days in Italian cinemas, which for the occasion has become a game available on the portable console of Mario and Luigi's home. This time in the role of Stitch you will be engaged on the small screen of the Advance to save Lilo from the clutches of an evil alien force.", "date": "2002-07-12", "grade": null}
