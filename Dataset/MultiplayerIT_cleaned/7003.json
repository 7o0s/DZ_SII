This is Invasion, the new Call of Duty: Ghosts DLC, which moves away from any ~serious~ and military setting ambitions to take us to a setting that couldn't be more varied. Even if to refute this incipit we return to Brazil in the classic Favela, a revised and corrected version of the one played in Modern Warfare 2. And then, of course, there is the cooperative experience of Extinction, which takes us directly to the den of aliens. Is it worth spending the usual fifteen euros? For aficionados this is a pointless question to ask, for everyone else it's the usual DLC after DLC refrain. To spend or not to spend, then? Invasion is the new DLC for Call of Duty: Ghosts. Is it worth spending our money to buy it? Pharaoh takes us, as the name implies, to ancient Egypt, for a decidedly large map, perhaps the largest of the lot, ideally divided between the interior and exterior of a ruined temple (tomb?), full of ravines and passages, rather intricate, a sort of bignami of everything that can be found inside an archaeological dig. A definitely fun map full of raised points, open spaces with long firing lines, but also with everything you need to engage in ~close quarter combat~, between blind corners and ruins, especially in the almost labyrinthine internal rooms. Also hit a couple of well-placed bottlenecks, while on an artistic level we must give credit to the developers for the richness of the setting and for the effective light effects that illuminate the indoor parts. Pharaoh is therefore a decidedly apt ~medium~ map, not trivial and just ~complicated~, perfect for all types of players, but ideal for specialists, given that upon completion of the field order it is possible to obtain the ~Blessing of Anubis~ which gives us all the perks available for a given amount of time. It will not be a pyrotechnic gimmick but it certainly works. From ancient Egypt we move to Mexico with Departed, set during the Dias de los Muertos festivities: death, in the form of skeletons everywhere, and seamless kills are therefore the protagonists. Smaller but much more intricate than Pharaoh, Departed is undoubtedly the best map among the unpublished ones, very colorful and full of narrow spaces made especially for ambushes and close-quarters shootings, even if there is obviously no shortage of airy openings. Posters, skeletons and bright colors aside, Departed is really well done, a synthesis of what is the typical level design of Call of Duty, which between defiles, narrow corridors and roofs allow us to put into practice the peculiar gameplay of the saga. As for Pharaoh, here too the style is a winner, the chromatically exuberant party of Los Muertos is rendered in a particularly vivid and effective way, without forgetting that the statue of Death in the middle of the level and the ~pimped~ hearse like a racing car clandestine battles make the battles even more grotesque. And since Infinity Ward doesn't miss anything, what about the invincible gunslinging mariachi that you can turn into after taking home a field order? You become a sort of walking Oracle armed with a double Magnum: unstoppable also given the possibility of transforming a teammate into a second Mariachi. The last unpublished map is Mutiny, the pirate one, consequently there is no lack of everything that is normally associated with corsairs, galleons and so on. The map makes us fight at night, in the moonlight, in a sort of small port, full of houses and huts, many of which it is possible to enter, and on several levels, from where we can control both the external ~periphery~ and the docks real, with the galleon from which it is possible to get on board to have a good view of the port itself. A decidedly intriguing map, medium-sized, intricate and full of numerous possibilities for accessing hot areas, and well divided between the openings of the docks and the winding areas of the port, full of ravines to exploit. Gimmick guessed the field order that allows you to bombard the anchored galleon with another that crosses offshore, in the same way it's nice to wander around with two ectoplasmic bodyguards ready to lend us a hand in the hottest moments. The last map is Favela, ~fan favorites~ since Modern Warfare 2, consequently well known by all fans of the franchise. It worked then and it obviously works today, with its perfect mix of house-to-house combat and open spaces with long firing lines, defilades, covers, and areas made specifically for setting up ambushes, taking advantage above all of the second floors of the houses and the numerous blind corners.On a technical level, the step forward is obviously notable, and we also liked the choices in terms of ~decor~ of the map. Favela will not be new (even if some buildings previously under construction are now finished) but without a doubt it is the best of the lot. Not that the others don't work, but it's the only ~serious~ one in the package, without bizarre gimmicks to enliven point-blank shots and jugular stab wounds. At most here it is possible to call in a flying gunship for air support. The new chapter of Extinction closes the range of contents, the fun cooperative mode that at Infinity Ward has taken the place of Treyarch's Nazi zombies. No haunted towns, cities or ships. We are inside a gigantic cave system that houses alien nests. Everything according to the textbook, even if some areas of low gravity will give us a hand to silence new enemies such as the flying and acid-spitting Gargoyles or the smaller but lethal (and always flying) Bombers. While at the boss level we find the Mammoths, huge, powerful and with different attack patterns, to be hired obviously making the most of teamwork. This new DLC for Call of Duty: Ghosts is undoubtedly successful. Ours is a ~yes~ therefore: the unpublished maps are pleasant, with a good level design and also spot on on an artistic level. Favela is the one we all know (therefore nothing new), but it is the perfect counterpart to the ~funny things~ of the new contents. Awakening is the usual fun and full-bodied cooperative mode, but this time it's certainly not the most successful part of the DLC.", "date": "2014-07-17", "grade": null}
