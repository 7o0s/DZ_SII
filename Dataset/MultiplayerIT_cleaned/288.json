{"name": "XenoSaga Episode III: Also Spracht Zarathustra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xenosaga-episode-iii-also-spracht-zarathustra_a.html", "text": "Also Spracht Zarathustra This third chapter begins about a year after the closing events of Episode II. We had left our protagonists grappling with the disappearance of the Zohar, the monolith with extraordinary powers, captured by the mysterious and gigantic Abel's Ark, while Jr. finally came to terms with his other half, the perfidious Albedo, who in the end had turned out to be well far from the idea of the Kefkian ~bad guy~ that we had during the first two episodes. The past year is recounted in various moments by Shion and associates: our heroine left the company she worked for, Vector Industries, after discovering that she was involved in the incidents relating to the Gnosis and the Zohar. Leaving his beloved KOS-MOS android behind, Shion Uzuki then begins to investigate Vector with members of the espionage group Scientia, in order to discover the truth about the Zohar and the cosmic events that are endangering humanity. Meanwhile, the disturbing Testament, masked figures in the service of the mysterious Wilhelm, are preparing to hit the girl and her fellow adventurers once and for all: the construction of a new battle android, T-elos, and a new mech warfare, Omega Res Novae, are elements that are part of a Mephistophelean plan linked to the fate of the universe. Many questions emerge during the story: who are Testament? What is U-DO really? What does Eternal Return mean and what is the Zarathustra system? The epilogue of Xenosaga answers practically every question left open, every mystery will be solved and every secret revealed: at the base, the fascinating theories of philosophers and mathematicians such as Jung and of course Nietszche, which make the final revelations much more realistic and disturbing. Everything (or almost) fits in the end, and the screenwriter Tetsuya Takahashi mixes philosophy, mathematics, religion and esotericism again in a narrative concentrate of incredible power: an exhaustive internal database that is constantly updated also allows you to keep an eye on the story, the places, the characters and the past and present events, in order not to get lost in the complex plot. It is surprising that the most blasphemous elements of the story (such as the role of Mary Magdalene) are counterbalanced by an incredibly positive, Western and almost Christian morality: in the end, one just needs to have faith, not only in God, but also and above all in himself themselves. Final gameplay As per tradition, Episode III presents the usual imbalance between narration and interactivity, leaning towards the first: at least ten hours of the adventure are made up of non-interactive films through which the story unfolds. However, the RPG playful nature emerges in this epilogue much more than in the two prequels, above all thanks to the greater freedom of exploration and a more refined and complete combat system. Already the cities that can be visited, although few, are enormous and full of details and characters to interact with: a new and ingenious system allows you to read what they have to say simply by approaching them, pressing a key and then it will be possible to deepen the conversation if you want, to get more information or activate sidequests. This mechanism makes exploration more fluid and captivating, eliminating the tedious pressing of the key to talk every time you cross an NPC. The exploration of the environments is intertwined with that of the ~dungeons~ and the locations to be crossed to continue the story by defeating the enemies on duty: the presence of simple puzzles makes them less boring and linear, and the possibility of dodging enemies, visible on the screen , or to attack them from behind or after having hit them with the appropriate traps, is a very welcome element in contrast to the now ancient random encounters. The normal fights have a mechanic that mixes some elements of Episode I and Episode II in a new less original but certainly more intuitive and satisfying battle system: the combo system in which each key was associated with an attack has been replaced by the classic Attack option , accompanied by those that allow you to open the menus relating to the selection of Ether and Tech. Ethers are nothing more than the ~spells~ in the world of Xenosaga, based on nanomachines: each character gets several as they level up and range from the classic elemental attack Ethers to healing ones. The Ether Points needed to launch the Ether are also used to carry out the Techs, or special attacks of a more physical type, often the prerogative of characters more prone to close combat. Another option available in battle concerns the Special Attacks, available in limited numbers per character, upgradeable through repeated use and eextremely harmful: they download the Boost Gauge, a welcome return, and if used as a coup de grace they allow you to get more experience points, money and Skill Points. The Boost Gauge also allows you to anticipate a character's turn, and is also in the possession of enemies: using it wisely is the key to victory in most cases. As the Boost Gauge recalls Episode I, so the Break Gauge recalls Episode II: the abstruse Zone Break system of the prequel, original but complex, has been partially revived with the addition of this numerical value variable from character to character, from enemy to enemy, which decreases for each attack received, until the moment in which, once the available Break Points have been exhausted, the target in question will remain stunned for a few turns, receiving more damage from the attacks. The normal fights have a mechanic that mixes some elements of Episode I and Episode II in a new, less original but certainly more intuitive and satisfying battle system. Final gameplay We have mentioned the Skill Points, relating to the Skill Line system which skilfully mixes that of the two prequels: abandoning the extremely complicated free ~skill-up~ of Episode II, the Skill Line is inspired by the first episode, presenting for each character a skill grid to be learn in sequence, which forks at the beginning allowing you to plan the growth of the character. Thus, a character like Shion can take the path of ~magic~ or ~combat~, purchasing the various skills available with the appropriate points, until he unlocks the exclusive final one of the chosen branch. The easy-to-use Skill Line system allows for enormous variety in character customization, allowing for extremely tactical party and combat management. We have covered the ~normal~ fights, but there is no shortage of those aboard the E.S. The mechs in Xenosaga return to their former glory, even if they cannot be used at will but only in certain areas: the mechanics of their use has remained more or less unchanged, with an amount of energy that is consumed with each attack, allowing you to plan the amount and power of the shots to be made. Each successful attack will also charge the E.S. Vessel of Anima gauge. allowing you to enhance the E.S. for a few turns, increasing its energy and allowing you to launch spectacular Special Attacks. Furthermore, during this enhanced state, the probability of ~Co-op~ and ~Ambush~ attacks increases exponentially, which in essence are nothing more than the combined assaults of the various E.S. Much more intuitive and fun, the new battle system on board the mechs is also extremely fast and visually spectacular. The gameplay overview of Xenosaga Episode III can only end with a nod to the most welcome return, that of money: after its absence in Episode II, it is now possible to buy equipment of various kinds again in shops, to customize the own characters. HaKox! In this Episode III the Monolith team has decided to add a fun optional mini-game called HaKox. The mechanics are clearly reminiscent of Lemmings, with the characters moving alone in extremely complex polygonal environments: the goal is to make them reach a certain goal, moving the platforms at the right time to make them walk or jump towards the finish line. The extremely simple concept is the advantage of a really well made mini-game: dozens of levels of increasing difficulty and complexity become available as you progress in the main adventure, and a special editor allows you to create customized stages to exchange with friends to test reflexes and ingenuity. Like a movie, more than a movie The artistic team in Xenosaga Episode III has taken a step backwards: if in the prequel the realistic visual imprint was decidedly marked, especially in the character design, with the almost total absence of fantastic and unreal elements especially during the special attacks of the various characters, in this epilogue a middle ground has been chosen. The various polygonal models show off realistic proportions far from the cartoon ones that characterized the first episode, while maintaining typically Japanese elements, such as the size of the eyes. At the same time, fantasy graphic details have returned, albeit in a much more sober way: the result is an elegant and not at all exaggerated visual style, which creates a remarkable contrast between the normal and the supernatural that continuously intertwine during the story. The greater graphic detail does not only affect the polygonal models, especially the main characters, but alsoand the settings: some locations are undoubtedly among the most beautiful ever seen on PlayStation 2, full of details and with perfect colors, such as in the case of the Miltia forest, the beach that can be visited at the beginning of the game or one of the last dungeons , in the heart of the planet Michtam. Often the movement of the camera tries to capture the majesty of the environment, following our alter-ego fluidly during exploration. Obviously the characteristic element of Xenosaga Episode III is the impressive quality of the non-interactive cutscenes, undermined only by some sporadic drop in frame in the most agitated situations (space battles are an example, but it's stuff that rivals Star Wars): everything is studied in detail, every shot, every movement of the camera, every shot. Episode III is a Hollywood film, in which three-dimensional models act with such attention to the movements, facial expressions and general detail that it is materially impossible not to be enraptured. The exceptional quality of the dubbing is another trump card, starting with the perfect lip synchronization: the voice actors carry out their work with total passion, interpreting their counterparts with extreme professionalism and skill, making them even more human, it is not difficult to be moved during the most dramatic sequences thanks to the intensity of the acting. The soundtrack deserves a similar speech, probably one of the best ever composed for the videogame market: Yuki Kajiura does not regret the great Yasunori Mitsuda, even if he does not reach his sublime level, composing simply wonderful songs. The main trend is dramatic, melancholic, perfectly suited to the atmosphere of the plot, able to underline the emotionality of the characters in an absolutely perfect way: it is not wrong to say that many cutscenes are particularly successful thanks to the musical accompaniment, which in many cases makes even the most important fights simply epic. The weak link is perhaps the final song, Maybe Tomorrow, textually inferior to the splendid closing songs of the two prequels, but it is simply a drop in the ocean, so much so that the purchase of the official OST is highly recommended. Comment Several years have passed since the first episode of Xenosaga, in the end the prejudice against the ~rib~ of Xenogears has not only proved unfounded, but has even been crushed by the impressive narrative quality of Takahashi's script: it is not wrong to say that Xenosaga a traits surpasses the splendid plot of Xenogears, superbly characterizing the characters and events. At the end of the journey, the regret remains for the gameplay of the two prequels, at times incomplete, perfected only in this third episode, definitely the best of the three in every respect. The new battle system, less original but certainly more intuitive, allows you to enjoy the interactive sequences without making them simple interludes between one cut-scene and another: the latter, on the other hand, are probably the best that the gaming market has shown at the level of narration by images. Xenosaga is a splendid film, characterized by an exceptional plot (unfortunately partially undermined by the budget cut which led to the exclusion of some sequences, such as the battle with Grimoire Verum) which unusually proposes a final moral that is anything but trivial, far from ~lovose bene~ with which the Japanese mega-productions have accustomed us, all devoted to underlining the importance of friendship: an element also addressed in Xenosaga, for heaven's sake, with an eye to the spirit of sacrifice, but this time they are the individual and his relationship with the otherworldly and the future in the center of attention, and who knows maybe something will not be learned at the end of this journey, videogame and spiritual, in a real sea of emotions. Pros Perfected gameplay Indescribably gorgeous storyline Long-lived and varied Superb soundtrack Cons Some frame drops Some fights are too long Here and there you feel the budget cut Erm, the saga ends, shall we say? It would be obvious to start this review with a trivial ~It all began in 1997 when Xenogears for PSOne was released~ especially now that the trilogy ended with a bang on PlayStation 2. Xenogears, the Squaresoft masterpiece that captivated tens of thousands of gamers almost ten years ago , is now part of the past: the Monolith team, now at Namco, has taken up the legacy of that exceptional RPG and the challenge of proposing a new saga inspired by it. A challenge won in part, probably due to the mixed feelings aroused in the public with products from which", "date": "2006-11-09", "grade": null}
