{"name": "Double Dragon Neon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/109404-double-dragon-neon-i-due-delloperazione-drago.html", "text": "The beautiful Marian has been kidnapped again by an attacker and the brothers Billy and Jimmy will have to do everything to save her. This time, however, they will face a formidable opponent, different from those they are used to. No street thugs, here we go to the next level with a bestiary composed of androids, warriors armed with jetpacks, huge mechanical bosses and finally an invincible samurai-skeleton, who is responsible for everything. The developers of WayForward Technologies, specialized in the creation of 2D action beat'em-ups, offer us their best production in this case, revisiting the classic from Technos Japan through an operation designed to enhance its contents. So let's see the various ~modernized~ characters compared to their original design, both the ~good guys~ and the ~bad guys~, and a campaign that unfolds through ten levels in which literally everything happens... but we don't want to anticipate too many things. The splendid soundtrack of Double Dragon, signed by Kazunaka Yamane, has been rearranged for the occasion and enriched with a series of new songs that bring to mind the atmosphere and musicality of the late 80s. The new enhancement system for Billy and Jimmy was built around the music, and along the way they can collect some audio cassettes that allow them to unlock and enhance a range of ~passive~ abilities and special attacks. The former consist of a boost to the character's characteristics, the ability to recover vital energy with each hit scored or different ~balances~ that favor the execution of the special attack rather than the combos. As far as the special attacks are concerned, they range from the classic whirlpool flying kick to the powerful ~Dragon strike~, capable of throwing any opponent from a distance, from the fireball to a real ~smart bomb~ which sees a huge fire dragon appear on the screen and damage all enemies present. There are many possibilities in this sense, but the developers didn't want to make life easy for us, limiting the presence of shops (to enhance the ~spells~ by spending the money collected) and of the ~carpenter~ (to increase the effectiveness of each single special ability) to three or four stages that we will inevitably find ourselves having to replay. Hokuto's slow punch If you are nostalgic for scrolling fighting games, you will know that Double Dragon was the true progenitor of the genre after the experiment made with Renegade, technically much simpler and less multifaceted. After Technos Japan it was Capcom who took the tradition of progressive beat'em-ups with Final Fight, introducing a decidedly different style as regards the execution of the very rapid blows and holds. The impact with Double Dragon Neon is therefore a bit traumatic, which sacrifices the speed of the maneuvers in favor of the fluidity of the animations, presenting us with a combat system strongly based on the evasive maneuver (executable by pressing the L2 backbone), which is activated at the right moment it allows us to obtain a performance boost and, therefore, to counterattack even more effectively. The game starts with only the normal difficulty level (the other two are unlocked by completing it), but already in this way the degree of challenge proves to be quite high and game over will not be a rare event, on the contrary. In the arcade, this problem could be solved by inserting another token and continuing the game, and the same approach has unfortunately been adopted by a whole series of arcade conversions, literally killing their longevity. In this specific case, the guys from WayForward Technologies have seen fit to make the infinite ~continue~ available, but to force us in this situation to start the level over again. The end result is therefore a rather demanding story mode, at times invariably frustrating, with the complicated management of special moves to make life difficult and opponents who do not go down with the first punch, but who indeed require a substantial sequence of moves before passing to a better life. Speaking of moves, the repertoire at our disposal is unfortunately not very rich, especially in terms of combos: two punches and a kick represent the standard for stunning an enemy, after which you can hit him with a further punch/kick or grab him (Circle button) and throw it at his companions; or again, in the presence of two dazed opponents, make them crash into each other. In short, we would have expected a few more blows (the nudge is missing!!! No, I mean, the nudge!!!), especially those capable of quickly knocking out an enemy to be able to concentrate on the others (the nudge, preciselyor). Playstation 3 trophies Double Dragon Neon allows you to unlock thirteen Trophies linked to traditional dynamics, which involve experimenting with every move, weapon and level in the game. A Trophy is therefore obtained if you use all the weapons at least once, make the first ~mixtape~ for special skills, perform fifty dodges at the limit or complete a stage without suffering any damage. Monstrous monsters and robobots Although the repertoire available to Billy and Jimmy is not very vast, the same cannot be said of the bad guys we will face during the internships. In many cases these are reinterpretations of the thugs present in the original Double Dragon, including the thugs capable of grabbing and throwing us as if we were a bag of chips, but there are also new entries, which, as mentioned, reflect the sci-fi interpretation that we wanted to give to this remake. The scenarios boast a fluctuating quality, sometimes offering some nice variations on the theme (see the ~shadow~ sections) and in some cases attempting to go beyond their original role, i.e. that of serving as a simple background to the fistfights between the Lee brothers and the their opponents, introducing chasms, traps and objects that we can smash to get money or bonuses. The design of some bosses isn't splendid (see the helicopter or the ~war machine~), but even in this case there are really absurd ideas, such as the large carnivorous plant which on one side hides a shark head (which throws eyed missiles, huh) and on the other that of a tyrannosaurus. Their attack patterns are varied enough to be a good challenge, and they absolutely must be memorized in order to defeat them. We liked the style of the graphics, but it is clear that this is a subjective matter. Instead, what appears objective is the mediocrity of the animations, which, however fluid, give the characters decidedly woody and implausible movements. Finally, a few words about the music: really beautiful, engaging and even fun (see the excerpt from the end credits).", "date": "2012-10-10", "grade": "7.0"}
