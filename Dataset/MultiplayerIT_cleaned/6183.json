Ok, some would have liked the Champions League final to have gone like this but, unfortunately, the reality is quite another matter. However, the Russian guys from Herocraft (already known for Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf and Majesty: The Fantasy Kindom Sim), have made with their FootLoL: Crazy Football! a very fun type of game in which you can literally put your hands on the field during a football match: you don't control the players but you can 'intervene' by inserting malus through disturbing elements or bonuses to protect yourself from the opponent's disturbance . Already present with some success for PC, FootLoL: Crazy Football! it's also available on iOS and Android devices, both tablets and smartphones, with a version identical to the original and a touch screen interface that seems almost born for this game and which, in our opinion, is even preferable to the mouse. There are 60 levels to tackle, divided into four planets (you got it right, planets!) - Earth, Moon, Mars and Saturn - and it's not always necessary to achieve victory to move on to the next encounter but just fulfill the objective of round, be it a draw or an accurate score. Getting the classic three stars of the maximum score represents the most difficult challenge and depends on the difference goals with which you will win the match or the time it takes to finish the level. But let's find out in detail the arsenal at our disposal. With FootLOL: Crazy Football! football has never been this fun Brothers of Italy It is known that, when the national team is involved in football, even those who didn't understand anything about football until the day before yesterday suddenly become an ultra of the south curve of the current stadium and, coincidentally, in FootLoL: Crazy Football! you can only choose between national teams while, as you progress in the game, you can unlock absurd ones such as ~Fashion~ or ~Greenpeace~, each with its own shirt and flag colors. The modes available are the Championship, Quick match and Multiplayer but to have access to the last two you need to advance in the game, as they are not available immediately. We now come to the highlight of FootLoL: Crazy Football!, or the twenty-four special abilities to be obtained automatically as the game progresses. Any examples? You can use mines to place under the players so they don't reach the ball, field one or more crazed cows that overwhelm anything they encounter, open portals to teleport everything that passes through them and even summon alien flying saucers to remove anyone who passes through their tractor beams from the field. Not all skills can be equipped in a single game, in fact, it is necessary to select them each time from a small briefing screen by placing them in the few slots that are available at the beginning; later, given that virtual money is earned at the end of each game, it is possible to purchase additional slots and skill points to use more skills at the same time and for a greater number of times. With the same money, other parameters such as the speed of your team or the shooting accuracy of the players can also be modified. Hats, wigs, lunar soccer fields The caricatured graphic style of the players is perfect for the crazy and goliardic atmosphere in which you are immersed in all the matches; even the soccer fields are rendered very well and will elicit more than a smile from you when, for example, you will see the players wearing a space suit and trying to score a goal with the Earth or Saturn in the background (by selecting Saturn, in fact, we will have the playgrounds aboard a base orbiting the ringed gas giant). The music does not make you cry out for a miracle but they do their job worthily in the intervals of the games, however, the sound effects are really hilarious having to do with crazy cows, meteor explosions, rocket launchers and so on. If in single player the challenge is competitive only by aiming for the three stars of each level (otherwise it is not that difficult to complete all sixty of them), it is in the multiplayer mode that the game gets really tough: in fact, each skill has its own 'counter' and, while that's almost never a problem against the AI, it becomes a nightmare against another live player. From the main menu you can access the community portal and share your games or vote for those of theplayers who entered them. To conclude, it should be noted that playing on the iPad is much simpler than on the iPhone: in fact, on the smartphone it can happen quite frequently that bonuses are erroneously given to the opposing team, especially in the most confusing actions, which rarely happens on the tablet, where the physical space for the fingers is much greater.", "date": "2015-07-21", "grade": "8.0"}
