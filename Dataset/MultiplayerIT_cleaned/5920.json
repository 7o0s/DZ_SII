We have already experienced his suffering, which title after title has become more exhibited than visceral, dispersed as it is in the sea of other ideas added with re-editions and expansions. In this sense Afterbirth (here the review), the first expansion of Rebirth, itself a revised and corrected version of The Binding of Isaac added to the DLC The Wrath of the Lamb, offers little to talk about and could end with the list of new contents that the installation adds to the already rich offer of the basic package. Edumnd McMillen and Nicalis have capitalized on the success of the game, churning out a kind of Christmas basket full of goodies. Isaac is no longer Isaac, but Isaac's franchise, or at least its story has become just a satellite of a larger expanded universe following feedback from fans, waiting for McMillen to finally release the kitten game shown eons ago and vanished into thin air (he will have put them in some box and won't be able to decide if they are still alive or dead). The independent has understood the market, has become a publisher and has added a hundred hours of gameplay to the pile, a new mode based on the achievement of objectives, the classic daily challenge with online rankings, new challenges, new rooms, new objects ( for a total of five hundred), secrets galore venghino siori, venghino. In an ideal world, the expansions would all be like this: that is, they would transform the base game without changing it much in the cornerstones of its gameplay. In short, we are faced with the classic enrichment of a work that was in any case already complete on its own. In fact, from a mechanical point of view, Afterbirth modifies Rebirth very little, despite the effort made. Buttons, restrictions and other atrocities Two of the novelties of Afterbirth that stand out the most when thinking about the base title are some new features of the maps. The first is the buttons: in some rooms there are now no more enemies (or just enemies), but small puzzles to solve. Nothing complicated, since you just need to press large buttons positioned on the floor to remove spikes or simply to open doors. The difficulty lies in reaching them, since at best they are surrounded by traps. The second novelty in the geography of the levels, much more relevant than the big buttons, concerns the shape of some rooms. The first The Binding of Isaac featured environments of a fixed size that filled a single game screen. With Rebirth, larger rooms were added, which could be rectangular (two rooms side by side) or square (four rooms side by side). Afterbirth still works on this aspect by offering ~L~ shaped rooms and narrow rooms, i.e. in which one of the two sides is smaller than the standard ones. Each of these new types is used to offer different challenges, without prejudice to the procedural generation of levels. For example, narrow rooms are often associated with chases with regenerating enemies, while the others with wider-ranging clashes, perhaps with some bosses degraded to common enemies in the advanced levels. Nothing revolutionary, but variety never hurts. Now the circular rooms are missing and we are on horseback. However, it is fair to report that even the normal rooms have had a good refresh and are now many more, to the point that it has become really difficult to find two alike. The developers speak of more than a thousand completely new ones. We don't know if the numbers are actually these (counting them is impossible), but it is certain that they are very many. The Binding of Isaac is back with Afterbirth, the first expansion for Rebirth... and we loved it! Excrementitious size From a technical and stylistic point of view, Afterbirth changes little from what was seen in Rebirth. We are faced with the usual river of excrement, blood and bowels, mitigated by habit in the impact, despite being enriched with new enemies and settings. The new enemies in particular are really many, but they deserve a note, because for the most part they are variations of others already seen. The same goes for the new bosses, well done but not impressive, especially in the attack patterns which, except in some cases, become immediately predictable. Of course, it must be said that it was difficult to go too far beyond what had been seen in the previous episodes, overflowing with visual and gameplay inventions. Furthermore, it was obvious that focusing on quantity would sooner or later produce a certain standardization, a natural and inevitable evolution brought about by serialization. So the new cyclops or the new variants of the evergreen Monstro are welcome, if they are in any case heralds of an overall enrichment of the whole cast. Speaking of settings, there are new onesve like the flooded dungeon or the burning cellar, but apart from the aforementioned greater variety, they bring very little in terms of gameplay. The soundtrack deserves a separate mention, completely revised in the accompanying tracks, similar but much more rocking than those heard in Rebirth. Some are also nice to listen to outside the game.", "date": "2015-11-03", "grade": "8.2"}
