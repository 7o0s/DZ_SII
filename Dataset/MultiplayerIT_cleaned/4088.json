It can be talked about, it must be talked about, but always with respect. Above all, respect for the courage on the part of Larian Studios to carry on a genre that has now apparently been forgotten - apparently, because then when any Divinity is released there is a race on Steam to pre-order. Respect for the management of the evolution of the title itself: for almost a whole year, the small Belgian team sifted through the online discussions of its players, asked for feedback, listened carefully, and finally intervened on individual aspects of the game to improve it, Still. Divinity Original Sin 2 already amazed us about a year ago, when we gave it a resounding 9.4, so much so that they must have heard it in Belgium too. Now, at the end of a hot August, we're off again for an adventure in a boundless world, but where's the real news? It is in being able to do it comfortably seated on the console, PlayStation 4 pad in hand, without compromising the fun. Return to Rivellon: the story of Divinity Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition At the time Divinity Original Sin 2, we told you, thrilled us. Before even wanting to review its mechanics, to see how they have been adapted to the current generation consoles, Playstation 4 and Xbox One, it surprised us with its plot. If you love Dungeons & Dragons-like RPGs, or fantasy RPGs in general, Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of those titles that will steal your social life for quite a while - at least a full month, with over 100 hours of gameplay proposals, not to mention the high replayability of the entire adventure. The narrative begins 300 years after the conclusion of the events narrated in the first chapter of the series: we are still in Rivellon, and the Source, the forbidden magical power, is forbidden and feared by most of the population. In itself it is not forbidden magic, but the gift of the gods of Rivellon to Lucian, the protector of the world from the dangers of the Void and from the realm of the God King. When Lucian dies, shortly before the beginning of the events of Divinity, the Void splits and his creatures break out invading Rivellon. Guess who will be the next owner of the Source so special that he can become the new Lucian-style god and save the whole world once again? Exactly, just our protagonist. Protagonist that before anything else will have to be duly created from scratch through a very rich editor, and when we define it in this way we don't say it so much to say: the first two hours of the game can very well be spent grappling with the editor, especially if you have the goal of dissecting all its offerings. First of all, you can create your own character from scratch by choosing from five different races - Elves, Dwarves, Lizards, Humans and Undead - each customizable in physical appearance, personality traits, main and secondary skills, talents and so on. he has more than that; after all, Divinity is hardcore RPG at its finest. If creating from scratch scares you and you prefer to enjoy the story, you can also choose one of the protagonists prepared by the developers, whose original story you can also listen to. It was impossible for us to reject the undead awakened in a time where his civilization has completely disappeared, and everyone fears or hates his physical appearance. Among other things, the acting in English and the charisma of the characters always remain at excellent levels, a real pity that the title has not been dubbed or at least subtitled in Italian, even if we understand that the cost of the operation would have been particularly significant. RPG with infinite possibilities The depth of the Divinity Original Sin 2 editor is total, sometimes almost dispersive, and has already made the happiness of all lovers of isometric hardcore RPGs on PC. But don't think that continuing the adventure this is the only well-finished aspect of the production: Divinity is a series where the attention to detail can be found in every dungeon, in every line of dialogue, in every accent of the dubbing. You have its flaws, but never as in this case do they become absolutely marginal compared to the work as a whole, and moreover if it had been otherwise, it would not have won countless prizes and awards, nor would it have managed (an isometric RPG!) to arrive with dignity even on consoles, where the audience is very different. And Larian Studios probably thought of the world of console gaming when it decided to review the difficulty levels and add new ones.When starting a new game you can choose between Explorer Mode, Classic Mode, Tactician Mode and Story Mode. The first three were already present on PC, and represent the easy, medium and expert levels respectively, albeit with the necessary rebalancing of the last few months. The Story Mode is instead new, and is designed for those who want to sit on the sofa and enjoy a fantasy world from start to finish without getting stuck somewhere due to the impossibility of solving a puzzle, or fighting a large group of enemies with a party that has not previously been properly developed. It is not the only novelty already highlighted by the Divinity Original Sin 2 console menu: playing among the options on the home screen, it is possible to identify the appropriate section dedicated to 4K and HDR adjustment, to fully enjoy the wonderful fantasy world of the title on the own TV. Wonderful, of course, yet still not up to the graphic detail achieved on PC, and this is an obvious consideration; it is less obvious instead to underline that here Larian Studios could have worked a little harder. Not that Divinity is bad to see on TV, mind you, but above all on PlayStation 4 Pro it is impossible that one could not have done slightly better on a technical level, even in the face of excellent general fluidity and minimal loading. They are trifles, it must be said, but when you have almost perfection in front of you, only the trifles remain to be pointed out. Playstation 4 trophies Divinity Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition represents a real challenge for Trophy Hunters. He has his beautiful Platinum Trophy, but taking it home will be anything but a simple undertaking, and above all it will require a very high amount of hours. We're talking about a title that in itself offers a main adventure of about 100 hours of play, and which has a higher difficulty level than other contemporary productions. With all this in mind, some trophies require you to complete the game on all present difficulties, including the highest ones; moreover, it will be necessary to complete precise secondary side quests, and many times perform unrepeatable actions in the game world. Never as in this case a good guide and a lot of patience are the fundamental ingredients, if you aspire to unlock all the Trophies. The console edition The use of Divinity Original Sin 2 on consoles is less intuitive than the PC one, but the porting has not weakened the solidity of the title: a few minutes of play are enough to get used to the commands (the completely revised tutorials also help in this) and everything becomes clear . The management of the party, the fights and the entire inventory via gamepad has been studied in what seemed to us the best possible way: almost all menus can be called up quickly on the screen with the combination of R2-L2 and the pad, and enjoyed quickly without too abstruse paths. The turn-based fights that distinguish the series are also immediate: the difficulty is certainly not that of memorizing the attack, defense and management keys of one's turn, but rather the profound offer of game actions between spells, physical offensives, tools, weaknesses , resistant and influences of the surrounding environment. On consoles, the title was also designed to offer a local (and online) multiplayer experience as immediate as possible: just grab a second controller and anyone can join the game in progress via split screen, but without sharing the progress of the narrative. A way to play together, but each in their own world, perhaps not to compromise the experience of those who carry on their fantasy adventure in the world of Rivellon with the slightest mistake. If, on the other hand, you prefer to participate online in the same game, you can decide to host your world or join that of other strangers on the net: we haven't been able to try the feature yet due to a lack of participants, but we have no doubts that it works effectively as it already did on pc. Finally, Divinity Original Sin 2 also brings a completely renewed Arena mode to the console and the possibility of challenging a friend in turn-based combat using a single pad, which passes from hand to hand by exchanging controllers (Hot Seat mode). In the Arena mode there are single-player or multiplayer challenges with 16 characters, including some unpublished ones such as Malady, Zandalor and Radeka, needless to say with exclusive skills and abilities. Game modes range from classic Deathmatch in which participants are pushed against each other until there is only one left, up to Kill the King, in which the team must protect a specific player; everything is complicated by the presenceMutators that modify parameters during battles or temporarily grant specific abilities.", "date": "2018-08-29", "grade": "9.4"}
