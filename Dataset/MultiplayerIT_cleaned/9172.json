One really has to wonder why the gaming world has neglected Lucha Libre for so long, given the undeniable allure that permeates it. That is, apart from the famous Rey Mysterio, a few wrestlers included in the fighting game roster with a completely different shot and few other digressions, very little is known in these parts of this sporting discipline that seems to mix the charm of Mexican mystical traditions with popular shows from a festive country. Or at least this is the vision that one can have without knowing the subject deeply, but it is still a vision full of charm. It is a subject that would seem to lend itself well to alternative interpretations of wrestling, perhaps fictionalized, humorous, undoubtedly colorful and bloody, just like the discipline in question, also mindful of the experience of the great Jack Black by Nacho Libre. So a game that chooses such a subject naturally attracts attention, above all because it draws precisely that atmosphere that most intrigues Lucha Libre, or rather the Mexican substratum pushed here to extreme parody, among extravagant masks, caricatured wrestlers, chickens and zany humor. Also for this reason, Lucha Fury is not a game that goes unnoticed, despite the production of modest dimensions and its honest release on Live Arcade without the accompanying hype hype. The other reason of interest is the genre to which the game belongs, that beat'em up which after the glorious years of the arcades and then of the 16-bit consoles has practically become extinct, bringing with it questions about the apparently impossible coexistence of genre with 3D graphics or, more likely, with a market that has become so refined and complicated in the space of twenty years. Unfortunately, this is not the standard bearer of the next generation scrolling beat 'em up. It's not so much the simplicity of the game or the modesty of the production - on the other hand the genre really seems to be able to be reborn within the digital delivery panorama, as Castle Crashers, Scott Pilgrim and several other titles demonstrate - but rather the obvious gaps in terms of gameplay that make this Punchers Impact product a rather unsuccessful experiment. Energy drinks and plucked chickens The plot is based on a crazy story of missing drinks and international conspiracies, but it's simply a pretext to try to make sense of the protagonists' long hikes through the various streets that make up the game levels, with a rightly humorous cut. In fact, it's about beating everything that comes along the way, just like in the old tradition of Final Fight or Double Dragon. The problem is that, despite the sincere wonder that the lush scenarios and cel-shaded characters initially arouse, the flaws all reside in the game's very mechanics. There are obvious ~woodiness~ problems in the controls, which in a game based on the speed of execution of the attacks become fatal on several occasions, combined with a certain slowness in the movements of the protagonists. The absence of defensive maneuvers such as parries or dodges flattens the entire combat system in getting the right moment to trigger the combo and above all finding the perfect alignment to hit the enemy, which is not always easy given the need to be perfectly positioned in contact with the opponents for the blow to be successful, obviously under penalty of having to suffer the punctual counterattack helpless. Then there is a strange insistence on shaking the analog stick throughout the game, given that several situations require this rather annoying practice because it basically requires changing the grip on the controller and makes the protagonist further exposed to attacks, in some cases triggering a really destructive vicious circle. Even the enemies are not very convincing, which in most cases do not require particular differentiated attack strategies and in this way do not contribute to varying the game mechanics, or in some cases they force patterns so difficult as to be frustrating. Xbox 360 goals Lucha Fury contains the classic 12 unlockable achievements for the usual total of 200 points, like all Live Arcades. Several of these achievements are achieved simply by progressing through the game and completing it, while others require particular dedication in certain performances. If the gameplay manages to get you, there shouldn't be any particular problems in the complete collection. Mucha lucha There is a certain sense of progression to the game, beyond the sequence of levels completed, given by the conquestof new moves and combos to assign to the fighters. These are pre-set additions that allow you to achieve a considerable variety of attacks, although the player is not left much freedom on customizing the chosen protagonist (no in-game ~shop~ where you can spend the points earned, in short). Another problem, the relative uselessness of the more complex moves, given that the structure tends to reward more the use of fast and immediate moves such as the basic ones, which further flattens the gameplay on the tracks of the pure and simple button masher. In the midst of many problems, however, there are positive sides in Lucha Fury: the possibility of playing the game in cooperative multiplayer obviously increases the fun exponentially, although here too there is the enormous lack of online multiplayer to be noted, as well as not one cannot fail to mention the beautiful graphic sector that characterizes the entire production, from the artwork to the in-game graphics passing through the interlude scenes. The one done in this sense by Punchers Impact is really an excellent job, able not only to make the game pleasant to the eye, but also to characterize it in a charismatic way thanks to an excellent interpretation of the classic Mexican iconography, filtered through a comic book optics. The cel-shading adopted to represent the game is really well made and is organically associated with the particular style adopted by the graphics for the artwork and for the creation of the four main characters. The sound accompaniment is less accurate, proposing the appropriate Mexican-style tunes that are interesting to listen to at first but soon tiring due to a rather pronounced repetitiveness.", "date": "2011-07-15", "grade": "4.0"}
