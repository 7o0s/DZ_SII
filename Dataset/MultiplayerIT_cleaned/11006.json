{"name": "Bikini Pool Battle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bikini-pool-battle.html", "text": "In the last period, the huge houses of American VIPs have been filmed on TV in a situation that is anything but festive, that is while they were burning in the flames that are taking away half of California. In any case, it is safe to assume that under normal conditions these luxury villas are the ideal setting for parties and parties in the sun, in this case in the pool, with a bunch of girls in costumes who want to do nothing but have fun at the expense of the rich man on duty. For the creation of Bikini Pool Battle, the Twistbox Games developers wanted to recreate that atmosphere made of bright colors, inflatable mattresses and silicone prostheses put on display, packaging everything according to the rules of the classic naval battle. A successful experiment? As mentioned at the beginning, our goal in Bikini Pool Battle is twofold: on the one hand we have to organize a rocking pool party, on the other we have to get people (pretty girls, in particular) to boycott the neighbor's similar party . The map of the neighborhood shows us our house and around it six large villas, each belonging to a famous character from the show and each with an increasingly larger swimming pool. In the first phase of the game, we will have a view of our pool and we will have to place a certain number of mattresses of different sizes in the water, after which we will be able to start the launch of objects: not being able to fire torpedoes like in real naval battle, we will have to be satisfied with throw objects of various kinds at the guests of the rival party. The goal is to center the mattresses that are in the pool, as if they were ships, and sink them in the same way. The degree of difficulty rises as the stages are passed, precisely because we will find ourselves facing VIPs with ever larger swimming pools, on which it becomes difficult to score hits. You take turns, launch after launch, until you hit a mat: at which point you can continue to throw objects until you hit the target. Every time you sink a mattress, the girl who was occupying it will show herself in all her glory, offering to come over to our side. At the end of the game, we will be able to see all the ~liberated~ girls again in the appropriate gallery, while we will also be able to try our hand at single games, replaying the already completed stages. A product like Bikini Pool Battle leverages the undoubted fascination of girls in bikinis, a bit like any strip poker game. The problem, however, is that we are not dealing with beautiful designs, indeed the style used leaves something to be desired. To this we must add a really mediocre graphics as regards the actual game, with a use of colors reminiscent of 8-bit systems, the palette is so poor. The characters who are near the pool are always the same, the animations are reduced to a minimum and the scenarios are all practically identical. In short, from a technical point of view, an exceptional job has not been done, far from it. Even the control system, in its disarming simplicity (d-pad to move the indicator on the screen, key 5 to ~shoot~), manages to disappoint due to a relatively slow response to inputs, making moving the ~crosshair~ cumbersome ~. PRO Very simple and immediate AGAINST Unwatchable graphics Very limited gameplay The drawing style leaves something to be desired", "date": "2008-11-28", "grade": "S.V."}
