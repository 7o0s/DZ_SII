{"name": "Pokmon Box Rubino e Zaffiro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-box-rubino-e-zaffiro.html", "text": "Serial or parallel? One of the strangest features of the current generation of Nintendo consoles is the famous connectivity between the GameCube flagship and the little brother Game Boy Advance; strange certainly not for the concept that underlies it or for the realization of this concept, but rather because Nintendo itself did not seem to have very clear ideas about its actual potential. While the marketing & propaganda departments trumpeted it almost as an epochal turning point, neither Nintendo nor third parties (Sega, Ubisoft and EA to name just three examples) managed to go beyond nice and fun little extras, to culminate with the medium failure of Squaresoft and its Crystal Chronicles; then when the PR charge has calmed down a bit, Pac Man Vs. and above all Four Swords jump out of the hat. And if you please... Japanese boxes Adventure Mode is certainly not the substance of Pokmon Box: every time in the RPG you find yourself saving in a Pokmon Center, you can then connect the two consoles and access the actual Pokmon Box mode, where the nice Colette will welcome you illustrating you briefly the options available to you. Basically two, Box Management and Exhibition. Let's go in order: all Pokmon trainers know that, despite being closed in small Pokballs, it is impossible to bring along all the monsters captured during one's wanderings; each Pokmon Center therefore provides practical virtual boxes where to ~park~ the excess creatures. In Ruby/Sapphire there are 14, each capable of hosting 30 Pokmon for a total of 420 in addition to the 6 to bring to the team: Pokmon Box offers the player as many as 25 new boxes, double the capacity for the beauty of 1500 Pokmon that can be hosted on a memory card (Pokmon Box takes 59 blocks of memory, fortunately an MC 59 is already inside the box). These are figures that not even the universal Pokmon champion will ever reach, but it is by no means certain that there is only one collection to manage at home... Japanese boxes The boxes are completely customizable, and by selecting any Pokmon among those present you will have access to all its characteristics, from the current level to the moves, from skills to virtues and so on; there is nothing, however, that cannot already be analyzed in the actual game, so you will hardly access Pokmon Box to analyze the statistics of your champions if not to enjoy them in always two-dimensional but high resolution graphics. The List Mode turns out to be much more delicious, accessible only from the boxes, in which your Pokmon will be shown in a practical and comfortable list to be managed according to the most various parameters, from the name to the level, from the moves to the abilities, from the virtues even to the friendship of the creature towards you; very practical then in the larger collections it is possible to search for a specific Pokmon based on the parameters above, as well as to mark a particularly important one with a symbol - but there are only 4 symbols available - to then find it again in no time say. Japanese boxes Transferring the Pokmon from the Ruby and Sapphire boxes to those on the memory card also allows you to use them in Exhibition Mode: several stages are at your disposal, completely customizable in size, shape, textures, backgrounds, supports for the images of the your Pokmon and even in the music, all very beautiful as per the tradition of the series. Once you have created a stage and arranged the Pokmon, you will be able to admire your collection in the splendor of three-dimensional graphics. Splendor so to speak, because the textures leave something to be desired as does the almost total absence of light and shadow effects; then the supports are three-dimensional, but the figures of the Pokmon they carry are the same two-dimensional as Ruby and Sapphire, and zooming in, you notice the classic, ugly ~pixellation~. It is true that it is not a game, but, even more so, we have seen the GameCube manage much more than the few polygons necessary to display a stage and some support; to be honest, when one's collection begins to prefigure a real army of combat monsters, the effect of seeing them all together well arranged is certainly remarkable. Finally, remember to transfer your Pokmon back from the memory card boxes to the GBA cartridge boxes after having set up a stage: the stage will remain intact, but if you don't do it, you will not have your Pokmon available in the RPG and you will have to access Pokmon Box again . Very last thing to report: the first time you use Pokmon Box, a Mi Egg will be transferred to your Ruby and/or Sapphire cartridgesterious... Comment And that's it. To judge as a game something that is not a game at all would not be fair, and in fact we will not assign any votes to Pokmon Box. As a utility, from the summary but exhaustive description you have just read, you can realize for yourself how much PB is a nice complement to your coaching activity and an amusing incentive for the collector in you, but the ~fundamental~ attribute does not it doesn't even remotely suit him. Furthermore, the presence of some drawbacks which could have easily been remedied is noted, making use not completely immediate and pleasant, a terrible defect for a utility; it is no coincidence that Nintendo has decided to make Pokmon Box available only for the purchase of the GameCube + Pokmon Colosseum bundle and in the Stars Catalog on the official website: in the bundle it makes sense, with the stars you could bring home much more interesting things... Connect them all Pokmon Box Ruby and Sapphire, with us in mid-2004 but already an old acquaintance in Japan, unfortunately belongs to the first era of connectivity, when you wanted to push it without adequate playful support, and to tell the truth of this first era it totally represents its spirit : Pokmon Box isn't even a game, it's simply a utility that has the main purpose of interfacing with a GBA and a copy of Pokmon Ruby or Sapphire, extracting the breeding of Pocket Monsters that the player has managed to set up and transferring it to an entire GameCube memory card, to finally give the coaches the possibility of carrying out a fairly high number of actions, which we will examine in detail together with the practical functioning of the program. First of all, we point out the presence of two distinct modes, the actual Box and the Adventure Mode; the latter allows you to face your Pokmon Ruby and / or Sapphire on the TV, as if you were using a Game Boy Player. However, given the different technical nature, there are, there are two differences and they both favor the Game Boy Player experience: first of all, although it must necessarily remain connected to the Cubetto, it is not possible to use the GBA as a pad, and much more annoying is the fact of necessarily having to turn on the laptop with each save, with consequent dilation of times. Unless you keep the GBA on all the time, but then why not play directly on it? Annoyances and nothing more, it's true, but between the two ways that Nintendo makes available to us to play Pokmon GBA big, the GBP remains clearly preferable.", "date": "2004-06-23", "grade": null}
