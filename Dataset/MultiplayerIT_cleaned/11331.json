{"name": "Actionloop Twist - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/actionloop-twist-recensione.html", "text": "There is evidently in the human psyche a tension towards order and cleanliness, which drives us to associate and keep the visual field clean from discordant elements. This, at least as far as puzzle games are concerned. ActionLoop Twist is based on a well-tested concept, and probably associated with some primordial chord of human instinct, if it proves to be so suited to the taste of gamers that it resists over the years, proposing itself in different forms in appearance, but basically always the same. As in Puzzle Bobble or Puyo Puyo (but the root of ~union=disappeared~ is as old as Tetris), it is a question of associating elements (spheres, in this case) of the same color so as to make them disappear from the screen, before they occlude screen space completely. In particular, the structure follows the Nintendo DS edition of the game of the same name, and is basically the same as another title that has long been present on Xbox Live Arcade: Zuma. We find ourselves with our Mii aboard a sort of rotating sphere-shooting cannon, in the center of a spiral path on which colored figures (spheres or gems, depending on the modality) continuously flow, and the aim is not to get the first of the chain at the end of the prepared path, eliminating all the colored elements. To achieve the goal, we can shoot at the chain of spheres of various colors, following the principle whereby placing three or more elements of the same color side by side, they disappear from the screen, with an obvious collection of points as a result. Being the objects endowed with a magnetic attraction towards each other, the voids that are created in the chain are immediately filled by re-compacting the spheres and triggering, when possible, various chain reactions, in case new ones are created. tiling of spheres of the same color. In this way it is possible to chain a series of side-by-side and consequent disappearances as real combos. This is the general structure, onto which some variations depending on the chosen game modes are grafted. Twists and balls Control is entrusted entirely to the Wii Remote: pointing it towards the TV, we will have to rotate it on the longitudinal axis, effectively twisting the wrist left and right. The response to the commands is fast and responsive, but in fact, it remains a less precise and relaxing type of control than an analog stick, and there are not even selectable alternatives. In the most complex situations, it is not easy to make the precise throws that would be needed, also considering the greater complexity inserted in this game compared to Zuma. Now it is in fact also possible to perform a sort of ~lob~ by pressing the A key and thus projecting the spheres even beyond the first row of balls. The game modes are different: ~training~ (in which we limit ourselves to collecting points, calmly), ~marathon~ (in which we continue from level to level up to the hundredth, in a single game to the bitter end with progressive difficulty), ~missions~ (where we find ourselves having to gradually meet different requirements, which change at each level) and some multiplayer modes (up to 4 players on the same console). However, the possibility of playing online and comparing scores via Wi-Fi Connection is missing. Graphically, ActionLoop Twist does its duty with minimal effort, without being required to do more. It must be said, however, that the flatness in the general appearance is evident and excessive, even comparing it with Zuma, which at least, compared to this Mitchell product, can boast a particular characterization. The musical accompaniment is instead well implemented and manages not to be monotonous. Comment ActionLoop Twist reworks and embellishes an already well-established structure, which has proven to be successful. In fact, it's fun right out of the box, and the good amount of modes makes it just the right amount of variety. The problem is that it has frankly incomprehensible shortcomings, and the feeling is that with a little more effort, it could have been a truly unmissable game. At best, one can overlook the lack of originality and care of the graphics sector, and one can also overlook the fact that the long-term inconvenience of the commands could be solved by the simple option for using a traditional controller. But the lack of the online component is felt: a game like this absorbs lifeblood from direct competition, and the introduction of a remote multiplayer game mode would have exponentially increased its value. At least the presence of online rankings (which is so beneficial to Star Soldier R, to stay in the environment) should be a standard, for these digital delivery puzzles, which otherwiseEntities remain isolated and arid like dry branches. As it stands, it's an instantly enjoyable pastime, but the justification for spending (albeit a modest) 1000 Wii Pints is hard to find.
