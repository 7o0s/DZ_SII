{"name": "The Falconeer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-falconeer-recensione.html", "text": "The Falconeer is one of the Xbox Series X and Series S launch games (but also available for PC) which, although developed by a single individual, the talented Tomas Sala, has really important ambitions, as we will see in the course of the review. Great Ursee is a world made up mostly of water. The peoples who inhabit it live crowded together on the few emerged lands: a large crevasse that divides the sea in two, small archipelagos or rock spurs with enough space available to allow the construction of habitable buildings and useful infrastructures. Among the latter are the landing platforms for the falconers, the lords of the skies who, astride their giant falcons, roam the vast expanses of water in this world on the brink of a huge political crisis, the only ones who can admire the its boundless majesty. Of course, falconers aren't just about hunting for beauty, they also have a much more prosaic role. Theirs is an essentially military function, that is to defend the various agglomerations from the assaults of pirates and not exactly friendly creatures that populate the game world, but they can also take on other tasks, such as those of couriers or messengers, which lead them to travel continuously from one point of the planet to another. It is thanks to these trips that we discover more and more details about the socio-political situation of Grande Ursee and its mythology, entering into the mechanisms that regulate the power relations between the various local potentates. It should be noted that Sala has tried to tell the background of his world in the most choral way possible, avoiding to concentrate all the events around a single hero, so much so that each chapter of the campaign can be tackled with a different falconer. What matters is the political nature of the story, which tries in every way to avoid tickling the player's fantasies of power (a choice that some have not really forgiven poor Sala). Gameplay The Falconeer is also and above all an aerial combat game in which you face off against other falconers, warships that sail by sea or sky, battleships, mines, monsters, fortresses and other adversaries, standing firmly on the back of your falcon friend . On closer inspection, this is the predominant part of the entire experience, as well as the most accurate both in the flight system, halfway between realistic and arcade, and in some interesting and original features, such as the need to recharge by collecting energy of storms or the possibility of using the falcon to grab objects in the sea and then throw them at the target of the turn. At first, those looking for a light gaming system could almost be blown away, but getting used to the controls, performing the various evasive maneuvers such as rolls or diving and regaining altitude just before touching the water, gives great satisfactions. Here, however, comes one of the first flaws of the game: the lack of progression. Of course, by acquiring experience it is possible to improve the characteristics of the falcon, just as it is possible to buy objects, the so-called mutagens, which alter its performance, for example by stimulating the adrenal gland so as to keep the bird in a continuous state of tension, or by altering the circulatory cardio so that it produces a healing mucus. The problem is that, despite this, the fights are all a bit similar and once you find the right maneuvers to perform, you can repeat them from the beginning to the end of the game with the certainty that they will still be effective, whatever the strength of the enemy. . This doesn't make The Falconeer an easy game, but after a while the repetitiveness starts to feel really heavy and, if you haven't let yourself be carried away by the narrative, moving forward becomes tiring. Another flaw is the lack of things to Do. Aside from fighting and solving missions as delivery men, Sala's title doesn't offer much insight. The typical mission asks you to go from point A to point B, fight, then go to point C, fight again, gradually until you have to go back to point A and collect the reward. It's certainly a great way to explore Grande Ursee and see its breathtaking scenery, but something more structured would have been frankly nice. It is probably too great an effort for a solitary developer, who had to make more than a few compromises to close the game, however we do not deny you that sometimes, between repetitive missions and very similar fights, the sense of emptiness feel strongly. Graphics Technically The Falconeer is a very good game, all things considered. The falcons are animated in an excellent way, the game world is made in great detail despitethe low-poly graphics, while the alternation between day and night and the presence of atmospheric events that change in real time, help to create truly beautiful landscapes. If we want, Sala's work is the demonstration of how, to make a virtual world fascinating, above all a solid artistic direction is needed and the ability not to transcend one's limits, perhaps aiming to do something for which one does not have the necessary resources.", "date": "2020-11-18", "grade": "7.0"}
