Eight years have passed since Explorers of Sky and Explorers of Darkness, double version of the second Pokmon Mystery Dungeon that fans generally consider the best of the series, and after the misstep of Portals to Infinity we expected it would be difficult to raise the bar of quality. Times, however, have changed. Once upon a time, ten-year-old children played hours and hours with LEGO; today they upload photos to Instagram on their iPhones while they wait for the PlayStation 4 to finish updating Bloodborne. Spike Chunsoft must have figured it out too, because he's spent the last three years working out a compromise. The result is this surprising Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon that manages to put all players on the same level. Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon has bewitched us: it is the best spin-off of the Game Freak series Patience is the virtue of monsters Anyone who has tried at least one Pokmon Mystery Dungeon will instantly recognize the first few minutes of play. By answering a simple aptitude questionnaire, the game will choose an alter ego and a companion for us, selecting them from all the ~starters~ of the series to which Riolu and the ever-present Pikachu are added. Don't worry, however. If you don't like the pokmon arbitrarily chosen for you, you can safely select another one. For example, we preferred Tepig to the Chespin that had been assigned to us because, always remember, Tepig is life. As ~partner~ we chose Piplup and we began the adventure in the usual way, that is by waking up in an unknown place after having mysteriously assumed the form of a pokmon (Tepig, in fact). Fortunately, we immediately ran into Nuzleaf, who practically adopted us and took us to Borgo Quieto, a lively village inhabited by pokmon where we met the local troublemaker, Piplup, and started attending school. If it seems to you that all this incipit makes very little sense, well, you are absolutely right. After all, Pokmon Mystery Dungeon drops us into the unexpected world of Pokmon without trainers, gyms and PokDex: in this colorful universe, every little monster has a personality, a way of expressing itself and a real story. The Italian adaptation does wonders in this sense, giving each character a character if not even a distinctive language. In this way, the pokmon that we usually captured and archived without thinking twice become protagonists or special guests. From the point of view of the plot, the first few hours are not particularly exciting: the school setting is hilarious and the dialogues sparkling enough, but nothing particular happens for at least six chapters out of twenty-two; only after four or five hours of play do some interesting twists and turns begin to follow one another and the threat we will have to face becomes clear, or rather the mysterious transformation into stone of pokmon. The last chapters will exalt the younger fans and make the older ones move and reflect, we are sure of it. In short, once you get over the obstacle of what is, to all intents and purposes, a very long tutorial, Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon opens up and allows the player much more freedom, allowing the protagonists to recruit new adventure companions and freely explore the many dungeons of the game. Together by force Coming to the gameplay, not much has changed compared to the foundations laid by the progenitor in 2006, but all the various improvements implemented by Spike Chunsoft have contributed to making the new experience cohesive and satisfying on multiple levels. In this sense, Super Mystery Dungeon looks more like a simplified version of the recent Etrian Mystery Dungeon, but those who have played the Atlus roguelike will probably sigh with relief: we are in challenging territory, but not as prohibitive. With the spin-off of Etrian Odyssey, Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon shares a graphics engine that gives us well-finished and beautifully animated three-dimensional models together with colorful scenarios full of details, supported by a qualitatively over the top stereoscopic effect. Together with the soundtrack, pleasant even if far from unforgettable, the Spike Chunsoft title is a small pearl that does not regret the cel shading of the latestthe two mainstream episodes developed by Game Freak. Returning to the game, however, we will find ourselves exploring numerous procedurally generated dungeons with each access: our aim will be to reach the stairs that lead to the next floor, moving on an invisible grid. Each movement or action represents a turn for both us and our enemies, regardless of where they are, which is why it will be important to coordinate the movements of our three pokmon by studying the actions of the targets and the structure of each room. The sword of Damocles of hunger will always hang over us, an indicator that is consumed with every step and that we will have to keep an eye on constantly, since it will be important to balance the experience: better to run to the stairs or face some enemies while looking for scattered objects for the map? This is a dilemma that always involves risks. Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon does not skimp on unpredictable peaks of difficulty, especially when facing super effective pokmon against ours. In this sense, you have to play following the rules of the mother series and therefore thinking about the weak points or the moves that enhance us or weaken our targets. Dozens of objects with the most disparate effects come to our aid, on which Spike Chunsoft would seem to have focused more than in the previous chapters. The strategic consumption of wands, spheres and other gadgets is not only recommended but sometimes necessary, above all if we consider that our defeat involves the loss of the objects and money in our possession; in this case Pelipper Island comes into play, a hub from which it is possible to ask for help from other players in various ways or send our subsidiary teams in search of the missing protagonists. To these more or less established mechanics are added a couple of interesting features that add depth to the hybrid combat system, such as for example the Circles, in which it is possible to set temporary gems that give pokmon special bonuses, or the combined moves that they allow our team to attack in the same turn at the cost of a few more hunger points. Pokmon fans, at this point, will immediately prick up their ears, because Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon effectively allows you to put into practice new strategies based on the numerous abilities of the various little monsters. And this is where the Intersphere comes into play. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect is generally of great impact, but in terms of gameplay it has no value at all. Spike Chunsoft designed the environments and positioned the camera intelligently, for example when overlooking Borgo Quieto from the adjacent hill. Even pokmon use Facebook After completing the sixth chapter of the story, our protagonists become part of (well, more or less) the GIP, the Pokmon Investigation Group that deals with helping little monsters in difficulty. At that point, the so-called Intersphere is unlocked in the options menu, a real network of contacts through which we can undertake secondary missions. The concept is quite simple. Some pokmon we come across while exploring the villages will become our friends and will appear in the Intersphere together with their friends, forming a network that will gradually become wider and more intricate. Between one story mission and another, some of the pokmon cataloged in our Intersphere will ask us for help: maybe they've lost an object - if they're not lost! - or maybe they want to teach a monster a little too bossy a lesson; be that as it may, helping them means tackling the dungeon in question to complete the mission and recruit the related pokmon to our team. At that point, we will be able to select that same pokmon every time we go on an adventure, but above all we will unlock the possibility of facing the side missions that will allow us to recruit his friends in the Intersphere. In short, by carrying out the various secondary missions, a list of supporting actors that is nothing short of immense is expanded: in Pokmon Super Mystery Dungeon it is possible to recruit and control all 720 existing pokmon, evolutions and mega evolutions included, even if in the latter two cases it is necessary respect some limits imposed by the narrative structure. While many pokmon are recruited by meeting particular requirements, most of them are unlocked by completing the same dungeons over and over again, which results in an experience that becomes decidedly repetitive a little too soon. There are various benefits, such as the fact that the ~on the bench~ pokmon gain experience even when they are not fighting, which help to lighten the game dynamics but the latter, in eachcase, they remain faithful to the roguelike nature of the Mystery Dungeon series: if you don't like the genre, in short, it won't be the pokmon that will make you like it.", "date": "2016-02-08", "grade": "8.3"}
