After a long beta phase that allowed millions of Xbox Live users to get a full taste of the game, the work of Wargaming.net finally reached the coveted official release last February. This happens exactly when the Xbox 360 life cycle inevitably comes to an end and the spotlight is all on its successor Xbox One. Live's first free-to-play title opens its servers to all users with a Gold subscription without requiring any other (mandatory) disbursement to be able to throw themselves into a war hell made of iron, tracks and explosions. The peculiarity of the game is summed up in the name: in World of Tanks the protagonists are the tanks! Sign up at no cost Rivers of virtual ink have now been wasted to describe what it represented and still is the phenomenon of World of Tanks. The PC parent version even broke the Guinness World Record for the most players connected to the same server at the same time. It is one of the first great successes of the free to play formula that managed to establish itself in the western market, when this form of distribution had already gained a considerable market share in the Far East for some time. The simplicity of the game formula produced by Wargaming.net meant that the user base expanded like wildfire and, albeit with a surprise announcement at the last E3, a landing on the console market also seemed inevitable. The gameplay of World of Tanks translates in a fitting way with the classic dynamics of shooters strictly dedicated to multiplayer. The peculiarity of the game is well summed up in the name itself: the protagonists of the clashes are exclusively various types of tanks with very distinct characteristics between the various models. The greater speed and mobility of light tanks is compensated for by poor armor and low offensive potential which makes them excellent tools for reconnaissance and the identification of enemy units. Diametrically opposite is the approach required to drive a heavy tank, these massive means boast an incomparable defense and firepower but sin in the slowness and in the poor visual range which makes them almost blind if not supported by other allied units, while instead medium tanks represent a versatile compromise between the two extremes. There are also tank destroyers specialized in long-range shooting in strategic but extremely fragile positions and the almost immobile artillery capable of raining lead from the sky with a very long range. This extreme heterogeneity of the means and their peculiarities obliges the player to face the clashes in a strategic way, relying on the choral team action made up of 15 players, which can be coordinated through voice chat or through explicit pre-set written commands. World of Tanks is absolutely not a game for lone wolves and individual action never pays off leading to the premature transformation of one's tank into a smoking can, also thanks to the total absence of respawns. Tracked chess The matches, which last up to 15 minutes, are characterized by a slow and reasoned pace and it happens that we run into situations of impasse where the two sides are perched in their respective positions and exchange blows at long distances. We soon realize how just positioning yourself in the wrong way or exposing the weakest part of the vehicle to enemy blows, such as the tracks or the rear, can prove fatal. The use of covers such as rocks or buildings and vegetation are essential to hide from the field of view of hostile tanks, as well as the refined system of damage and collisions of shots calculates different variables to always take into account. In fact, a cannon shot received perpendicularly to the armor will have a greater probability of penetration than a shot arrived obliquely and even the breakage of a track can lead to remaining at the mercy of events while awaiting repair. In some cases there is even the possibility that a member of our crew may succumb in the middle of the battle, compromising some of the vehicle's functions. The game modes vary from the Standard game where the goal is limited to conquering the enemy base or (much more frequent outcome) eliminating all enemy tanks. Encounter matches instead focus on the occupation of a neutral area located in the center of the map, while in Assaut mode the two teams share the roles of attacker and defender ofa single basis. Initially, only three modest vehicles belonging to three different categories are available, by gaining experience with the games it is possible to purchase upgrades and aesthetic customizations or other tanks of a higher rank (there are over 150 available). The accumulation of experience is rather slow and could discourage less motivated players, even if in the first few days of the game there is a period during which the rewards at the end of the game are doubled. Obviously it is possible to resort to a further resource, through the disbursement of real money and the subscription of a premium account: gold, thanks to which it is possible to obtain some special means, buy consumable goods or simply to speed up the growth process. Thanks to the experience gained with the PC version of World of Tanks, the implementation of these optional transactions does not unbalance the game balance too much and the risk of degenerating into the spiral of the so-called ~pay to win~ is all in all averted. The excellent matchmaking that selects players based on the ~tier~ (or class) of the tank chosen for the match also helps to keep the balance on the field. The netcode is also excellent which, together with the use of dedicated servers, offers a solid and uncertain online gaming experience. Xbox 360 goals The 400 points available are divided into 29 objectives, one of which is secret. If the first tens of points will be unlocked almost by themselves, to complete the loot it is necessary to play numerous games with each type of tank (100 games with each of the four classes) and destroy as many as 500 enemy tanks. The war is definitely long. Trip to the countryside The seven game maps boast a vast area of one square kilometer and differ both in geographical conformation and in their aesthetic appearance, alternating, for example, landscapes of the French countryside with desert or arctic scenarios. The developers of Wargaming West (the Chicago-based studio that took care of this version) have focused particularly on the creation of the models of the tanks, very detailed and on which you can appreciate the various upgrades and aesthetic changes that we can make. The frame rate is also decidedly stable, helped by the slow and never frenetic game action, while the rendering of the environments leaves a little bitterness in the mouth and in particular the very reduced visual distance of some details of the maps, such as bushes or grass that literally appear a few meters from our vehicle. It is understandable that Xbox 360 is a machine that is now accusing the weight of the years and it would be inappropriate to expect the same visual standard as the PC version, but it is equally true that this console has repeatedly shown that it can offer more from a technical point of view. One cannot help but think of the constant rumors that have been chasing each other for months about a possible (but we still don't know how probable) version intended for the next gen of Microsoft where surely one could be more daring also from a graphic point of view. But on the other hand we are still talking about a fully playable title without necessarily having to shell out a penny, for which some technical ingenuity can be forgiven. On the other hand, the controls adapted to the joypad are decidedly fitting, which recall in all respects those of the classic first-person shooters and allow total and intuitive control of the tanks.", "date": "2014-03-09", "grade": "8.0"}
