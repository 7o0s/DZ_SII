{"name": "THE LEGEND OF DRAGOON", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-dragoon.html", "text": "The way of the hero It's not easy for anyone to become a hero. Especially for the protagonist Dart. Orphaned from an early age of both parents (who died in an attack by the Black Monster on their village) he has always stood out for his fighting skills. In his childhood he was a close friend, almost a brother, to a girl with a heart of gold, Shana. And it is precisely for her that you will leave Seles, your adopted city. I'm not going to tell you the whole story, but suffice it to say that you'll find that ultimately your social life isn't all that important. Yes, because this title will be able to involve you from the beginning in a fascinating story full of backstory. It will take you for the plot, for the characters, for the setting. Or perhaps because, deep down, we all want to feel like heroes like Dart, a boy full of insecurities and fears who will however have the strength and courage to face incredible adventures. The Legend of Dragoons After a spectacular introduction that will introduce you to the world of ~The Legend of Dragoon~ you will find yourself inside an RPG that has a structure very similar to that of the titles of the Final Fantasy series. In fact, you will have a party available with a variable number of characters ranging from one (ie only the Dart) to three. The main menu is simple and effective and here you can change the various parameters of your characters and check the objects in your possession. The internal sections are: Status (where you will check the health of your group), Items, Weapons, Goods (i.e. the items you cannot use), Equipment (selectable special shots which I will talk about later), Substitutions (to replace player characters with those not used), Configure and Save. The management of weapons and magic potions will be very important because this will greatly contribute to your success. The game is divided into two phases: exploration and combat. In the exploration phase you will have to go around the cities or the map in order to continue the adventure. In the various locations you will have the opportunity to enter practically any house, shop or anything else that happens to you on the screen. You will be able to talk to anyone, even if the dialogues will very often be reduced to a couple of sentences. But maybe it's better this way: imagine if all the characters (and there are at least a couple of hundred) told you about their lives! Within the three-dimensional map, which you will use to move within the vast world of the game, you will follow pre-marked routes which, however, will undergo variations as the story evolves. The idea of the three magnifications is interesting thanks to which you won't have too many difficulties in finding even the most hidden locations. You will not be able to save when you want but only if you find yourself inside one of the many luminous spheres that you will find in the game. Inside the map, however, the problem does not arise: in fact, saving will be free here. The fight However, what has always distinguished a good RPG from a bad one is the combat phase. In this, Sony's latest title draws heavily on the Square masterpieces of the Final Fantasy saga. When you find yourself fighting you will have to act only when it is the turn of one of your characters. In the moment of interaction you will be able to attack, defend yourself (recovering energy and suffering less damage from opponents' blows), use an object, escape or, later in the game, become Dragons with the ability to launch devastating attacks and magic. Furthermore, when you attack, you can use the Equipment I was telling you about earlier: they are special shots that you will get by pressing the X key at the right time. The fights take place on the whole in a quick and simple way, without obstacle submenus and without ever making the weight of waiting feel thanks to sometimes spectacular interludes. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, I can tell you that the latest Sony title is average. The technique The graphics aren't bad. The rendered backdrops are well done, but the polygonal characters are very sparse both in the exploration and in the combat phases. What struck me most, however, are the graphic effects of the spells, very suggestive and often excellently done. Sound is good. The music is very nice (even if the Final Fantasy ones were quite another thing) and the sound effects are discreet. I didn't like the voice acting at all, even if it was limited to a few words in the combat phase.9 Concluding In conclusion, I can only recommend this title to you. I haven't had this much fun since Final Fantasy VIII! It's an incredibly long-lived game and I think it's a great buy for everyone, but especially for the many Square fans. Pros Very intriguing story Very good control system Long-lived Cons Not amazing from a technical point of view [Special Legend of Dragoon's Artwork] Dragons and Dragoons Always, when we talk about dragons we talk about legend. The dragon is the best known mythological animal and we find traces of it in dozens of medieval works. It is an imposing animal with wings, a long tail and the ability to breathe fire from its gigantic and powerful jaws. It has been represented in various ways, but has now entered our imagination as a vaguely reptile-like monster that has the sole purpose of destroying everything, especially human beings. Some believed they were able to speak or had other extraordinary abilities. Many mysteries permeate the figure of this animal and that is why it can be defined as the symbol of the Fantasy universe (for further information, I recommend watching the film ~DragonHeart~ ndCartac) Even in the latest Sony effort, the legendary monster dominates the scene. It is also in this case a cruel being in the service of evil but as the story progresses you will understand that in the world in which ~The Legend of Dragoon~ is set it has not always been like this. Once, when men and Winged Ones fought for world domination, dragons were commanded by special humans, called Dragoons. They had the gift of taming dragons and making them fight on the side of humans. Thanks to these special people, humanity defeated the Winged race and peace reigned for many years. But you know, peace never lasts forever and in fact 11,000 years later a devastating war broke out on Earth between the kingdom of Basil, ruled by the noble King Albert, and that of Sandora, dominated by the cruel King Doel. What made the battle even more bitter was Doel's capture of the last living dragon, Feyerbrand. You will find yourself in the middle of the battle between Basil and Sandora. But this is just a pretext for the dense plot behind this immense game.", "date": "2001-01-24", "grade": null}
