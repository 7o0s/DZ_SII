{"name": "Eden Tomorrow", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eden-tomorrow-recensione.html", "text": "That Eden Tomorrow is not a world champion of originality can be guessed even just by reading its synopsis: a protagonist of whom little or nothing is known who crashes his spacecraft on an alien planet populated by enormous beasts and which he must try to bring to home the fur with the help of a friendly droid. Basically the carbon copy of Robinson: The Journey, a Crytek title that over two years ago tried to bring a full-fledged sci-fi adventure to PlayStation VR, with unfortunately far from exciting results. Precisely because of this not unforgettable precedent, anyone would have been willing to forgive Eden Tomorrow for this lack of inventiveness, if only it had proved capable of offering an experience up to the situation: a pity that the game by Soul Pix even manages to do worse than the product it was so obviously inspired by... Clouds of Eden on our Tomorrow today And to think that Eden Tomorrow looks anything but bad, thanks to a dramatic and engaging introductory sequence: the player's alter ego is abruptly awakened by the AI of his escape pod, just in time to realize he is falling on a unknown planet as the hull literally falls apart. Miraculously survived the crash and the encounter with a first fearsome predator, the anonymous hero realizes he doesn't remember anything of his past but finds help in Newton, a flying robot who will accompany him in his attempt to recover his memory and return At home. Precisely the creation of this supporting actor represents the first, big mistake of the developers: what should be the comic shoulder of the adventure (like the Wheatley of Portal 2 to be clear) instead resolves itself into a redundant and verbose presence that in most cases it weighs down the unfolding of the plot rather than lightens it. Considering how Eden Tomorrow's offer brings it closer to walking simulators than to adventures proper, the fact that the story is not exciting is a big problem, which unfortunately turns out to be only the tip of the iceberg of the product's limits. In fact, things are not better in terms of gameplay, which proceeds in a completely linear way with the user switching to the commands of the protagonist or Newton in pre-established phases. As the human, all you have to do is walk through the scenarios (with the pedantic droid constantly denying any semblance of freedom to explore), collecting clues and occasionally engaging in very simple puzzles or tests of skill. The latter are particularly disappointing, both because they appear unrelated to the normal progression and above all because they exploit the potential offered by virtual reality in a superficial way to say the least - when not exactly conceptually incorrect. It doesn't go better when it comes to controlling Newton, indeed it can be said that these are the most boring phases of the entire offer: these only involve navigating the surroundings in search of a series of energy cells indispensable for charging the pulse weapon in endowment of the droid, to allow him to remove certain obstacles and allow the protagonist to continue. As if the prospects just described weren't already bleak enough, the tombstone of Eden Tomorrow is given by the fact that these routines are repeated cyclically throughout the course of the adventure, making the approximately five hours required to see the end credits exhausting. In this absolutely negative picture, the only little joy comes from Soul Pix's technical skills, which have allowed the creation of a VR title that is at least functional and immersive. Although the graphics of the game do not literally leave you speechless, the glance is still remarkable thanks above all to the good modeling of the creatures that inhabit the planet and to the sense of scale offered by the settings, two elements which in fact represent the only , an ephemeral antidote to total gameplay boredom. On a purely scenographic level, therefore, Eden Tomorrow takes full advantage of the potential of PlayStation VR, and is also committed to making the experience as adaptable as possible to anyone, thanks to a few but useful options that allow you to adjust the comfort of vision by avoiding the risk of motion sickness starts. The work done in terms of sound is also good, with convincing effects and a musical accompaniment perfectly in line with the mood of the adventure: a pity that everything is often covered up by Newton's unsustainable babble...", "date": "2019-03-25", "grade": "5.0"}
