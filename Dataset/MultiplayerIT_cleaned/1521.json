{"name": "Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne.html", "text": "Noir as pitch. Noir, there is no other word to define the atmosphere that reigns from the early stages of the game. As in the first chapter, the comic introductions dominated by very dark colors and the topics covered, which speak of betrayal, pain and violence, bring to mind the classics of the genre. The story oozes with crime and pulp, and the drama flows through the convulsive words of Max and the protagonists of the story. This time Max will have to deal not only with his tormented past, always ready to resurface and upset his fragile mind, but with a disturbing love story worthy of the best film noir. Mona Sax, suspected of murder, will follow Max closely, letting our fall into the thin web of a dramatic and dark love story. Remaining faithful to the original, the story is enriched by twists and flashbacks, which will soon lead you to no longer know who to trust. There are also visionary journeys in the mind well known to those who have tried their hand at the first chapter of the saga. No longer hallucinated by the Valkyrie, but tormented by terrible nightmares Max will have to deal with the most hidden side of his personality and fight with the ghosts of the past and his monumental guilt. Aaaction! But the time has come to get into the action. One of the most suggestive qualities of this title is precisely that of never diverting the player's attention from the dramatic setting of the game without detracting from tons of lively actions and endless shootings. Every single frame of MP2 will keep you glued to your seat, with your heart pounding and the perennial feeling that your adrenals can't continue to produce so much adrenaline for much longer. From the very first moments of the game, everything has been set up to constantly remind you how precarious your safety is. Max Payne remains a game of fast-paced action, twists and turns, and escalating tension. The storyline, fragmented and deliberately confused, offers from the very first moments a story that has little to do with the story of the first chapter, but which is perfectly configured in the noir tradition. Max wakes up alone, in an apparently abandoned hospital, no doctor, no nurse willing to help him, and above all, even more alarming, no bloody gun in his right hand. Staggering and tired, through our intervention Max manages to get away from the ward bed and explore the area a bit. The corridor is ghostly deserted and a telephone is ringing in the distance. From time to time the commands are removed to make room for some animations. Max has clearly aged since we last met him. The signs of a difficult life and the indelible pain that has marked this man's existence for years are more evident on his face. In the throes of hallucinations (perhaps induced by some anesthetic) and still staggering Max drags himself through the corridors until he comes across the corpse of a surveillance man. Picking up the fallen weapon at his side, there is not even time to understand what is happening. A man armed to the teeth and made unrecognizable by a balaclava enters the room and threatens us. We just have to cool it with a shot and continue on our way. Wandering around the floor, still shaken by frequent hallucinations, our takes the elevator. Once on the ground floor, Max runs into Jim Bravura, a nice mustachioed little man, also from the NYPD who does not hesitate to rant in our direction. From here on, you enter the nightmare. Apparently this time too our Mr. Pain got stuck in a good mess, given that Jim's last words, before sending us to hell, referred to a murder of which Max seems to be the culprit. A burst of machine guns, another man in a balaclava and Jim's life goes out before our eyes. A cylinder accidentally left in plain sight launches a flame in our direction, and taking off as a rocket towards the lift next to it, it unleashes hell, involving Max in a thunderous explosion. The real story starts from here, retracing the events through flashbacks and memory excerpts we will have to reconstruct the sequence of events that led Max to this point. havok. Password: realism Finding ourselves faced with a title of this kind, it seems right to waste a few more words on the physics engine, which is directly responsible for the great degree of realism achieved by Max Payne 2. Currently, in fact, it is no longer sufficient to equip a video game with a graphics engine that does not take great also consider the physical interaction of objects and consequentlytheir real reaction to current events. Just to focus the problem let's take the example of the bodies of the characters in a common FPS. In recent years we were used to seeing games that were very well done from a graphic point of view, but which did not take into account the real reaction of bodies abandoned to themselves; for example, it was very common to be faced with clipping, or rather the phenomenon that sees objects and parts of the bodies literally sucked into the scenography, with a decidedly unpleasant visual effect. All this derives from the fact that the game engines did not take into account the solidity of the models presented, for this reason, not knowing how to solve the case of a man who slumped on the ground crashes into a wall, the program solved the problem by allowing the arm to disappear within the wall itself. Max Payne 2 can instead count on a latest generation physics engine called Havok, capable of guaranteeing a huge step forward in this matter. The benefits of this engine in such a game are very remarkable. If in the past even the smallest object was an immovable obstacle and you could get stuck by a bottle left on the ground thanks to Havok you will notice notable changes. In MP2 all objects react realistically and it will not be uncommon to see Max tripping over them or making enemies fall with his shoulders (something unthinkable until some time ago). As far as the reactions of the corpses are concerned, a separate chapter should then be opened, it is enough to know that Havok has invested a lot precisely on the enhancement of the ~ragdoll~, i.e. the realistic movement of the corpses that behave like rag dolls; I recommend a stroll on the developer's official website to get an idea, there you will find some truly spectacular short videos that will leave you breathless. To conclude, it is worth remembering that even the highly anticipated Half Life 2 integrates Havok, the obvious conclusions are up to you. The nitpick... But let's get to the point, what is really new about this Max Payne 2. Well, the news is many, and all worthy of note. The first Max Payne saw the birth at the end of 2001 and managed to astound the critics with very accurate graphics, a somewhat compelling story and a truly out of the ordinary novelty. The introduction of Bullet Time, inspired by the well-known slow-motion scenes of the Matrix, upset (in an absolutely positive way) the expectations of the players. All this transformed Max Payne, an action game like many others, into a global success that led to the sale of millions of copies. The graphics engine of Max Payne 2, an evolution of the one already seen in the first chapter, probably won't be able to compete with that of the famous Doom3 and Half Life 2 but it offers a truly noteworthy show. Playing Max Payne 2 is not only fun, but also enjoyable. The details have been refined considerably (starting from the faces of the characters, amazingly detailed) and the degree of environmental interaction available appears to have been enhanced. The faces are crafted with obsessive care and, even more astounding, but all the more necessary in a game that almost pretends to be a film, the movement of the lips is synchronized with the speech. There are many small objects scattered around the map that Max can interact with. Starting from the possibility of rummaging in numerous hiding places, such as lockers and drawers, in search of ammunition and painkillers, up to the possibility of seeing entire piles of bins, boxes and various scraps roll on the ground, a real panacea for realism. Every small object hit by the characters or by some stray bullet will react in a totally natural way, and we also seemed to notice a certain correspondence between the hypothetical weight of the object and its reaction to the impact. The engine physics is also very faithful to reality. A show, albeit macabre, is to see how the bodies of downed enemies collapse to the ground, or get entangled in the props. This effect is guaranteed by the massive use of the Havok physics engine (see box), perfectly integrated into the game, capable of giving a realism never seen before. The nitpick... The abundant presence of gore might make some obscure censorship lord pale, but it gives us yet another opportunity to accurately assess how powerful this engine is; you will not find one bloodstain the same as another. In fact, the red spots will spread to the ground in an extremely realistic way, for example leaving macabre trails on the floor when a corpse is moved or thrown from the floor.position in which he was. The maps are dotted with objects to collect, very useful for completing the mission, and obviously well hidden. There are many ways to reach these places, and no seemingly inanimate object should be taken for granted. For example, an abandoned forklift next to a warehouse could be activated in order to access a raised floor that is difficult to reach without any support. The arsenal supplied to our hero is the richest and most equipped, you will find weapons of all kinds on the way, from the Uzi submachine gun to the beloved sawn-off shotgun to the sniper rifle, you will certainly not be disappointed by so much goodness. Impossible don't spend another two words on Bullet Time 2.0. During the game you will obviously find it essential to use Max's ~super power~. For those approaching the game for the first time, it must be said that the secret that made Max Payne famous is hidden under the name of Bullet Time. It is the ~Matrix-like~ effect for which time seems to slow down and you have the possibility of moving as if in slow motion by seeing the bullets of the enemies with precision and thus managing to hit the enemies very accurately. Obviously this involves a significant increase in spectacularity, which gives something magical to this game. To activate this property, simply press the secondary mouse button. At this point the screen takes on a sepia hue and everything starts to move slowly (everything except the viewfinder of our Max, fast and precise as usual). While in BT mode, an hourglass lets time pass, until everything returns to normal speed when it runs out. The novelty of this new BT 2.0 is that the more shots Max will score in this way and the more destructive the following shots will be, as well as the faster Max's hand and trigger will be, as if to say that whoever knows how to shoot well will improve the coup from man to hand, a nothing short of brilliant gimmick. The wise man says: ~Better alone than in bad company...~ true, but what about when you are well accompanied? In Max Payne 2 you will have to deal with many characters who, as the story evolves, will prove to be fearless companions or terrible traitors. The fact is that for the first time Max Payne will be joined by supporting actors who will help him overcome the most difficult moments. It is a series of extras and real characters with a strong characterization; in general they are all old acquaintances of Max Payne, criminals seeking revenge and colleagues in the department, but the figure of the beautiful Mona Sax stands out above all (ok, ok those who know a little Venetian will find this juxtaposition amusing well yes, it is Mona in name and in fact!). As far as the gameplay aspect is concerned, these characters will support Max in some missions by providing their contribution in terms of cover from enemy fire and attack, and for this reason they will be able to prove to be effective and dangerous. Obviously each supporting actor will be able to fall under the blows of the enemy, so you should also try to ensure their survival. One piece of advice is to let the ambiguous characters talk until they become annoying or dangerous, like the old lady with the rifle that you will meet in Mona's apartment building, who, although she seems threatening if left alive, will reveal the hiding place where she keeps precious weapons and ammunition (how nice these grannies!). However, a separate chapter should be opened for Mona Sax. Impossible not to define her as a femme fatale, Mona is the true supporting actress of this adventure. The ambiguous relationship between her and our tormented hero will soon emerge from the protagonist's fragmented memories (on the other hand, the game cover itself is a fairly obvious spoiler). A love story dyed black like all the rest of New York seen from the eyes of our Max. The attraction that Max feels for Mona will lead him to face a new tormented period, as the girl is embroiled in a dark story of murders and local mafia. Whether she is an innocent or a solitary avenger who entered the police sights by mistake, you will only find out by playing MP2, but suffice it to say that her role as guardian angel will not fail to amaze you, if it is true that at some point you will be asked to wear his shoes to help Max in a moment of serious difficulty. ~The real life~... or ~When Max Payne comes home from work...~ ~A film noir story~, this is exactly how Max Payne 2 is defined by the developers themselves. Indeed the script of this title and the skilful direction with which it was made make Max Payne a real movie to play. And like any self-respecting film, the actors could not be missing.
