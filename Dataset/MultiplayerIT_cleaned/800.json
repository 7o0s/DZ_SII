In fact, the futuristic scenario is reduced to a crashing spaceship and an alien planet, but otherwise the setting is imbued with technological decadence and cyberpunk deviations that are not exactly new in the video game world. The story is inspired by the shipwreck of the ~Gloria~, a full-bodied interstellar cargo swallowed by a mysterious vortex, and by the miraculous escape of two crew members, Lanthan Signey and Cheris Sheridan, respectively Captain and first pilot of the ship. While the destiny of the Gloria is tragically fulfilled, the rescue shuttle takes the two survivors to the desolate planet of Procyon, where the Numori empire secretly extracts tactonium, the ever-present radioactive mineral that is used to favor the inevitable hi-tech grafts in the body. of mostly low-tech characters. In short, in short, Lanthan and Cheris find themselves in the middle of the desert, surrounded by scorpions, and with minimal equipment (just underwear and a slingshot), but fortunately not far from there they will find the human settlement (more or less) of Fortune City. It's all about getting there, up to there... Deja vu Here begins our story, which will see us roaming through the desolate lands of Procyon and among the desperate people who inhabit it. Poverty and degradation fill every dusty corner of the world and the inhabitants of the place, despite being aliens, have curiously human features. We will find the replicants, men created in the laboratory to carry out the most thankless tasks, the mutants, men who have carried out the most thankless tasks and have been inexorably marked by them, the cyborgs, men who did not want to carry out the most thankless tasks and filled themselves with so many grafts that they are no longer recognizable as human, and then the mysterious Numori empire, with which we will start arguing right away. As we said, the setting draws heavily from the post-apocalyptic future of Fallout, but changing the name of the variables and rewriting the story (but not too much). The whole universe is country And yes... however far we may end up, in the end what matters is always the money! And the money will be used by our heroes to find a way to escape from the inhospitable planet. Since the not exactly soft landing, Lanthan and Cheris will feel the need to find a spaceport from which to take - it is appropriate to say - the flight to a more welcoming accommodation. But between saying and doing there is an entire RPG involved. The very short initial phase, when our heroes are still lost in the desert, introduces the combat system in a dry and brutal way which, coincidentally, is very reminiscent of that of Fallout. It is a turn-based system, in which points are spent, alternately with the AI, between shootings, movements and various actions. And yet the confrontation with Fallout, unfortunately, ends with a resounding defeat, given that Metal Heart lacks all that outline of splatter, animations and sound, which made the battles in its predecessor unrepeatable. From the first encounter with the very insidious scorpiola, you immediately notice that Lanthan's very powerful machine gun is nothing more than a cough bean shooter, that the bursts are too short and that the sound is completely inadequate (cough bean shooter, in fact) , not to mention the unjustifiable lack of any arbitrary pulping, disemboweling, or truculence. The whole universe is country Beyond the combat system, the game is structured on a vast framework of quests, ranging from the main story line, to secondary quests, ending with random quests, which most often consist of reaching a certain destination, do something, and get money from it, but be careful about killing helpless people, because then our reputation suffers. The story develops through a large number of non-player characters, which we will later call NPCs, and more or less diversified settings. Not all that glitters is gold... not even tactonium Sore point of this production is the interaction with the scenario, which is almost completely absent. It is not possible to open doors or containers, it is not possible to move objects, even the noble passion of every self-respecting RPG player is prevented: theft! We won't be able to rummage in drawers, furniture or filing cabinets, simply when we point the cursor at something, it doesn't change shape and we don't need furious clicks and doubleclicks from pour art, because the game unfortunately does not allow interaction with the environment. Oh God, every now and then we will find some machine that, if stimulated, will respond, but it is rather a matter of sporadic presences, of exceptions, because the rule is a very sad absence of any form of interactivity. Sore point of this production is the interaction with the scenario, which is almost completely absent. Not all that glitters is gold... not even tactonium But at least, we will find objects to collect, scattered here and there, and we will be able to buy many others from the shopkeepers that we will meet as we go. Of course, in this case there is no shortage of an imaginative variety of material and we may happen to come across bizarre cyborg prostheses and XXX magazines (which we won't be able to browse through, sorry) or substances with rather curious qualities, such as a bottle of pheromones animals in heat, just to give an example. Obviously, we will find a more than good availability of weapons, ammunition, armor and systems, as well as a fair number of NPCs to hire in our group. Not all that glitters is gold... not even tactonium The exploration is quite good and the game areas are never small. There is a lack of a map to use for better orientation, but in the end it is not a great loss. The crossing of the various areas takes place in closed areas, similar to Baldur's Gate 2, in short, you leave a map and load the next one. Forget, therefore, the seamless movement to Morrowind, here the fences are higher and there are no shortcuts. This means that, to reach the opposite end of a city, we will have to cross it all and, moreover, we will be subjected to physical stress which will sooner or later tire our characters until they slow down. Hard backlash to the playability, sadly. Once out of the first settlement, we will learn about the global map, the one that will allow us to cover the greatest distances. As per the script (who said Fallout?) it will also be possible to make random encounters during our travels. At least over long distances we were spared. Added to this is a game interface that isn't exactly state of the art. Skimpy or poorly translated menus, questlogs that are by no means exhaustive, databases with bare-bones explanations, in short, it seems to have more of a beta in your hands than a finished product. How I bring out the Vin Diesel in you! What RPG would it be without the ability to distribute stat points? Well, it would undoubtedly be a revolutionary RPG, but apparently the guys at Num-Lock don't think the same way and have decided to draw up a nice list of features to increase, during the passage from one level to the next, distributing a lot of points. As if a couple of numbers were enough to make an RPG, ah... Well, more than a couple. To begin with, as soon as the game starts we will have a nest egg of 25 points to distribute, out of a total of 10 different characteristics. Far be it from me to list them all, but know that alongside the more classic strength and dexterity we will also find a much more strange health or a very curious protection, ending with the graft's portability and duration. If grafts and duration seem rather relevant to the growth phase of a character, the items health and protection are rather discordant, as we are used to, in other games, seeing health gradually increase as the other items rise, and the protection increase based on the armor we wear, but anyhow... they are there. In fact, moving from one level to another is a rather stressful phase and in sharp contrast with current standards, which tend to simplify this phase as much as possible. How I bring out the Vin Diesel in you! Perhaps the most interesting feature is that relating to the grafts. In Procyon's world, survival is a luxury that can easily get out of hand, so everyone resorts to the measures they deem most effective. There are those who crash into a pit to rot underground and there are those who improvise neighborhood bosses and keep everyone in line, but there are also those who prefer to transform themselves into a sophisticated war machine, grafting cybernetic prostheses on themselves and electronic systems. This choice, however, is not painless and every time we decide to use one of these implants, we will suffer physically, suffering damage as long as the device is in operation, unless there is a good supply of tactonium in our inventory, which it will run out instead of our health. Definitely an intriguing choice for those who love a tormented existence. The benefits of grafts are innumerable and it certainly becomes difficult to resist the temptation to use themi, but we all know that sooner or later we will become slaves to hidden reserves of tactonium, so let's get used to the idea of walking around with a metal eye and a hydraulic arm. There are three types of grafts, the surface grafts, which are applied to pieces of armor or equipment. They are the most harmless but also the least effective. Then we move on to level 2 implants, grafted directly into the flesh and for which a rather high level of the corresponding characteristic is required, as well as a good user manual, always available from the best (or worst) surgeons. Finally, there are the third level implants, which replace the internal organs, heart, lungs, you know those weird soft things that slip out if you open someone's belly. To use these grafts, you need a high level of the corresponding characteristic and a special kit that can be purchased at the best butchers in the neighborhood. The tongue hits where the tooth is in pain... A good story deserves a good narrative, don't you think? Well, what narrative would it be without an equally good translation into our beautiful language? Here, it would be the translation of Metal Heart. Oh you, purists of the Italian idiom, fasten your seat belts well, before launching the executable, because what you will see is the worst translation work ever seen so far! Phrases to make your stomach crawl, syntactic constructions worthy of the Messina bridge, verbal evolutions that not even a politician on acid would dream of... I would love to be able to say that, overall, there are some sporadic translation errors, after all count which of us is infallible? But no, these are not sporadic errors but gross oversights that could only emerge from an automatic translator. Hear this: ~feels like you were actually heard~; ~space port~ (translation of Spaceport, which means spaceport); ~safeguard~ (translation of save, from the game menu). These are just some examples, but unfortunately it will not be uncommon to find more or less serious errors during the adventure, errors that heavily affect the gaming experience, from a narrative point of view. Final comment We are not. Metal Heart starts badly already due to the obvious inspiration from Fallout, where it takes the first slip, because if you want to follow a path already traveled, you have to do it well, while Metal Heart is lacking in countless points of view. It goes without saying that one has the general impression of being faced with an incomplete title. Too bad for the authors, because you can see the good intentions, but unfortunately they are not enough. Metal Heart combines good ideas, a good characterization and an interesting story, with an insufficient technical realization. The poor interaction with the environment (little? Non-existent), the intricate points system, the meager combat phase and, finally, the embarrassing Italian translation, are all heavy boulders that fall, one after the other , on the product in question, definitively burying it. Recommended only if you are in heavy abstinence from old-style RPG. Pros Old-style RPG Freedom to explore Well-characterized NPCs Cons Bad localization There is no interaction with the backdrop General sense of incompleteness Classical dichotomy Due to a curious combination of fate, in the history of RPGs there has been a sensational division of the genre into two large strands: fantasy and science fiction. On the one hand we have shining examples such as Baldur's Gate and, further back in time, Ultima VII, on the other cornerstones such as Fallout and Deus Ex. Of course there have been some deviations: we have impersonated vampires, some shy soldiers of the Second World War, and even jedi knights; but the hard core of the genre is fantasy, followed at a distance by science fiction, and all the rest are only sporadic appearances. While on the one hand the market is saturated with fantasy-style RPGs, on the other we begin to feel the lack of some science fiction titles, a territory that has never been explored enough in this category. It is therefore with great surprise, and a touch of perverse pleasure, that we have received the news of this new RPG set not in a land populated by dragons, nor in a dark land devastated by witchcraft, but on an alien planet, in a distant future of humanity.", "date": "2005-10-18", "grade": null}
