However, the most interesting mode is undoubtedly that of the championship, which allows you to compete against the greatest surfers in the world in the most important beaches of the circuit. You choose the board (you will unlock new ones as the game progresses), and throw yourself on the highest waves in the world trying to get as many points as possible (therefore a higher score) being careful not to end up too often in the area where the wave it breaks, otherwise your points will be deducted and you will drink a lot of water; to your aid in the lower part of the screen there will be a bar that will warn you if you are more or less close to the dangerous area of the wave, but be careful not to go too far from the point of greatest thrust otherwise your feats will never be spectacular enough. A note should be made to the number of stunts available which are not many and to a certain feeling of randomness in performing them that one has in the first game sessions. However, in our opinion, everything remains on good levels of fun whatever the chosen mode. because life is more than washing the dishes So sang the spot for a well-known dishwashing detergent on the air of a legendary piece by the Beach Boys and even if it has nothing to do with us, this association came to mind, not because by dissolving the cartridge in the dishwasher your dishes will become shiny and shiny, but because what this title transmits (especially to those who are not passionate about this sport) is pure fun. In fact KSPS is surprisingly fun even for those who don't like games of the genre (Tony Hawk or SSX), it is true that here there is less freedom of action but the waves that run after it and the limited time give the whole thing a something of adrenaline. All this is then assisted by a graphic sector which, although inevitably sparse (sea, sky and surfer) is of great quality, the water effect is amazing even compared to that of consoles of similar power (e.g. psx) and also the rendering of splashing and definitely satisfying and varies depending on the numbers you perform on the waves; the movements are also extremely fluid and the audio is also very good with decidedly plausible water effects and always spot on music. Comment What can I say, KSPS is undoubtedly a valid title, perhaps not very long-lived due to the repetitiveness that the specialty itself somehow implies and above all the environment in which it takes place, but we guarantee you that the technical realization is of a good level both under the audio and video profile and playability is excellent, thanks to very simple controls and good fluidity. It is therefore difficult to find major flaws in a game that in any case deals with such a particular sport, but we can assure you that you will often be surprised to say: ~... come on, I'll try again~. Pros: Fun as a wind chime. Beautiful water effects and good sound. Cons: It's a surf game Repetitive in the long run. There are probably not many of you who would consider buying a handheld game focused on surfing. But if the game is Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer and the console is a GBA we can assure you that the purchase is more than justified. Perhaps we are not dealing with a masterpiece, but in our opinion the Hot Gen Studios team has done a great job, creating a simple, immediate game with a respectable technical sector; in short, a mix that can only bring down any prejudices that one may have regarding a game based on a sporting discipline so little known here. The game structure is similar to other titles of the genre (Tony Hawk for example), but although obviously more limited in the freedom of action, it adds a very interesting element to a gameplay still based on jumps and acrobatics: that of having a wave of 5-6 meters running after you; so in addition to having to perform the ~traditional~ tricks, you will also have to be careful not to end up submerged in water without losing the thrust you will need to make the ~gestures~.", "date": "2002-12-24", "grade": null}
