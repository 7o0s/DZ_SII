In fact this is the fifth, and respectively the third in the nextgen platforms, a timeline that has always guaranteed tangible improvements to each edition, as well as a technical realization of absolute importance. However, Fight Night Champion comes out rather close to the recent Round 4, so what are the reasons capable of persuading the user to make a further purchase? Many to tell the truth, starting from the desire to provide an edition of the franchise that is truly attractive for everyone, but first and foremost to present the mode that characterizes this episode, called, unsurprisingly, Champion. The results exceed the wildest expectations. Let's see them. Adrianaaaaa Raise your hand those of you who have ever nurtured the intimate desire to step into the boxer's shoes, not so much in the canonical, icy career now seen in every sporting title. We are talking about a more intimate and, why not, fictionalized and metaphorical approach to the great American dream. Rocky Balboa teaches, but also draws heavily on Cassius Clay or The Hurricane to tell the story of the athletic black boxer Andre Bishop, our digital alter ego that we will guide along a difficult but exciting journey, from the slums of the suburbs to to redemption and triumph. EA Sports pushes in the right direction by shaping the escalation on the ropes of an adventure interspersed with various videos, which present the main character with well-chosen supporting actors. In a nutshell we find ourselves facing a series of encounters and mini-games subordinated to various objectives proposed by the modality, united by a pleasant, engaging story that never lacks a sense of empathy towards the protagonist. Andre is not doing very well, after a series of promising matches a rosy sporting future seems to lie ahead for him, but unfortunately his fate collides disastrously with the cruelty of a ruthless manager. Unjustly found in prison, he must face the hatred of his not very reassuring companions, find within himself the strength to react, and get out of that hell to take back what is rightfully his. He will also make it thanks to the help of a woman who believes in him. Among the characters encountered we find Andre's stormy brother, determined to follow in his footsteps, a very nice and canonical coach (you're a scamorza cheese!), and the snooty Isaac Frost in the role of the inevitable antagonist (I'll split you in two!). To all this is added the proverbial icing on the cake, represented by the official ESPN coverage, we therefore witness frequent fictitious broadcasts conducted by real sports journalists, in a mixture where the limit between virtual and real becomes dangerously thin. The career is long and full of surprises, it is necessary to master the new Full Spectrum control system to adapt to the various objectives, and the most dramatic clashes are emphasized by an impressive sound accompaniment. In short, the Champion mode is the real flagship of this edition, masterfully created and able to excite the player, but it certainly didn't end there... Photorealism issue There are many things to do after having dismissed our friend Bishop, starting from the Legacy mode which returns in splendid form, giving us the possibility to choose our boxer from a rich sample, or create one from scratch. Also in this case we find ourselves facing a long series of meetings of increasing difficulty, from the amateur championships to the world top. Or we can throw ourselves into the ring instantly through the ubiquitous quick match, and even in this case the choice is almost dizzying: 75 boxers including the historic stars. It starts from Mike Tyson, passing by Muhammad Ali, Oscar De la Hoya and Jake Lamotta. It is even possible to unlock the characters of the Champion mode, in addition to the obvious possibility of presenting ourselves with our personalized athlete. Fight Night Champion is much more than a mere updated re-proposition, as much as a product that has been profoundly revised in all its departments, starting from the graphic aspect, which reaches its maximum expression and effectiveness in this incarnation. It's hard to get bored in front of the visual spectacle orchestrated by EA Sports, but it's terribly easy to become addicted to its endless details and photorealism. A practically endless amount of preparation scenes, presentationsroaring tones and luxurious contours leave room for a polygonal engine still capable of astonishing as it did five years ago. The polygonal modeling of the boxers often leaves you amazed, especially the rendering of the flesh and the muscles shaken by the powerful blows, the precision of the tattoos, the copious and realistic sweat, up to the sophisticated mapping effects to make the fabrics shiny. A wise use of motion blur even manages not to weigh the halving of the framerate compared to past editions. The performance of the various rings is also exceptional, ranging from dusty gyms to the most impressive arenas. Not least is the audio accompaniment, characterized by a pressing soundtrack, realistic effects and a commentary capable of effectively representing the progress of the meetings. The reviewed version is the English one, therefore without an Italian localization. Xbox 360 goals As expected, Fight Night Champion offers the canonical 1000 points divided along 44 objectives. Many of which are obviously related to the Champion mode. But be prepared to spend a considerable amount of time improving your boxer in Legacy mode, or defeating some human opponents in online gyms. Whatever happens, put on those gloves, scamorza cheese! Power is nothing without control The truly fundamental element is represented by the new Full Spectrum control system, which, although continuing the will of the developers in proposing a playability strongly subordinated to the analog sticks, potentially opens up to a slice of user even unrelated to the discipline in question. The mechanism is more intuitive than it is legitimate to think reading this review, the control of the punches is managed on the respective sides of the right analog stick, while specific combinations and half-moons allow more elaborate and incisive shots. The buttons and back triggers are instead used for the management of dodges and parries. The most exciting aspect of this system emerges only after understanding it in its entirety. The aim is to find that rhythm that characterizes and makes real boxing so fascinating, and the greatest athletes who have ennobled it over the years, all without forcing the player to twist acrobatics on equipment that will never be able to make the right level of precision. In our opinion, the result is twofold, in addition to smoothing out the playability in favor of a less savvy user, it is possible to have a much clearer and more concise picture of what happens in the ring, soon abandoning useless shots, decidedly harmful to the form of our beloved boxer. Further proof is given by the specific objectives of the Champion mode, such as fighting with a single punch, conditions to which the renewed system adapts brilliantly. However, there is room for improvement, as demonstrated by the slight delay in the execution of the commands, sometimes annoying, and the not always optimal rendering of the animations in conveying the sense of beating the opponent. Finally, the fighters managed by the cpu oppose a resistance that is sometimes unnerving and not exactly realistic, even if very linked to the level of difficulty chosen. Despite everything, the road taken by EA for this new chapter proves to be successful and open to future developments, such as an even richer Champion mode. As for online, the Xbox Live service is fully supported to face players from all over the world, enriched this round by a collective mode, which offers us the possibility of joining other players in real virtual gyms.", "date": "2011-02-24", "grade": "9.2"}
