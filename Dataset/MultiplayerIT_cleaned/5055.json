In fact, we are talking about a Japanese studio made up of Shinnosuke Ohashi and his wife Aiko, programmer and graphic designer respectively, who have recently launched Missileman on iOS devices, an entertaining vertical scrolling shooter that in the first place courageously stands as a premium production, purchasable for 2.99 euros; secondly, it draws liberally from the vast tradition of endless games that have been raging in the mobile sector since time immemorial. In reality, the experience proposed by the game is not characterized by an infinite structure, in the sense that different levels follow one another (sixteen in total, each divided into three stages crowned by a boss); however the roguelike approach forces you to start the journey over again with each game over, without even being able to treasure what you have just seen since the arrangement of enemies and obstacles changes with each game. Everything is managed through a very simple and immediate touch control system, which assigns the movement of the character to the left side of the screen and the fire to the right, revealing itself to be fairly precise and reactive, although sometimes the fingers tend to dangerously hide the pitfalls in I arrive. It's a pity, because even from a graphic point of view, the Game or Die title is a great sight, fluid and very colorful, accompanied by a perfectly fitting soundtrack. Missileman is a fun, fast-paced, and very challenging roguelike-style vertical shooter Rocketmaaaaaan The protagonist of Missileman is precisely a man-missile, or rather a guy in a costume who stands funny balancing on the head of a rocket and ~shoots~ it without hesitation at enemies, landing on the next missile on the fly to continue its run. An image as absurd as it is fun, which however must not distract from the demanding action that takes place on the screen, and which sees the arrival of an ever-increasing number of enemies who must be killed to obtain the green gears. These are essential elements to raise the indicator which is located in the upper left of the display, under the hearts that represent our vital energy, and which allows between one stage and another to unlock upgrades with a view to three different factors: the main firepower, the secondary one (in the form of small support missiles) and the resistance to attacks, which takes the form of a more or less powerful energy shield. It goes without saying that pursuing the upgrade path is essential to increase one's chances of reaching the end of the game, although the first encounter with each boss hides surprises that are difficult to predict. The roguelike approach therefore arises on the one hand as a fascinating element of challenge, on the other as a frustrating obstacle to completing the experience, both because it is not possible in any way to continue the game at game over, and because not even the unlocked upgrades resist such an event. The only element of real progression consists of the achievements, which allow you to take advantage of a different skill tree as the objectives are completed.", "date": "2017-02-10", "grade": "8.0"}
