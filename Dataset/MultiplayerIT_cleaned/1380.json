{"name": "Sonic Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-heroes-4.html", "text": "Team play. The idea behind this Sonic Heroes is to divide the now large park of protagonists of the series into four different teams (Team Sonic, Team Dark, Team Rose and Team Chaotix) of three characters, each with their own abilities and who can , collaborating, being able to overcome the various game situations. In reality, the different teams correspond to a different conformation and difficulty of the levels, and not to actual gameplay differences, given that they are equivalent in the possibilities offered: there is the strongest character with which to destroy the elements of the seabed to find hidden ways o bonuses and get rid of enemies faster; the character who allows you to fly and climb the steepest slopes in search of passages or to better eliminate flying enemies; there is the one with which to face the fastest parts and jump from enemy to enemy to overcome ravines or chasms. Great effort has been put into the creation of the many character abilities, power ups and special shots, each with a specific function. The most positive note certainly lies in the longevity of Sonic Herpes: if to finish the game in the simplest way, it won't take more than ten hours, to finish it with all the emblems, all the power ups and all the teams it will take no less than about thirty hours. This, of course, provided you like the core of the game which is the breathless and breakneck crossing of dozens of locations, interspersed with clashes with the end-of-level bosses. The level design is back to the good old days, with loops, spectacular jumps and a great feeling of speed. Naka, in the level called Casino, manages to achieve the best 3D pinball rendering that he has ever achieved and that he has been chasing since Sonic Spinball. Were it not that the physics of the ball / Sonic is completely busted, there would be something to cheer about. What do we do? There are multiple ways to play Sonic Heroes. The first is the fastest and consists in getting to the end of each stage, surviving the attacks of the enemies and without using up all the lives by falling into chasms or cliffs. As in the best tradition of the Sonic Team, however, this is nothing more than the tip of the iceberg that offers much more. At the end of each internship, in fact, we are given a letter that corresponds to the vote obtained based on factors such as the time taken to reach the end, the rings recovered and the secrets discovered. During the internships it is also possible to find cages with keys inside, once collected and at the end of the internship you can access the bonus levels modeled on those of the legendary episodes on Megadrive. Before you have explored each of these, achieved maximum marks in each level and collected all the emblems, it will be a long time. Mon amour camera. Here we go again, it is appropriate to say it. The biggest problems of all Sonic 3D transpositions have always been related to camera management and Heroes is no exception, maintaining some of the annoying characteristics of the past. Apart from the accidents for which the shot sometimes gets stuck in positions from which it is difficult to juggle and which in any case are not too problematic rarities, some choices made by the developers are unclear. With the analog triggers it is, in fact, possible to rotate the camera 360 around the character you are controlling, with the right analog stick you switch to subjective view and it is possible to look around in every direction. The problem is that while you're standing still and wanting to look around to gauge the distance to a platform or see if you can proceed in an alternate direction, you can't look up or down while in third person view. This can only be done by switching to the first person view, which, however, does not help when you have to jump, or from the third person view, but only while moving. Strange choice, which greatly limits the possibilities of this game, so we soon find ourselves bashing our way towards the end of the stage just to see what acrobatic adventures we are called to in the following stages. The desire to get the most out of these mammoth schemes is likely to fade quickly. Blue flashes For a multiplatform game, this Sonic Heroes does some things very well. The sensation of speed is intoxicating and the sporadic slowdowns do not affect the playability nor the overall result. Even the structure of the internships is noteworthy, these are in fact articulated and complex and seeing yourself whizzing around the structures of the different schemes generates more than an exhilarating moment. The only shortcomings are to be found in a system poor in effects or goodies, which are now the order of the day on Xbox (the new chapter in Sonic's life boasts perhaps the worst polygonal reconstruction of water ever seen in this generation of hardware ), and in the lack of polygonal details in the backdrops, whose choreographic rendering is almost entirely entrusted to the textures and the general cleanliness of the image. The sound is typical of Sega's hedgehog-related titles, with that 80s melodic rock that will bring down a few tears to lovers of the golden years of the Japanese entertainment giant. Comment After the misstep of Sonic Adventures 2, the new chapter in Sega's hedgehog saga is perhaps the one closest to its 16-bit origins. The doubts arise from having recovered the frenzy, vertigo and level design of the early days, leaving out the aspects more purely related to platforming, especially for camera management problems. Sonic Heroes is a lightning-fast thrill ride, a long ride on a pyrotechnic and colorful roller coaster, but it remains to be seen how long this type of gameplay still manages to be truly satisfying. The result of the Sonic Team's work is fun, but frankly the time has come to find new ideas for a hero who has run a lot with these road shoes and who could leave his mark again. Pros: Sonic returns to good levels Great sensation of speed Fair longevity ... Cons: But only on condition that you get caught up in the gameplay Usual camera problems Some slowdown After having enjoyed some success on the GameCube with the 128-bit re-editions of the two chapters released for the Dreamcast, Sega returns to the fray with this Sonic Heroes, openly multiplatform, and which arrives simultaneously on all consoles. The version that has perhaps the luckiest to exist is precisely the Xbox one, where the Sonic Team game does not have fierce opponents in front of it and where the public is literally hungry for platformers. Sega relies on proven mechanics and returns to the typical path of the episodes of the 16 Bit era with a fast and fun result, but one that can't really scratch.", "date": "2004-02-26", "grade": null}
