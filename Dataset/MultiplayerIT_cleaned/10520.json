From the outset it is clear that we are not faced with a real school trip, but with a kind of summer campus, in which the didactic dimension, made up of questions and assignments in class, is added day after day to that of outdoor recreation. The leitmotif of the whole story is in fact the participation in the ~summer school competition at the Montrose campsite~; here, Giulia has to take care of the cleaning of the classrooms and the control of the dormitory, but above all, he has the task of directing and leading a team of six children (the ~Pulcini~) to victory. The various missions will be described by the various stereotyped characters who work alongside Giulia at the summer camp: a grumpy director and three colleagues (head of the opposing teams) will thus take turns, among which a petulant and sour teacher stands out, ready to discredit the Pulcini team in the eyes of the boss. Even the group of children takes on conventional characteristics, from the sporty type to the classic ~nerd~, passing through the blonde girl who loves the look. The almost obvious structure of the game manages to become a great advantage, if we consider the target audience: in this way, young players will be able to fully enter the dynamics of the game and make progress much more easily (without getting stuck, for example, on the favorite character, but paying attention to the different characteristics presented). Towards victory... The objective of the ~summer school competition~ is the very precious ~Great Camping Cup~, reachable only through a real treasure map, which will be unlocked as you progress with the various missions: prizes are dispensed for each success secondary (the so-called flags, the collection of which allows the winning of minor cups) and a fragment of the important map. The physical tests that children will have to face are all linked to the world of camping and outdoor sports: there is running, fishing, pitching a tent and so on. However, athleticism is not enough, given that during the morning the class will have to undergo checks and questions, elements that contribute like physical tests in winning the prizes. Obviously, the children do not all have the same abilities, therefore, to optimize teamwork and become more competitive, a ~training~ section is available, in which to carry out extra tests and increase the different abilities of the chicks. Nothing is left to chance: the missions to be carried out are always explained in detail and, as far as the visual aspect is concerned, you are faced with very simple and intuitive commands. Plenty of room for using the microphone, whose sensitivity level can also be selected in the ~options~ section. ... without too much effort Winning the proposed missions might seem like a tough feat... but it's actually really simple. The requirement of having to perform only a few easy movements performed quickly with the stylus of the DS to complete the various levels proves to be the key to grabbing first place without even struggling a bit; the difficulty of the game is therefore reduced to a simple exercise of speed, the only truly necessary skill. Once you understand the concept, the slew of missions from accomplishing almost seems to fall into the vortex of routine and repetitiveness, despite the proposed challenges being characterized by a certain variety. The secondary activities are no less, especially the control of the dormitory, which is reduced to a simple ~turn off the light and blow the whistle~. Naturally, these defects can undoubtedly constitute elements of challenge for the younger players, to whom the game is absolutely dedicated; a pinch of more videogame experience would be enough to spoil the spirit of the game and to make the identification with the main character fade. On the other hand, budding players will surely be able to play the part of the teacher Giulia and, engaged in teaching and sport, will find amusement and entertainment without worrying about a certain monotony.", "date": "2009-09-18", "grade": null}
