After a few seconds the main menu appears, perhaps the most famous tune by John Williams welcomes us and we are faced with the choices which, although disguised, immediately make us have the bad impression of finding ourselves in front of a sumptuous MODification of AOEII  mah  perhaps we are just prejudiced, and in any case this shouldn't necessarily be a defect: we postpone. There are 6 selectable Campaigns (Tutorial included) and allow you to play with each of the available civilizations: Rebel Alliance, Empire, Royal Naboos, Gungans, Trade Federation and Wookiees. When we get tired of the standard campaigns and random clashes we can also play single maps or campaigns developed directly by enthusiasts or whoever they are. In fact, the game includes a very complete mission editor that will allow you to recreate, for example, all the major ~historical~ conflicts told by books, comics and films inspired by Star Wars. Let's not forget that we will be able to use our TCP / IP connections to challenge other human players on the other side of the globe. In Multplayer we will continue to find the game modes that have made AOEII successful and lucky, only worthy of note is the fact that we could cancel all the Bonuses/Maluses associated with each individual race to have more balanced games and nothing more. For the rest we will connect to Microsoft's Multiplayer service (The Zone) and we will find dozens of enthusiasts ready to break our teeth with laser swords. A long long time ago  The classic structure of the RTS will certainly not suffer major shocks in Galactic Battlegrounds: we will have to collect a certain amount of resources (food, different types of ore, coal) in order to support the creation and livelihood of different war / logistic units. The units and houses that we will be able to build are basically the same for each race but the quantity and type of resource required and above all the external appearance will change minimally. Once a certain level of wealth has been reached, understood both in terms of accumulated resources and constructed buildings, it will be possible to increase the technological level of one's settlement and thus access new or more powerful structures and units each time. Each civilization as well as some particular units (obviously the Rebels will be able to boast the contribution of the Jedi Knights) will be characterized by some advantages/disadvantages, the Trade Federation for example, since it uses an army composed solely of androids, it will not need to build accommodation for the troops (usually instead the more your troops grow numerically and the more housing units you will have to build) but it will be less effective in coal mining, furthermore some powers will have an overall army more capable of fighting on land rather than on land or by sea. Once on the battlefield we will be able to give our troops the most diverse commands such as the type of formation (scattered, square, wedge, ...), the defense of certain objectives, the pursuit of an enemy unit or the unconditional attack. Generally we will never have an indestructible unit because, as in a game of chess, each move corresponds to an adequate countermove: the only problem is to find it and do it as quickly as possible. in a galaxy far, far away To get to the heart of it right away, we decide to start immediately with some tutorial missions, not so much because we think they should serve us but because it is a way like any other to make the first acquaintances with the first usable ~race~: that of the Wookiees. The impression of being in front of AOEII disguised in space suits returns again: the options are the same, the mechanics pure, the camouflaged structures are easily recognizable, the armed clashes exploit the same rules (despite the inclusion of aircraft)  but we keep telling ourselves that everything is not a bad thing: after all, we had a lot of fun with Age of Kings. A little disconsolate but still reinvigorated by the Force (which is strong in us) we venture into the first Campaign: what happened to the beautiful animated interludes that enrich the LucasArts titles? Gone, we are left with the Briefing screens accompanied by stylized artwork and well-curated voices: who knows why but it reminds us of something. Also the music, which has so muchnno strengthened in the side menus, they disappear when we are on the battlefield and leave us at the mercy of our grim destiny, which isn't so grim because the sound effects are still well done. The voices then, completely in Italian (as well as the rest of the game), greatly enrich the game and are all perfectly characterizing. For example, hearing Black Helmet speak ... pardon .. Darth Vader exalts a lot, the voice actor is certainly not the original one but the only defect that we feel like moving is the lack of the characteristic ~heavy breathing~ that gave us so many chills as children . The answers that our units give are quite varied and hardly boring. in a galaxy far, far away The graphics on the other hand, it really pains us to say, are quite ugly. It will be that we have softened with the three-dimensional models of Battle Realms, it will be that we have become accustomed to the visuals of Empire Earth ... the fact is that the graphical representations of the units, in addition to being quite small, are sometimes ~out of scale~ and above all badly made ( the Tie Fighter models disappointed me a lot). The latter is really a big flaw if we consider that the strong point of the production should really be the cosmetic component. Yes, because the producers of the game seem to have not changed an iota from a gameplay point of view and have brought with them all the strengths and weaknesses of the good old AOE. In the game manual (by the way, at least from this point of view we will not be disappointed, the manual is excellent and we will find a giant color poster with all the game units) several ~innovations~ are mentioned which, on balance, they are little more than cosmetic. Now some units and buildings will be equipped with regenerating shields (in full StarCraft style, I dare say), with all the peoples we will be able to build air and anti-aircraft units, while in some cases it will be possible to produce stealth units. There would therefore seem to be a lot of meat on the fire but, in the end, we will not be able to notice it because very often the innovations introduced do not bring many changes to the game tactics. If we then consider that one of the great defects of Age Of Kings, namely the lack of characterization of the various civilizations, has also been taken up by Galactic Battlegrounds we regret the lost opportunity. Star Wars is the forge of dozens of different settings and populations, in theory it would have been easy to be inspired by them and recreate different game situations. In practice instead using a pre-packaged game engine, and evidently not very flexible, the only noteworthy differentiations are the possibility for the Naboos to build houses under water and the presence of Jedi/Sith knights depending on whether you decide to command the Rebels or the Imperials. Really too little, especially if we think about what happened in StarCraft using the Zerg and using the Humans: almost two different games.  Star Wars! In case you missed the concept: Galactic Battlegrounds is nothing more than a Total Conversion of a title released about 24 months ago. The differentiation offered by the marine/space scenarios is of little use, the effort made to offer the player more than 300 different units is of little use: the game style is two years old and despite the (few) changes by playing this title we will have always the impression of being in front of an RTS of two years ago. Successful and tested as much as you want but still from two years ago. The game is still fun sure, but are you sure you don't want to try something different? Even the graphics, while on the one hand it renders the atmosphere of Star Wars well, it seems a little obsolete and certainly does not keep up with the current titles. So to throw away? No, of course not. If you love Star Wars you will most likely also love Galactic Battlegrounds: the feeling of commanding armies of 100 and more androids will certainly satisfy you, not to mention the possibility of being able to direct all our favorite heroes and send our beloved X- Wing. In Multiplayer it is much more exciting to fight against the troops of the evil Emperor than against the Fierce Saladin. Not to mention the plots that govern the various campaigns: the stories are well written, perhaps trivial at times but they make good the spirit that has been telling the deeds of Skyluke and associates for years. If, on the other hand, you are ~only~ interested in playing a good RTS and you have already tested the qualities of the Ensemble Studios title, first I advise you to buy Battle Realms or Empire Earth, only after havingIf you have eviscerated them to the point of boredom, you might think of dedicating yourself to this title. Introduction Force Commander: those who don't know it know that it is an RTS set in the Star Wars universe: a game as promising as it turned out to be silly. Today, after about 3 years, LucasArts is trying again to offer such a title but, to risk as little as possible, decides to sink its roots into the foundations of one of the most successful real-time strategy games of recent years: Age of Empires 2 - The Age of Kings, by Ensemble Studios. Tested game method, setting loved and appreciated by millions of fans: a sure success? Let's try to discover it together.", "date": "2002-01-09", "grade": null}
