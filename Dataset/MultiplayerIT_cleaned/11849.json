{"name": "Tomb Raider: Anniversary - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-anniversary-recensione_c.html", "text": "Tomb Raider was the Playstation's Mario 64, and it was also something more since he deigned to convince Saturn and PC users that the wonderful world of three dimensions was a possible choice. The son of Another World presented himself to us mortals in the pleasant form of Lara Croft, a busty archaeologist destined to become the first true heroine of videogames, the Ripley of action, the Joan of Arc of..all right, all right, we are exaggerating. However, let's not exaggerate by saying that the video game imagery stalled on Tomb Raider until the advent of Max Payne, lord of bullet time and champion of dynamic action. In the meantime something has been lost. The taste for level exploration has dissolved by appearing sporadically in B-series productions or in titles lacking in charisma until a certain Metroid Prime suddenly revived the disappointing Game Cube stock. It is through this journey that Tomb Raider: Anniversary comes to us. Today the first Tomb Raider knocks on our door again and coincidentally it does so by improving the management of the aiming car and with the addition of a pinch of bullet time, in an attempt to ride the progress that advances. There is madness and madness At first, you are a bit taken aback. It seems that the designers have taken the task of honoring Lara very seriously and have deliberately decided to recreate her difficult adventures like those of the past. While keeping all the new moves and while updating the structure of the levels, the feeling is that of the time and the difficulty as well. I'm one of those who found Legend all too easy and the comparison with Anniversary, which proceeds in a completely different direction, only confirms how in recent years it has been chosen to favor simplicity, making some games too quick to finish . An adventure game needs adventure. The player wants to find in it a challenge and a confirmation of his imagination: you pull a lever and a boulder collapses, you jump into the void, you throw a grappling hook and you get to the other side of a ravine and so on. In short, there must be all those situations that make it possible to deal with danger feeling it as present and that require a minimum of dedication to be overcome. Right from the start Anniversary proves to be a difficult challenge, especially for the casual player, accustomed to video games in which you just need to press a button at random to make a massacre of enemies or to overcome an apparently insurmountable obstacle. The developers wanted to re-read the intricate levels that so many players had fallen in love with, adapting them to the new graphics engine and remodeling them around Lara's new moves. The result is spectacular and we are not even going to explain the thrill of finding yourself jumping here and there again on the precarious platforms of a level like the Folly of San Francesco, which today as then is a small miracle of level design; something that makes us proud to love video games despite everything. Of course, it is also true that less practical users will find many difficulties in moving forward. In this sense, completely forget Legend, designed for less savvy users, and consider the fact that in some sections you die very often, especially in the advanced levels where the attempts to overcome traps will have to be multiple. Death in slow motion There are many moves available to Lara: she can run, jump, crouch, use weapons, throw a grappling hook, run along walls (only if she is attached to a rope), climb, swim, dive and perform other actions based on her situation. As in the original, there are objects to collect, levers to pull and enemies to fight against, even if the latter are much smaller in number than in Legend, where some levels were essentially dedicated to combat. Learning to dodge is essential to being able to survive Death in slow motion One of the innovations introduced concerns fighting: when an aura shines on an enemy's head, it indicates that he is preparing for a lethal assault. In these cases, by continuing to aim at the target and combining the crouch key with a directional movement, it will be possible to perform a dodge in slow motion, during which two white crosshairs will appear which, when superimposed and turn red, will indicate the possibility of perform a lethal blow to the head. Learning to dodge is essential to be able to survive the clashes because normally the assaults of the enemies are not avoidable in any other way. In addition, some bosses, such as the tyrannosaurus, will require the use of this technique in order to be overcome. The system looks complicated but it is not difficult to master. Certain,compared to other action titles it is slightly cumbersome, but you soon get used to it and you no longer notice it. Xbox 360 - Goals If the title is a classic, the same cannot be said of the objectives. To get the infamous points it's not enough to progress through the game and the spectacular actions are limited to defeating the bosses without dying. The points challenges arrive directly from the Legend while the bulk of the rewards comes from the collection of special weapons and artifacts. Both unnerving activities for those who are not accustomed to manic exploration of the levels. Comment In terms of third-person action Anniversary adds nothing new but carries with it the legacy of a real video game milestone. The level design is impeccable and the feeling of going through the most mysterious places on the planet alongside the attractive archaeologist remains. Unfortunately, the spectacularity has faded and the combat system, unlike Lara's face, shows clear signs of aging. Ultimately it is a product dedicated both to authentic fans of the series and to those who have never had the opportunity to play the progenitor of the series. Pros Best of Tomb Raider Some nice additions Retains a taste for exploration Cons Shows signs of aging Outdated gameplay Tomb Raider: Anniversary is available for PC, PlayStation 2, PSP and Xbox 360 and is planned for WII. The tested version is the Xbox 360 version. A look at the past If the graphic profile is exceptional on PS2 and acceptable on PC, the same cannot be said for the XBox 360, a fixed configuration machine that has accustomed us to decidedly higher standards. The fauna models are particularly poor, badly animated and so outdated that they could be dated using Carbon 14. The level design intervenes to revive the technical sector which derives largely from the original Tomb Raider and which represents a brilliant example of balance and inspiration , so much so that we often forget the too geometric nature of maps. The addition of bullet time and some effects, even if none of these belongs to the next gen, improve the visual impact in some situations, but they are not able to change an experience that remains linked to technological and aesthetic standards surpassed by time. The coup de grace comes from the scenes of the old Tomb Raider now created with the game engine, which join the short Quick Time Events scattered here and there during the game and which have now lost almost all of the spectacularity that was offered 11 years ago in the first Tomb Raider.", "date": "2007-11-08", "grade": null}
