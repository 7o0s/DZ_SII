{"name": "Tony Hawk's Underground 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-underground-2_a.html", "text": "Welcome to the World Destruction Tour! The first novelty introduced by softco concerns the story mode, where you will take part in one of the two teams of skaters (team Hawk and Bam) who will compete in a tournament set in various cities around the world. The purpose of this challenge is simple: score more points than the opposing team by completing some objectives assigned during the course of the game. It goes without saying that to successfully achieve the missions you will have to show off all your skater skills and then try your hand at the most daring enterprises! During the journey you will also have to take turns with the other team members in order to unlock new objectives, and complete the levels accordingly. However, it is not certain that your companions will use a skateboard as a means of transport: for example, one guy will go around with a subspecies of moped, another even with a wheelchair, and so on! All of this will take place in the middle of daily city life, complete with passers-by and traffic. A few words should be spent on the stunts that you can perform: well, there are so many tricks available (about fifty), and if we add the possibility of performing spectacular combos, fun and variety are guaranteed. To facilitate less experienced players, the programmers have inserted the focus mode, which can be activated with a key when a special bar is full, which will allow you to perform the evolutions in slow motion, thus facilitating the execution of the combinations. However, this does not mean that it will be easy to carry out the moves, indeed the first few times there are numerous falls of your alter ego. Therefore, newbies will have to arm themselves with patience, and the frustration initially will not be small. However, when the main character ends up on the ground, a red bar appears which must be filled as much as possible in a short period of time; once this is done, the skater literally tears his board to pieces and will then be able to vent his anger by performing tricks with a greater number of points. In addition to the story mode, the classic one has also been included, in which you will have to complete the objectives before the time runs out, and, listen, listen, the online game, which will allow users from all over the world to challenge each other in various types of game (capture the flag, firefight, graffiti mode, etc.). The training option could not be missing where you can sharpen your techniques. I want to do my own thing Tony Hawk's Underground 2 includes a very powerful editor, which will allow you to modify many aspects of the game at will: first of all, it will be possible to create your own character by customizing even trifles such as the shape of the nose, eye color and socks. However, if you want things done right then the Eye Toy support will be right for you, thanks to which you can insert a photo as the character's face. But that's not all, because if the existing maps are not enough for you, you will have the possibility to create one from scratch, inserting the objectives decided by you and placed along the route as best suits you!. Isn't all this still enough? So I'll tell you that the title allows you to make your own tags (the drawings on the walls to be clear) with a lot of choice of shape and color .. Are you happy now? Long live freedom... Another strong point of the Activision product concerns the wide freedom granted to the player. Obviously nothing comparable to GTA, but the permitted actions are not at all few, and the elements with which one can interact are many: locations such as roofs, boats and the interiors of buildings can be reached with the table without particular difficulty, and you can sow panic in the streets decapitating statues (with a particular acrobatics), grabbing onto cars to pick up speed, ~grinding~ (i.e. riding the board) on benches, ramps and electricity cables, scratching walls and signs, throwing apples and tomatoes against passers-by and so on and so forth. In certain circumstances, however, it is possible to get off your skateboard and walk around the city normally. Let's talk about the missions: they are very varied, and will range from performing combos on various points of the stages (sometimes with the table on fire!) and completing a pre-established path up to more bizarre things like marking walls with tags, transporting wounded on stretchers and more. It must be said, however, that some objectives will be rather difficult to complete, and this could discourage the little patients who do not like arduous challenges. In any case, nothing serious enough to affect the rich and exhilarating gameplay. Graphics & Sound Even from a technical point of view, the title offers excellent results. Graphically speaking, THU2 stands at eightlevel me, showing off a very powerful graphics engine capable of handling numerous polygons with maximum fluidity. The overall aspect of the game is quite lively, imbued with light and very fiery colors, highlighting the transgressive spirit of the title. The characters, on the other hand, are painstakingly cared for: in addition to distinguishing themselves by conformation and build, the skaters include a large number of details, even the most futile ones such as the type of shoe, haircut, etc. As far as the animations of the evolutions are concerned, they too have been done very well, and boast a commendable spectacularity and realism. Even more electrifying is the audio sector: all the most current soundtracks have been included, ranging from rap, metal, rock and hip hop. From this point of view, the Activision product can compete with Grand Theft Auto. Comment I don't think there is much to say about this Tony Hawk's Underground 2: the Activision title offers spectacular, varied and fun gameplay, many game modes, ample freedom of action and a wonderful editor. In short, the elements to satisfy fans of the saga are all there, so we can only warmly recommend the purchase of the game. I also advise wary people to try the product without getting discouraged by the initial difficulty in executing the combos. Pro Compartment Excellent audiovisual Damn fun Wide freedom of action Powerful editor Cons a bit difficult for novices In recent years, the Tony Hawk saga has dominated the field of skateboarding simulations, thus becoming the main point of reference for lovers of this particular sport. And so, to the delight of all fans of the legendary Tony, Activision launches the new chapter of the saga on the market, which arrives, as usual, on all existing platforms: Tony Hawk's Underground 2 (henceforth THU2 ).", "date": "2004-11-14", "grade": null}
