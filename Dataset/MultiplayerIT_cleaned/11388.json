{"name": "Orcs & Elves II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/orcs-elves-ii.html", "text": "When your name is John Carmack, and at not even forty you can say that you have laid the foundations for the creation of important video games such as Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom, Quake and Doom 3, it is clear that you begin to see things from a different perspective, looking for a new challenge. Mobile gaming somewhat represents the ~bare ground~ of the situation, an ever-growing market in which (for now) ideas are worth much more than aesthetics, and often one can cultivate them in complete freedom. The creation of Doom RPG is a prime example, in which Carmack has tried to merge the dynamics of the first person shooter par excellence with RPG elements. Orcs & Elves is a bit like the ~next step~ of this operation, an original product which also bases its charm on the fusion of two seemingly distant genres, especially on mobile phones, but it does so using scenarios and types of characters purely Fantasy. The first episode of the series had the burden of introducing the discourse, this sequel aims to expand it from every point of view... The early stages of the game make us understand, through an exchange of jokes, what the relationship will be between the protagonist of Orcs & Elves II and his magic wand... talking. Indeed, the wand not only speaks but also proves to be rather grumpy, so much so that it will refuse to lend us a hand during the first stage, which we will have to overcome relying only on the other tools at our disposal: a stick and throwing knives, which lend themselves to close-quarters and ranged combat respectively. The developers have devised a particular movement system: it is not a question of proceeding as in a first person shooter, but moving ~by steps~, along an imaginary grid. This can be a bit disorienting at first, but you soon get used to it, also because the controls support this choice in the most absolute way: the joystick is used to move in the four directions, the 1 and 3 keys to discard left or right, while key 7 scrolls through the weapons at our disposal, which are activated with the usual key 5. Already from the second stage we will be able to appreciate an expansion of our arsenal, which will also see the presence of a ~familiar~, or a small magical animal that we will be able to exploit on more than one occasion: by ~shooting~ it, we will be able to control it in first person to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, or to distract certain characters and lure them away from our position. The possibilities offered by the game are really many, and the most surprising thing is that all this depth is not accompanied by numerous text screens, as happens with other RPGs on mobile phones: the story unfolds through short and often funny dialogues, fully translated in Italian. The technical realization is divided between ups and downs. The ~box~ movement system takes away much of the spectacularity of first person shooters, unfortunately, and we often see ~predetermined~ sequences in which everything moves much more fluidly, betraying a graphic optimization that has not gone as far as possible beyond a certain point. Apart from that, it must be said that the amount of characters, enemies and weapons is exceptional for a mobile game, not to mention the large number of levels and the characterization of each location. In short, we are faced with a product that graphically prefers quantity over quality, with very appreciable results. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the sound: not since the days of PCs without sound cards have we heard such simple effects, very often beyond any logic (a ~trill~ for throwing the dagger?). PRO Solid and addictive game structure Very varied and rich in thickness A large number of weapons and characters AGAINST Sound ridiculous Somewhat peculiar movement system ~Quantity~ but not ~quality~ graphics", "date": "2008-06-03", "grade": "S.V."}
