It was an excellent fighting game that arrived late on our shores, while its first revision was about to appear in Japan. Arc System Works fans are now accustomed to the practice cleared by Capcom some time ago, and know that sooner or later they will have to abandon their favorite fighting game to buy a revised and corrected version if they want to continue to challenge a large community. Although it has now become a practice, it is rather difficult to get over this real asset recycling, but lovers of the genre are more than happy to open their wallets if the new contents are up to the cost. In the case of Revelator, this is more true than ever. Guilty Gear Xrd: Revelator is a much improved version of the already excellent predecessor Easy to play, hard to master Guilty Gear veterans will immediately feel at home as soon as they hold the joypad or the lever of their favorite arcade stick: the game is basically the same as Sign, improved in graphics and content, but true to itself, if not for the new features and mechanics that not only enhance the gameplay, but offer a whole new variety of nuances. The first novelty that catches the eye is represented by the so-called Stylish mode, designed for newcomers to the series and, above all, to the fighting game genre. Already in the previous Guilty Gear Xrd, Arc System Works had shown that it had taken new players to heart, above all because its most important brands - such as BlazBlue and Persona 4 Arena - are famous for being particularly intricate titles to master due to their imaginative mechanics and more complex strategies. For this reason, Revelator also includes an exhaustive training mode that describes in detail every mechanic, feature or peculiarity of the combat system, from the basics to the most elaborate combinations. The Stylish mode, for its part, adds a further level of accessibility, introducing in the Guilty Gear series the automatic combos already implemented in Persona 4: Arena and a whole series of facilitations such as the automatic parry in neutral position and the dedicated execution button immediate Overdrive and special moves. If on the one hand this implementation could discourage the more experienced players who have worked hard to learn how to play their favorite fighters, on the other hand we must consider the downside in Stylish mode: the players who choose to use it receive, in fact, a greater number of damages than usual. That's not the only addition to the combat system, however. The general balancing work of the developer has allowed the introduction of a couple of very interesting new features, in particular the Burst Overdrive: the latter allows you to run some Overdrives by pressing an alternative button and consuming, in addition to the Voltage indicator , even that of the Burst. The result is a much more powerful attack that, if it lands, also recharges part of the Burst meter, and it is clear that the Arc System Works team decided to introduce the variant to entice players to consume more often and more tactically the remaining Burst charge. Among the other most interesting news it is worth mentioning the Blitz Attack, which allows you to attack during the Blitz Shield, and the removal of Danger Time, a feature that fans had not welcomed in the last episode. In short, the result is an even more complex and satisfying combat system: you don't need to know and know how to put all these possibilities into practice to play freely, but by playing online you immediately recognize the difference between those who have studied them in depth and those who have barely touch. Playstation 4 trophies Are you tempted by 36 bronze trophies, 8 silver, 3 gold and the final platinum trophy? Then get ready to spit blood, because it won't be easy to grab them. You have to complete the arcade mode, follow the whole story, collect all the items in M.O.M. and make a lot of money, among other things. And we don't even name the missions and challenges... of the latter you will have to complete 300. Who needs Ibuki? The Guilty Gear Xrd: Sign roster is back in full force, including the fighters who had once been optional DLCs, but boasts seven additional fighters, to which will be added those who peep out in the Story mode and who probably Arc System Works will post for a fee. Among the new arrivals there are some well-known faces: Johnny, the captain of the Jellyfish pirates, is a character to be used at medium range with sword and... coins. Jam Kuradoberi dates back to Guilty Gear XX and remains the jaunty kung-fu expert she was then, a versatile, quick and aggressive fighter. The Immortal Raven instead comes from the old Guilty Gear 2: Overture and is able to inflict more damage based on what she receives. Also joining the cast is Dizzy, an old acquaintance from Guilty Gear XX who is now married to Ky Kiske. On the unreleased front, however, we have the creepy Jack-O' who plays a bit like in a real-time strategy, deploying his minions, and the absurd Kum Haehyun, a gigantic martial arts expert in whose body mechanic is actually hiding a very normal girl: she is able to chain several special moves in sequence. Some of these characters are available immediately, others are unlocked, still others are promotional or outgoing DLCs, but together they help improve last year's already excellent but perhaps a little contained roster. The same can be said of the modes for one or more players: they don't shine for originality, but they certainly don't leave anyone idle. The least exciting is perhaps the Story mode which continues the story of Sign with five episodes to watch as if they were those of an animated series, without the possibility of interaction: they are half compared to what was offered last year, but Arc System Works has promised that you can download new ones for free as the months go by. Those unfamiliar with Guilty Gear will struggle to understand what is happening in its wacky world, but luckily the developer has included a glossary that explains more or less the most confusing aspects of the plot. The ~arcade~ mode reinforces the story, offering a series of fights interspersed with dialogues and cinematics that delve into the characters and their relationships. In terms of raw gameplay, the challenges of increasing difficulty return and the RPG-like mode entitled M.O.M. in a revised and corrected version. Of course, there is also the multiplayer mode: Revelator also offers an abstruse interface that recalls a cross between a social network and a role-playing game and which even allows you to fish and play football while looking for a lobby or waiting your turn to fight . As we said last year, perhaps we would have preferred something more immediate and intuitive, but we feel like rewarding Arc System Works for its inventiveness.", "date": "2016-06-03", "grade": "8.8"}
