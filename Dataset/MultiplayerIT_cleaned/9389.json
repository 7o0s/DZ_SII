{"name": "Planet Zoo: Europe Pack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/planet-zoo-europe-pack-recensione-nuovi-contenuti-europa.html", "text": "Frontier Developments has a very precise policy when it comes to expanding its games: trying to launch DLC of all kinds, in order to tickle the imagination of as many buyers as possible. For this reason it never lacks news, giving players as much choice as possible. Of course, many look with little benevolence on the river of DLC that floods the titles, but it must be said that, regardless of everything, in this way constant long-term support is guaranteed which takes the form of the launch of large free patches, which they usually accompany that of new content. Planet Zoo: Europe Pack does not change one iota the strategy adopted so far by Braben and partners, as you will read in the course of the review. The new animals The lynx is one of the new animals The main novelty of the Europe Pack, in terms of content, are obviously the new animals: Alpine ibex, European lynx, fallow deer, badger and fire salamander. Four from habitat and one from exhibition, to use the terminology of the game. It should be emphasized that they were not among the most requested by the community. Nonetheless, they are among the best ever added. The guys at Frontier have done a really great job creating the animal models and animating them. Above all, they have integrated their behavior more with the objects of the habitat, creating really interesting situations. For example, the badger can be observed in its underground lair via a camera system, while the ibex hops naturally on the new rocks as it would in reality. The result is truly surprising and conveys a sense of completion that other DLCs have failed to give, while offering more requested animals. Of course, making them the protagonists of sandbox parks depends on your tastes, but the fact remains that they are among the best animals in the entire Planet Zoo, which is no small thing considering the average level reached by Frontier. The 1.8.0 update As always, along with a new DLC, Frontier has released a major update for Planet Zoo, 1.8.0, which introduces several new features for all owners of the game. The most important are the restaurants, i.e. the possibility of creating the refreshment places for visitors piece by piece, through a special section of the editor. Another important feature are the dens of the animals: now the European badger and the anteater can spend time in the shelters dug into the earth, which can be placed like any other object linked to their habitat. Finally, the animal memorial was added, with which the now deceased creatures of the park can be remembered, thus making them known to visitors. Besides that, the update introduces many new items and fixes some residual bugs. Timed Scenario and Items How about a nice alpine party, full of lights? It must be said that the new contents are not very many, as indeed were not those of the other DLCs. Once the animals and objects have been removed to customize the parks, only a new timed scenario is offered, obviously set in the Alps. As always, the player is called upon to take over the reins of a park that has already started, with elements that recall Italy, the France and Switzerland, and to solve their many problems within the given time, more or less depending on the selected difficulty level. In this case it is asked to introduce as many species as possible before the holidays arrive, so as to attract a greater number of visitors. Nothing insurmountable, especially if you know Planet Zoo well. In total, the whole experience lasts the usual hour or so, so don't expect to spend who knows how long. Much better to use the new resources with the sandbox mode, which allows you to indulge more and experience the aesthetics of a European park more deeply, thanks also to the great versatility of the added objects, much greater than those of the other DLCs. In particular, the objects related to the new animals, although essentially aesthetic, allow the park to be embellished in a more characteristic way, so as to be really pleasant. The rustic features are also very nice, such as some truly superb stone walls, a new bridge and other structures evidently the result of careful research by Frontier Developments. It's just a pity about the boat which, although well made, looks a bit like Porto Cervo, more than an alpine landscape. That said, Planet Zoo's Europe Pack turns out to be one of the best published so far because, despite not having particular elements of excellence that distinguish it, it offers a set of consistent and pleasant contents, which taken all together allow you to create parks really very beautiful. After all, that's not the goalor main of these small expansions? The Europe Pack does not differ much from the other expansion packs of Planet Zoo, neither conceptually nor in terms of quantity of content. It is certainly one of the best among those proposed, but basically what we wrote for the previous ones also applies here: if you like the proposed scenario and if you like the new animals, then don't think too much about it and buy the package. Otherwise it's just another addition you can pass over, waiting for something to resonate with your park-building soul. Tanto does not introduce any real novelty in the gameplay.", "date": "2021-12-16", "grade": null}
