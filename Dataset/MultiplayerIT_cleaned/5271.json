He has read about it and the promises behind this production were high-sounding: an MMO set in the world of Warhammer with the Tyranids attacking the territories owned by the players. The latter would have had to organize themselves, they would have had to buy equipment by sharing resources and they would have had to structure themselves in guilds to survive. The conditional is a must, because of so many wonderful ideas there is practically nothing left in the finished game. Currently Eternal Crusade can be defined as a normal arena shooter in which four factions, Space Marines, Orks, Space Marines of Chaos and Eldar give each other a good fight on more or less large maps depending on the chosen mode (Total battle for 50-60 players, Skirmish for 30.40), in which control points must be defended or conquered. In reality, there are Tyranids: just select the Lair mode, i.e. a cooperation between five players who must carry out various missions together. Too bad it's little played and runs out of interest after a couple of games (it's evident that it's a piece of something bigger that hasn't been completed). What about the MMO? Vanished. But let's go back to our player who has just spent his fifty euros to enter the game and, like a good boy scout, begins to create his completely personalized character... ah, right? To customize it, do you have to spend either game currency or premium currency that can be purchased with other real money? Just think, he spent fifty euros and immediately finds himself fighting with a free-to-play style shop. But he's still optimistic (we'll come back to the shop later) and decides to start playing with the standard classes. After all, think, I don't need to customize my character since I haven't tried to play it yet. After the tutorial (a special map with messages explaining the various game mechanics), he finally enters a game... and is literally slaughtered. When faced with an armored Space Marine, his Ork's machine gun appears to shoot paper balls. Whole bursts hit, but they seem to have had very few effects. One, two, three dead. What happens? Are there any cheaters on the server? No, these are people who have been playing the Early Access version for months and have equipment that you dream of, dear new player. Plus they have loads of unlocked skills, and you dream of those too. Until you manage to buy yourself some prized money, you will be cannon fodder. We reviewed Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade and didn't like it very much Pay yet? Our friend is incredulous. He keeps playing, but game after game he is more and more discouraged. By now he has also learned all the mechanics: he knows how to use his ogre perfectly, he knows its limits and weapons. A few kills arrive, but the gap with respect to the others is always very high. Skill matters little, it's clear: the characters in Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade aren't very fast (apart from some special maneuvers), but hitting them isn't the problem. In direct battles, a well-equipped character will always win against an ill-equipped one. Unfortunately there are not even servers divided by levels and therefore you are always at a disadvantage. Our player is very down in the dumps. The only ones who are at his level are the other rookies, who also have the standard equipment. There are two options: continue like this, eventually buying something decent for the character, or spend real money on customization. And here our in-game shop returns: to customize a character you have to spend between thirty and forty euros on average. The developers initially said that the only items that could be purchased with real money would be cosmetic ones, but that didn't happen. Currently there are unique items, even very powerful ones, that cannot be purchased with in-game currency. So are we faced with a pay-to-win? No, it would be better to say a re-pay-to-win, since as already mentioned it costs fifty euros. Sure, there are skills that help mitigate the feeling of imbalance a bit, but we're always there: if the servers fill up with old and new players, the latter will inevitably be the sacrificial victims of the former (each faction has its own tree of skills where to spend the points acquired by leveling up). It's bad to talk about a game in those terms, but you have to deal with these problems if you want to understand why Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade is currently such a big failure. Our aforementioned player will in fact have to dedicate alot of time, or spend other money, to be able to become competitive. In all of this, direct experience on the battlefield will play a very marginal role, because it will help him little or nothing until he has the right tools. There is confusion, it will be because I love you And here we come to another crucial point to deal with: the gameplay of Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade is still immature. Too immature. The four classes are unbalanced, with major problems deriving from their asymmetry, evidently not resolved with the patches of recent months. Between blinding shots, automatic cannons, very powerful long-range weapons, reckless cures and so on and so forth, it always seems to be playing the same game. Each faction has its own winning tactics, which make it almost pointless to try other avenues. Those eager to experiment will not be able to do it very easily, partly because chaos reigns supreme, and partly because the combat system is obviously designed for a different type of game. The end result is that what could have been the definitive game dedicated to the world of Warhammer really came to a bad end and at present is considered more of an alpha version than a full title. The technical side doesn't even think about helping. Of course, the models are very well done and have great animations. Even the maps, although not many, make the atmospheres of the Games Workshop universe well. Too bad, however, for the conspicuous drops in fluidity, with the frames per second that collapse dramatically for no real reason. In short, even looking at Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade from a technical point of view, one realizes that it is an unfinished title and that it still needs refinement and optimization.", "date": "2016-09-28", "grade": "4.0"}
