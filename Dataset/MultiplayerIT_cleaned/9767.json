{"name": "Farming Simulator 22", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/farming-simulator-22-recensione.html", "text": "One of the great mysteries surrounding our industry is that of simulators: what do millions of players find in titles that limit themselves to reproducing real, often boring, activities as faithfully as possible? We are not talking about junk games, but about high-level simulations, which are now a consolidated reality on the video game market. One of the leaders of the genre is certainly the Farming Simulator series by Giants Games, the production at the center of the Farming Simulator 22 review. The basics Beekeeping is new to Farming Simulator 22 Farming Simulator 22 offers gameplay perfectly in line with its predecessors. The player is called upon to directly manage a farm, working the fields to sell the products on the market. Depending on the difficulty level selected, at the beginning you will have more or less money to spend on the purchase of vehicles or new fields to cultivate, as well as fences to raise animals, buildings, woods to cut to sell timber and of production points to process the raw material into commercial products. The three maps available, one inspired by rural America, one by France and the last by Germany, offer very different scenarios, which however all require the player basically the same things: optimize work in order to have more luxuriant crops and waste tending to zero. As in the previous chapters, it is possible to climb directly onto the vehicles to carry out the various jobs, or you can hire helpers to work for us. Let's say that this last option practically becomes an obligation when you own a lot of land and it starts to become a problem to follow everything directly, running from one part of the map to another to manage the various activities. It is true that there are no timers to overwhelm the player, who can take as long as he wants, but if you want to see progress, delegating is the best option. Novelty Raising animals remains a very good activity The novelties of Farming Simulator 22 compared to the previous chapters are not very many, at least in terms of gameplay. Speaking of new activities, we point out beekeeping, viticulture and the possibility of building greenhouses, which essentially translate into the need to learn to use new means of work. More relevant are the seasonal cycles, i.e. having to manage crops based on the season of the year, being no longer able to do what one wants when one wants, as happened previously, on pain of a bad harvest. In this the developers have given some depth to the management and consideration of time, although the fact that the seasons are advanced by the player (every time you go to sleep a month passes), makes it quite easy to adapt to the calendar . The seasonal cycles have had a big impact on the graphics, now much more varied than before. For example, vegetation now changes color depending on the month you are in. The graphics engine always seems to be the same, but there is no doubt that some aspects of the game now appear more refined and beautiful to look at. Seasons aside, even the maps have been treated more, with the aim of making them more alive. For example, local traffic is now more present and dynamic, even if it remains only a decoration, while the landscapes are more refined (especially in European maps). Another big news are the production chains, which go a bit to cover one of the most criticized aspects of the Farming Simulators, namely the excessive simplification of the economic system. In this chapter 22, instead of directly selling the harvest, small production chains have to be managed which lead to shops and supermarkets. So forget about selling grapes, but get ready to bottle the fruit of your labor to bring it directly to consumers. Of course, on paper we are dealing with a system capable of increasing the complexity of the economic simulation, but in reality this is not quite the case, given that it is limited to adding a few steps to the sales phase to obtain results very similar to those of before. The vehicles But what would a Faming Simulator be without a rich supply of agricultural vehicles to buy and use? From this point of view, the new edition of the game does not disappoint, in the sense that the presence of most of the means seen in past editions is confirmed, including tools, with some significant additions linked to new crops, such as the Braud 9070L grape harvester . Of course, there are also additions for traditional tasks, such as some multifunctional vehicles from the manufacturer CLASS or trucks from the manufacturer Mack for the USA scenario. Needless to say, all vehiclesthey are reproduced to perfection, to the point that it is a pleasure just to observe them and discover all their details and functions. In certain moments one almost feels like a collector. Plus, each has its own unique dashboard and features, although the goal is always the same: that they do their job well. That said, there is no doubt that much of the charm of Farming Simulator 22, like that of the previous chapters, lies precisely in these imposing beasts with which you spend your time harvesting, tilling, sowing, cleaning, transporting and carrying out all those necessary activities to the proper functioning of our farm. If we want, it is precisely to the vehicles that a large part of the novelties of the graphics engine are linked, aimed for the most part at making the feedback from working the fields more satisfactory. For example, the parallax occlusion mapping clearly improves the traces left by the vehicles as they pass over the earth, now much more three-dimensional and realistic, while the collections, in particular the harvests, have been enriched by well-made particle effects. Conclusions Farming Simulator 22 does not revolutionize, but it has more than a few interesting innovations What Farming Simulator 22 is not, and probably never aimed to be, is a game-changing chapter. Indeed, far from it. Those who have already played the old episodes will immediately find themselves at home, without even having to follow the lackluster tutorial. The only new concepts to learn are the seasonal cycles, for which it is enough to follow the crop calendar present in the information screens to be sure you are not wrong, and the production chains, the latter a replacement of the old direct sale which adds a little ' of realism but which on balance does not change the gameplay very much. Everything else has remained practically identical to the past. In truth, it doesn't even make too much sense to expect a Farming Simulator to be revolutionary, given that logically a similar title lives better on refinements than on epochal changes. Basically it works well as it is and it is difficult to think of radical changes that can transform it without distorting it. Unfortunately this also means that the game itself is perfect for anyone who is not tired of its formula, but at the same time it is not able to give great motivation to those who are fed up with performing the same actions for more than ten years now. part, given that the novelties present sell out soon. In short, it's a nice Farming Simulator, but it's the usual Farming Simulator.", "date": "2021-11-22", "grade": "8.0"}
