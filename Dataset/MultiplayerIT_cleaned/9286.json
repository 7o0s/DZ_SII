Gatling Gears shares the same universe as Greed Corp, a strategy released some time ago, but at the same time distances itself from it by embracing a genre more devoted to action and immediacy. On the wave of all too usual steampunk stereotypes we witness the epic of a rebel force, fighting against a tyrannical and parasitic army for the immoderate consumption of planetary resources. The preamble, however, puts us in the shoes of the bad guys, aboard a lethal armored mech, the Walker, with the very little onerous task of making a clean sweep of the enemies. The events along the campaign will change significantly, following the trite canvas of sin and redemption, but this is certainly not a criticism, as the narrative sector does not represent a crucial factor in evaluating a title like this. Gatling Gears is a canonical scrolling shooter, with twin-stick controls totally in line with the trend of the moment, as Geometry Wars has taught over the years. However, Vanguard has slightly mixed the cards, focusing heavily on the graphics engine, as well as an obvious nostalgic vein, let's see how. Isometric steampunk The main adventure unfolds through a long series of levels set in very different scenarios, but does not change the main purpose, which sees us engaged in destroying everything with the help of our trusty mech. The setting is that of a scrolling shooter with an isometric view, however the action is developed both horizontally and vertically, with reminiscences to the old Capcom Commando. Our bipedal armor is in fact capable of launching deadly grenades with the aid of an adjustable sight, in addition to the ideal missiles for larger enemies, while the infantry can be easily decimated using the standard machine gun. To all this are added special objects that can be recovered on the playing field, from the gold bars necessary for the purchase of upgrades, to the wrenches useful for treating our health. The same weapons can enjoy a momentary boost, which gives a very high firepower, but at the cost of a very small duration. The technical realization is of a high level, the graphics engine developed by Vanguard is able to celebrate the apotheosis of war with a significant impact. The scenario itself falls apart, devastated by earthquakes, explosions and so on, even if everything represents a purely scenic habit. The animations are also valuable, with the enemy infantry which, although represented in tiny dimensions, is hilarious and on more than one occasion recalls the legendary Cannon Fodder. At the price of a slight tearing present on the screen, the action of Gatling Gears flows fluidly and spectacularly by virtue of a technical sector far superior to the Live Arcade standards. Xbox 360 goals 200 points for a dozen objectives represents the loot proposed by Gatling Gears. Half of these can be achieved by completing the main campaign, but there is also an objective related to completing a level with the support of a friend. Considering the ease of the game, it won't take long to get the perfect score. And now get on the saddle of your Walker! Do you like to win easy In terms of pure playability, Gatling Gears is fun, on the other hand the formula is much more than tested, and the addition of some ideas taken from the old classics is certainly very welcome. However, after the first few hours a certain lack of finishing begins to emerge which does not ruin the experience but certainly makes it less transcendental than desirable. The game is far more than accessible, not to mention indulgent, due to certain too permissive choices. It is difficult to shake off the sense of omnipotence conferred by our mech, starting from the devastating paraphernalia (there is not even the smart bomb), but the real problem is represented by the lack of hostile power necessary to guarantee the challenge. The enemy projectiles are incredibly slow, so much so that our vehicle can even outrun them, generally there is a tendency to clean up even before the scrolling is finished waiting for a new wave. Even worse if we face it all in cooperatives with a friend of ours. The spectacular bosses present in the main campaign, very well done, deserve a separate mention, but the rest of the game struggles to keep the adrenaline high and falls victim to an excessively linear development. The bland art direction does notit helps, especially when it happens to confuse our Walker with enemies and possible allies, so much so that the developers have even inserted a command to highlight it! As already mentioned, there is the possibility of tackling everything in both local co-op and through the Live service, an option that allows you to overlook problems more easily, focusing on pure devastation in company.", "date": "2011-05-11", "grade": "7.0"}
