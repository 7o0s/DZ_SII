{"name": "The Sims 2:  tempo di ripartire!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-e-tempo-di-ripartire.html", "text": "Installation, why not talk about it? It's really hard to find a starting point. So why not start from the Maxis style, which is truly a quality mark and a guarantee for the consumer. And it is therefore from the installation that we will have to start because it exudes charm and style. Those geniuses of Maxis, in fact, have thought well of introducing a mini game (a quiz, to be exact) even in the installation phase. It is a pastime, a sort of Trivial Pursuit made in Flash, in which the player is asked to answer some questions about The Sims and to support some skill tests to while away the time. A little stroke of genius. After a few minutes (of installation), however, the time comes to deal with the real game. The scenarios She must have asked him out with her friends... The Sims 2 opens the curtain on a simple selection menu through which it is possible to choose the scenario. In fact there are several cities (three at the start) with certain characteristics, and a real story to follow. The first, Pleasantview is the classic average American town, populated largely by modest houses, where ordinary people of all races and ages lead a simple and comfortable life, the ideal place in which to raise their children and spend the last years of their life. The second city is Strangeville, located in the middle of the desert, it is a truly mysterious place; in fact, here the Sims have to contend with UFOs and aliens who have taken home among them (yes, you got it right, you will also have aliens as neighbors, with their characteristic greenish skin). A really busy place, controlled by strict military and mad scientists, really nice. Finally we find Veronaville, the city of love. In fact, like the Verona of Romeo and Juliet, chaos reigns here caused by difficult and sometimes impossible loves, opposed by rich and powerful families (and coincidentally called Capp and Monty... irony really is at home). Although these three scenarios are able to occupy any player for a long time, it is also possible to create cities from scratch through an editor or by obtaining maps from Sim City 4 saves, proving the fact that Maxis has long been aiming for a real connection between Sim saga products. Maxis-branded continuity Hydroponic crops Once the scenario has been chosen, the player is projected into the city, through an enchanting overview of the place, immediate proof of the totally 3D choice that Maxis has prepared for this title, abandoning, after years of faithful service, the isometric view, now too narrow due to current availability of machines and graphics accelerators. In all respects, the map appears as a detailed zoom on one of the cities of Sim City, and we catch it from the shape of the roads, and from the appearance of the cars and the scenic elements. Having thus reached the choice of the family to play with, we realize how continuity with the previous title has been preserved, both from the point of view of the interface (certainly richer, but similar), and from the point of view of setting game. ... the choice not to distort the gameplay and the interfaces is definitely spot on ... Maxis-branded continuity In fact, the player is always given a budget to spend on the purchase of a new house, or an empty lot on which to build. We will still have new opportunities to repeat it, but the choice not to distort the gameplay and interfaces is decidedly spot on, as it allows the player who had already known The Sims to orient himself perfectly in a game that is totally new and in a certain sense revolutionary compared to its predecessor. At this point we get to the heart of the game: the player is faced with the opportunity to start a game using the families already available or creating a totally new one. The alter ego generator Fuss in the living room The Sim generator is one of the truly surprising aspects of The Sims 2. Thanks to a respectable graphics engine, the developers have decided to enrich the game with a very detailed editor for creating virtual alter egos. This is not a simple skin manager, but a real program within a program capable of reproducing any type of face. The player will be able to choose from a large number of standard facial features and modify them in detail until the desired face is obtained. In fact, through a series of scroll bars it will be possible to modify all the characteristics of the face with extreme precision. It is guaranteed that anyone who comes across this editor will spend a lot of time editing their Sims face until it is renderedsimilar to that of some friend or relative, with a little patience the result will certainly not disappoint. The Sim Generator is one of the truly amazing aspects of The Sims 2. Once the face modeling phase has been completed, the player must compose his own Sim's wardrobe, choosing from a wide range of accessories and clothes. Nothing is left to chance and not only everyday clothes must be carefully chosen, but an elegant dress for formal occasions, a night outfit, a set of underwear to show off exclusively within the home and a costume towels to be used in moments of relaxation, perhaps while sipping a drink by the edge of a luxurious swimming pool. Last, but not least, the character, which will form the basis of all behavior of the Sim during the game. Through the usual expedient of characteristic points, similar in concept to that of role-playing games, which can be summarized through the choice of a zodiac sign, the player is called to broadly define the characteristic aspects of the alter ego's nature. Finally, the choice of life aspiration is very important. The life of the Sims revolves around the goal to reach, or rather a pre-established goal that characterizes their ambitions, dreams and fears. These aspirations are divided into five macro-groups. Luck, or to become rich and powerful, thus allowing oneself all kinds of well-being and expensive madness. Knowledge, that is to say learning the greatest number of things through study and exercise, and perhaps aspiring to an important job as a scientist in some research laboratory. Family is the aspiration of the Sim who always tries to carve out a corner in their life to spend time with their loved ones and receive ever-changing affection from all members of the family. Romanticism is the aspiration of the Sim tombeur de femme, or the pure-blooded Latin lover, who aspires to hit as many hearts as possible and indulge in the most lustful attractions. Finally, popularity is the ambition of all those who want to be authentic heroes of the neighborhood, envied and admired by all acquaintances. The Sims 2 also focuses a lot on the aspect of family ties. In fact, through the aforementioned editor it is possible to manage a real family tree. Once the main characters have been created, it is necessary to establish the ties that unite them to outline the relationships within the family. At this point it is also possible to automatically generate children, the result of the ~genetic~ fusion of two family members. It should be understood that The Sims 2 (like its predecessor) is open to every conceivable form of conjunction between adults, which also includes adultery (perhaps even polygamy) and homosexuality, including marriage ties. So through the family tree tool it is possible to combine cooked and raw ones. The only limit is represented by the maximum number of components for a family, set at eight; but we guarantee that trying to control a greater number of Sims could prove to be a titanic undertaking. With the trowel in one hand and the brush in the other Having created your own ideal family, it is finally time to see your Sims at work. The choice, still conditioned by a tight budget, can fall on a house that has already been built and only to be furnished or on an empty lot in which to build the home of dreams starting from the foundations. The construction mode appears much more complex and detailed, there are new elements, such as the base for the house and the possibility of going far beyond the first floor, building dizzyingly tall (and sometimes absurd) buildings, or digging a basement and creating taverns below ground level. Once the house has been arranged, as far as its masonry structure is concerned, the time comes to furnish the family habitat following one's own taste, and perhaps that of the future inhabitant, who through the ~desire interface~, which we will discuss in depth further on, he also communicates his own tastes in terms of furniture. Also in this case, the wide range of choices immediately catches the eye. For each category of furniture pieces, a quantity of objects is shown that is far greater than that which could be found in the first The Sims (except for the expansions). A grouping system that suggests, without any secrets, the possibility of uploading objects downloaded from the web, shows a selection of furnishings even divided by collections and styles (art nouveau, modern, ethnic and so on). As already happened for the first The Sims, we bet that from the first day of release of this game the network will be invaded by real virtual stylists able to give a pinchor more of magic and originality to a title that already has these qualities to sell. Finally, note the presence of a couple of useful and extremely practical tools for furniture management such as the dropper through which it is possible to select a type of object or covering simply by selecting one already present in the building and the sample collection, through the which, whenever possible, the player can change (for a small fee) the color of the furniture. Daily life A plate of spaghetti & egrave; what it takes Entering the ~life~ mode it is possible to notice the great similarity with the previous title and at the same time immediately enjoy all the small and big news. For example, the object pointing system and the interface through which it is possible to interact with them has remained almost unchanged, yet the number of interactions with common objects has increased dramatically. But it is not possible to ignore one of the most innovative elements of this title, capable of revolutionizing, in our opinion, the interaction relationship between the player and his Sims: the aspiration management interface. As already mentioned, during the Sims creation phase the player is asked what kind of aspirations you want to give to the character. These aspirations will affect your Sim's desires and fears throughout their lives. To the classic needs indicator, widely known in The Sims. A new indicator, relating to mood, is added. The mood of the Sims is directly related to the degree to the fulfillment of wishes and being careful not to run into an event feared by the character. One of your Sim's first wishes will be to find a job, possibly compatible with their aspiration. For example, the ~Fortuna~ aspiration is linked to the desire to find work as an athlete; granting this kind of wishes, expressed by an explicit icon in the relative indicator, the character ...one of the most innovative elements of this title, capable of revolutionizing, in our opinion, the interaction relationship between the player and his Sims: the aspiration management interface. will earn points that will raise the level of mood. Once a certain threshold is reached, the indicator will change color, as will the title which at that moment describes the state of the Sim's aspiration. Having reached a considerably high level, the bar takes on a platinum color and the Sim enters a sort of immunity period in which, for example, needs are frozen and ignored, a sort of bonus to give the player a moment of respite and peace, which until then he will have been struggling to do everything to please the Sim. The mood points can then be spent to purchase special, and in a certain sense magical, very powerful and useful, but at the same time dangerous, items. For example, you can buy ~the money tree~; if taken care of consistently it will donate prosperous crops and loads of Simoleon (the classic currency of the Sim series), but a sudden drop in the owner's mood can lead to unpleasant and unpredictable consequences. When the aspiration bar unfortunately reaches the red level then the trouble begins and a very silly therapist rains from the sky with multicolored pocket helicopter soil to lift our spirits, an event that however entertaining it is always better to avoid for the state of mind and health of their Sims. Make friends Conversation helps build strong bonds with other family members Interpersonal relationships represent a very important part in the life of a Sim and have a marked influence on the progress of the needs of the characters. In The Sims 2 there are different ways to interact with other Sims and weave friendships, acquaintances and new loves. The means of communication, for example, provide help to Sims less inclined to a direct approach. For example, it is possible to maintain good relations through the telephone (cordless is also available) or through a chat via the Internet. But a face-to-face meeting far surpasses any technological gimmick. The streets of the city are crowded with passers-by (the inhabitants of the other houses in the neighborhood) who form a good basis for spreading the first acquaintances. These occasions are then linked to those that come from work (in fact it is possible to take a colleague home to get to know him better), or from friends of friends who gradually insert themselves into the life of the character. However, the domestic walls are not the only ones able to offer inspiration for the birth of new friendships and for meeting new people. The city map always has some meeting place, such as a park or shopping mall, where you can go", "date": "2004-09-17", "grade": null}
