{"name": "SBK-07 - Superbike World Championship - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sbk-07-superbike-world-championship-recensione.html", "text": "First impact We had the opportunity to check the progress in the development of this SBK-07, which right from the start presented itself as a ~young~ product, with a rock soundtrack and a string of photos of the so-called ~umbrella girls~ as a side dish. only to the main menu, but also and above all to the loading screens. This light-hearted atmosphere cannot be found in the animated introduction, however, in which the sequences are accompanied by a very evocative Gregorian chant, in a mix that promises something epochal in substance, at least a Gran Turismo on motorcycles. With the Polyphony product, SBK-07 perhaps shares the aspect relating to arcade / simulation controls, given that it is possible to adjust every aspect of driving: assisted braking, type of traction, gearbox and a whole series of elements that can transform the game into an ultra-realistic simulation as they can round off the corners to meet the tastes of those who love arcade racers. In the same way, the game modes refer to all aspects of a Superbike championship race, so it is possible to try your hand at a fast race, a practice session, a single race weekend (complete with a warm-up, free practice and qualifying sessions) or in an entire season, naturally selecting our team and driver from a real shortlist. Comparison games Anyone who has had the opportunity to try the aforementioned Super-bikes Riding Challenge knows well what Milestone is capable of: in that title, a wide selection of real bikes, from different categories, challenged each other on incredibly detailed urban tracks, which flowed really fast and fluid, creating a spectacular outline for a playful sector of great substance and quality. A masterpiece of the genre, in no uncertain terms, with which it is certainly difficult to compare. The comparison, however, in the case of SBK-07 is not only obvious, but also necessary: while interpreting motorcycle racing in a different way, the two products share the same development team and probably the intention was simply to add the officiality of SBK-07 to an already consolidated and valid technical-play structure like that of Riding Challenge. The final result is very different from what was hoped for, unfortunately, and the final version of Superbike World Championship for PS2 only confirms the doubts that arose when the product was still far from complete: technically subdued, rich in quantity but poor in substance . The game As mentioned, SBK-07 gives us the opportunity to try our hand at a fast race or in any case in a fraction of what a Superbike championship weekend is, or to experience the adventure in its entirety, without missing out on anything. In this sense, once the team and driver have been selected, we will find ourselves analyzing one of the eleven tracks available, testing it several times before starting with the qualifying and warm-up sessions. It is a very rigid structure, purely simulative, where the playful aspect can be modified according to taste to be permissive rather than ruthless. Whatever settings we start with, there is one thing that won't change anyway: the management of collisions between our bike and that of our opponents. Whether you've chosen an arcade or simulation approach, crashing into another competitor will result in a crash 99% of the time, even at low speeds, regardless of the angle of the impact. It is an element that falls within the normality of motorcycle racing games, mind you, and it was also present in Super-bikes Riding Challenge and you had to deal with it, but in SBK-07 it seems that it was handled a little worse and so the first thing you need to do is train yourself to avoid these eventualities even before studying the circuits. A similar argument can be made on the setting of the curves, quite tricky, and in general on the controls, which seem less ready and ~stable~ than in Riding Challenge. This is evident above all using a couple of very particular views, which keep the shot centered while the bike leans to the right or left to set the curves: playing that way really requires a lot of experience, and you'll end up preferring the more classic view from behind the pilot or, at most, the standard first person view. Technical realization Analyzing the graphics of SBK-07, we are faced with a well-made title, even without acute details. In short, on average for PS2 racers, which include both spectacular masterpieces and very snappy examples of how not to make a racing game. Unfortunately, even in this sense it is the comparison with Super-bikes Riding Challenge that is incredible: Milestone's ~unofficial~ title has set new standards for the genre thanksie its incredible audiovisual quality, combining a great level of detail with an extraordinary fluidity. The graphics engine of SBK-07 cannot be the same, as it struggles to keep the frame rate stable (which never reaches the levels of sufficiency) despite the scenarios being absolutely poor in both details and background elements, interpreting reality of the official circuits in the saddest and most bare way. Even the polygonal models of the motorcycles have some defects, in this case the graphic rendering of the wheels, which is very unrealistic. The average is further lowered if we take into account the really long loading times, which often occur and break up the experience excessively. The sound sector is more successful overall, between good quality music and a series of quite realistic sound effects. Comment SBK-07  Superbike World Championship is a little more than sufficient product, which perhaps has its greatest attraction in the official Superbike license. The developers have tried to add depth to the gameplay through an infinite series of parameters that can make the game arcade or simulation, but then got lost in a glass of water for what are gross defects in collisions and vehicle driving. On a technical level, then, there is nothing to rejoice in between low frame rates and bare locations. If you passionately follow the Superbike championship and expect a licensed title, then you can consider purchasing SBK-07. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a good motorcycle racing game, fall back with your eyes closed on Super-bikes Riding Challenge, which still remains a reference point for the genre. Pros: Official Superbike license Very detailed race reproduction Adjustable gameplay Cons: Subdued graphics Sometimes problematic bike control Collisions to be reviewed Milestone, the reference developer for the ~Italian school~, has specialized in racers with particular attention to two-wheelers. After creating that masterpiece of technical solutions and playability that is Super-bikes Riding Challenge, it seems he intends to add nothing less than the official Superbike license to the package, and thus SBK-07  Superbike World Championship for PlayStation2 was born.", "date": "2007-06-08", "grade": null}
