As the years went by, however, things changed when the title actually arrived on the GameCube. The often immoderate action of the fourth installment of the famous Capcom series has not captivated everyone but playability, design and technical sector have convinced millions of players to buy it and things have gone on between conversions, high definition remasters and now with a real own remake for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. The latter version is the protagonist of our review of Resident Evil 4 for PC, mainly focused on its technical aspects. In fact, we have already talked in detail about history, gameplay and structural innovations in the console review written by Aligi Comandini. Here, however, we focus on the graphic options of the PC version, on the frame rate and, more generally, on the quality of the experience with a very high-end PC, albeit not of the latest generation. But the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti of the Lenovo Legion T7 desktop that we received on the occasion of this review, is not too far in raw power from an RTX 4070 Ti and therefore gives us the opportunity to see how it runs on a high-end solution, but not top of the range a title that in this re-edition has radically transformed from a technical point of view, also showing off reflections in ray tracing. The remake of an unexpected cult The quality of Resident Evil 4 is also evident in the cutscenes which can be set in 4K resolution With the arrival of Resident Evil 4 in 2005, it wasn't just the pace of play that changed in the Capcom series. The asphalt of Raccoon City has given way to rural El Pueblo, a small town full of secrets, coves, huts, clearings and caves, all for the first time entirely in three dimensions. And here a view behind the protagonist has become possible, the backbone of the gameplay of a three-dimensional action game that is much more agitated than its predecessors, albeit faithful to the series in terms of imprint, progress and spirit. But the hordes of enemies, the abundant resources, the melee and breakneck escapes have significantly changed the pace of the experience and this has sparked, at least initially, the complaints of the purists. The complaints that anticipated the release of Resident Evil 4, the latest signed by Shinji Mikami, then turned into prophecies with the next chapter, extremely fun as an action game yet for many too far from the original spirit of the series. But there is no doubt that the fourth episode has had a great influence on the evolution of the survival horror genre, imprinting itself in the memory of the players also thanks to a masterful design work and further enhanced by an excellent technical sector for the time. When it comes to technology, time is relentless and its merciless flow has been seen with a fairly disappointing HD Remaster, and it is for this reason that we have looked at the remake with great optimism since its announcement. A title rebuilt, revised and improved in every aspect in the wake of what Capcom did with the first two chapters of the series. The restructuring of Resident Evil 4 also passes through the animations and modeling of the environment Based on the versatile RE Engine, Resident Evil 4 has remained faithful to the original, a title in many ways already modern, but has gone through a radical transformation in the graphics, a work of refinement of the mechanics which includes the almost total elimination of the QTEs, a review of the story now more cohesive and mature, the introduction of new areas, the addition of new combat and the use of latest generation technologies such as ray tracing, the technique for the physical simulation of light and refraction which at the moment enjoys the greatest attention, albeit not always in a positive light. In fact, someone feared a hasty implementation and useful only to castrate performance, although it can obviously be deactivated. But the PC demo has already reassured us about the weight of the lighting, but scared us from another point of view. Capcom must have made a few too many mistakes with the Resident Evil 4 demo, spot on in terms of content but plagued by sudden crashes, the typical stuttering of many PC conversions of Japanese titles and even suboptimal support for mouse and keyboard. So let's start from here and we do it with good news: everything, at least on our configuration, works sufficiently in the final gamegood not to put any obstacles to what is a great gaming experience. The options for assigning keyboard commands, as well as those for fine-tuning aiming and sight sensitivity with the mouse, are all there and work flawlessly. The gory details of Resident Evil 4 at their best There is essentially nothing that keeps us from talking about the purely technical aspects of the PC version, in truth not too dissimilar from those for consoles. The difference, as usual, concerns the options that allow you to tweak almost every aspect of the graphics, with the welcome presence of comparative images that show the actual changes brought about by the various settings for the visual rendering of the game. Furthermore, it is possible to change the ray tracing settings and those of the FSR thanks to various settings. In fact, Capcom did not limit itself to implementing the FSR in version 2, the reference version waiting for the FSR 3, but it included the FSR 1, more limited from the point of view of visual quality but for this reason capable of returning higher performance. The PC version of Resident Evil 4 Remake The work done by Capcom on Resident Evil 4 is undoubtedly of a high standard On the latest generation consoles, the graphics options of Resident Evil 4 include some options including ray tracing and hair rendering quality, but they mainly revolve around the selection of two modes: the resolution that guarantees effective 4K and the performance that maintains i 60 FPS by slightly reducing the number of pixels on the screen. In the case of the Windows PC version of the Capcom title, on the other hand, we have a large number of options available to adapt the experience to our configuration or to our tastes. With all graphics settings maxed out, excluding the video memory budget set to 4GB, the performance of the PC version is impeccable, even if the difference compared to the console versions mainly concerns more defined textures and a slightly cleaner image. superior. For the rest, the glance is that of the resolution mode of the latest generation consoles even if on PC, as anticipated, it is clearly possible to put your hand to the options that include everything you would expect from a carefully made conversion. Not exactly typical of the Windows versions of oriental titles. Resident Evil 4's lake sequence is radically transformed with new graphics including volumetric waves Options include shadow quality, ambient occlusion, screen space reflections, skin transparency, effective render resolution, enable dynamic shadow cache, and a variety of other settings typical of a high-tech title. We are not at the levels of the latest generation heavyweights, especially as regards the quality of the water shaders, the plasticity of the facial animations and the models of some enemies, but we are still facing a complete transformation which from a technical point of view is superior to that of the two previous remakes and which in some cases, such as in the mines, offers glimpses of the highest level. The renovation is radical and includes detailed and believable buildings, complex and articulated structures, trees full of leaves, high-quality main models, lots of blood, realistic rock modeling, detailed landscapes, high draw distance, dynamic scenery elements, an avalanche of light sources embellished by the diffused shadows of the excellent FidelityFX CACAO ambient occlusion, convincing fog, refined use of the depth of field, interiors full of details and volumetric waves that radically transform the sequence of the lake. All with high-impact interlude sequences, with an incredible work on Leon's animations, with refined physics and with the realistic, dank and visceral style of the RE Engine that enhances the high quality of most of the textures. The lighting work on Resident Evil 4 is excellent Among the uncertainties of the technical sector we find instead unconvincing tufts of grass, some textures not up to the excellent ones of the wooden structures, some recycled assets, the annoyance of seeing the change in detail when you approach some environmental elements , some rare framerate drops and some sections of the map less well-maintained than others. Ray tracing and FSR Resident Evil 4's Screen Space reflections are high quality, and ray tracing adds detail and realism Furthermore, one of the most discussed and relevant technical innovations of recent years must be added to the above, even if its impact depends a lot on how it isand implemented and optimized. We are obviously talking about ray tracing, the physics-based lighting which, in Resident Evil 4 Remake is used for reflections and has an impact on the graphic rendering of the Capcom title in areas full of bodies of water and even more in the interiors of the castle by Salazar, where the marble floors return very realistic reflections of the objects on stage. However, these are specific situations for a technology that has an impact on performance, takes up a good portion of video memory and can be renounced in the face of a technical sector that enjoys excellent traditional reflections, lacking some details, but still exploited in a effective for reflecting walls and details in puddles and glossy floors. It should also be said that the impact of ray tracing on performance, as we will see, is not very high, but it can have a weight on the gaming experience with mid-range PCs. If, on the other hand, ray tracing is essential, despite having a relatively modest configuration, to lighten the workload it is possible to use FSR upscaling which, among other things, is available in both the FSR 2 version, which guarantees slightly better visual, both in the FSR 1 version which returns a less clean image, but offers a higher performance increase. Specifically, as can be seen from the comparison screenshot, the FSR 1 has a clear impact on definition even in quality mode, while the FSR 2 fares much better from this point of view. To be clear, on a 32-inch desktop screen, the fidelity of the image remains decidedly high. The latter is therefore the preferable setting and the one we used for testing our configuration. Performance We tested Resident Evil 4 Remake with an Intel Core i9-12900k equipped Lenovo Legion T7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 RAM More than satisfied with the aesthetic rendering of what is undoubtedly one of the best remakes out there, we can move on to the performance measured with our test configuration: a Lenovo Legion T7 desktop equipped with Intel Core i9-12900K and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. A decidedly powerful system that, pushed into performance mode, also allows you to play in 4K with ray tracing at maximum settings, with the exception of the texture memory budget set to 4 GB and anisotropic filtering in 8X mode, and without the need to activate the FSR. All this without the stuttering phenomena complained of by many players in the case of the demo and with over 60 FPS of average in 4K even in the middle of the village, where a large puddle calls into question ray tracing. But, as anticipated, the lighting technology has a relative impact on performance and is only felt significantly in 1080p resolution. In fact, in 1440p, disabling it earns a few frames and becomes almost insignificant in 4K. Good implementation, therefore, for a solid title that also gets along from an optimization point of view. This is net of a couple of crashes in windowed mode which proved to be unstable even on a second configuration equipped in a similar way. No problem, however, in full screen mode. With the FSR in Quality mode at 4K resolution, it takes a lot of zoom to notice the loss of quality on a 27-inch screen With the FSR in Quality mode at 1080p resolution the loss of quality is immediately apparent For our tests we also carried out a battery of tests with the FSR 2 upscaling in quality mode and found a clearly visible loss of definition in 1080p. As evident from our comparison image, the image is blurry despite the Quality mode which among other things guarantees a limited gain. And it's partly the responsibility of the CPU that despite the power it is an obstacle with an effective rendering resolution of 720p. Hence a minimal gain that gets a little bigger at 1440p, with a native 960p rendering resolution and image quality that gets better but still looks slightly blurry. Net gain, however, in 4K, a resolution that allows the AMD upscaling algorithm to work better and guarantees optimal quality for the FSR 2 on our 27-inch panel. Looking closely, however, a little dirt remains and this can become a nuisance on large screens.", "date": "2023-03-23", "grade": "9.0"}
