This is the only way to summarize the protagonist of the review Divine Knockout (DKO). It's one of December's free games for users of Playstation Plus Essential (the cheapest tier of Sony's online play subscription) and we, despite an utterly soulless graphic style, think it's worth checking out thanks to a pleasantly chaotic and accessible combat system. Developed by Hi-Rez Studios, the authors of Smite and Paladins, Divine Knockout initially presents itself as a smoothie of things we have already seen but which, somehow, has not managed to bore us. 2022 was the year of platform fighters and if Multiversus still remains the prime suspect to dethrone Smash Bros DKO has decided to ride this wave in its own way by introducing a 3D environment and creating a game that looks like a MOBA that has been unlocked the camera. In this review of Divine Knockout we will analyze the divinities from all over the world who make up the cast of playable characters, the stages and the game modes of this fighiting game with a very weak identity but decidedly magnetic gameplay. A multifaceted identity The first impact with Divine Knockout is confusing but the idea of a third person platform fighter works Divine Knockout is first and foremost a platform fighter, a game where the goal is to throw your opponent off the map. Like the many progenitors of the genre, DKO also has a whole series of mechanics typical of this way of imagining fighting games. There are light attacks, heavy attacks, a dodge (on cooldown) and the double jump; each character also has 3 timed skills and an ultimate that loads faster when many hits are scored against the opponents. All these mechanics, however, the general public has always encountered in a two-dimensional universe, such as that of Super Smash Bros or the more recent Multiversus: it is the first time that a developer decides to embark on the task of transporting a platform fighter in three dimensions. The first impact with the three against three mode, especially for those who have played a lot of Smash Bros., is pure chaos. Skills keep piling up, the maps are full of traps that can throw you off the pitch, and if the matchmaking software malfunctions, it could start you off with a weird mode like coin-collecting. Once this first obstacle has been overcome, however, things start to make much more sense and the fun is felt because you will be the one to have the reins of that chaos in your hand, especially with some characters. DKO's deities Throwing opponents left and right with the Hercules ultimate is always fun in Divine Knockout The roster of characters currently available in DKO is limited to 10 deities, 8 playable immediately, 2 locked behind a (relatively) little grind or paying 5 euros each. To decide which one to start with, there is a star system that represents each fighter's difficulty although we found Athena, a three-star heroine, much easier to use than Thor, marked as one of the easiest characters in the game. DKO also encourages experimentation with a system of general levels (which unlock upgrades, cosmetics and a special currency to buy the deities you lack) and specific to the individual hero which, as in Multiversus, give access to passive upgrades with which to build your own configuration. For now, the designers have gone on the safe side with regard to the choice of deities to represent in the game, drawing inspiration from the Norse, Greek, Roman, Japanese pantheon and from the Arthurian cycle. Thus you will find in the same arena Thor, the Norse god of the sun Sol and the ice giant Ymir, against the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu, Izanami (the Japanese goddess of death) and Susanoo, the kami of storms. Or see King Arthur and Hercules challenge Athena and Thanatos (the personification of death in Greek myths) in a two-on-two battle. Unfortunately, some characters are much more successful than others such as Athena or Amaterasu, both very versatile and with a varied kit, while Sol does not have skills relevant enough to have an impact in battles. Ymir is very similar to a tank, thanks to his barrier that he can place to prevent being knocked out or to save an ally, while Hercules is at his best when in the center of the fray with an ultimate reminiscent of Winston's Primal Rage in Overwatch . Maps, modes and monetization At launch, two Divine Knockout heroesthey are stuck behind a light grind or a $5 each paywall The number of maps and game modes is also quite limited at launch. Each stage, however, has a unique mechanic to put the fighters in difficulty. There are falling boulders, rogue waves, demonic books and other traps, but over time you can use them to your advantage by throwing an opponent into them. The modes available, on the other hand, are the classic versus, in which the goal is to eliminate the opposing fighters, a zone mode in which whoever stays longer in a goal wins, oddball (in which whoever survives longer scores the most points with an object to contend with) and coin drop, where to achieve victory you have to collect and deposit the coins scattered around the map, even stealing them from your opponents. There are also two more competitive modes (2v2 and 1v1) where once eliminated there is no respawn and the team with one fighter left standing wins the round. As far as monetization is concerned, Divine Knockout uses the same economic model as many games featuring hero protagonists: over time (we still don't know how often) new deities will be added that can be unlocked immediately by buying them with real money or earned by playing for earn dedicated currency. There are also many skins and other cosmetic items, some obtainable only with real money, others that can be unlocked with in-game currency. DKO is available for PC, Xbox and Playstation where it is included, only in December, in the Essential subscription. Soulless graphics More often than not the graphics of Divine Knockout disappoint for lack of originality and inspiration We have left the major criticality of Divine Knockout for last: the graphics sector does not have an identity and does not have a soul. Probably the chibi style of DKO's deities has already conquered several fans but has not communicated anything to us. Very little of the identity, history or curiosities of the deities who inspired the characters is revealed by their representation or their voice acting. The maps, then, seem to be made with the prefabricated assets of Unreal Engine 4 and in their cartoonish graphics they are empty and devoid of any characterization. The graphic style is so bland and forgettable that some animations of the ultimate that should convey epicness and power do nothing but generate a very strong feeling of discomfort. The gameplay takes care of saving DKO and making us support everything we said at the beginning of the article. its dynamism, the introduction of the third person and the many possible combinations offers genuine fun. If you manage to get over the little imagination and creativity that make up the graphics of Divine Knockout, you will have in your hands an innovative title capable of giving several hours of pleasantly ramshackle and adrenaline-pumping fights.", "date": "2022-12-24", "grade": "6.5"}
