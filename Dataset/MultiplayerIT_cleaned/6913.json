Already on that occasion the intuitive and extremely simple gameplay of Valiant Hearts: The Great War had led us to hypothesize that a version specifically dedicated to touch devices could have been the best way to enjoy the game. And in fact, a few weeks after the release of the first edition, the French publisher has seen fit to announce and then distribute a handful of months later, a conversion of the game for iPhone and iPad capable of rivaling and in some cases exceeding the release original. Its rather basic gameplay which during the first review was criticized by the writer, could have become a real strength for this transposition according to the peculiarities of iOS both in terms of controls and users. However, and the use of the conditional just above is no coincidence, a certain lack of precision and refinement has made this conversion a little too rough and unable to express its full potential. But let's proceed in order before going into the details of the judgment. Valiant Hearts is a little gem even on iOS despite some issues related to the controls So the story went Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a modern graphic adventure enriched with various contextual puzzles and with some small action parts where the player's reflexes are put to the test (and sometimes even his patience). The plot is undoubtedly a strong point: set in the First World War, it intelligently uses true events to tell the lives of four characters and an affectionate rescue dog who will invariably meet and intersect until they reach a tragic tear-jerking epilogue. Such a particularly intense story full of real references could not shine properly without the splendid artistic research that represents the other key element of the entire production. The guys from Ubisoft Montpellier, using the UbiArt graphics engine, the same one behind Rayman Origins and Legends and the other little experiment Child of Light, have in fact managed to bring the ideal cross between a cartoon and a comic to the screen: splendid drawings in movement, extremely rich in particulars and details, skilfully combined with a great job done on the music and sound effects. The result is an extremely evocative product, instantly recognizable and capable of involving the player in an instant in the tragic lives of Emile, Freddie, Anna and Karl. The gameplay, as written several times, is quite basic and takes place in small scenarios in which the character can only move horizontally for most of the time, as in a two-dimensional platform, but where there are stairs and various handholds to move even vertically and sometimes, with a clever trick, it is possible to explore the scenario in depth through doors and windows. Within each ~level~ we will have to solve some small puzzles in order to carry on the narrative. In the vast majority of cases, it is a question of collecting some objects to combine with the elements of the scenario to gain access to otherwise unreachable areas or to be able to unlock and therefore complete small environmental puzzles made up of levers and devices to be activated. Nothing transcendental or particularly complicated: most of our time will be spent moving left and right through the scenario to find and collect objects rather than racking our brains to figure out what to do. Everything is very intuitive and getting stuck is practically impossible. And even if we run out of ideas on what to do at any given moment, the hint system integrated into the game can give us a hand in an instant. Next to the latter we will also find the splendid encyclopedia composed of insights into the events that really happened during the First World War, including some small monographs on the objects and equipment that the men of the time used to use not only during battles. Precisely these elements represent the only collectible that we will be able to collect in the various levels by carefully studying what is shown on the screen. More could have been done And we come to the iPhone and iPad version of Valiant Hearts: The Great War, which is the subject of this review. First of all, it must be noted that the game is distributed in a rather particular way: the first episode is available for a feeor for 4.49, while the three subsequent chapters can be purchased individually for 3.59 or in a single solution for 7.99 (with a 25% discount). In practice, having the whole game costs 12.48 if you avoid getting entangled with individual in-app purchases, about 3 less than the PC and console version even if, we are sure, this choice to offer the game on the App Store at a fairly high price it will mislead several people convinced that they are faced with the complete game and then discover later that in reality it only contains the first of the four chapters that make up the story. Then there is a sore point that distinguishes the conversion work operated by Ubisoft Montpellier. Reconnecting to what was said at the beginning of the article, Valiant Hearts seems conceived from the outset to be played with touch controls but in reality, once you pick up an iPad or iPhone to try the title, you notice a certain woodiness of the controls and a lack of precision and cleanliness which in part weighs down especially the more action sequences and those in which you have to dig the ground (a characteristic of one of the four protagonists). Among other things, many of the interactions require more ~touches~ than one would expect given that it is often necessary to approach an object, click on the contextual icon and then perform the various dragging gestures. It probably would have been more intuitive and immediate to eliminate the touch on the icon. What remains is a gaming experience that is certainly pleasant but which could have been more refined and cleaned up. On the other hand, nothing to say about the technical aspect of the game which is absolutely in line with what has been seen on all other platforms and therefore worthy of being appreciated at its best for its artistic and visual quality.", "date": "2014-09-16", "grade": "8.0"}
