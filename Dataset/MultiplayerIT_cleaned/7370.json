The title by Holy Water Games was then followed by a whole series of more or less similar products which helped to propose a wide range of variations on the theme, ending up saturating a little this particular branch of the great family of puzzles: So let's see if the Feed Me Oil 2 here has what it takes to get noticed... I see black Considering how quickly the mobile market moves, the more than two years that have passed since the release of the first chapter could have made us predict a Feed Me Oil 2 heralding great changes and a particularly significant amount of content, but it's not like that: the playful mechanics are remained practically the same as the original, as well as the setting of the stages. Each level therefore has the same basic framework, with a tap that pours oil which must be led to the finish line using as few tools as possible: beyond the starting and arrival points of the black fluid, the main differences between the various schemes reside precisely in the number and type of objects that can be used to direct the flow of the liquid. Therefore, old acquaintances such as platforms, fans, cannons and so on make their return, combined in truth with a new taste of Feed Me Oil 2 for the variables related to atmospheric agents: during the four worlds included in the package, water, wind and ice forcefully enter the design of the stages, influencing the movements of the oil. To be honest, however, the physical routines devised by Holy Water Games ultimately prove to be more incisive on a purely aesthetic level than on a playful one: although very nice to see, the behavior of the fluid seems to be governed by not too coherent laws which sometimes they decide in an almost arbitrary way the success or failure of a project. At least we can console ourselves with a two-dimensional graphics that are considerably better than the - rather sloppy - one of the prequel, with very colorful scenarios always characterized by the presence of oil-hungry creatures, all represented as bizarre mixtures of elements taken from the natural world and mechanical components. Feed Me Oil 2 is an honest puzzle game but one that knows too much what has already been seen and does nothing to avoid it However, the inclusion of the atmospheric elements was not sufficient to guarantee Feed Me Oil 2 the necessary thrust to elevate its design beyond the boundaries set by its predecessor. We therefore play this second chapter accompanied by a heavy feeling of deja vu, basically finding ourselves performing the same actions already carried out in the prequel. A veil of laziness that is also reflected in a decidedly subdued level of challenge: already the 60 stages that make up the game are not many (although packages have already been announced with the next updates), if then a substantial part of them is ~wasted~ on tutorials and most of the others fail to constitute a particularly difficult challenge, it is evident that it does not take long to see the credits of Feed Me Oil 2. Unless you get bored first: Holy Water Games didn't try too hard to give bite to the action on the screen, accompanying it with a narcotic soundtrack and above all depriving it of the trappings that make a good impression on other products of the genre. There are therefore no alternative methods, contents to unlock or extras of any kind: the only digressions that Feed Me Oil 2 allows concern connectivity with Facebook and the possibility of buying aid packages with real money in case you find yourself stuck or unable to achieve the maximum rating of three stars on a given stage. In short, a task that is really too narrow for a sequel that seems totally devoid of ambition.", "date": "2014-01-08", "grade": "6.2"}
