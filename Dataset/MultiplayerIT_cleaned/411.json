{"name": "The Ant Bully", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-ant-bully.html", "text": "The punishment of bullies The protagonist of The Ant Bully is a naughty boy, whose favorite pastime is making life complicated for the ants that live in his garden. One day, however, they decide to punish him and so they make sure that he comes into contact with a magic lotion, capable of reducing his size until he becomes as big as one of the insects he hates so much... In his new form, the bully will have to atone for their own faults by doing a sort of training course for ants, in order to understand how insects live and how much effort they have to put in for every minimal conquest. The game taken from the film is based precisely on this incipit: the boy has assumed the size of an insect and has been welcomed into the realm of ants so that he can pass increasingly demanding tests of ability. The first steps will be governed by a tutorial that will familiarize us with the simple control system, after which we will be able to wander around the locations in search of missions to carry out. In the end, the game structure does not differ from finding new missions and accessing previously closed areas, in a predictable and repetitive mechanism, which leaves little to variety. You go on a mission There are several characters who can send you on a mission. In any case, the tasks you will perform will be quite simple: collect a certain number of objects (possibly to be positioned in a certain way), engage in combat and little else. Whatever the chosen application, the control system is far too simple (even the jump is automatic...) and you are left with an ~ethereal~ sense when you face some enemy: the fault of a non-perfect collision detection system and of a technical realization generally below current standards. Each completed mission will provide you with medals and possibly new skills, in a path that will see your alter ego ~grow~ up to the final stages of the adventure. The developers have tried to insert many interlude sequences to give a logical thread to the succession of events, and in the version we tested these sequences are spoken in English but they don't shine for the level of acting or for the realization: fortunately it is possible to skip them for go straight to the action. As mentioned above, The Ant Bully is a title technically below current PS2 standards. In fact, every aspect of the game exudes approximation: from the uncertain graphics engine to the animations of the characters, passing through the design of the levels (really meager) and the management of the fights, really bad. Where we should see locations full of colors and well detailed, we find wastelands, dull in shades and not very detailed, moreover with a very minimal level of interaction. The concept of ~limit~ comes to mind during the various phases of each game, perhaps when the management of the view shows its many weaknesses or when it is not clear whether a shot has been scored or not. And the music that comments on these sad thoughts doesn't have the power to make everything more cheerful. Comment The Ant Bully is the perfect example of what a tie-in shouldn't be like. Technically mediocre, devoid of any original idea and extremely boring. It would be easy to think of a product designed for a very young target, but in reality even less experienced gamers will realize that they are faced with a game that really leaves something to be desired. We sincerely hope that the film is different from the game based on it. Pros: Movie may be likable Cons: Technically inadequate Terribly boring Combat system lacks form and substance Cross-platform The Ant Bully is also available in PC and Gamecube versions, the differences are minimal in terms of graphics and controls, and therefore the low rating of the game does not change. The Ant Bully is the transposition of the new cartoon in computer graphics by Warner Bros., which comes out in American cinemas this summer and which presumably will arrive here in winter. From the trailers available it seems that the elements to make a good film are all there. And those to make a good tie-in?", "date": "2006-07-14", "grade": null}
