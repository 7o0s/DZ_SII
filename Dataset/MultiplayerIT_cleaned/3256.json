Available from March 10, 2023, DC Justice League: Cosmic Mayhem was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S (digital only in Italy) and Steam. We see all the details in our review of DC Justice League: Cosmic Mayhem. Three heroes Batman can throw batarangs, control bats, and more in DC Justice League Cosmic Mayhem DC Justice League: Cosmic Mayhem lets us control three heroes: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. Accompanying them will be various other more or less masked men of the Justice League, such as Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg and Green Lantern, who however will not be playable and will play the role of support. We're talking about a simple third-person action game with a top-down view, in which we can control one hero at a time, switching on the fly to take advantage of the various special reloading abilities. The gameplay is all about fighting, with simple fisticuffs where you just need to do some dodging from time to time. To make things a little more varied are the powers, three for each character in DC Justice League: Cosmic Mayhem. We will be able to throw batarangs, use laser sight, attract an enemy with the Lasso of Truth and more. Combat is as simple and accessible as it is repetitive. In the course of DC Justice League: Cosmic Chaos we will also unlock alternative powers, to be used in place of the basic ones, but the pace of the game does not change much. The problem is often that the missions stretch a little too much and we find ourselves having to repeat fights one after another in visually repetitive places. DC Justice League: Cosmic Chaos tries to make the fights as dynamic as possible using an elemental weakness system: enemies have a colored halo that indicates what they are weak to and each hero and each attack is associated with an element, between ice, fire , electricity and more. Adding the management of skills to recharge, one is pushed to switch from one character to another every few seconds. It's a good idea and helps a little, but on balance you don't do much else than hit the action key on repeat for most of the game. However, DC Justice League: Cosmic Chaos could be a little more interesting for children who have brothers / sisters or for a parent who wants a small colorful game to share with their children thanks to sofa cooperative (maximum two). There are also many difficulty levels, with the maximum one actually requiring a certain effort in the defensive phase. Furthermore, when you are in the open world, there is always an arrow that indicates where to go, excellent help for the little ones. Happy Harbour DC Justice League Cosmic Mayhem's city - Happy Harbor - is a colorful and cheerful little open world map The focus of the game is Happy Harbour, a city divided into neighborhoods that are distinguished by the level of enemies. You can explore freely in search of chests and collectibles, or comic book pages that can be exchanged for alternative costumes for our characters. For the rest, time is spent accumulating experience points: each level up gives us new skills and gives us materials (which are also obtained by defeating enemies), necessary to increase the skills of the heroes. In addition, there are various items to equip to enhance Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman even more: not that it is really necessary given the low average level of the difficulty. However, the city is only a not particularly interesting background for the plot, which sees a large part of the Justice League end up under the control of Starro The Conqueror, a starfish who has been helped by Mister Mxyzptlk. The latter, as usual, just wants to have some fun and proclaims himself mayor of Happy Harbor and unleashes some chaos. The plot is simple and always told with a comical edge: we are certainly not dealing with a complex and interesting plot, but we must remember that it must also be suitable for children, so it's fine. The three heroes of DC Justice League Cosmic Chaos have many costumes, to unlock Considering the type of game, the variety of enemies is good, including fish, crabs, strange corals, manta rays and various sea monstrosities that can fight close, far and even summon allies. Then there are also well-known villains from the DC world, such as Bizarro and Clayface, relegated to side missions. Finally, there are many references to other characters who do not appear in the game thanks to equipable itemsthem, which will allow true fans to show off their encyclopedic knowledge. We also point out that the game is completely in Italian, including good quality dubbing. Another great news for pre-school children, who will be able to follow the story without any problems. There are also some pleasant animated cutscenes at the most important points of the plot, which embellish the package.", "date": "2023-03-10", "grade": "7.5"}
