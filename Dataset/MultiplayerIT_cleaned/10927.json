{"name": "Zenses Ocean - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zenses-ocean-recensione.html", "text": "Zenses Ocean is proposed as the first of a series of games based on the main elements of nature. In this case, the chosen element is clearly water, which will be the stage for the whole gaming experience. More than a real game, in reality Zenses proposes itself as a propellant for relaxation, in full Zen style from which it takes its name and in the wake of the many more or less new age products which for some years have been enjoying some success also in the world of videogame entertainment, to which they have arrived after having been tested in the environments traditionally more congenial to it. The stated purpose of the product is to allow us to unplug as much as we want or can, even if only for a few minutes, from the chaos of modern life to actively relax. A dip in the ocean The game welcomes us with a marine menu with light colors, reflections of light on the surface of the water and shells resting serenely on the white sand at the bottom. Ambient music, serene and devoid of any frenzy, accompanies the delicate swaying of the still water. Everything contributes to generate peace, to invite us to relax our limbs and let ourselves be cradled by those same calm waters. The only thing that interrupts our transport is the choice of the language of the game, which we will have to choose only on our first access and which will then be memorized subsequently so as not to distract us from the atmospheres that want to be magnetic and which, in part, really manage to let some of the tension and stress of everyday life slip away. Once this is done, we will be able to directly access the game selection menu contained in the software, a collection of six puzzles to be faced at different levels of difficulty, which we chose when starting the game itself. In the course of navigating from one menu to another we continue to be accompanied by the persistent musical motif, which never stops and continues its infinite loop. The first of the games on the list, Zen-Stones introduces the collection. Inside, as with any other game, the first thing we access is a screen that presents the instructions of the game itself in the upper screen and the settings in the lower one, in which we can decide the intensity level of the puzzle mesh and the its consequent difficulty. Shells and air bubbles - everything floats down here Zen-Stones asks us to remove all the stones that will appear on the grid of the lower screen, by clicking two by two stones that bear the same symbol carved on their back and are adjacent, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. There will also be score multiplier stones, valid for overcoming our records once the picture is completed. The game ends, from frame to frame, when we find ourselves in a position of not being able to carry out other moves to eliminate the stones. In another of the games, Wave Breaker, we will find a sort of memory, in which to memorize the shells brought to the sand by the waves, to then identify those required the next time the wave passes. There is a game in which we will have to fill the empty shapes with shells of the same shape, one in which we will have to match parts of a luminous fish and another in which it will be necessary to align the turtles by flipping them on their stomachs or backs, keeping in mind that flipping them one causes the same action in the eight surrounding turtles. In short, classic puzzles reworked to always be easy and immediate to use and never to generate frustration. In fact, in no case is there a real game over and even a real goal to be achieved is absolutely lacking, if not that of passing from one puzzle to another over time, slavishly continuing to enjoy the relaxation you want instill and which certainly cannot be invalidated by the inability to solve a problem or the need to understand complex explanations or mechanics. Everything takes place in a linear way, through a few strokes of the stylus and little brain effort, just enough to make us feel active without getting tired. Comment Zenses Ocean, the first of a series set in the elements that make up the natural scenarios with the greatest emotional impact, is proposed as a product intended for all those who want to interrupt the routine of everyday life to carve out a corner of relaxation, for a few minutes or longer times, through the Nintendo DS. The game leads us to navigate through a series of puzzles of various kinds, always simple and immediate, accompanied by a fresh and relaxing atmosphere such as the lapping of the waves and the white sand. The music, which spreads out in an ambient loop continuo, helps to ensure that the final result is almost hypnotic and certainly reassuring. An ideal game for anyone who wants to bring the stress bar down below the guard levels, whether it's in a few minutes break from their chores or in the relaxation of their own home. Pros Really relaxing Immediate and never frustrating Against In the long run it can be boring Effective only for short sessions", "date": "2009-01-11", "grade": null}
