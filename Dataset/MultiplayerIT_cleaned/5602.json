From January to the end of March, several gems have already been released capable of proposing innovative ideas, peculiar and eccentric aesthetic visions or, simply, avant-garde points of view on already tested game mechanics. Think of The Witness, or SUPERHOT, or even Pony Island, without forgetting Firewatch, Oxenfree, Shardlight and Stardew Valley, just to name a few. The pixel art graphics made by Heart Machine are excellent Not that the games mentioned have anything in common with each other, but taken all together they are the concrete sign of an incredible vitality, vitality that also finds expression in Hyper Light Drifter, a highly anticipated top-down action role-playing game, style The Legend of Zelda, by Heart Machine, funded through a very successful Kickstarter campaign, which earned the small development team almost $650,000 in 2013. After some delay, the game has finally arrived in all its pixel art glory. The beginning of the adventure is unsettling. On the one hand we find ourselves admiring the painstaking work on the graphics, visible in every single screen and in every animation, on the other the introduction fills us with question marks, showing us something that has no explanation, at least if taken by itself. All we understand is that we find ourselves in a dying world, threatened by forces we cannot name. There is not a single text to introduce us to our mission. In reality we are not even told that we have a mission. We wake up in a house in a village we know nothing about, saved from certain death by a guy we don't know, after having terrible nightmares. We look around without seeing anything familiar. Fortunately with us there is a small mechanical creature, which obviously we are not told anything about, which helps us to explore the game world, positioning itself on areas of interest when we pass by. We will soon discover that it also has other functions, such as healing, but we will return to this point later. First we have to look around. We have reviewed the excellent indie Hyper Light Drifter: a little gem that you can't miss vagueness Despite being in a collapsing world, the village is still populated. Going around you will find shops and people to talk to. Don't worry, there are no words: the characters tell their stories through sequences of images. The bosses are really tough Exploration is the core of the game However we are not given missions or indications on what to do. No one seems to be interested in defeating anyone or achieving any particular goal, although there are guards on alert. Only on a small table do we find a diagram illustrating the functioning of the strange machine in the center of the village. We soon realize that we need to collect parts to reactivate it, but we don't know where they are or even why we should do it, if not to try to make sense of the protagonist's nightmares. It is an intriguing way of introducing to the action. Many consider it almost a mistake not to take the gamer by the hand to lead him into any virtual world, but Hyper Light Drifter, like The Witness and other titles, have amply demonstrated that it is possible to involve and explain even without giving strong narrative motivations and without providing a real tutorial. In both cases mentioned, it is the gameplay that introduces us to its mechanics, offering us very simple initial situations to overcome. When we start getting serious in the Heart Machine title, we are already perfectly aware that we have a sword, with which we can perform a combination of three moves; to be able to take quick shots, useful both in combat and in exploration; and to have a firearm, with which to kill enemies and press buttons. In short, we used the basic mechanics in situations of relative danger and compensated for the lack of explanations with intelligence, experience and practice. This, which we can call inductive insertion system in the game, is repeated several times during the adventure, in which initially unclear interactions are proposed to us, whose function is revealed in due course, inserted with mastery in the natural progression of the adventure . Fight before the apocalypse The world of Hyper Light Drifter is very much alive, despite the imminent apocalypse. From the village we can choose where to go with absolute freedom, exploring one of the four macro areas into which the game is divided. We are not told which is more dangerous, but, in case you are faced with insurmountable difficulties, it is always possible to go backand try another way. The supplied map always makes us understand where we are The characters tell their stories through images In reality, although there are some upgrades, which can be purchased in shops or obtainable in certain situations, the difficulty is always linked to the player's skills. For example, in combat some skills open up alternative strategies, but if you don't learn how to use them, having them or not is indifferent. On the contrary, in some situations they can become counterproductive. Let's talk about a specific case: it is possible to buy a sword upgrade that allows you to repel some bullets at the sender, but you only really benefit from it when you have perfectly introjected the combat system and understand how to exploit the new ability. It must be understood that repelling bullets is not enough, but we must also take into account the rhythm of the attacks, ours and those of our opponents, in order to become effective. If you think you can use it frantically as a sort of unsurpassed shield, i.e. pressing furiously on the key of the sword, you soon find yourself in the paradoxical situation of being penalized by your own enhancement, because the greater security lets through attacks that would otherwise dodged without major problems. The entire combat system is actually designed to revolve around the three aforementioned main characteristics of the protagonist. The first enemies encountered are very mild to eliminate and effectively introduce the system of attacks and dodges. However, the situation soon becomes complicated and when you are forced to fight with multiple enemies with different attack patterns, mastering the times and methods of attack and dodge is a must. It is true that there is always the possibility of healing oneself, having at least one medikit available (they can be found by exploring the scenarios), but doing it during a fight is more complicated than it seems, because the cure requires a moment of pause which can prove to be lethal when surrounded and panicked (happens often, especially in the beginning). Particularly difficult are the fights with the bosses, very resistant creatures with multiple attacks that can require enormous efforts to be shot down. What is certain is that if you don't study them properly and you don't understand how to avoid their attacks and when it's time to fight back, choosing the right gun, you won't last very long. Console versions In the Kickstarter update dedicated to the launch of the PC version of Hyper Light Drifter, Heart Machine confirmed the console versions, which will hopefully be available in the summer. Be confident. Artistic expertise Exploration deserves a separate treatment, because it is focused on the protagonist's shooting ability, which not only allows you to dodge the attacks of your opponents, but also to overcome small chasms or avoid traps that require the right timing. The protagonist does not have exactly peaceful dreams For example, in one situation you have to jump quickly between flammable grates, while in another you have to overcome platforms that disappear on contact (also used in some battles with nightmarish effects). Like the attacks, the shot is not continuous but provides moments of pause between one and the other. It is possible to buy an ability that allows you to make three shots in a row, pressing the button with the right rhythm, but in general it is not an automatic ability and, like the whole game, it must be mastered. Let's take the triple shot: on the third press of the button, if you are not careful about the direction given to the character, you risk ending up against some obstacle, with the result of finding yourself on the ground exposed to enemy retaliation. However, the greatest use of the shot is in the exploratory phase. The world of Hyper Light Drifter is full of secrets: hidden rooms, hidden recesses, hidden corridors and much more. To reach them you often have to use the sprint, paying close attention, because when you end up in an abyss you lose energy. Did we already tell you that Heart Machine is a really difficult title? Now you have all the elements to imagine the complete flow of the gameplay, made up of a lot of exploration: there are entire sections without enemies that only require you to look closely at the area you are in to solve small puzzles that allow you to continue; of fights that become more and more difficult and that end up resembling ballets; and a breathtaking graphic beauty. The scenarios are full of gigantic objects that refer to times long gone This last point will make more than one person turn up their noses, since Hyper Light Drifter apparently does not show anytechnical prowess. In reality this is not the case, because we are faced with one of the best pixel art ever, at least in the videogame field, detailed where it is needed, evocative when it must only suggest the object represented, but animated as it has rarely been seen elsewhere. To think that such painstaking work has been carried out pixel by pixel (so to speak, but this is the principle) makes you dizzy and won't leave you indifferent. To enrich everything we think of the perfect color choices, which make the single scenarios unique and never monotonous, with continuous surprises in the passages between interiors and exteriors, and the exceptional soundtrack, which deserves listening even on its own for how spot-on and perfectly blended with the gameplay, so as to seem a further descriptive element of the game atmosphere, rather than a separate component placed there just to accompany the action (as usually happens). In short, waiting for Hyper Light Drifter has earned us a small masterpiece, recommended to everyone except those who fear demanding challenges.", "date": "2016-04-05", "grade": "9.0"}
