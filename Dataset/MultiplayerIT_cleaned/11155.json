{"name": "TOEM", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toem-recensione.html", "text": "For some time now, part of the independent scene has been passionate about an alternative vision of videogames that makes concepts such as relaxation and narrative lightness central to the gameplay, introduced to counter the dominant forms of core videogame production, exasperated by the search for adrenaline and emotion easy at all costs. TOEM's review talks about one of those adventures that just need to be experienced, without being arrogant in their way of presenting themselves as different and without adolescent outline themes. Story and missions TOE extension The starting point of TOEM is very simple: the protagonist receives a camera as a gift with which he is asked to photograph the top of a mountain, apparently a place of infinite beauty. The journey he must undertake to reach it, set in a Scandinavia between the modern and the fantastic, will however be different from the usual, because he will have to travel by bus for which he will get tickets for free by helping the people of the places he will visit. Excluding the protagonist's house, where you spend a few minutes, and the top of the mountain, for the same reason, there are in total four main places to explore from top to bottom, divided into different sectors, going in search of missions to obtain and photographs to take. Yes, because in most cases to solve someone's problem ours will have to photograph a specific subject, often just suggested, looking for it in the maps. Each place has its own dedicated missions, even if there is no shortage of recursive ones, that is, present in every major place, such as those assigned by the photography club or those of a military group looking for a spy. There is also no shortage of objectives spread over multiple places, which require you to go back and forth to be achieved. For example, a character will ask us to photograph four monsters, one for each place that can be visited, all well hidden in the scenarios, while another character will ask us to help some of his ~colleagues~, scattered throughout the maps. The photography The camera menu is essential As already mentioned several times, the gameplay of TOEM is all about photography. Mostly on observing the world around us, in which photography becomes the tool for translating intuition into actual action. The control system is really simple: the character is framed in the third person and moves through three-dimensional environments created as if they were black and white illustrations in a children's book. The shot is zoomable at will, with the camera that is positioned to rotate around the protagonist, so as to always force you to examine the game world by keeping it as a pivot. This is a necessary solution due to the very nature of the gameplay: if the camera had been freer, we would have soon lost sight of our photographer, trivializing some missions very much. The places that can be visited are divided into sectors While exploring you can also find special objects, some purely cosmetic, while others are useful for solving some missions. For example, to see ghosts you need specific glasses, while to reach a particularly cold and windy area you need to wear very warm clothes. There are also objects that help to photograph, such as the tripod, perfect for photographing the shyest subjects, or the trumpet, which scares the animals and allows them to come out of their dens. Be that as it may, when you have found the subject to photograph, you just need to take out the camera, compose the shot and shoot, immediately adding the photo to your album. When we have photographed what we think is a useful subject to solve a mission, just go back to whoever assigned it to us and show him the photo. If successful, we will receive our coach stamp. Some items are just cosmetic, others are very useful TOEM is a calm and lovable game, in which you wander for a few hours in environments populated by imaginative characters, such as a very shy hippopotamus girl or a family of balloons, just to name a couple, observing every nook and cranny in search of the decisive photo. It is precisely in this relaxation that its greatest strength lies. If you want to define it, it's a kind of photographic experience diluted into a video game: you reach unknown places, you look around you a lot and you only shoot when you're sure you'll be able to take a good picture. TOE extension Below there is really nothing else, if not the invitation to seek for ourselves a form of elementary and childish wonder, just as the protagonist tries to reach his mountain. TOEM flows light and merry like a breath of summer breeze, full as it is of song and merriment. You get to the end in a few hours, but you are strangely satisfied. It is a walk and as such it must be lived. The puzzles themselves are never too challenging, although in each location there are easier and more difficult ones. Let's say that with a little effort it is never impossible to understand what the other characters want and in any case there are always enough simple missions to allow practically anyone to advance in the game without major problems.", "date": "2021-09-13", "grade": "8.0"}
