At the command of a funny ~square~ character, our goal in the game is in fact to complete a set of paths avoiding traps and chasms, trying to maintain almost perfect precision and timing and memorizing the stages in every single detail, so as to being able to complete them after dozens and dozens of trials and errors. At each game over you start over, with the only consolation of seeing the percentage of progress in the scenario memorized, therefore motivated to try again and again and again. A formula, we said, which has been able to attract a large number of users and which led a few days ago to the publication on the App Store and Google Play of a new introductory version of the game, free although limited (at the moment) to only three courses: Geometry Dash Meltdown. Geometry Dash Meltdown is a small, very enjoyable concentrate of immediacy, design and challenge Try and try again Developing a gameplay capable of combining immediacy and challenge is not easy, much less being able to do it without getting too frustrating an experience: having successfully completed both of these tasks, the author of Geometry Dash Meltdown deserves at least a small monument. As mentioned, we are faced with a product that is very simple to play but really difficult to master, in which there is a path that runs automatically and which gradually offers different situations, whether it is a question of avoiding spikes or chasms, or trying with real variations on the theme in which our character momentarily acquires the ability to fly or transforms into a sort of magnetic wheel. A ~practice mode~ also allows you to tour the levels by taking advantage of multiple attempts and immediate replay of the action at each game over, building an additional substrate. The philosophy is in many ways the same as Flappy Bird, but in qualitative terms the two titles are light years apart. In fact, Geometry Dash Meltdown boasts three predetermined stages (to which others will be added in the future) and not generated at the moment, therefore a challenge that is not an end in itself and invites us to memorize the characteristics of each scenario to understand how and when to touch the screen to jump, accompanying everything with fluid and stylish graphics, as well as with a dubstep soundtrack whose rhythms are often connected to what is happening on the screen, so as to take on the characteristics of a rhythm game. The banner ads and trailers that play from time to time represent the price to pay for a de facto free game, which does not include any in-app purchases (tapping the ~full version~ icon takes you to the original Geometry Dash page) and which therefore arises as a mandatory download for those who want to try this peculiar experience.", "date": "2016-01-02", "grade": "8.0"}
