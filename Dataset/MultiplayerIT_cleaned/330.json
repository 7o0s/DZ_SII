{"name": "Gothic 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gothic-3-recensione.html", "text": "I love the smell of the scavenger in the morning The purists of the series have nothing to fear: Gothic 3, fortunately, faithfully reproduces the game mechanics born in the first episode and subsequently perfected in the second; you will therefore have total freedom of movement in an absolutely fantastic world, full of forests, trees, beaches, rivers and animals, more or less hostile and you will be free to follow the missions related to the main plot, or carry out those that the different cities, scattered throughout the kingdom, they will entrust you. As a classic in any self-respecting RPG, you'll have to worry about collecting experience points, by fighting or completing tasks, to evolve your character, teaching him new skills and improving his physical and mental attributes. A first significant novelty, introduced by Piranha Bytes, lies in the incredible increase in the skills made available to you: in addition to the classic ones relating to combat, classified according to the type of weapon (swords, heavy weapons, bows and crossbows), your character he will be able to learn all the most hidden secrets of hunting, such as the silent approach to the prey, or of stealth, learning how to eliminate an enemy in silence, or pickpocket a rich merchant. The slow ascent of the skill tree will require a considerable effort: gradually the passage of the level will become increasingly difficult, and you will have to choose carefully how to invest the character points you hard-earned. There is, theoretically speaking, a better choice than the other: investing in the creation of a strong warrior will come in handy in many warlike situations, but it will prove useless if you want to sneak silently into an enemy camp; fortunately, the developers have left open the possibility for the player to shape his character following his own personal style of play, offering an interesting range of possibilities. 3 Seasons in one game! Interactivity with the surrounding world is one of the main strengths of all the titles in the Gothic series: in order to further improve the gaming experience offered by this new chapter, the developers have well thought out to vary the world of game. 3 Seasons in one game! The entire Myrthana region will in fact be divided into 3 different climatic regions: a desert, a winter region and the classic temperate zone; the differences are not limited only to the type of texture applied to the ground, but each region can boast its own particular building style: for example, in the desert you will come across huts, tents and buildings vaguely in Arabic style, while in the cold North you will find more similar to the (coincidentally) northern ones, with stone and wood huts, abundantly covered with skins. Each climatic region will also have its own characteristic animals. Unfortunately, the different climatic regions absolutely do not affect the gameplay, perhaps forcing you to invent new strategies, but they help to restore a feeling of realism in an environment very similar to what our Middle Ages could have been. What's going on today? Gothic 3 offers something that no other RPG had ever dared to do: offer the player the complete sensation of being in a living, and not obviously virtual, world inhabited by creatures and human beings with their own typical habits and behaviours; although the idea is not original, cleverly conceived by the antagonist Oblivion, it was the Piranha Bytes that made it with more satisfactory results. The sensation of being in a real environment is given not only by the large quantity of flora and fauna that we will meet, starting from the smallest and most harmless hares, up to the most aggressive Slayers, but also by some routines associated with them: thus, during during your nocturnal walk, you may come across a wolf desperately looking for food, which will find itself attacking not the first animal that comes within range, but following a probable food chain, it will look for its most suitable prey. Your wonder will therefore be justified when, during a hunting trip, you will notice the arrival of a dangerous predator, only from the hasty flight of desperate prey, just as we imagine happens in reality. the sensation of being in a real environment is given not only by the large amount of flora and fauna that we will encounter, starting from the smallest and most harmless hares, up to the most aggressive Slayers... What's going on today? This expedient, despite being pleasant, turns out to be absolutely useless for practical purposes and lacks its underlying logic: one detCertain prey does not necessarily attract one or more corresponding predators: as a result, expect to find some unusual combinations as well, such as white-furred wolves in the middle of the desert, desperate for some snakes to eat. Beautiful, but full of moles Once we started our first game, we were absolutely amazed by the graphic quality of the game: our gaze was lost on a distant valley, made slightly blurry thanks to the Depth of Field effect, while the grass of the meadows was gently rocked by a light breeze , generating a delicate wave movement to the entire local flora. Although we had already been assigned our mission, we took a few hours to wander around the world, admiring the forests, the long beaches, the steep cliffs and, above all, the magnificent plains: each environment is characterized by a rich set of details and made in a really good way. The engine used by Piranha Bytes is absolutely valid, capable of managing even furious fights without excessive drops in the framerate, while simultaneously offering an excellent visual impact. The commitment placed by the developers in trying to offer a wide range of different models, characterized by small differences, which make the game environment decidedly more real, compared to the perfect clones of the first and second episode, is remarkable. The realization of the water is also excellent, a real frame killer for any GPU, which returns a convincing transparency effect, thanks also to the use of the latest shader version available. However Gothic 3 can't stand the comparison with its direct competitor (at least from an aesthetic point of view), Oblivion, due to a bad use of bump mapping and, especially, a lack of care placed in the realization of some elements, as in the case of the sand, where the repetition of the same texture is clearly noticeable, or in the representation of the animations: these, especially during the dialogues, are repeated cyclically, sometimes offering hilarious combinations. Although they represent minor errors, the decision to render the game environment with textures at different resolutions is much more serious: although mipmapping is widespread in all the most recent titles, Gothic 3 suffers from some problems and good latency in switching and loading from a low resolution texture to a higher one, sometimes causing sharp contrasts and notable graphic imperfections for the objects framed in our view. Oblivion then totals a further point of advantage if we come to talk about the physics that acts in the game world: in Gothic 3, despite the fact that there is a sketch of a physics engine, we are far from what Havok offered in Bethesda's masterpiece: the lack of an engine that manages the physical laws inevitably results in a series of continuous clipping errors (or interpenetration between polygons) and in the positions assumed by the ragdolls of the different models, especially those made up of several joints; crown it all with an annoying pop up effect, which will make you suddenly materialize objects, and the impression that the developers wanted, at all costs, to remove the loads in the world by making excessive compromises, will become more and more concrete. Gothic 3 is fully translated in texts and menus, while the speech continues to remain in English, as in previous episodes. Unfortunately the translation does not live up to expectations: some dialogues have been translated making big mistakes, not only of style, but of concept, which will make you waste time in solving various quests; other times instead, subtitles appear in languages other than the chosen one. Give it to the boar! However, despite the defects just described, Gothic 3 has one more card, something difficult to describe, but which could be summarized in the ~Civilization Syndrome~, that terrible disease that reduces your social life to zero and pushes you to continue playing , identifiable in a single word: charm. The world of Gothic, its characters, excellent storyline and total freedom of action help to save a title, otherwise rated as decent. You will therefore be led to complete the missions entrusted to you, to face them to see how your fight against, or in favor of, the Orcs continues, while in parallel you will try to unravel the skein of the main plot. The other great advantage of Gothic, typical of the series, but especially accentuated in this last chapter, is represented by the very high rate of distractions it offers: during your continuous walks from one city to another, it will happen to youcome across a group of bison intent on grazing, and it will be natural for you to draw your bow to get some meat (except then run fast and avoid the subsequent charge of the animals). Everything is born. All ends. If the graphics engine is abundantly promoted, despite the existence of some small neo, it leaves the artificial intelligence of the enemies absolutely shocked, where the developers wanted to offer an unwelcome return to the last century; forget any attempt to sketch an artificial intelligence in real time: the Piranha Bytes, evidently traditionalists, have preferred to rely solely on the good old dear scripts. However, the use of fully scripted AI per se would not be a downside if this were decently implemented, as demonstrated by titles such as Call of Duty; unfortunately, in Gothic 3, enemies will only follow two different behaviors: if equipped with a white weapon, they will simply charge you head-on, while if equipped with ranged weapons (such as bows, crossbows or magic), they will do nothing but stand absolutely still targeting you, waiting for you to get close enough to engage in a hand-to-hand fight, not even trying to move away an inch. if the graphics engine is promoted, despite the existence of some small neo, it leaves the artificial intelligence of the enemies absolutely shocked, where the developers wanted to offer an unwelcome return to the last century ... Everything is born. All ends. All fights, as a direct consequence, can be resolved simply by hoisting oneself into an elevated position and hitting the enemies below with a bow and arrow, who will remain passive to be killed. If you add to this a practically non-existent memory, which will allow you to eliminate a guard, escape and return to the scene of the crime as if nothing had happened, you will understand that something must have gone wrong, to leave within a game like Gothic 3, such a summarily sketched Artificial Intelligence. There are still some problems to report if you want to be followed by a comrade in arms: consider wasting time trying to be followed through a forest or a plain, because every fallen branch, every single stone and every steep descent it will be an obstacle for your partner, forcing you to look for a road as clear as possible, a particularly difficult undertaking considering a world like that of Gothic 3, full of plateaus, mountains and dense forests. Path-finding problems, combined with an absolutely immature artificial intelligence, are the main problems afflicting the latest Piranha Bytes title and, unfortunately, contribute to creating a frustrating situation for the player. Final comment Gothic 3 is a really difficult title to enclose in a precise vote, because all our games have been permeated by continuous mixed feelings: just as they began to delight us and make us involved in the world and its adventures, some annoying problems crop up and immediately after something new and exciting that rekindles our passion. However, we give it a rather high mark because the problems that afflict it are so many but they manage to go quietly; if you are a fan of role-playing games and are willing to forgive these shortcomings, without a doubt Gothic represents one of the best titles of this 2006, completely free and very engaging and above all in light of its tasty selling price; the hope also remains open that, in the future, the developers decide to release substantial patches (the first is already available) to solve the problems listed and, at that point, we will no longer have any qualms about elevating the title to a classic video game. Pro Engaging and full of things to do Total freedom of action Hunting the Scavenger is always fun! Great graphics Cons  but with some uncertainty Several annoying bugs AI in its primitive state Wow Spoiler! As soon as you get off your ship, together with your faithful travel companions met in the second episode, the scenario that appears before you is at least disconcerting: due to the interruption of supplies of magical ore (do you know anything about it?), the Paladins are were quickly overwhelmed by their green antagonists and, as a result, the entire human race was enslaved. You, as a famous nameless and fearless hero, at the sight of constant abuse, destruction and injustice, decide to intervene, unleashing a chaotic revolt.
