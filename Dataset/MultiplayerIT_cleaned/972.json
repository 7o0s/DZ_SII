{"name": "Wipeout Pure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wipeout-pure-2.html", "text": "Pure style As the title suggests, Wipeout Pure aims to set aside the highly questionable innovations made by the previous Fusion to return to the original structure of the franchise: therefore, the excessively wide tracks, the inappropriate emphasis placed on the shooter element and the uninspired design have been banned , all the aspects that made the Wipeout series important make a welcome return. Starting from the care placed in the look of packaging and menus, oriented to the glories of the PlayStation era: following the lines traced at the time by the brilliant Designers Republic, the developers of Studio Liverpool have been able to define an excellent techno-minimal style that characterizes the screens and the game interface. But more generally, it is the entire design of Wipeout Pure that convinces and wipes out bad memories related to Fusion. The 16 tracks included in the package indeed shine for their ability to combine formal beauty and structural variety, while the cars of the eight different teams present show off a captivating and decidedly personal look, proving to be immediately distinguishable from one another. All of this is enhanced by a cosmetic component that it is no exaggeration to define as the best seen so far on PSP: whizzing around the circuits of Wipeout Pure is a real feast for the eyes, thanks to the excellent cleaning of the image, the great richness of details of the backdrops and particle effects of excellent quality. The only small drawback is the frame rate, which does not reach 60 fps and is susceptible to some drops, but it is very little. Visually splendid, the Studio Liverpool title also faithfully follows the tradition of the series regarding the care placed in the audio sector, offering top-level effects and a screaming electronic soundtrack, composed of rhythmic and adrenaline-pumping songs. On a purely technical level, therefore, Wipeout Pure is a small jewel, capable of bewitching the player with an explosive audiovisual cocktail. And fortunately, the benefits of the SCEA product don't stop there. Swoosh! From a playful point of view, Wipeout Pure could be defined as a compendium of the best qualities expressed by the previous episodes, with the addition of some welcome novelties. The title offers the classic game modes (Single Race, Time Trial, Tournament) alongside which the two new entries consisting of the Zone and Multiplayer sections deserve mention. The first represents a sort of survival mode, with the user committed to having to pilot a particular ship whose maximum speed increases progressively at each checkpoint: the aim is to grind as many kilometers as possible before the shields are completely drained. As for the Multiplayer mode, the novelty lies in the fact that it is possible to challenge up to a maximum of 8 players via Wi-Fi. Everything works very well, although the structure of the lobbies is not exactly an example of clarity and practicality. As for the action on the real track, Wipeout Pure hits the target perfectly by offering solid, captivating and adrenaline-pumping gameplay. The already mentioned goodness of the track design enhances the player, happy user of straights, banked turns, jumps and tight curves that lead to a correct use of the airbrakes managed by the back buttons. Then there are the pads arranged on the road surface, useful for providing a temporary boost to your spacecraft or for giving the user the possibility of using one of the ten available weapons at random (mostly taken from previous episodes, with a couple of new features ). The car repair mechanism is also connected to the power up supply system in Wipeout Pure: the energy strips a la F-Zero gone, to restore the level of your shields it is now necessary to literally absorb the power-ups collected, sacrificing their use real. This is an element that adds dynamism to a title that is already tasty in itself frenetic, and above all fast. Precisely in this regard, Wipeout Pure offers five different speed classes, which can be progressively unlocked during the game: if the first two prove to be absolutely affordable, from the third onwards we really start to get serious, with increasingly aggressive opponents and ships gradually faster, capable of making the speedometer show frightening numbers. Wipeout Pure therefore presents a medium-high level of challenge, which works to the full advantage of game longevity, certainly more than good and enriched by a series of extras obtainable after obtaining gold medals. On the game menu there is also a Download section which bodes well for the future possibility of downloading new playful materials. Comment Wipeout Pure succeeds brilingantly with the intention of putting a series stained by the loud thud of the previous Fusion back on track, offering the user a gaming experience that has regained possession of its precise distinctive features and, above all, enriched by some tasty novelties. Although it cannot properly be defined as original, Wipeout Pure boasts the great merit of having been able to combine gameplay as solid as granite with an audiovisual creation of absolute excellence, undoubtedly the best seen on PSP so far. In short, those who have never appreciated the series will certainly not change their mind with this last title, but all the others should seriously consider buying the Studio Liverpool work. Pros: Excellent audiovisual sector Nice and satisfying gameplay Wise union between old and new elements Cons: Not exactly original Multiplayer mode that can be improved After an unfortunate passage on PS2 with the disappointing Wipeout Fusion, the famous series of futuristic racing games created back in 1995 by Psygnosis has ended up in a sort of limbo: the cold public and critical reception obtained by the aforementioned episode must have in fact convinced the Sony leaders to close the road to the hypothesis of a possible sequel, at least on the same platform. To confirm this fact, almost three years after the release of the unfortunate Fusion, Wipeout returns to the videogame scene, but this time on the PSP screen.", "date": "2005-04-08", "grade": null}
