We have already analyzed the different vision of the game by Sega on one side and PAM (later 2K Czech) on the other, one purely arcade and the other more devoted to simulation, characteristics that have allowed both games to share the public going to capture one the ~simple~ users, the other the sports enthusiasts in particular but it is a simplistic subdivision of the two concepts that has now lost much of its value, since above all the 2K series has changed and Top Spin 4 has decided to raise the bar and go and invade a large part of Sega's territory. The third chapter represented a good evolution of the series but not a perfect game in the full sense, in the sense that by further refining and specializing a particular and rather complex gameplay it resulted in a perfect product for the Top Spin enthusiast, much less for any other gamer, given the simulative but also cumbersome control system that could discourage those who intended to approach videogame tennis with a lighter spirit and who therefore often ended up choosing the Japanese immediacy of Virtua Tennis. Top Spin 4 smooths out the roughness of the control system by proposing a scalar and soft approach to game action, managing to find a satisfactory compromise between simulation and video game in the strict sense. The role of the tennis player Beyond the actual match, the surrounding elements that structure the single player game experience are now the standard ones of sports productions, with the possibility of creating and personalizing your own tennis player and then launching him in his career to conquer the first position in the world rankings, in case you don't want to use one of the many licensed stars in the cast. The editor is complete and structured in levels, so as to allow a quick construction of the character and leaving the more meticulous players the possibility of expanding the characterization through deeper, optional construction levels. Therefore, starting from the face, body and clothing (the latter can be updated several times by unlocking clothes and accessories by continuing in the game) one then arrives gradually at the deeper facets such as wrinkles, the modification of each feature of the face and the choice of animations related to nervousness or elation. In addition to the outward appearance, the personalization of the tennis player also includes his technical development through the modification of the values assigned to attributes such as speed, resistance, strength and ability in the various fundamental strokes between forehand, backhand, service and volley. The modification of the statistics takes place through an almost role-playing progression, which develops with the conquest and investment of experience points - which are collected during each game session in any mode - in the three main strategic attitudes, in turn linked to different statistics , represented by ~attack from the baseline~, ~defense from the baseline~, ~serve and volley~. These modify the tennis player's statistics and skills, allowing us to choose his tactical attitude and technical skills at will, thus personalizing the gaming experience and in particular giving a great depth to the single player mode, comparable to the complex careers present in other games sports like the EA series. To all this is added the advancement of the player from level to level, given by the progression of his parameters, up to a level cap of 20, which increases the possibilities of modification and identification with the virtual tennis player. A further level of tactical depth is then given by the possibility of associating the player with a coach to choose from a vast list (expandable as the game progresses), capable of applying certain bonuses and multipliers to certain techniques or types of hit. The coach also assigns various goals to be achieved (randomly even during matches, between games) egr get additional experience points. A busy calendar In addition to the simple exhibition, the Top Spin academy (the structured tutorial) and multiplayer, the main game mode to be implemented in single is the career, which is organized on the basis of a calendar full of monthly commitments. It's important to choose your events wisely because we can only run two per month, with the option to participate in training matches, special events or tournaments. The first is an exhibition match of progressive difficulty, the events range between many genres and essentially concern the tennis player's private life, from special training sessions to yoga sessions up to disco nights, all events that dispense a certain number of experience points, while tournaments represent the most important commitments with different matches to be faced on various fields and according to different rules, trying to get to the bottom of the competition. The ultimate goal of the career is obviously the achievement of the most prominent places in the tennis world scene, something to be achieved with victories on the field and the accumulation of large quantities of experience points to be transformed into exponential increases in the player's statistics. Winning is not enough, often it is also necessary to satisfy the wishes of the coaches to receive extra points, while the satisfaction of certain greater requests (number of victories, for example) determines the transition from one tennis circuit to another, going from amateur to professional stage . The result of all this is a constant and progressive effort that translates into a single player mode that represents a valid gaming experience, not a simple palliative in the absence of a human player to challenge as often happens in sports simulations, although it is clear how multiplayer continues to represent the real pivot on which the game can count in the long run. Top spin effect Longtime enthusiasts can rest assured: the desire to open Top Spin 4 to a greater slice of the public by making it easier to metabolize has not actually affected the simulation depth characteristic of the series. The timing in positioning the player and hitting the ball with the racket remains fundamental here, a procedure that requires a more complex calculation than usual of the action times but which has now certainly been made more accessible. The difference lies in the possibility of activating various indicators capable of providing information on the right moment in which to press and release the key used for the racket stroke, on the direction imparted and on the resistance of the tennis player, but it is a way for the player to adapt to the gameplay rather than the other way around. The front buttons are used for the various types of shot (flat, cut, lob and top spin) which, associated with the use of the backbones and the direction given, constitute further variations but it is the time taken to load the shot and the right moment for the release of the button to determine the most important variables to score, which forces you to calculate the movement times well and above all to always return to position immediately after having retaliated, however always keeping an eye on the player's resistance level which decreases with each intense exchange. It is a system that forces you to fully enter the game mechanisms, leading to reasoned exchanges full of competitive pathos, perhaps slower than what can happen in Virtua Tennis but undoubtedly more experienced by the player, while the possibility of activating the graphic aids represent a valid support to help metabolise the particular control system which, once mastered, will be able to give great satisfaction. Xbox 360 goals In Top Spin 4 there are 40 unlockable achievements for a total of 1000 points to assign to your gamertag, as per tradition. Given the nature of the game, the objectives are scattered and require particular performances from the player on the field, both during a single game and cumulative, i.e. achieving a certain number of results of a certain type. Several others are instead linked to career progression, in a certain sense easier to achieve by following the course of the game. In general, the undertaking is difficult but within the reach of those who intend to dedicate themselves seriously to Top Spin 4. The tennis show The impact of the graphics sector is truly impressive, both as regards the players and the various fields in which we find ourselves competing. The polygonal modeling of the tennis players is decidedly convincing as are the animations: we particularly note the care with which the most famous players have been reproduced, with tanto of custom animations. The coordination between the movement of the player, the racket and the ball is also excellent, all elements that make the re-presentation of digital tennis extremely realistic, together with the spectacular nature of the various courts characterized by a convincing public, a good representation of the atmospheric agents variables that translate into different lighting effects during the game and from the appropriate rendering of the various types of terrain on the pace of play. Remarkable, in this sense, the difference in sensation that immediately catches when passing from a field with a concrete base to a clay one, in terms of ball speed and ease of movement. As regards the players invented or built through editors, there is obviously a minor care in the results that place them on a different level compared to the faithful reproductions of the champions, with in particular the faces that suffer from the typical zombie expressiveness that often mars sports productions , but the effect is certainly superior to that of many other genre colleagues, also thanks to the indisputable technical advantage of having to represent only two players on the pitch at the same time. The only demerit notes to attach to a package that otherwise appears impeccable are a certain anonymity that characterizes the appearance of the game menus, where, moreover, it is necessary to spend a good amount of time, and a somewhat colorless musical accompaniment, but it is clearly of two marginal aspects with respect to the gaming experience.", "date": "2011-03-14", "grade": "9.0"}
