{"name": "Starlancer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/starlancer_a.html", "text": "Year 2160 In 2160 the space conquest is in full swing and a tremendous battle for control of the sector takes place near the rings of Saturn. Nothing strange, some will say, the rings of Saturn are the usual theater of space battles. No? Yes, but the amazing thing is that our opponents are the Soviets. But how? No bloodthirsty aliens or other sidereal monstrosities, but dear old Russians! It all begins when the Italian and French fleets are attacked by surprise near Mars (a sort of 22nd century Pearl Harbour). The survivors, together with some volunteers join the rest of the Fleet that makes up the Western Alliance (Japanese, Spanish, British, Germans and obviously Americans) in orbit near Titan. And here we enter the scene who are part of a squadron made up of volunteers and called the 45th Volunteers. If you pay attention, it's not the first time that a video game has drawn such a scenario (Battlezone and Tiberian Sun above all), but that it comes from Roberts impressed me a bit. What you have to understand and why you opted for such a choice, instead of repeating the old and fruitful arguments of the past. Year 2160 Want something new? I think it's a choice dictated by the gameplay and let's see why right away. In StarLancer we wanted to recreate the same feeling of a WWII flight simulator. In fact, the vehicles that we can use (there are 12 in all) are the transposition of the most well-known aircraft that were protagonists of the last conflict. For example, the Grendel is strikingly similar to the ME 110 and the Naginata to the Japanese Zero. The same feeling is reported on the Capital Ships and our flag ship is the Yamato (for the uninitiated, it was a Japanese super-battleship). Obviously, the combat also follows this philosophy and the clashes are much more similar to those that took place in the skies of Europe in the 1940s, than to those seen in the latest generation space simulators. Want to know if I liked the result? Get to the end and you'll find out. Graphics and sound The latest generation games are all very convincing, so it shouldn't come as a surprise to know that we are facing a top-level show with textures taking the lion's share. In any case, the Direct 3D engine does its duty very well, especially as regards the fluidity of the game, which has never shown signs of tiredness in the test machine. To be really picky, you notice the lack of 32-bit graphics and the Capital Ships are not exactly exceptional, such as those of FreeSpace 2. Graphics and sound Then there is a truly remarkable attention to detail. For example, when the Grendel uses its guns, the ejection of shells is clearly seen as well as the whirling of the multiple barrels. The torpedoes are very large and visible thanks also to the beautiful trail they leave behind. Worth mentioning are the explosions of the Capital Ships that occur sequentially. The sound is no different. The music is themed and communications between the various pilots are clear and effective. Unfortunately the game has not been localized in Italian, and this is a defect for those who don't fully understand the English language (there aren't even subtitles). Vice versa for those who have even a minimum of familiarity I can assure you that the dialogues, even in the midst of the bloodiest clashes, are very understandable. It should be emphasized that the characters speak with the accent of their country of origin. The kilometers of interlude films that have always characterized Roberts' games are missing. Let's understand each other, there are, but not at the level of previous productions, and as proof of this there are only two CDs in the package. Interface and control Take the classic interface of Wing Commander and update it in the graphics and here is what you will find in front of your eyes in this StarLancer. So, no news. The cut-scenes are very beautiful even if they can be disabled due to their repetitiveness. The arming and vehicle selection screen deserves a note of attention, simple to implement but excellently understandable. Speaking of armaments and vehicles, I want to open a quick parenthesis. As I have already told you Roberts has tried to recreate the clashes between the vehicles of the II World War in space, therefore the close-up clashes have been privileged over the long and medium range ones. This also implies a different type of armament, for example in competing games the famous dummy rockets weren't qalmost never used, given that precious space was taken away from much more performing intelligent weapons (such as the Fire and Forget missiles). Here it is quite the opposite and I must also say that it is extremely pleasant. You will find yourself loading a lot of rockets instead of a few missiles (which by the way are good for slower targets). Also for the choice of the fighter it is necessary to undertake weighted choices and not dictated by the famous law ~The bigger the better~. Many times it is better to focus on smaller and more manageable fighters than larger and more powerful ones. In short, the balance is one of the strengths of this game. I must also say that with the MS Sidewinder Force Feedback the game acquires a remarkable thickness. Single and Multiplayer There are 25 missions in all and they are very linear, as in the best traditions of the genre. As usual there are hunting missions, escorts, patrols and all the rest of the repertoire. Obviously, the classic twist that forces us to review the mission plans happens (almost always). Sometimes, not achieving a mission exposes us to criticism but it is possible to continue the game, other times not. I open a small trade union parenthesis. One is a poor fellow who has survived 1000 vicissitudes, he enlists in desperation in the Space Fleet without having the experience, but given the emergency situation one does not go too far. Now I wouldn't expect anything from such a driver! I don't expect it to work miracles; but instead in video games this is the norm. And if by chance you fail to destroy 30 Fighters commanded by satanassi and intercept 30 torpedoes targeting your Capital Ship (obviously alone) they send you to the martial court. Well, I think I'll set up the first video game pilots' union. Returning to more serious things, it must be said that the plot has the right thickness and can be fully enjoyed. To be honest it seems to participate in a naval campaign of World War II. I liked it. Single and Multiplayer Multiplayer has two great modes. One exceptional, the other normal. The first is the Cooperative one which allows you to play the SP missions in more than one and I must admit that this type of mode has always fascinated me. The second is the classic deathmatch (even in teams). It must be said that there are six variants of the latter mode, all very pleasant and interesting. Obviously you can play through the classic The Zone, like any good game published by Microsoft. Conclusions StarLancer belongs to those titles that can be played pleasantly for their immediacy and above all for a very successful gameplay. Personally I liked it, above all for the beauty of the clashes, which is what is asked of a game like this. Of course there are more complex and elaborate titles (such as the aforementioned FreeSpace 2), but which do not give the same feeling as Roberts' title. And then here we really feel the protagonists of the action. Introduction Do Erin and Chris Roberts tell you anything? Nooo? Shame! However, for the few who don't know it, they are the creators of one of the best-known video game sagas known as Wing Commander. Well if we are talking about them here it means that they have created a new video game. After the not too brilliant results obtained in the cinema (with the unsuccessful film adaptation of Wing Commander n.d.Pucci) they returned to their old love, only this time the production is not by Orgin but by ~mamma~ Microprose under the Digital Anvil brand. Well. What game is StarLancer? Are you annoyed if I tell you that it's the usual space simulator? However, Roberts deserves full confidence and let's analyze this title with great curiosity.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
