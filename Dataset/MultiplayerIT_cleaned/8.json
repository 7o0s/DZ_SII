{"name": "Tennis Open 2007 feat. LLeyton Hewitt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tennis-open-2007-feat-lleyton-hewitt.html", "text": "Like any self-respecting competition, this one too takes place on a common ground between the two products: in particular, Tennis Open 2007 offers a playful structure very similar to that of its illustrious predecessor, primarily with regard to the game modes. In addition to the classic Exhibition, Quick Match and Tutorial, the Gameloft title allows you to take on tournaments, engage in training sessions divided into various levels of difficulty and above all try your hand at the excellent Career mode. The latter, without too many worries, simply takes all the positive characteristics of the Virtua Tennis counterpart: after having created your own alter ego, you must therefore accompany it in its climb to the world ranking by facing and winning tournaments, without neglecting the training necessary to improve its characteristics . This is possible by completing particular skill tests relating to service, power, technique, movement and volley, each corresponding to a specific mini-game (target shooting to improve serving, collecting objects on the field to increase running speed and so on) . To say that Tennis Open 2007 was inspired by Virtua Tennis is almost an understatement, but all critical ambitions in this sense vanish in the face of the excellent quality level of Gameloft's work. Starting from the control system, intelligent, comfortable and effective at the same time. In essence, the telephone keypad is used to move the player in eight directions in order to bring him closer to the ball's arrival point: once this is done, a red indicator appears on the screen indicating the possibility of hitting, which must be done using the same buttons to direct the shot. Easier to learn than to explain, the game control system is completely complete, considering how you can also give more force to the shot by pressing the button longer, perform volleys with a double tap and produce a lob by hitting 0. The result of all that has just been described is an extremely enjoyable and immediate title, but at the same time profound and long-lived, thanks to a convincing and well-structured gameplay and a series of modes capable of entertaining for a long time. The proverbial icing on the cake is represented, in the case of Tennis Open 2007, by a truly excellent graphic sector with attention to all details. Different in this respect from Virtua Tennis, the Gameloft product offers a very colorful and detailed two-dimensional cosmetics, which finds its strong point in the excellent animations of the athletes: in addition to the fluidity of the normal game movements, the various gestures of the tennis players should also be noted in the event of a point scored or suffered, as well as their actions during the change of sides or at the end of the match. Looking at the nitpicking, only two flaws of Tennis Open 2007 can be identified, namely a slightly absent sound and the absence of real players apart from testimonial Hewitt. Very little for what is not difficult to define the best tennis game available on mobile phones. PRO Excellent graphics Deep and complete game structure Excellent control system AGAINST Sound a bit poor", "date": "2007-03-25", "grade": "S.V."}
