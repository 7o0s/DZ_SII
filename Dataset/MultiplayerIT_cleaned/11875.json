{"name": "The Eye of Judgment - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-eye-of-judgment-recensione.html", "text": "The evaluation of a title like The Eye of Judgment must necessarily open with a sort of disclaimer: non-card game lovers, those who want to use the PlayStation Eye only to do some fitness and, above all, who does not have a large group of friends ready to shell out money for collecting purposes or is not willing to play online multiplayer. If you don't fit into these three macro-categories we can proceed; TEoJ is an innovative and very original title that succeeds, with decided success, in pouring the tactics and strategy typical of a trading card game into a video game, embellishing the whole with a very engaging graphic and sound style which, we must say, in different moments it will make you think you are in the middle of an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh. Obviously in the best sense that this statement can have. Unpacking the package Conceptually, The Eye of Judgment is just that: a card game that freely collects from the various Yu-Gi-Oh, WoW: Trading Card Game, Pokemon but, above all from the progenitor, of the genre, Magic The Gathering and not at all Wizards of the Coast (the creator of Magic) collaborated with Sony on the development of the game, making the cards. TEoJ is sold in a bundle with the PlayStation Eye, the camera that was so successful on PlayStation 2 and which has undergone a decisive restyling to appear on PlayStation 3 including built-in speakers and microphone, a deck of basic cards and the fabric carpet that serves as a playing board. Just mount the camera on the special support contained in the package, spend a few minutes to calibrate it and place it on the mat and the game is practically ready. There are no manuals to read or complicated instructions on how the cards work: through a series of tutorials of increasing difficulty it will be quite simple to enter the game and better understand all the rules underlying The Eye of Judgment even if, as is the case for all card games, it is one thing to understand how they work, quite another to master the game. You will need a rather large number of games to easily defeat the computer and when you find yourself challenging a human opponent online for the first few times, it will be really difficult to follow the new rhythms of the game and put into practice all the strategies you have learned hard . There is in fact a huge gap between the much more relaxed style that is ~imposed~ in challenges against the computer compared to battles played in online multiplayer (or live against a friend) and it is precisely on this field that The Eye of Judgment offers the best of himself. In fact, here lurks a problem of the game: in single player TEoJ is decidedly poor and limits itself to offering a single battle against the computer or a sort of quick battle between two cards which limits itself to saying which of the two is stronger (the Judgment). That's all. No story mode, mini-games or other challenge options. What remains is, precisely, the online and obviously the configuration and registration system of your deck. But how does this Judgment work in the end? The game mat (a round of applause to Sony for the care with which it has made this square of fabric complete with very valuable artistic drawings and writings) is divided into 9 squares that can be occupied by a single creature card. These nine zones have a specific elemental theme on each face and can be moved or rotated with appropriate spell cards. These elements - fire, water, earth, forest and biolith - determine the summonable creatures (some can only be placed on certain elements, or die in the presence of others) and any bonuses/penalties to be applied to their hit points: for example if a creature is summoned on a square of its element immediately earns two hit points, if instead the square belongs to the opponent's element it loses as many. In each turn the player will have to draw a card from his deck, he will earn two mana points (cumulative between turns) and can then activate creatures that are already on the board (to make them fight or rotate them 90 degrees) or play spell cards. Once this phase is over, he will be able to summon a new creature (only one per turn) which will be forced to attack the neighbors that fall within his attack range. In fact, each creature has a specific cone of offense and defense and it is here that the question of the rotation of the creatures comes into play: some will, for example, be able to attack only those in the front square, others only two squares away in a straight line, or still others will be able to attack simultaneously on multiple sides. And the same goes for defense as a creatureattacked will only counterattack if the attacker is in a certain position. TEoJ is extremely tactical: as in a sort of new millennium chess, it will be essential to decide the precise positioning of each creature (since it will no longer be possible to move it during the game) and to rotate it adequately during the evolution of the battle. We can assure you that everything is much easier to play than to read and a long series of special abilities of the cards (in classic Magic style, such as haste or wall/fortress creatures) ensure that the viable game strategies tend endlessly. The game ends when one of the two players ends his turn with five creatures on the board. Fighting each other online Once you have created your own deck, which must strictly consist of thirty cards shown one at a time to the Eye, it will be possible to register it online on the game servers and, from that moment, start using it in multiplayer. And it is precisely on this front that the main controversy regarding The Eye has arisen: the recognition of cards by the Eye takes place through a simple code present on the top and bottom of each card. Since the cards are printed with normal ink and without any holographic protection, it is enough simply to photocopy a real one or print them from the library sites that are already appearing online to be able to use practically all the existing cards in the game. If on the one hand this literally brings down the collecting component of the game (and above all it will make Wizards of the Coast cry given the considerable influence of the story on the sale of decks and packets), on the other it does not undermine the mechanics in any way game of TEoJ. Indeed, if we really want to exaggerate, we can say that it tends to balance the composition of the decks and to really leave the composition of the decks in the hands of the player's creativity. Too often, in fact, the main complaint that is made to card games is that they cater to those who have the greatest monetary availability and can therefore buy the rarest cards. Once you have registered your deck online, you will then need to customize your account with a minimum of options and select a realm from among the four available. This choice will only serve to enter more into the narrative of the game (although, we stress it again, we were stunned by the total absence of a story, apart from the splendid CGI introduction and the ~literature~ written in the manual) and to participate to the realm ranking. Online it will then be possible to challenge other players through ranked or unranked matches in order to eventually climb the world rankings. Text and voice chat is perfectly supported, the latter also through the Eye itself and, during our tests, we did not experience lag or connection problems. Maybe just a little slow in the match creation phase. To eliminate any risk of cheating, the deck will be shuffled by the computer and, as if playing with cards face up, the console itself will say, in the draw phase, which card to draw. It will then be up to the player to actually look for it in his deck and take it into his hand. What you see and what you hear In purely technical terms The Eye of Judgment manages to have its say. Graphically, the title is extremely accurate: the virtual game board is full of animations starting from the element that makes up each square to get to the explosions of lights and colors typical of the major evocations. Very funny then the interaction that can be had with the creatures that can be ~beaten~ by moving one's hand under the camera or can be held on the palm. Of course, they are all actions that you will do at most a couple of times in the presence of some friends to amaze, but they represent the attention to detail that surrounds the entire production. The speech is a little different instead in the case of fights. When these occur, the board is set aside to make room for a battlefield where the creatures, in alternating turns and depending on their skills, hit each other once. Initially these clashes are very fascinating in their brevity but, after the first two, three games, you will find yourself disabling the battle animations because they are extremely repetitive and absolutely useless since the player cannot in any way intervene or influence the outcome of the fight . As for the audio, no particular note. In fact, if we exclude the boring and long tutorials, there is only the narrative voice that underlines the evocation of particular spells or the stages ofthe turn and speech of some creatures. The soundtrack is in heavy rock style without praise and without infamy: there is some interesting tune but soon you will find yourself mentally filtering it and forgetting about it. Comment It is really difficult to test and evaluate The Eye of Judgment. It is an extremely original and innovative product where the physical component of the cards manages to give a surplus to the style of play, mixing perfectly with the mechanics of a very classic but extremely engaging and addictive gameplay. Spending hours choosing the best cards to create the ultimate deck, experimenting with your creation online in a succession of games that are difficult to put down, refining the best tactic by offering a friend the ~reserve~ deck to play live against him, they are all experiences that decide the success of the game. But, and it must be absolutely emphasized, TEoJ is not a game for everyone. It costs an abundant 30 euros more than a ~classic~ game (but it's also true that you take the Eye home with you in the bundle), it is practically devoid of single player and mini-games and, above all, it is static like only games of cards they manage to be: if you can't stand seeing someone play Magic or you don't conceive of collecting cards, run away, otherwise it is very likely that this will be the title that will accompany you in the months to follow. Pros Engaging and balanced game mechanics Attention to graphic details The cards are physically well made and stimulate collecting Cons Virtually total absence of the single player Only in multiplayer it gives its best After all it is ~only~ a card game", "date": "2007-10-31", "grade": null}
