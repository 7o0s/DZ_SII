Cars like the Nissan Silvia, the Toyota Supra, the Honda S2000, the Nissan Skyline and the Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno, just to mention some of the most iconic models, have now entered the collective imagination of every lover of four wheels and racing games. invariably making any new title that does not present a selection of the aforementioned sports be accused of ~heresy~. Just think of the good Project CARS, criticized at the launch precisely because the garage included only the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X, subsequently accompanied by other racing cars from the Rising Sun with the long-awaited ~Japanese Car Pack~. Similarly to Slightly Mad Studios, the very Italian Kunos Simulazioni has also decided to embellish the Assetto Corsa fleet with a DLC dedicated to JDMs, carefully selected for the occasion by the community through a dedicated survey. We have put the seven new cars to the test (in twelve variants) and we can anticipate right now that for value for money we are faced with one of the best DLCs available for a racing game. For just 5 Euros, seven splendid cars in twelve variants in the Assetto Corsa Japanese Pack Tablet Before analyzing the racing cars in detail, it is necessary to spend a couple of lines on the Assetto Corsa update, which as per tradition has made progress in parallel with the release of additional content. The most important feature of build 1.6 is undoubtedly the pre-alpha support for the Oculus Rift CV1, a concrete step in the field of virtual reality which in the future will also embrace compatibility with the HTC Vive viewer. Among the most interesting innovations there are refinements on artificial intelligence, improvements in the collision system in multiplayer mode, new parameters of the physical / dynamic model and a whole series of fixes and introductions that enhance both the driving experience and the support to modding. Closing the parenthesis on the update, let's focus on the new car models, starting with the three most modern ones, namely the Mazda MX-5 (2015), the Mazda MX-5 Cup and the 2016 Nissan 370Z NISMO. The small Japanese roadster has no absolutely no introduction, as it is the fourth generation of the best-selling car in the world in its category. Also known as Miata and Eunos Roadster, the MX-5 featured in Assetto Corsa is the most powerful, equipped with a 160 horsepower 2.0-litre engine that allows it to reach a top speed of 214 kilometers per hour and break away from 0-100 km /h in 7.3 seconds. The numbers are absolutely not custom-built, however the driving pleasure offered is completely comparable to that of the real car, thanks to a balance in weight distribution and delightful handling. From an aesthetic point of view it is a perfect model, both in the interior and in the exterior, dirtied only by a pinch of aliasing and some imprecise shadows in the back. The sound of the engine is also excellent. The Special Event ~Between the Dunes~ on the Dutch circuit of Zandvoort has been prepared for this car. The roadster's racing sister, the MX-5 Cup, is certainly one of the funniest cars in the Italian simulator: given that it can be pushed to the limit without much effort, it is perfect for learning the curves of the tracks by heart. Lighter, stiffer and more agile than the road version, the Cup also differs in the presence of a full-bodied tubular frame to protect the rider, a digital display on the steering wheel and a more scratchy engine sound, accompanied by the inevitable squeaks due to the racing trim. The third and last car of this first group of modern JDMs is the Nissan 370Z NISMO, direct heir of the 350Z and descendant of the legendary Datsun 240Z of 1970. Equipped with a 3.7-litre DOHC V6 engine and 350 horsepower, the 370Z NISMO reaches a top speed of 250 km/h and does 0-100 km/h in five seconds. Powerful, fast and perfectly balanced, the sports car modified by Autech immediately leapt to the top of the preferences of Assetto Corsa players, despite not having the ~quid~ of other legendary models present in the package. The interiors are made with care thanks to the meticulous reproduction of the sophisticated cockpit, which alternates digital and analogue instrumentation, while the exteriors, although perfect in terms of proportions, have some flawson the side and rear shadows, especially under the spoiler. The roar of the engine is also scratchy. Timeless legends The Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno hatchback (1983) is one of the old JDMs most loved by enthusiasts, a real ~cult~ car, the protagonist of some Japanese films and translated into numerous racing games. Included in the fifth generation Corolla line (E80), the car has an unmistakable square silhouette, especially in the iconic black and white color sometimes accompanied by Japanese ideograms. Weighing just 925 kg and equipped with a 1.6-litre engine producing approximately 130 horsepower, the Sprinter Trueno reaches a top speed of 196 km/h and does 0-100 km/h in 9.2 seconds, unimpressive figures which however do not they limit the driving pleasure associated mainly with rear-wheel drive. The original spirit of the car is intact on Assetto Corsa, where it is extremely fun to drive while drifting especially on small and mixed circuits like Magione (it is no coincidence that the Slow but fun event is set on the Umbrian track). The drive is on the right and the brakes are not very efficient, while the polygonal model is simply superb, as is the sound of the engine. The AE86 is also available in the Drift variant, lighter and more powerful, and in the Tuned version, where the engine reaches 200 hp. Both the numerous liveries made available by the developers and the specific aesthetic characteristics of the Drift version are interesting, equipped with dedicated aerodynamic appendages (skirts and spoilers) and oversized tyres. From the small Toyota coup we move on to another JDM ~sacred monster~, the third series Mazda RX-7, made legendary by the line and the Wankel rotary engine. Beautiful and gritty, the RX-7 remained in production until 2002 and was replaced by the less successful but still appreciated RX-8. On Assetto Corsa it is present in the Spirit R (Type-A) variant, exclusive to the Japanese market and characterized by technical improvements and peculiar red Recaro seats which further reduced the weight. Equipped with a 276 horsepower engine, the RX-7 reaches a top speed of 256 km/h and does 0-100 in 5.3 seconds. This is very probably the best car in the package, not only for the excellent polygonal model, but above all for the irresistible driving pleasure, capable of accurately reproducing the refined dynamics of the real model. On Assetto Corsa it is also available in the 444 horsepower Tuned version, decidedly more nervous and complex to manage than its polite little sister. The Tuned differs in the Momo steering wheel, circular instrumentation with a black instead of white background, more refined aerodynamics and an increased turbo, which is also reflected in the more gritty sound. Perfect for drifting, it breaks down a bit too much out of the corners and suffers from the inevitable turbo lag, but it's still a lot of fun to drive. Produced until 2002 as the RX-7, the Toyota Supra (fourth generation) is another JDM that has become a legend, as well as one of the most loved cars by Gran Turismo players. Fascinating like few others, this sturdy sports car is present on Assetto Corsa in the powerful MK IV variant, equipped with a 280 horsepower 2jz GTE engine capable of making it reach 250 km/h (electronically limited) and break away from 0-100 km/h in 5 seconds. The model is perfect both in terms of aesthetics, despite some smudges on the side shadows, and in behaviour, thanks to a peculiar and slight loss of grip that makes it a lot of fun to drive on fast bends. Known for being one of the cars most open to modifications ever, the Supra is also offered in the Drift variant with 624 horsepower and 756 Nm of torque and in the Time Attack variant, which reaches the beauty of 690 horsepower. The first has no spoiler and is available in seven different colours, while the second, very nervous and complex to master to the limit, offers more refined aerodynamics and various additional options for the setting. We close our overview with the queen of the package, namely the splendid Nissan GT-R R34 Skyline V-Spec, one of the most beautiful and exciting cars ever made. Characterized by cutting-edge technological solutions to improve driving pleasure, the Skyline is equipped with a 2.6-litre RB26DETT engine with 325 horsepower and releases a maximum torque of 392 Nm, which allow it to reach speeds of 250 km/h and detach the 0-100 km/h in 4.9 seconds. Aggressive and exuberant on the track, the R-34 requires good experience to be pushed to the limit on Assetto Corsa, especially without active TCS and ABS, however it is very enjoyable on fast circuits such as the Nordschleife and Spa.A touch of aliasing on the seams and on the A-pillars, the polygonal model is excellent, as is the sound of the engine accompanied by the unmistakable sound of the turbo and the pop off valve.", "date": "2016-05-26", "grade": null}
