{"name": "Apsulov: End of Gods", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/apsulov-end-of-gods-recensione.html", "text": "Apsulov: End of Gods is a first-person horror adventure with a strange but interesting storyline that mixes science fiction and Norse mythology. The protagonist wakes up in a laboratory surrounded by gigantic stone faces. An artificial intelligence, apparently controlled by a deity, completes its new and unsolicited technological implants and tests it cruelly, before abandoning it to go elsewhere. Left alone, ours decides to run away. In doing so, he discovers that he is in a huge research center in Sweden, where gigantic artifacts with exceptional powers have been found, which however have awakened an ancient evil that now threatens the world. At the beginning the heroine is completely defenseless and only has an enhanced vision that is consumed with the passage of time: the so-called gaze of the gods allows her to see otherwise invisible objects and writings, so as to find codes and information on her destination. The base seems abandoned, with the exception of the presence of a kind of sect made up of crazed humans and, as we will discover by playing, a series of more or less aggressive creatures. All this translates into a gameplay with a dual nature: in principle Apsulov seems to be the classic Amnesia-like horror in which you have to advance through the environments without being seen by enemies, while solving very simple puzzles, but after the first chapter you get the possibility to respond to blows, so to speak, thanks to an object that is implanted in it and around which the few survival mechanics present revolve: a robotic hand. Without revealing too many details about the story, which is the most interesting part of the title, know that the robotic hand is powered by energy cells that allow you to launch electric shocks, useful for tampering with doors and other electronic devices, and for attacking enemies. Obviously the charges are not infinite and it is necessary to be able to manage them by exploiting the various energy stations scattered throughout the levels and the single disposable cells. Their attacks are not very fast and must be loaded first, so don't expect to find yourself facing a kind of Call of Duty clone. The general rule is always the same: better to overcome enemies by moving silently than to attack them wasting precious resources, especially if you play on the highest difficulty level. Pros and cons Apsulov has many strengths, but also some major flaws. Its main problem is the artificial intelligence of the enemies, which is really poor. Furthermore, the fact that they rely only on the sense of sight makes them harmless in many cases. In fact, they usually follow elementary movement patterns which, once learned, allow them to be avoided without problems. Even when they are discovered, however, the risks are relative, because you just need to run a little to make them give up or, worse, just jump on an object placed on a different plane than the one they are on to see them get confused . For example, in one case we saved ourselves by jumping onto a table, with the pursuing creature who stopped seeing us and started looking for us as if we had become invisible. Another significant problem arises when you can start shooting back: the possibility of killing enemies reduces the general tension. It is true that in some moments our powers are useless, as against some gigantic creatures from which we can only hide, and it is also true that in the last chapters the situation improves because resources are scarcer and the creatures become more aggressive, but the fact remains that with a weapon in hand the sensation of being simple prey immediately vanishes; sensation accentuated by the post-death mini-game, which allows you to come back to life by solving a puzzle that in the long run becomes just a nuisance, especially when the game gets more difficult. Finally there are the puzzles, really very simple, which in most cases require you to find codes to enter or to throw shocks at the right time. Surely they help not to slow down the story, but we wouldn't have minded something more complex. Scattered details The substance is that Apsulov gives his best from a narrative point of view, managing to handle a very particular story, without ever falling into the ridiculous. This is also the aspect that makes it advisable despite the above flaws. The technical side is also good, especially in the settings that are always made in a convincing way, even when they lack particular elements of interest. Excellent management of the lighting system. Obviously it is clear that we are not dealing with a triple A, but as an independent titleYou can't really complain about the results you get. For the rest it should be noted that, despite the presence of some larger areas to explore, the entire game is quite linear and can be completed in just over six hours. Many will be happy to know that the lyrics are in Italian: a rarity these days.", "date": "2019-08-16", "grade": "7.5"}
