A sort of new beginning for the El Presidente saga therefore, with the usual excellent attention in translating the premises into the gameplay, giving the user all the tools to extricate himself in what is ultimately a city builder of atmosphere, a fine example of emergent storytelling and a successful video game. More than the sum of the parts The first block of mechanics is linked to the management of one's own island, to its administration: unlike what can be experienced in the recent Cities XL where specialization is king, in Tropico 3 the player is asked for all-round management of the area assigned to it, leaving little room for refined urban planning and instead asking to create jobs, housing, roads and infrastructure, trying to make the precarious living conditions of the population of an unstable, small Caribbean state acceptable. It will therefore be possible to unravel between farms and companies specialized in the production of the most disparate goods, creating residential centers of different value according to needs and moving around the territory to optimize the management of raw materials, choosing the most prosperous areas, and travel, building the roads. Once the economy has been set in motion and certain requests have been satisfied, there is the possibility of boosting tourism, strengthening oneself militarily and paying attention to the usual social aspects such as religion, health or leisure reasons. Micro-management is present but not annoyingly invasive, being required, for example, in the case of foreign specialists called for certain jobs or when the rates of a single building need to be raised or lowered. Nothing particularly original if it weren't for the implications due to the particularity of the characters whose lives to interpret: whether a small dictator is created from scratch or one of those who really existed - or exists - takes over the management of an international policy not facilitated by the own state of borderline country and of the internal one made up of intrigues, riots and attempted coups d'tat, makes the sequence of bizarre, possible attitudes almost natural, always committed not to annoy the USSR or the United States and perhaps spending a few afternoons in throwing dissidents in prison, as well as saving some money in one's foreign account. It will be better to work hard otherwise the inhabitants will only have to eat each other. (in fact in the game this may not actually happen) A few small niggles The Free Mode, during which you set a good number of options and then throw yourself into the seamless administration of your island, is accompanied by a real campaign, structured through fifteen different missions, each designed to require a different type of approach and put in the face of different problems. We go from the need to reclaim an area that was previously unusable to facing waves of desperate refugees, from celebrating twenty years of government to the wildest use of one's secret police; there is no shortage of variety and every situation is permeated by an exhilarating patina, perhaps accompanied by the local radio which, always sharp, underlines the main events. To the many points in favor, Tropico 3 alternates a series of not huge but still annoying gaps. The tutorial is not adequate and the learning curve, especially for those who want to immediately jump into the campaign, is decidedly steep, suggesting that you first spend a few hours wandering around the sandbox and then return with all the relevant knowledge. Secondly, the possibility of wandering around the streets and buildings with one's alter ego is nothing but a tinsel, a sort of appendage with very few functions that ends up disappearing - if not annoying - inside the massive mass of all the other possibilities put on the plate. The gaming experience is therefore, as a whole, more than positive, a leap back to the first chapter that can be played and from a playful point of view it is worth the money it costs, perhaps extending its life by having fun creating, playing and sharing online the scenarios created using the appropriate editor. Scent of the sea The visual impact with Tropico 3 is simple but captivatingivante, with the menus created as if they were the pages of the classic document holders, complete with staples and marks on the sheets, to act as a not too discreet but not even annoying frame for the most traditional representations of Caribbean countries: trees, sun, sea and an architectural complex that seems to have come out - and probably is - from a collection of postcards dedicated to Cuba. A few more days and these shacks will make way for a nice concrete building The level of detail dedicated to the characters, intent on walking as well as in the most disparate production activities, and to the buildings as well as the vegetation, is good, with a certain care in the amount of different animations and models. Excessive use of HDR does not affect too much a sector dedicated to effects that is not particularly relevant. In terms of performance, the work done is discreet and the test hardware has made it possible to maintain, at 1600x1050, above thirty images per second almost always, even bringing the view towards the ground as close as possible and thus having total control over the entire country . The graphics options menu, in addition to the resolution, goes fairly deep but, as always, to get a little extra performance, it will be enough to break down the anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering, then moving on to shadows if necessary. The sound is largely dominated by the discreet Latin American soundtrack, with the voices and writings totally in Italian to accompany the main events.", "date": "2009-10-30", "grade": "8.0"}
