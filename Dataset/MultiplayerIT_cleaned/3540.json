{"name": "Gears POP!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gears-pop-recensione.html", "text": "Gears POP! left everyone a little confused at the time of the announcement, after all we are talking about the first mobile game based on the Microsoft series, also created in collaboration with the famous brand Funko POP! For this review we therefore approached the game with great curiosity, while aware of the fact that it was basically a clone of the blockbuster Clash Royale, only with the Gears of War characters. The tutorial actually reveals some new and unexpected facets, which exploit the traditional element of stalking to introduce a new territorial mechanic: when we release certain units onto the map, they tend to find shelter just enough to conquer the position and thus raise the range of our subsequent maneuvers. To succeed, however, the operation must be performed both on the right and on the left ~wall~, approaching the opponent's position which is naturally composed of three elements: two turrets and a base, the latter our main goal to win the game. Each victory corresponds to the inevitable prize boxes which, once opened (it is necessary to wait a bit for this to happen), give out virtual currency and new Funko POPs! complete with unboxing of the package: a nice sequence for fans of these figures. Just like in Clash Royale, having a certain number of identical characters allows you to buy an upgrade and thus improve our deck. Structure and gameplay In addition to the tutorial and training, Gears POP! includes two main modes namely Versus and Horde. The first is competitive and incorporates well-tested mechanisms, with two players challenging each other in real time until one of them manages to destroy the other's emplacements; while the second is a cooperative challenge that unlocks quickly enough and sees us face artificial intelligence together with a companion from the same clan on multiple waves. In a nutshell, things change little, but the willingness to insert further elements of variation is appreciable in addition to the inevitable unlocking of new maps as you go up in level. The gameplay is exactly as we expected, so no surprises on that front but rather the desire to follow a formula that has given the Supercell guys so much success. In the lower part of the screen there is the action energy indicator, which fills up as the seconds go by and allows you to release different units on the battlefield, simple grenades, seemingly unstoppable titans and the inevitable special move, represented from a hole from which hordes of small, annoying creatures are pouring out. A subdivision between good and bad is not made: figures such as Marcus Fenix and August Cole are mixed in the deck with the various representatives of the Locusts and the Swarm, seamlessly, and it is up to us to manage the troops in the best possible way to have the best chances to win. The technical realization is excellent, even if there are situations (see the cutscene with the Lancer and the jumping head) in which the collaboration between the two brands appears a bit forced and very unnatural. However, a convincing job has been done to faithfully represent the Funko POP!, equipped with a fairly valid set of animations and accompanied in battle by sound effects that reflect the classic sounds of Gears of War.", "date": "2019-08-25", "grade": "8.0"}
