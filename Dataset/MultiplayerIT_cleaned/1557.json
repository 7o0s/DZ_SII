{"name": "Red Faction 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-faction-7.html", "text": "I'm a joker and my textures lose color. I admit it, but seriously describing the little plot under Red Faction 2 in more appropriate and ~professional~ tones would have been ridiculous in itself, but now it's time for some serious talk about this second episode of the little Volition saga. Let's start right away by putting our hands forward: it's a console port, nothing more and nothing less, so you'll find everything you can imagine, from an all too arcadey and easy-going gameplay to a technical report not worthy of the very expensive coupons that you geeks of PC you love to mount. The various 9700s and FX will weep with sadness in front of the dull, monotonous, faded and little, perhaps too little detailed textures of many levels of RF2. The gpu will have very little to sweat with the few polygons that build the architecture of the levels, generally saucers, and little characterized. Bad bad? Well, actually it's not bad, you will still find the use of lights and certain pixel and vertex shading effects particularly nice and effective, moreover the polygons of the various models, although not very well animated, will be more than watchable. The strength of the game engine is represented by the so-called ~geo-mod~. Already present since the first episode, it is that particular fetaure that should allow you to pave the way for the various levels by pulverizing everything in front of you. Although many have expressed themselves in enthusiastic terms towards this pleasant addition to the usual FPS routine, in my opinion it should be scaled down. Mind you, it is satisfying to pull down a wall with a missile and go from one room to another without using the doors, but be careful: it is not always allowed and when you find yourself having to face a forced passage, you will discover how, even in RF2, a plasterboard wall can withstand ten well-placed C4 charges. No more than a pleasant addition therefore, which makes some action scenes particularly rewarding, but does not influence the gameplay in a sufficiently incisive way, in my opinion. I hear sweet sounds. The audio, on the other hand, is decidedly on another planet: good, very good. Weapons thunder, people scream, the fire crackles and the goats say ~hello~ (34 degrees, put yourself in front of a PC to write). The word of the day is ~addictive~, a game without audio is like a pizza without the tomato and the title of Volition has the triple filling. The thing that gives me the most satisfaction is using the mini-uzi combo, those little thugs scream like a slaughtered cat while spewing lead on the Commonwealth toy soldiers. Ah I love the smell of Napalm in the early morning, it has the scent of victory Ok it has to do with it and it has nothing to do with it, however the musical accompaniment of RF2 is decidedly satisfying and combined with the already excellent sounds it will make you grin with malice, while you cut off the head of the victim on duty, or while you wander around warily in the laboratories of Sopot (~With Sopot, he wants to wash the dishes~). The sound is therefore promoted with full marks, good sounds and good music will keep you company while you wander around the Commonwealth, without ever annoying you too much. And the gameplay? We have seen how the product is decorated with bows, but now it's time to see what we ~really~ have in our hands. Red Faction 2 is a title, easy, very easy. It's also a very short title, I'm a really poor player and I finished it in less than twelve hours divided into two daily sessions: very little. Both for the limited artificial intelligence of the opponents, who know how to shoot and don't pick their noses, and for the simple design of the levels and the total lack of a minimum of puzzles (at least the basic mechanism: ~find the key to open the door ~) the whole adventure will flash before your eyes a 'mo of Serious Sam. You'll have to find ammunition and then dislocate your left index finger to keep shooting, or for those who remember the Simpsons, you could always build a counterweight wooden woodpecker, which keeps tapping the mouse button for you and maybe one day I'll write to you a guide to making such a contraption. The only difficulty will be not to shoot yourself in the face, if you can do this you can think of finishing the game in less than a day. Although this was damn fun to play, the programmers were very careful to create a fake storyline with missions that somehow justifies your devastating presence within the Commonwealth and were very skilled in creating a certain variety of environments that I did not see for some time. Ok, sonor the usual clichs of the genre: the office, the cemetery, the sewers and so on, but they are put together with a certain style that is a bit kitsch, but very nice and original. Furthermore, numerous sequences aboard vehicles intervene to break the monotony of the traditional FPS, some made in a sufficient way and others decidedly well thought out from a technical and playability point of view, and I am referring in particular to the moment in which the plot pushes us to take control of an underwater vehicle, to find a hidden entrance to the base of the usual dictator. Multiplayer and abstruse conclusions or not. Multiplayer would be nice if there was, can't figure out why a useless mode called ~bot-match~ was implemented, but not the traditional online beating. The ~bot-match~ is also made with a fair amount of care, there are various game modes even in teams, it is possible to build an ad hoc character to use in the arenas and there are several levels built specifically for the various modes. Unfortunately, the levels themselves are even more dull and ugly than those of the single-player game and the intelligence of the various bots leaves much to be desired even at the highest difficulty level. In short, nothing exceptional, nor justifiable without the presence of a real online game mode, the presence of which would have justified the existence of the bot-match as an offline training mode. This Red Faction is a good missed title, not by much if only they had increased the resolution of the textures in the pc version, if only they had tweaked the A.I. of the various bots, well, a nice little game would have come out of it. So instead we have before us a little harp, a title to be played quickly and then thrown away, an appetizer before the big titles of the autumn. The problem is that you pay for this appetizer and therefore perhaps you may not really want it and in the end, you could, moderately, wait for the large courses of autumn. Pros: Great sound and music Plenty of weapons of all kinds Disengaged and fun Cons: Outdated and poorly maintained graphics You'll finish it in a couple of days at most A.I. bad A few screenshots. 21 Old-style rigmarole Life on Earth in 2161 is hard, especially if you're on the wrong side: like me. I am a demolitions expert, a soldier and I fight for the resistance. Against the perfidious governor Sopot (~Use Sopot for the limescale of your toilet bowl~ or ~One tablet of Sopot is enough and you will regain your intestinal balance~... in short, I think you have understood the concept) there was no other choice but to raise one's head and fight, to stop him from completing his projects that would see the entire planet crushed under his fetid boot. Nanotechnologies are the means that will allow him to gain power, creating an army of hyper-powered imbeciles dressed in red overalls like the ~Spintarelle~. The populace would not bear this terrifying sight and he would have won. I can't allow it, I have a group of nano-enhanced super friends who back me up: they are super armed, super strong, they have more powerful weapons than Mazinger Zeta and they have so much faith in me that they send me forward using me as a human shield or as a battering ram to break through the doors, sometimes they just send me forward and if I try to go back they shoot me... they say it's for my own good, to increase my self-esteem, who else can boast of such dear friends? However I am the fundamental link in the chain, the backbone for every mission, the most perfected nanotechnological soldier: I am Alias. Yes, I know, it's a bit like being called ~Ovvero~, initially my parents wanted to call me ~Quantunque~ or ~Empirecch~, but then they thought how happy I would be to spend half my salary in psychologists to recover from the traumas suffered from elementary school children who still today, when they see me, throw stones at me (the children of the time, who today are about forty and even bring their children with them, today's elementary school children). It was for this cruel twist of fate that I decided to redeem myself socially by embarking on my military career as a demolisher.", "date": "2003-08-12", "grade": null}
