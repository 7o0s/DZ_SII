{"name": "Pistole", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/144732-gunman-clive-2-pistole-dinosauri-e-tetramini.html", "text": "When a couple of years ago landed on Nintendo eShop, Steam, App Store and Play Store Gunman Clive, a small side-scrolling 2D Action by Hrberg Productions (acronym behind which practically only one developer is hidden, the Swedish Bertil Hrberg, assisted by his brother for the composition of the music), many recognized its qualities: made with great care both from a technical point of view and from a more properly playful one, this indie gem above all had the merit of drawing liberally from the great classics of the genre , first of all the various Mega Man, proving to have fully understood the spirit. Few, however, let's bet, managed to predict its success: thanks to its quality but also to the very low price, Gunman Clive arrived in the hands of 400,000 players in two years, with 80% of these sales obtained on the eShop in the version for Nintendo 3DS. It is therefore not surprising that the very small team has decided to redo the formula and publish a sequel: Gunman Clive 2 therefore arrives carrying an already greater load of responsibility than its predecessor, who was an illustrious unknown. Will he be able to stand up to the name? The sequel to one of the biggest and most unexpected hits for Nintendo eShop! All Around The World The game begins exactly where the prequel ended, that is in a western-futuristic setting, with our Gunman still chasing the antagonistic bandits of the first episode. Soon, however, the pursuit moves to other parts of the world, from cold Russia with lots of quotes from Tetris in the form of tetrominoes that fall from the sky, to the lush African jungle in which, in the middle of the 19th century, they still roam free dangerous T-Rex! All this for the beauty of 25 stages, mostly made up of the classic platform and shooter combo, but which do not disdain variations on the theme also inspired by the great classics of the past. For example, levels with rear view (where stereoscopic 3D gives its best) reminiscent of Space Harrier, or a re-edition of the crazy mine cart ride of Donkey Kong Country, in which however instead of the cart there is a cuddly panda. Gunman Clive 2 also makes clear its love for the experiences of the past, with an extremely accurate level design that skillfully repeats more or less all the situations to which titles such as the aforementioned Mega Man (but Shinobi, Ghost ' N' Goblins, Super Mario Bros.) have accustomed at least the more elderly players. It is true that memorable situations are very rarely encountered, those that remain in the hearts and minds of users for years and years: the battles with the bosses, however, are absolutely fantastic and if they don't deserve to enter this category, it is only for little. But it is also true that even more rarely, almost never to tell the truth, we come across sloppy or trivial situations. In short, it is played in a completely pleasant way from start to finish; an end which, moreover, comes soon, given that the 25 levels are rather short and, at least by selecting the first level of difficulty, simple. The 3D effect Bertil Hrberg shows that he knows how to do it and that he takes great care in his works even when it comes to exploiting 3D stereoscopy, which stands out without ever being intrusive, it does not affect the good frame rate at all, and it also becomes spectacular in the sections with view from behind. Select Your Player Always in full respect of the love for vintage, beyond the actual game there is absolutely nothing: no objectives, no extra modes, nothing at all. But the actual game is much richer than you might think by reading the last sentence of the previous paragraph, which evidently refers only to the first of several possible playthroughs. First of all there is the right to choose from the beginning between three different characters, and if Mrs. Johnson, the damsel of the situation, brings the only addition of the glide during the jump, like Princess Peach from Super Mario Bros. 2 onwards , making the game even a little easier, Chieftain Bob's short-range spear already shuffles the cards a lot, requiring a completely different approach in fighting enemies. That's not enough, because by completing everything the first time, a fourth character is unlocked, which we won't anticipate (but fans of the first episode may have already understood), which once again manages to change the way of dealing with those who remain always the same levels. All this then to be repeated for three levels of difficulty, among which Normal already significantly increases the level of challenge by affecting elements such as the life bar and the restart pointin case of death. To be repeated, of course, if you want, but the beauty is that Gunman Clive 2 invites you to be replayed over and over again by virtue almost exclusively of its freshness and immediacy, once only it seems objectively too little and the significant differences between a character and the other, between one level of difficulty and the next, helps to dilute the feeling of having already seen and tiredness that re-tackling an already finished internship could create. Only applause also on the technical and, above all, aesthetic side: probably the effort of the hardware will not remain in the annals, but the technique is placed at the service of a really good design, which with its comic strip, beautiful to see in motion, begins almost monochromatic to then surprise further with a richness and use of colors much more significant than in Gunman Clive. The same goes for the music: the composer Hrberg demonstrates his ability to go beyond the western theme, with accompaniments that are always pleasant and punctual.", "date": "2015-02-06", "grade": "8.0"}
