On the one hand, EA's product was criticized for a general lack of depth, on the other hand, the game undoubtedly offered an immediate and intuitive skateboarding experience, cleverly combining traditional controls with the touch screen. It was in fact possible to manage the movement of one's character by acting on the d-pad, while on the lower screen of the DS a skate was depicted on which it was necessary to draw lines with the stylus to obtain as many acrobatic maneuvers. Given the potential in the gaming field of the iPhone and iPod Touch, the developers of the mobile division of Electronic Arts have seen fit to re-propose Skate It on the App Store, with the intention of offering users a sui generis sports simulation and focusing everything on methods and customizations. However, it is the control system that once again makes the difference, unfortunately in the negative since we are faced with a really difficult game to master. But let's go in order... To each his own As already mentioned, the strength of Skate It lies above all in the numbers: the career mode includes twenty locations in which to compete, each full of increasingly complex challenges. It is also possible to try out a completely free mode and customize your skater and his board with numerous designer objects, all to be unlocked. In fact, the editor is the first thing we deal with once the career has begun: we can determine the gender and physical appearance of our character, then dress him as we please (at the beginning, in any case, the there are very few dresses available) and then take a tour of the classic tutorial that explains how to move and how to perform tricks. The control system of the game refers to that of the Nintendo DS version, even if on the iPhone the developers have decided to give up the virtual d-pad and to use only the accelerometer integrated in the device for the character to lean left or right. You can adjust the sensitivity along these lines, but don't opt for more traditional controls. On the touch screen there are buttons that allow us to accelerate and grab the board while we are in the air for the classic ~grab~. Just during the jumps, the image of the skate appears on the screen and we can draw lines that each correspond to a different maneuver. The sequence for performing a trick, therefore, is generally this: you gain speed by pressing the appropriate button, draw a line on the screen for the character to take a jump, hold the iPhone tilted to add rotation to the maneuver and possibly holds down the ~grab~ button as icing on the cake. Simple? Not really, and the developers have also noticed this, who have built the game structure precisely on the basis of the limitations of the gameplay: the challenges are extremely short and not very articulated, we are not asked for a commitment of a certain weight and in the same way the satisfaction of passing the tests and unlocking new items is small. The presence of the scenario editor is interesting, really simple to use, but in principle Skate It is too cumbersome (and expensive: we are talking about 5.49 euros) to convince when the competition at the moment is not only very valid but even free (we are clearly referring to Gameloft's Skater Nation). The technical realization only underlines the concepts expressed so far, with too simple and angular polygonal models that move within somewhat dull and not very populated scenarios, with a few small bugs to season everything.
