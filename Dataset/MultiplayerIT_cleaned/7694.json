We are therefore talking about a niche discipline here, which from a videogame point of view it is even more so for obvious reasons. That said, there is still a rather long tradition, also made up of many excellent quality productions, to accompany stock car racing. Do you remember NASCAR Racing, released on PC in 1994 and developed by Papyrus Design? It was basically the ~covered wheels~ version of the previous Indycar Racing (1993), which at the time was a point of reference for car simulations on personal computers. The undersigned was confronted with those titles almost twenty years ago, learning for the first time how to adjust settings such as wheel camber and asymmetrical tire pressure, given that all the circuits were oval and therefore the grip of the car had to be taken care of only one verse. It would be nice to be able to say that a long way has come since then. In reality, NASCAR licensed video games have not stood out over the years, they have often gone completely unnoticed and even the series created by Eutechnyx does not seem to have gotten who knows what feedback, given that in the space of two years it has gone from the console market to the PC one, losing the publisher (Activision) along the way. Puteeeence The main menu of NASCAR The Game: 2013 is obviously inspired by the latest Codemasters titles, now a staple for the genre, therefore it offers us a view from our car within an environment in which we move from one option to another. other. It is possible to dispute the career, which is the fulcrum of the game, or try a quick race, adjust the car settings (possibly saving the set-up) and access an online multiplayer mode for up to sixteen participants. Let's start with the latter, which unfortunately does not shine due to the frequent problems related to the quality of the users' connection, with episodes of lag that cannot be avoided for the moment, given that there is not yet a manual selection of servers. However, it seems that the developers are working to make the online component more competitive, so it is possible that the situation will improve from here to the next updates. Thus we return to the single player and, in particular, to the section of the menu dedicated to car upgrades. You got it right: if on the one hand Eutechnyx's latest effort boasts clear simulation ambitions, on the other it plays the upgrade card to make our climb to glory more interesting. Once on the track you will realize that this choice brings with it positive but also negative elements, at least in terms of balance, given that during the first races you will be systematically unable to cross the finish line first due to the slowness of your vehicle. Of course, once some upgrades are mounted, the situation will change, but it is a factor to take into due consideration when, at the beginning, it will seem to you that any effort to overcome this or that opponent is completely in vain. NASCAR The Game: 2013 is a competent driving game, with some good ideas but outdated graphics Three centimeters away from you Among the peculiarities of NASCAR races, in addition to the oval circuits, there are these incredible trains of cars that are formed at the beginning of each race and which are also well represented in the game. Get ready to race a few centimeters away from other cars, otherwise you will lose the ideal trajectory and perhaps the rear end, with disastrous consequences for you and for others. From this point of view, the experience of NASCAR The Game: 2013 often seemed too punitive to us, thanks to an artificial intelligence that has very little trouble looking for a collision, behaving almost as if you weren't there, at a very short distance. Experience will help to cope with these phases by skilfully dosing accelerator and brake, but we tell you right away that at first it will be a disaster, with rear-end collisions triggered by nothing and the race suspended for a few laps. The only way to avoid having to endure downtime is to adjust the options, deactivate the black flags and perhaps even the damage to the car, so as to complete the race even in the event of problems. But is that what the most discerning NASCAR aficionado really wants? Probably not. He probably really wants ~tough~ gameplay, where accuracy is paramount, without even dropping giri of the track compared to the reality of each event and therefore enjoying the need to stop to refuel, pay attention to the engine temperature when drafting and work for hours on the setup to maximize performance. Well, these elements have been well implemented, so there is certainly no question of disappointment on the part of the purists. However, it is certain that on the technical front the situation is not the best and the comparison with racers of the caliber of GRID 2 appears merciless. The levels in the field are different, it is clear, but NASCAR The Game: 2013 does not have such a low price as to justify this lack, and nowadays going out with a graphically obsolete racer we doubt it can be a winning strategy.", "date": "2013-08-01", "grade": "7.0"}
