Following a more than discreet racing game, Asphalt: Urban GT 2 presents itself in the best way: captivating menus, real music in the background, a large amount of competitions and the Pussycat Dolls to cheer up the loading screens. It's just a pity that the only song on the list is the ultra-inflated (and not even extraordinary) Lift Me Up by Moby, that the Pussycat Dolls have absolutely nothing to do with everything else and that the competitions are as numerous as they are lacking in gameplay profile. Here, Asphalt: Urban GT 2 reveals itself from the very first moments as a product that focuses entirely on appearance and which hides very little behind a wall of truly absolutely remarkable contents. Yes, because the Gameloft title offers great racing game numbers: 15 tracks set in as many cities, 37 licensed cars and 8 motorcycles, an Evolution mode consisting of 61 mini-championships, an Arcade section divided into six specialties (Single Race, Quick Race, Time Attack, Cop Chase, Bandit Chase, Elimination) and Multiplayer support via Bluetooth for up to four players. All without counting the possibilities for customizing your vehicle, ranging from the purchase of parts to improve its performance to purely aesthetic processing, including airbrushing, neon, rims and bodies. A truly astonishing amount of elements for an N-Gage title, which unfortunately totally loses its meaning once it gets on track. In fact, Asphalt: Urban GT 2 suffers from a series of serious shortcomings that heavily affect its playability, starting from an embarrassing control system, which makes the cars woody and the motorcycles almost undriveable: the behavior of the cars on the road is completely unrealistic and made in a superficial way, as well as the management of the shocks, so coarse as to be literally ridiculous. It goes without saying how modes such as Bandit Chase, which are based precisely on the wild door, are essentially unplayable ... Near horizons Many of the most negative aspects of Asphalt: Urban GT 2 then derive from its technical sector, the inadequacy of which is also palpably reflected in the gameplay. Graphically rather crude and decidedly not phenomenal in terms of frame-rate, the Gameloft product presents massive pop-up and bad clipping problems, to the point of often preventing an appropriate display of the road ahead. A limited visual horizon which, combined with a poor general definition and absolutely arbitrary perspective corrections, does not even allow you to distinguish well whether what you are going towards is a car, a bonus or a nice concrete wall. It goes without saying that in the face of these shortcomings, playing Asphalt: Urban GT 2 is certainly not the maximum pleasure. The icing on the cake, however, is represented by a nice bunch of bugs including disappearances of objects, polygonal interpenetrations and dulcis in fundo convulsive camera movements devoid of any logic. And it is painful to reiterate how much it is a pity that the Gameloft title was created with so much inexperience, because even acceptable quality gameplay and cosmetics would have been enough to allow the full-bodied playful contents of the game to have a real meaning. As it stands, however, Asphalt: Urban GT 2 is a frustrating and poorly enjoyable racing game, as ambitious in its purposes as it is incredibly naive in their actual implementation. Finally, a few lines should be spent with regard to a disharmonious sound sector, with acceptable music but terrible sound effects, and a not exactly exciting exploitation of the N-Gage Arena service, limited to the classic scoreboards and the unattractive practice of Shadow Racing. Comment Asphalt: Urban GT 2 is without too many words a racing game extremely approximate in its realization, whose serious mistake was to try to go too far beyond its actual potential. The eagerness on the part of the Gameloft developers to insert cool elements taken from popular series such as Need For Speed and Burnout has weighed down a game that simply cannot stand on its own legs. Poorly cared for in its fundamental aspects and guilty of a decidedly crude and unsuitable technical sector, Asphalt: Urban GT 2 is a title that literally pales in comparison with much more dignified exponents of the genre such as Glimmerati or its own prequel.Pro Large quantity of contents Decent realization of the cars The Pussycat Dolls in the background Cons Serious deficiencies from the graphic point of view Unacceptable control system Some macroscopic bugs Never change a winning team. This is one of the mottos prevailing in the industria of video games (and not only), in which a successful play structure is unlikely to be distorted in the quality and quantity of its contents on the occasion of the release of a sequel. The secret is to keep the virtues of the original game intact, enriching everything with just enough to attract the attention of the largest number of users already familiar with the franchise and other strangers to it. A modus operandi that Gameloft developers seem to have adopted with unforgivable lightness for this Asphalt: Urban GT 2.", "date": "2006-01-04", "grade": null}
