It is an MMO inspired by imperial China and its myths, above all that of martial arts, which in many ways takes up the atmospheres and suggestions of films such as ~The Tiger, Hidden Dragon~, including flights. In the game our task is to create a character by selecting his style from four different schools, then try our hand at numerous quests with a view to a path that will lead us to gradually unlock new features, attack maneuvers and modes, both cooperative and competitive . Thanks to the presence of real automatisms, both for the search and completion of missions and for combat, the experience is revealed to be very simple and immediate right from the start, despite an often crowded interface and therefore not very suitable for a production mobile. The touch controls work quite well: on the left side of the screen there is a virtual analog stick that does not reposition itself but interprets our inputs quickly and precisely, while on the right there are various buttons for the basic attack, special maneuvers , the jump and the block. These last functions allow you to proceed quickly within the scenarios, between pirouettes and long throws, as well as to give the fights a pinch of depth, using instantaneous blocks that disorient the opponent and therefore allow you to sink a series of blows to defeat him. Watch out, though: enemies also enjoy the same resource, and as we progress through history we will see them resort to it more and more often. Age of Wushu Dynasty fulfills the role of a mobile MMO very well, it is free to play and offers a bunch of quests mobile We were talking about the automatic functions: by tapping the small box for the quests we will see our character move voluntarily across the map, until we find the possible interlocutor to start the mission, thus avoiding having to waste time in frantic searches which, at first, they might annoy. Beyond this expedient, however, the structure of Age of Wushu Dynasty appears rather lean, well calibrated for use on the move, with quests based on simple combat, finding characters or delivering objects. Around us many players committed to following the same path, connected to servers that guarantee low latency and therefore a solid experience, free of particular problems. We appreciated the cadenced release of new functions and methods, because in products like these it is important to avoid throwing everything out immediately, but even more we were convinced by the freemium model used by the developers, free of time constraints and dense monetization attempts : you can play for hours without problems, avoiding spending real money on items with a mostly aesthetic value. It's a pity only for a lackluster rendering of the impacts and for the poor fluidity of the animations: while using an iPhone 6s, the movements of the characters tend to snap and this inevitably takes away the charm of fights in which timing is often important (see precisely the execution of the instant save). The strange thing is that even if you change the graphic detail settings, you don't get an improvement from this point of view.", "date": "2016-01-16", "grade": "8.0"}
