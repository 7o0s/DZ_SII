Especially when you have to draw conclusions and give it a rating that takes into account the gameplay but also its general quality, without forgetting the era in which the product was released, the technology on which it could count certainly less performing than those currently available. A title considered a masterpiece can in fact be reviewed and evaluated in a different way just a few years after the date of its release, above all in light of the ever-frantic changes that take place in the world of consoles as regards hardware and graphics engines. In short, every judgment must be weighed and analyzed with a cool head before proceeding to the final draft, always placing the emphasis in the article on the distinctions and on how users should evaluate the product covered in the service. Prince of Persia Trilogy HD offers, as you know by now, the three games of the Sands of Time saga that appeared for the first time in the past years on PlayStation 2. After reviewing the progenitor of the series a week ago, the time has come for us to analyze the its direct sequel, also reproposed in its edition adapted to high definition televisions. Warrior Spirit continues the story of The Sands of Time by introducing new characters and showing new character aspects of the Prince, here re-proposed in a more brutal and angry guise than ever. Seven years after Azad's adventure, our Persian friend, in an attempt to free himself from the curse that afflicts all those who have worked with magical sands, must go to the place where they were created, go back to the past and stop their genesis: only in this way can he be saved from the Dahaka demon who persecutes and chases him. Indeed, the powerful Being does not forgive him for having used the power of the Sands of Time to rewind the course of events and escape his destiny. The presence of the demon, among other things, does not have a purely and simply narrative function, but brings with it one of the novelties present in this new adventure of the Prince of Persia. Dark warriors In fact, in some sessions, Dahaka is physically present and chases our hero like a madman, consequently forcing the user to avoid this infernal creature by fleeing like hell and to perform a series of combinations of actions (jumps, acrobatics, climbing) within a certain time limit to avoid it. Initially tackling these passages may seem difficult, because the tension arising from the constant presence of the demonic threat behind you can lead you to make some errors of judgment during your escape, especially when in sequence you perhaps have to run up a wall, then throw yourself towards a spike and subsequently gliding on a platform, but it must be admitted that the coordination developed in these points, once you get the hang of it, makes the various ~schemes~ easier to deal with later on. As for the general gameplay of the product, Ubisoft offers in this second chapter of the saga a slightly retouched game mechanics, especially as regards the combat system. With the intention of making it more varied and engaging, a whole series of innovations and improvements have in fact been introduced in this sense, through the increase, for example, of the number of moves that can be performed by the Prince and the introduction of a particular system for the combos which allows the user to chain them together, in order to perform sequences of extremely lethal and spectacular attacks. In addition, the developers have also improved and numerically expanded the protagonist's time manipulation powers and implemented the ability for him to wield two weapons simultaneously, with the second however subject to rapid deterioration in relation to the frequency of use made of it . These elements that put together further increase the available combinations, giving the player considerable freedom in the management of the fights, which as we will see later have become the fulcrum or almost of the game. The Sands of Time The Sands of Time is a quadrilogy made up of 4 games, all linked together by a compelling storyline that takes place in the same narrative universe. The first is Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003), pseudo remake of the original Prince of Persia. The second in chronological order, i.e. following the plot of the series, is Prince of Persia: The SandsDimenticate (2010), which however is the last as a production. The third episode is Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), the second in chronological order to have been released on the market. While the fourth and final chapter is Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), which is the third as a production. Playstation 3 trophies Prince of Persia: Warrior Within gives users 20 Trophies. They are divided as follows: 1 Platinum, 4 Gold, 7 Silver, 1 Bronze and 7 Secrets. To obtain them, you must fulfill certain requests from the game during the adventure, such as completing the story on any difficulty level without dying (Undefeated trophy), beheading 150 enemies (Executor) or completing the game on Hard mode (Hero). New enemies, more action It is no coincidence that the exploratory component in this episode has been put somewhat in the background compared to the clashes. Which in some ways gives the user a more action-oriented experience, consequently proposing a setting that has gone from the fairy-tale and arabesque tones of the whole series in general to the darker and bloodier ones of this new chapter. The clashes are in fact a constant component of this product. In addition to being present in greater number and frequency, the enemies to face have changed in appearance and abilities, with a greater characterization of one opponent over the other. Furthermore, they appear smarter than in the past and decidedly more enterprising and organised. End-of-level bosses were then added by the developers who, while not shining for originality, turn out to be pleasant diversions, challenges within challenges to be faced to the full advantage of the game's variety and spectacularity. The exploratory component, albeit reduced, is however always present and still constitutes an important part of Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. During the adventure, our hero will often find himself having to escape from huge rooms full of platforms, handholds and infernal machinery, articulated with the level designing style that has characterized the various episodes of the saga. Just as he will once again be busy ~managing~, with more options, space-time thanks to his powers to control the hours and minutes given to him by the sand, which allows him to rewind or slow down the time flow in order to earn a second chance after some risky move, or to make his way easier through exaggeratedly fast or complicated passages. To refresh our memory, let's take an example: imagine you are inside a structure in which a huge object blocks your way, preventing you from getting out, or you are stuck on some spike with no handholds nearby where you can throw yourself to look for a grip or a stunt jump and get away. Well, traveling in the future, the obstacle may no longer be present in that location, consequently leaving the way free, or where there was nothing now, a point could appear to which to hook to to overcome the area or a platform to jump on. A Prince and his jumps Of course, the freedom left to the gamer is not total when moving from one era to another, given that the game provides for this possibility only in certain locations on the map. However it is one of the positive aspects of the adventure, given that even through it there is a decidedly more open progression of the adventure than in the past, with greater freedom of movement for the gamer within the world which forms the backdrop to the events. From an aesthetic point of view, the revisitation of this chapter of the saga in Prince of Persia: Trilogy HD proves, once again, excellent. The ~new~ 720p graphics can count on unprecedented (but not complex) textures, normal maps and anti-aliasing, which while obviously not distorting the aesthetic component of the product (the polygonal models are always the same) certainly still manage to improve it. to make it more pleasing to the eye. The image is thus sharper, the colors alive despite the gloomy setting and in general the feeling of depth given to the scenarios, always beautiful to look at, is superior to the original version on PlayStation 2 which was already quite good for the time anyway . If anything, everything clashes a lot with the cutscenes where the paucity of the polygons that make up the figures of the characters, which we mentioned a little above, and that of their ~coatings~ are highlighted by the close-ups. Unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to test stereoscopic 3D as it requires a 3D TV that is not available at the time of writing. The animations are also good, as per tradition, numerous and beautifully made, fluid as never before. Different speech rrelated to sound. The music is well made but in our opinion a little ~out of tune~ in the world in which the adventures of the Prince of Persia are set. In fact, they tend too much towards rock, even though in some cases maintaining an oriental tone, and therefore sometimes appear not very suited to the context. The dubbing in Italian is discreet and in some situations appears ill-adapted in terms of content, interpretation (in particular the horrible voices of the enemies) and characterization, with our hero who often comes out with trivial jokes and not very suitable for his character.", "date": "2011-03-17", "grade": "7.7"}
