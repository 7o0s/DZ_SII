{"name": "La guerra dei Wanzer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82210-front-mission-evolved-la-guerra-dei-wanzer.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 The Front Mission series has its roots in the 90s, with the first chapter released on the SNES in 1995, a game that was very successful and ensured Toshiro Tsuchida's creature the space and resources for further sequels. It is not rhetorical to say that at the time they were just other times: Squaresoft had its own well-defined identity which led to associating its brand with productions with attention to the smallest details and characterized by a structured and deep gameplay, almost always very reflective and conceptual. Not surprisingly, although the game in question concerned huge war mechs used by armies of the future, the structure was that of the turn-based strategy, which was also particularly difficult and demanding. To stay on the edge of rhetoric, this Front Mission Evolved could be seen as a metaphor for these troubled times, where the gaming market has expanded, massified and globalized, with Squaresoft which has become the gigantic conglomerate Square Enix committed to publishing titles right and missing throughout the world, ranging in any genre can ensure a good return. Within this panorama, Front Mission has become a frenetic shooter with a third-person view, moreover developed in outsourcing by the Californians Double Helix. Not that westernization necessarily leads to negative results, and several productions in recent years between Capcom, Konami and Square Enix themselves have demonstrated its validity, but it is certain that a structural upheaval of the kind makes it easy to lose track of the original spirit. The result of this experiment is a spin-off that draws from the world of Front Mission a rather accurate setting and a minimum narrative substratum - although far from the fanta-political plots of the past - but which generally lacks bite, even if it contains some elements of some interest. A personal war Front Mission Evolved is probably the chapter of the series most pushed into the future, placing the story in the distant year 2171, 50 years after the conclusion of the events narrated in Front Mission 5: Scars of the War. Humanity has made enormous strides forward on the technological front, in particular as regards the conquest of orbital space, which has now become an integral element of the enormous geo-political blocs into which the world is divided. The space bases are directly connected to the earth's surface through very high orbital elevators which represent a great form of wealth, therefore jealously guarded by their respective countries. The international situation is characterized by a precarious peace but, as is known, the ~hunger for war~ is something that mankind is unlikely to overcome. The world landscape therefore plummets following an attack carried out by unknown forces against the major orbital elevator of the USN (North America), located in the New York of the future. The mechs responsible for the terrorist attack belong to the OCU troops (the block composed of part of the Asian territories), although the government denies any connection with the initiative, therefore the UCS decides to concentrate some border forces against the alleged perpetrators, starting actually a world war. The personal story of the protagonist fits into all this, Dylan Ramsey, a quiet engineer specializing in the construction of wanzers who is in the midst of the attack on New York aboard his company's new experimental vehicle, and decides to launch headlong into the battle to save his father, a scientist who evidently represents a key player in the entire conflict. All this is narrated through the classic full motion video footage of excellent workmanship and dialogues inserted within the game action, as well as some cutscenes obtained directly from the basic graphics engine. The background is undoubtedly interesting thanks to the good construction derived from the well-established universe of the Front Mission franchise, however the story is heavily affected by rather flat dialogues and decidedly stereotyped characters, from the fearless young hero to the ruthless villains, and it's a shame considering the potential that could be exploited starting from this excellent setting. A good variant to the normal game action is provided by the multiplayer sector, which offers the classic modes codified by the shooter genre (deathmatch, team deathmatch and various forms of team and non-team control of the territory) applied to this particular context, with the wanzers as protagonists . The substantial simplicity of the combat system does not change, but the possibility of facing opponentsHuman rites certainly constitute a good incentive to occasionally dedicate oneself to this sector, the interest of which is increased by the possibility of personalizing one's own wanzer and thus experimenting it in direct comparison with others. Outside and inside the wanzer Having gone from the turn-based strategy structure, Front Mission Evolved is configured as a standard third-person shooter, something very similar to the Armored Core series, with the wanzer in the foreground seen from behind to be commanded directly with the analog stick and direct controls on weapons placed on the right and left arm and relative ~shoulders~, as well as the possibility of activating a momentary (and rechargeable) acceleration thanks to the reactors, the possibility of jumping and hovering in the air for a few seconds and activating the EDGE system which allows a sort of hyper-active status for the wanzer, also consumable and refillable. We therefore find ourselves driving our half-biped in various scenarios, essentially having to destroy all the enemy units present in the area until we reach the conclusion of the levels, almost always coinciding with the clash with a boss. The action itself is fun in the first hours of the game, also because the control system is rather simplified and intuitive despite the complexity of the mech, but the problem that arises in the medium term is the repetitiveness of the action, given that the structure of the levels described above applies to almost all of the game and does not offer particular digressions. Going through a level, no alternative solutions are offered to approach the enemy beyond simple fire at will and possibly dodging shots by hiding behind elements of the scenery, with our AI-managed allies limiting themselves to carrying out the their tasks without any possibility of concerted action. The only breaking elements are the sensors and emblems scattered within the levels to be discovered and destroyed or collected, but this is an old and very uninteresting gimmick, just as the foot sections in which we directly control Dylan are inconsistent diversions from a playful point of view, given the flatness of the level design, justifiable, in the limit, only for narrative purposes. So after the first period of exaltation for the use of the mighty wanzer and for the spectacularity of the explosions and the satisfaction deriving from them, boredom comes quite inexorably, above all for the lack of bite and drive to go on: the plot does not reveal itself live up to the background and the pacing takes abrupt breaks during the often long and grueling boss fights. Xbox 360 goals Relatively few (27) are the unlockable achievements for the total of 1000 Gamerpoints. Most are dedicated to the single campaign, distributed between the progression through the levels and the collection of hidden objects, the others are reached through the classic multiplayer performances. Shiny metal In a game with mechs, the ~constructive~ component could not be missing. The attack possibilities depend on the weapons loaded on the wanzer of the player's choice, although the types are rather constrained during the single player campaign, leaving the bulk of the customization to the multiplayer. Basically, these are long-range, short-range (or contact) weapons, missiles and homing rockets, all available in various progressively more evolved types, which can be attached to the arms and shoulders of the vehicle. In applying the weapons, however, one must bear in mind that their weight cannot exceed the power generated by the engine, which forces balanced configurations almost always corresponding to the classic archetypes of melee units, medium-range or long-range attacks ( sniper). From an aesthetic point of view, it is also possible to extensively modify the colors, the pattern, the decals and even the level of metallic sheen of each individual piece of the mech. The wanzers on the other hand are the most important element in the entire graphic sector, characterized by well-made animations and polygonal models, which can also be destructible in a differentiated way piece by piece, but the scenarios also reserve some interesting solutions. The scale of the maps is obviously extensive, although even being inside the city, between streets and buildings, one often has the clear impression of having to do more with a papier-mch model than with a place full of life given the absence of sensitive boundary elements beyond roads, enemies, buildings and some lampposts. In fact, except for some particular points, many elements are not interactive and cannot be destroyed, which increases thefeeling of emptiness of the settings. However, the attention is largely captured by the firefights and the effects in this sense are remarkable, including spectacular pyrotechnic explosions, projectiles and missiles that wander in the air and rain down on the targets, up to melee clashes, moments that do justice to the size and power of the war machines deployed on the field. The spectacularity is also well enlivened by the excellent full motion video scenes as well as by the well-made soundtrack.", "date": "2010-11-15", "grade": "6.0"}
