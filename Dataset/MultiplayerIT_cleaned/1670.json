Star Wars: Republic Commando is a video game that touches one of the most important periods of the narrative universe, that Clone War that was just mentioned in the original trilogy and had to wait for the second trilogy, together with the animated series, to find the right expression. In a period where tie-ins were still in fashion and did little to pay homage to the reference film, playing the role of Delta Squad was a pleasant diversion that made it an excellent game and still holds its head high today. Of course, you have to deal with 3D graphics that don't age well, settings that are now considered obsolete and a certain linearity of the only three settings available from which boredom transpires at times. But knowing what you're getting into picking up the game again, Star Wars: Republic Commando manages to offer the same genuine fun as it did sixteen years ago - mitigated by its understandable technical limitations. A little less beautiful and without the same wonder effect as when it was published, if you skipped it at the time it is still an experience to add to your life; above all because team management still remains a well-developed key element today in order not to risk a too premature and painful death. Let's see what works and what doesn't, in 2021, in our review of Star Wars: Republic Commando. Bacta, now! As mentioned, Star Wars: Republic Commando puts us in the shoes of Delta Squad as a leader, codenamed Delta 38, which is assigned missions that only an elite group could complete. Together with the trusty Scorch, Fixer and Seven (Delta 62, Delta 40 and Delta 07), the single player campaign - the only one to have been kept in the port - takes place across three main settings: Geonosis, Cruiser Acclamator and Kashyyyk. Without giving you spoilers in case you haven't played it at the time, each of these offers different enemies and situations, allowing you to experience firsthand the events that would have led to the events told in Revenge of the Sith and finally giving a taste of enemies, vehicles and scenarios that would later be shown in the film a few months later. Despite the linearity of the levels, the game relies heavily on cooperation with your team and the ability to manage it in the best possible way to survive the threats you will have to face: you can give four single orders thanks to the d-pad (Clear the Area, Search and Destroy, In Formation and Cancel Maneuver), or observe certain elements of the environment to tell your companions what to do. Seven can take cover behind debris to offer lethal covering fire, which the other two can do too but with different outcomes, Fixer is a wizard with terminals while Scorch has an innate passion for explosives. To each their own role and it is precisely this that makes the whole campaign very pleasant in spite of the aforementioned linearity, making it more layered than you think - always keeping in mind the past standards of course. Star Wars: Republic Commando, Delta Squad ready for action The team's artificial intelligence is discreet, that of the enemies a little less but they often leverage the number to put you in difficulty, and the characters are also able to act independently to heal a fallen companion. If, on the other hand, you should be the defeated, as long as there is still an active member, you can ask him to heal you or remain faithful to the orders previously assigned. An interaction that we greatly appreciated at the time and still enjoys today, allowing you to identify yourself even better in Delta 38 and in the situation. Among other things, the user interface implemented in the helmet, as well as the fact that this cracks when the damage suffered becomes large, combine to create a further sense of immersion. As for the arsenal, it will not be as full-bodied as those we are used to today but it is still remarkable: the inevitable Blaster, which will replace our main weapon when we run out of bullets, is joined by the equally iconic blaster rifle typical of stormtroopers , the sniper rifle, the particle rifle, the pulse rifle and of course the Wookie crossbow. Not to mention the grenades with which to get rid of groups of enemies or incapacitate the droids and a wrist blade as a last resort when the danger is decidedly too close - nothing to rely on, however, too much. Compared to the original game, the feeling of firearms has remained almost identical, so don't expect who knows what impact, although the implementationntation of the Rumble HD offers a discreet feedback without guaranteeing particular differences. Star Wars: Republic Commando is that game to try aware that it is a port to which a slight facelift has been applied, which has undoubtedly done it good but does not remove it from being an old title. It's not a bad thing at all, on the contrary, as much as an invitation to approach it with the right expectations. Star Wars: Republic Commando, Fixer (Delta 40) Being dated goes a bit to the advantage of Nintendo Switch, which with porting always has some difficulties in terms of performance (except in some cases). There is little to work on here, even in terms of frame rate, and although there are sometimes drops, especially in the most agitated phases, we still start from a lower fps standard than today. The same goes for the graphics, just passable for some tweaking to make it more pleasant but overall not too dissimilar from the original. Instead, there are numerous customizations that will help you adapt the game to your style: in particular, we advise you to remap the commands to make them less uncomfortable, while if you want a more demanding experience, there is always the difficulty modifier and other goodies such as disabling the tactical viewer or adjust the intensity of the tactical mode. Time has not been very kind, especially from a playful point of view where the weight of linearity could be tight for some, but Star Wars: Republic Commando manages to partially circumvent those that today are limitations not only thanks to teamwork but also to a cast of characters that is captivating and more alive than one might expect, with some exchanges between members of the Delta Squad that give that always welcome touch of irony. Do not underestimate the fact that our own character is not a dumb puppet but in turn interacts with the rest of the team, once again contributing to the immersion in the situations we will encounter.", "date": "2021-04-11", "grade": "7.0"}
