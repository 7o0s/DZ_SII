No other leading manufacturer has invested so much in this still so immature platform but, apparently, full of untapped potential. And so, in the space of just a month, we found ourselves in our hands three triple A titles with enormous commercial value but with different development objectives. On the one hand there was DOOM VFR, a virtual experience condensed into a few hours, borrowed from the full game with recycled environments but with a new narrative arc and modified gameplay to meet the peculiarities of VR. On the other hand, we instead found in our hands a complete and only partially adapted version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Bethesda's role-playing masterpiece which, probably due to its gameplay peculiarities, was more easily combined with the virtual platform without the need for any particular alterations. And now we're here to talk about Fallout 4 VR which follows the publisher's other RPG very closely in terms of vastness of the gaming experience but comes with a certainly wider baggage of tweaks to the basic mechanics to meet the controllers and the immersiveness of virtual reality. Even if, probably, rather than retouching, we should talk about compromises. Don't call it a port At first glance this could really be the noun to be used to define the VR version of Fallout 4: a mere port. The game is in fact that, untouched and complete in its hundreds of hours of primary and secondary quests, with unchanged environments, weapons, equipment and everything else that has characterized this production. It is also, and above all for this reason, that we refer you to our review of the original title to get an adequate representation of what Fallout 4 is and above all how it is, given that here we will focus exclusively on the VR version. In reality, however, this adaptation to virtual reality has evidently required a very substantial work if we have in mind the structure of the dialogues and above all of the interaction menus that distinguish the fourth chapter of the post-apocalyptic series. Let's start with movement management which, for a change, is relegated to a teleportation system that now seems to have become the common practice of video games in VR. It is always possible to use a direct movement function where the protagonist can walk using one of the two d-pads of the HTC Vive 3D Controller (or the Oculus Rift Touch) but considering the numerous ups and downs of the game map, it is practically impossible do not suffer from motion sickness during gaming sessions. Returning therefore to the obligatory choice of teleportation, we find ourselves faced with a decidedly anomalous mixed situation: navigation is in fact classic with pressing the d-pad and the usual navigator that indicates the landing point but a consumption of action points has been implemented associated with this type of travel. In other words, by teleporting we will get tired and, after a couple of ~jumps~ at the maximum distance, we will be forced to move very little, making longer journeys really annoying since we will have to proceed with countless ~jumps~. Among other things, although it is always possible to turn around with the movement of the head, it is often necessary to actually rotate the protagonist's body, especially near obstacles or in interiors, and this movement is relegated to the right d-pad for reasons we don't know. since dedicating all the movements to the left controller would certainly have been more intuitive. But unfortunately the difficulties do not end there. Fallout 4 is a game full of menus: loot and inventory management, but above all the use of the pip-boy on the arm, are just the most eye-catching elements of an RPG that relies heavily on interaction with items and with statistics. Managing them with the two controllers by alternating the pressure of the triggers with that of the d-pads, sometimes having to use the scrolling of the fingers on the touch surfaces, makes these activities extremely cumbersome and very unpleasant especially when you start spending dozens of hours on the title or maybe you find yourself in a room with seven, eight enemies to loot and a dozen shelves and bookcases to rummage through. And then there's the loved-hated pip-boy. By default, it is activated by rotating the left wrist, as if you really wanted to observe it, and this operation enlarges it until its screen is perfectly legible. The problem is that the interface of the latter has remained the exact same as the title in the ~normal~ version and therefore, even here, we find ourselves having to navigate dozens of menus by alternating triggers,d-pad and scrolls above. Plus the aggravating circumstance of wrist rotation. We let you imagine what it's like to move across the map or inventory in these conditions. It would have been enough to implement a simple touch interface to make everything more immediate. Among other things, in Fallout 4 VR the management of the pip-boy takes place in real time, without pausing the game, making this role-playing aspect even more atrocious. Now it is true that it is always possible to enable the secondary function of activating the pip-boy through a key, a feature that brings him completely to the fore with the annexed pause of the game, but it returns to that general discourse that over and over again we find ourselves do with virtual reality. If we are forced to give up all those ~simulations~ that should make us feel inside the game, in order to have a more fluid and immediate gameplay, what is the concrete use of putting a helmet on our heads? Here, precisely this search for a compromise which unfortunately can never be ideal, is the basis of Fallout 4 VR and is already clearly evident when you start the game with the initial menu and the intro that do not ~envelop~ the player but are merely projected in front of his face as if the conversion had been half completed. And where is the gold that glitters? However, we want one crucial factor to be clear: Fallout 4 VR is not a bad title at all, on the contrary it is an immense, complete video game capable of entertaining the player for tens, if not hundreds of hours, exactly like its counterpart for monitors and televisions . In terms of content, this is the path that virtual reality should take and follow, not that of offering trivial 90 or 120-minute micro-experiences where the depth of the gameplay is almost completely missing. Among other things, once you have digested all the woodiness of the controls and interactions, the elements that work very well are immediately evident: not only the exploration but, above all, the fights. Managing the aim from the barrel of the weapon and more generally the fact of holding guns and melee offensive tools always has its great charm in virtual reality and this thing is more than ever in Fallout 4 VR where, wandering through the desolation of the fully armed post-nuclear scenario, goes well with that sense of survival that the game wants to convey. Of course, even in this case there are some shortcomings such as the total absence of precision sights and, above all, the physical interaction with the surrounding world but, again, this is the leitmotif of the entire experience. This last factor can be alienating given that in front of a physical object, one expects to be able to move or hit it by moving the hands, but in reality one has to press a button every time, tearing us away in an instant from that sense of immersion that reality virtual should ensure. On the other hand, the SPAV and the consequent slow motion of the game action remain perfectly implemented which, in addition to allowing us to automatically aim certain parts of the opponent's body, also allows us, in an extremely more effective way than the base game, to launch into shootouts heart-pounding where you can hit numerous targets before they start to counterattack or get too close. We conclude this review with the usual analysis of the graphic aspect. Fallout 4 has never been known for its technical sector and, if possible, this VR version does nothing to improve the situation, perhaps even manages to take a few steps back. We don't know if it's the fault of the elapsed time or the close-up point of view, the fact is that textures and models seemed even more sparse in detail and in low resolution. Only the open-air environments are saved, however they retain their charm and now appear even more mammoth. Nonetheless, the system requirements have been pushed up to accommodate the high demands of virtual reality. Finally, remember that already published DLCs are not included at the moment and it is not clear when they will be implemented, while MOD support is included even if the Creation Club is not present. Furthermore, to anticipate a fairly obvious question, it is not possible to load traditional game saves as they are not compatible.", "date": "2017-12-29", "grade": "7.9"}
