The young protagonist of Glyder 2, after the efforts of the first episode, finds a strange device and decides to take a look at it to understand what it is about her. At a certain point, however, a very strong light comes out of the object, which catapults the girl back into an alternative dimension made up of strange landscapes and lights that float in the air. Fortunately, Eryn's equipment is still in place and will be able to help her get out of trouble this time too, by collecting all the objects indicated by the interface in each of the six available locations. It is an atypical equipment, of course: not everyone goes around with a pair of wings attached to their back, wings that unfold and function exactly like a glider, allowing you to glide for long distances and to take advantage of the warm air currents to gain share. Do you know the flight sessions in Assassin's Creed 2? Well, the gameplay of the latest GLU product is based on the same assumptions: our character can fly, but must continually gain speed and altitude or risk crashing to the ground. There are two indicators that help us keep these values under control, the rest is up to us: control of the wings is completely entrusted to the accelerometer, so we have to tilt the iPhone in order to steer the glider to reach the objects to collect and explore each area. Fly, o-oh Defining Glyder 2 an arcade action game is certainly an understatement. Despite the simplicity of the controls, in fact, the game hides an enormous thickness made up of areas to reach, secrets to reveal, switches to activate and so on. Each of the six available scenarios hides caves, shaded areas that can only be explored by performing particular manoeuvres, for example by diving after reaching a certain altitude or by being carried as high as possible by hot air currents. Among the various objects to collect there are numerous bonuses and upgrades that enrich our equipment not only with alternative costumes, which perform a mere aesthetic function, but also with new wings with different characteristics than the starting ones. There are wings that are more suitable for turning but slow and others that are fast but more complicated to control, and choosing between one or the other can make the difference when it comes to completing a stage 100%. The accelerometer lends itself to our aerial evolutions in the best way, giving an excellent feeling of control and responding promptly to even the slightest solicitations. Flying in Glyder 2 is an operation to be carried out with delicacy and patience, allowing yourself some time to familiarize yourself with the controls and with the philosophy behind the GLU product. As for the technical aspect, the developers have used a graphics engine capable of guaranteeing a constant and fluid frame rate, a factor of primary importance in video games that are based on motion detection: any jerks and drops would in fact make the controls more chaotic and less accurate. Unfortunately, the price to pay is made up of a far from high level of detail, with very bare settings and almost completely devoid of textures. The sound is as essential in the effects as in the music, which in any case can be replaced by a personalized playlist.
