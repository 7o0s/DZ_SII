For many users of this type, the two-handed use of a keyboard or a typewriter is something very natural, but we can guarantee you that for many people it is not so automatic, especially for those who are not children of these modern times. Learn with Pokmon: Adventure between the keys is a rather atypical spin-off, aimed precisely at those who are not so good at using a keyboard. Ideally it should actually teach you how to type, but the results aren't very convincing... An interesting package Have you ever found yourself in front of someone who, grappling with a mysterious keyboard, took two and a half minutes to write your name, curiously looking for the various letters with his index finger? Maybe on a sultry July day, after half an hour in line at the bank, while you mentally cursed, wondering how it was possible that such an incompetent was behind that desk? Did you feel like stepping over the counter and writing your damn name in its place so you could cut it short before you got hysterical? If the answer to these questions is yes, there are two considerations to make: first, you were in line with us and you didn't know it; second, giving Learn with Pokmon: Adventure between the keys to the employee prevented would be absolutely useless. The idea behind this spin-off of the famous Nintendo franchise is decidedly original and the proposal, all in all, should be rewarded: the game package not only contains the cartridge, but also a pedestal for your Nintendo DS and a excellent mini-bluetooth keyboard compatible not only with the portable console, but also with any other device that supports this standard. The peripheral is simple, elegant and quite comfortable, so in fact the price of the game is already justified in itself. The purpose of the software, on the other hand, is another matter: ideally, Nintendo would like to teach you to write with a typical ~QWERTY keyboard~ thanks to a series of challenges, of increasing difficulty, set in the ever-expanding universe of Pokmon; however, the didactic aspect of the game is really small and apart from some really superficial missions in which we would hypothetically be forced to write using all our fingers, there are no particularly useful tips or suggestions for learning how to really do it. At times, it almost seems that the game expects you to have learned to type between one challenge and another, quite unlikely if we consider the target to which the product is aimed. Write them all! The developer Genius Sonority has partially abandoned the role-playing setting of the franchise to marry a structure in levels, to be faced first in a certain order and then at will, in case you want to replay. And you'll want to replay them, because for each level you can unlock various medals and break records, not to mention that it's a Pokmon game and, therefore, you'll have to catch them all. The idea is this: to catch pokmon you'll have to write their names as soon as they appear on the screen. Ideally, our character follows a ~path~ (just like those of the main series) coming across various little creatures: at the beginning the game only asks you to write the initial or part of the name but then, as the levels go by, it becomes necessary not only write the full name, but also do it in the shortest possible time. There are also real bosses, to be defeated in a particular way: to weaken or dodge their attacks you will have to quickly write the letters that appear on the screen, only then can you proceed with their capture. The problem of the game, in fact, lies precisely in this mechanic: not only are the more advanced challenges a bit too complex for a beginner typist, but a good knowledge of the pokmon universe is also required to be able to predict the name to write based on the little creature's screech or sprite; if we then consider the complexity of some names such as Misdreavus or Sandshrew, it is clear that Learn with Pokmon: Adventure between the keys can not find a balance between being sensationally easy or unexpectedly complicated. In short, it is rather unlikely that a child or an inexperienced user will be able to learn somethingwith this Pokmon spin-off, apart from a good number of names of the various creatures. In fact, the game includes about four hundred and it is undeniable that there is something intriguing that leads to completing and recompleting the various levels to fill the PokDex on duty. In this sense, Learn with Pokmon: Adventure between the keys is quite fun, especially recommended as a gift for a particularly smart nephew or cousin. On the other hand, if you intend to buy it precisely with the aim of learning to write like a pro, you might as well take a real typing course.", "date": "2012-10-15", "grade": null}
