{"name": "FORM", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/form-recensione.html", "text": "The review of FORM, which arrives on PlayStation VR almost three years after its release on PC, starts from some interesting narrative assumptions. The protagonist of the game, Dr. Devin Eli, is in fact in Alaska to work on a mysterious experiment in the Mindful Laboratories: the purpose of the expedition is to discover the nature and origins of a disturbing artifact found among the ice, the Obelisk. The object in question seems to hide a strange power, which one day manifests itself unexpectedly and projects Eli into a sort of alternative dimension made of darkness and geometric shapes, with which he initially interacts through the use of luminous orbs linked together by strings of various lengths: perceiving these geometries is an innate ability of our character, who between one puzzle and another will find himself reliving his memories and discovering that, somehow, everything is connected. Gameplay FORM compulsorily requires the use of a pair of Move controllers, given that in many situations we will find ourselves handling multiple objects for the purpose of solving increasingly complex puzzles. Our goal during the adventure is to interact with different artifacts, in a practically closed environment and without the need to move, neither with a teleportation system nor in a free way. Surrounded by an almost constant darkness, at the beginning we will have to identify and grab the ~light chains~ linked to each individual puzzle, then find a way to apply them to the geometric shape in front of us, possibly rotating it or releasing its cavities to make it open and lead us to the next puzzle. Continuing the story, however, different mechanisms will also be introduced, which exploit colors or even sounds to create more complex and multifaceted situations. In various situations, the mechanics of FORM appear quite similar to those of the recent The Room VR: A Dark Matter, see for example the parts in which a device must be used to reveal the true appearance of a scheme and act accordingly on the relative switches. The concept adapts well to virtual reality in terms of the spatiality of the interactions, and even if the lack of movement is inevitably perceived as a limitation, the puzzles prove to be progressively more stimulating and completing them gives a good sense of satisfaction, especially when they come into play some interesting variations on the theme. Unfortunately, the duration of the adventure is quite narrow, so much so that it is possible to complete it within just an hour: very little, although the price of the game on the PlayStation Store is only 14.99 euros. To this we must also add the general lack of a real challenge, given that solving the puzzles never requires who knows what effort and the degree of replayability is limited to the possible discovery of hidden secrets. Playstation 4 trophies The FORM Trophies are just twelve, and unlocking them is not particularly completed. Most of the achievements are in fact linked to the simple completion of the campaign, with only two or three Trophies unlockable by identifying hidden objects. Technical realization FORM boasts an essential but fascinating graphic style, which plays a lot on the contrasts between dark and light to create a great atmosphere, capable of accompanying us from the beginning to the end of the adventure and surprising us during some sequences, especially when approaching the conclusion . Thanks to this expedient, the simplicity of the forms is not seen as a lack, but as a precise choice, and in the end the system proves to be effective. However, the sound design steals the show, which projects us into this mysterious setting and alternatively underlining the various situations very well and becoming a real protagonist when a sound dimension is added to the puzzles. Even the dialogues in English seemed well interpreted.", "date": "2020-05-16", "grade": "7.0"}
