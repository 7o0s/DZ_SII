Or from multiple perspectives, as happens in Mekorama. Martin Magni's puzzle clearly owes something to Monument Valley, as the latter was inspired by Fez and other games based on the ingenious idea of rotating the scenario and discovering new shots to find the solution to space-based puzzles. Mekorama does not go too heavy on the puzzle front, preferring a rather light and dreamy approach, also in this aspect similar to the famous Ustwo title, staging a particular world made of geometric solids and mysterious mechanisms, in which a small and nice little robot, masterfully animated, must move around trying to find the exit in each level, avoiding obstacles, traps and enemies. Touching the screen indicates the direction to take but the protagonist can only reach points that are on the same floor as himself or reachable via stairs, which forces him to use various elevators, mechanisms and passages to be able to reach the different points of the various maps. To find the way it becomes necessary to rotate the screen, which allows you to see the levels from different perspectives revealing hidden passages and mechanisms, therefore in the game an accurate study of the geometric conformation of the structures is essential to find the right path towards the exit. dealing with seemingly impossible vertical displacements. Geometry, perspective and orientation are the fundamental elements of the Mekorama puzzle Walking among the cubes Contrary to what happens in Fez or Echochrome, Mekorama does not resort to optical illusions or spatial variations given by the different perspectives to create new passages and solutions, therefore the puzzles are more elementary and logical, lacking that layer of additional depth given by the interpretation of the geometries, but it cannot be said that the mechanics are too flattened for this, although the game solutions are certainly much simpler and less profound. The greatest difficulty is therefore concentrated in the correct activation of the mechanisms and in finding the way within the intricate geometries of the levels, rather than in the creative reinterpretation of the spaces, making the whole game more focused on exploration and precision of movements than on the solution of puzzles of a certain level. The opportunity for the robot to lose its balance generates another element of sporadic difficulty, with the risk of falling outside the structures and having to repeat the level from the beginning. Despite the complexity of some structures, the level design in general is not such as to generate an always stimulating level of challenge but the variety of situations is also ensured by the presence of a surprising level editor that allows you to expand the game solutions potentially infinitely , giving free rein to the creativity of users who find all the tools available to develop new challenges. Finally, we cannot fail to mention the absolutely fair and supportive monetization system adopted by the developer with Mekorama: Martin Magni does not ask for money to download his game, it is possible simply to make donations in perfect freeware style. Compared to certain perverse drifts of free-to-play, this is another element to be rewarded for this interesting title.", "date": "2016-05-25", "grade": "8.0"}
