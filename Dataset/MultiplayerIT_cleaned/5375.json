The latter case is certainly that of Blendo Games, the name behind Quadrilateral Cowboy which will perhaps say little to those who do not hang around the independent scene. Brendon Chung, founder and only member of the ~team~, is certainly worthy of respect, given that he has been active in the gaming scene since 1999. Among his beginnings it is possible to list a series of appreciated mods for titles such as Half-Life 2 and Doom 3, before making the definitive leap towards making full games. For lovers of Chung's work, the one carried out with Quadrilateral Cowboy represents a particularly awaited return, given that the appointment with the predecessor of this title dates back to 2012, the year Thirty Flights of Loving was released. Taking up the unmistakable style of the latter project, but also of older experiences such as Gravity Bone, with Quadrilateral Cowboy the developer has not stopped his will to change the cards on the table. At this point, we just have to put on our hacker clothes to find out what it is. Quadrilateral Cowboy takes us straight into the world of hacking, with the mythical charm of 80's cyberpunk! Give me a 56k modem and 256MB of RAM, and I'll rob the world for you The atmosphere in which Quadrilateral Cowboy takes us is that of cyberpunk dated from the 80s, accompanied by some small futuristic element that helps to define the particularity of its style. As mentioned, as soon as we start the game we find ourselves moving in the footsteps of a hacker, engaged together with his group in carrying out thefts on commission. In formal terms, the effort of Blendo Games can be labeled as an adventure, given that the essence of the game is contained in the use of a portable terminal and some gadgets, to be used to solve the puzzles that Quadrilateral Cowboy puts us away in front of. Compared to Thirty Flights of Loving, the new game focuses more on gameplay dynamics, putting the narrative component a little aside: between one theft and another, it is still possible to watch cutscenes that help define a sort of plot, enriched by some element scattered here and there for the scenario. Returning to the actual game, our hacker can plan the shots through virtual reality software, in which his terminal enclosed in a briefcase is found. The latter must be used to open doors or deactivate surveillance cameras, just to give a couple of examples. To carry out these actions, you have to type the commands with your own hands in the small computer's operating system prompt, seeing them executed in the real world when you press the Enter key. For example, inserting the command door1.open(3) into the system will cause the door identified with the name before the dot to open for three seconds: a number that is by no means random, given that it is often the time interval set at our disposal to prevent the alarm from going off in the place we are robbing. When things get a little more difficult, it is therefore necessary to chain several instructions, thus creating mini scripts that allow you to reach the next area of the mission. Among the various opening and closing commands we also find the wait() command, necessary to give a timing to the execution of the list of actions so that the agent can move from one place to another. A bit difficult to explain, but simple to implement: even if the hacking dynamics do not have a particular depth or didactic will like Double Fine's Hack'n'Slash, Brendon Chung must be recognized for having implemented a system that can also be used by those who are not used to juggling command lines and system scripts, through a series of initial aids and an adequate puzzle difficulty curve. As already mentioned, as we progress in the game, our hacker's instrumentation is enriched with some additional gadgets: for example, there is a small rover capable of moving, jumping and connecting to nearby control devices, a base for launching objects (and oneself) to a certain point, and so on. Some of them continue to be controlled via terminal, using ad hoc commands in the related control software. For the duration of the adventure, equal to four-five hours depending on one's skill, the player is continually stimulated to use the new elements to find the best solution to the riddle of the moment, but at the same time Quadrilateral Cowboy does not try to go beyond a certain limit. The main criticism that we feel we can move towards the last effort di Blendo Games is definitely this: the adventure ends just when the player feels safe enough to be able to enjoy a certain freedom of action, thus renouncing to test those who simply want to have some more demanding challenges ahead. Fortunately, from this point of view everything remains a bit open, given that Quadrilateral Cowboy came out with full mod support, thus making sure that we can hope for the work of the fans to get some additional missions. Perfectionists, on the other hand, can try to improve their times to complete those that already exist, comparing them with those of friends to find out who is the fastest hacker. Quadrilateral heads Graphically, Quadrilateral Cowboy shares the same world made of 3D blocks with Thirty Flights of Loving and Gravity Bone, including the cubic heads of its protagonists. Compared to previous experiences, Brendon Chung has passed from the old id Tech 2 engine (that of Quake II) to the ~newer~ id Tech 4 of Doom 3. A necessary leap according to the developer, in order to be able to count on more modern tools capable to implement his vision of the Quadrilateral Cowboy. The hackers protagonists of the game are shown a bit like the ones Hollywood got used to us between the 80s and 90s, engaged in ticking commands in the prompt of a DOS-like with the head in the monitor in a dark room. There is no shortage of references to information technology and the videogame world of the time, starting with the unforgettable Amiga guru meditation along with other goodies that we leave you with the pleasure of discovering for yourself. The soundtrack is excellent, chosen with obvious care to make it an integral part of the atmosphere conceived by the creator of Quadrilateral Cowboy. In strictly technical terms, we point out some instability of the code: during the same mission, for example, the game crashed completely a couple of times in a row, thus forcing us to restart it. Another time it happened that the launch pad control pad no longer responded to commands, forcing us to reload the mission from scratch. Luckily there is an autosave system, so even in the worst case scenario you won't lose a lot of progress.", "date": "2016-08-01", "grade": "8.7"}
