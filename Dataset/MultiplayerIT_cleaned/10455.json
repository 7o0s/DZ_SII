Like balance, for example, and survival related to it: that's what You, Me and the Cubes is all about. A better title could not have been chosen for a game that puts us in such an intimate relationship with these little beings with an ephemeral existence, firmly anchored to the idea of balance and the need not to fall, vehemently launched on these cubes suspended over the void and always on the edge of the abyss: a life in the balance, in the true sense of the word. The aim of the game is therefore the survival of the ~Pincopallo~ (rather ridiculous name, we agree, but think about what would have happened by keeping the original name of ~Fallos~), or tiny little beings of human form, for some reason destined to live above cubes of different shapes and characteristics. It is a question of playing with gravity, trying to keep a pre-established number of Pincopallo in balance above the cubes, preventing them from falling into the surrounding void, within a certain time limit: the schemes are made up of increasingly numerous cubes as one proceeds , suspended in the void. The only possible action for the player is the creation (by shaking the Wii Remote) and the launch (again shaking the Remote) of the little beings in pairs above these solids, with the ability to precisely select (using the pointer) the point where these they will land. Based on the arrangement of the little men above the cubes (or rather, on the polyhedral structures formed by the union of various cubes) the entire suspended structure will incline due to the effect of the weight and it is up to us to try to balance the balance by arranging the beings in a as uniform as possible in order to distribute the weights and prevent the excessive slope from sliding the Pincopallo into the void, bearing in mind the need to keep at least one of these on each cube. If we manage to keep a given number of little men in balance within the pre-established time, we move on to the next scheme, essentially made up of the same cubes with the addition of a new interlocking one, up to the passage of the level. A life on the cube The fundamental structure of the gameplay, in itself already quite deep although not excessively varied, is enriched with some occasional variants that complicate things. In the more advanced levels, for example, atypical cubes appear: while the normal ones have standard surfaces and shapes, which undergo only the action of gravity, the special cubes are characterized by some fundamental differences. Some have numbers on each face, indicating the maximum number of Pincopallo that can be placed on each of them; others have more slippery surfaces than normal, still others are ~bouncy~ and obviously increase the chances of falling of the little creatures. To these ~environmental~ dangers are added real enemies: from time to time the process of creating the little men generates a ~phantom Pincopallo~, i.e. an individual who, characterized by a pale color and a decidedly petty character, tries in all the ways of pushing others off the edge of the cubes, necessitating a precise throw of Pincoball against it. The fall of each individual determines a certain loss of seconds, but there are also positive bonuses: by eliminating the ghosts you get additional seconds, or by throwing the creatures at the best points of the structures you get stability bonuses that make them more resistant to the effects of gravity. Also noteworthy is the particular behavior of the Pincopallos: perhaps aware of the precariousness of their condition, these small individuals try as much as possible to help each other, doing their utmost in rescue actions when a similar one of theirs in the vicinity finds itself in difficulty, which, moreover, increases in somehow the empathy for these little inhabitants of the cubes. There is a cooperative multiplayer mode that allows two players to tackle the various levels, acting simultaneously on the same game and therefore requiring a harmonious collaboration between the two users, who will find themselves managing the Pincopallo above the cubes together: the situation summarized in optimally right from the title of the game, on the other hand. The representation of You, Me and the Cubes would make it an ideal candidate to be part of the ~Art Style~ series, given the minimalist but clean and pleasant characterization of the graphics sector, with a particular mention to be made for the Pincopallos: whose animations and behavioral routines add a lively note to the general austerity.", "date": "2009-10-20", "grade": "8.0"}
