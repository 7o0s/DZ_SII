Sure, there's a ball to hit in the back of the net, and two teams facing each other, but the rules are decidedly different... or rather, there aren't. Offsides, throw-ins, fouls and so on, are all factors absent in Nintendo's production, replaced by special moves, bonuses, shoulder and ruthless slides. But first of all you have to choose the captain of your team, available from a list of the ~usual suspects~: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Waluigi, Wario, Bowser and Donkey Kong (plus 2 to unlock), each with different characteristics of running, attack, defense and accuracy in passing. A careful analysis must also be made for the choice of the other team members, selectable from 8 historical ~supporting actors~: Toad, Boo, Tartosso, Tantatalpa, Koopa, Strutzi, Martelkoopa and Shy Guy. Even the latter are in fact well differentiated in their characteristics and special abilities, and being able to organize a balanced and valid training can often constitute a big difference compared to a group chosen ~at random~. It is therefore clear that Next Level Games wanted to listen to the criticisms, thus trying to increase the depth and customization of its product, and in this sense the Super Abilities available for each captain are included. In fact, in addition to earning shells, bananas, bombs, mushrooms and so on to be used to your advantage, on the occasion of the loaded shots it is possible to obtain precisely a special move with devastating potential; For example, Mario becomes a huge Super Mario, Waluigi creates an impassable barrier, Yoshi turns into an egg by rolling over his opponents, etc. And could perhaps miss a mega shot? Certainly not: just hold down the B key (only with the captain though) to see a semicircle indicator similar to that of golf games appear above his head. A first shot to determine how many balls to shoot, and a second for their accuracy and power; yes because with a single Mega-shot you can score up to 6 goals, with all that this can entail in the economy of a game. Fortunately, there is a way to minimize or cancel the damage in case we find ourselves having to defend ourselves against such a move; all this by temporarily taking control of the goalkeeper and trying to center with the wiimote and then blocking incoming balls. Obviously the mega-shot is not a simple weapon to use, and the time it takes to be able to be fired is so long as to allow its use only on rare occasions. One step closer Mario Strikers Charged Football essentially does not differ from what was offered in the first episode of the series, to the point of being immediately familiar and accessible to those who had already gained experience on GC. Nevertheless, it would be decidedly inappropriate to accuse programmers of laziness, since the improvements and fixes are there and can be seen. First of all, the problem related to the lack of longevity and the reduced variety in the game modes has been solved; the traditional ~Striker Cup~, i.e. a series of tournaments of increasing difficulty against opponents controlled by the CPU, have been added the ~Striker Challenges~. In the latter, one is called upon to face pre-established challenges, in most cases trying to overturn rather tangled situations; for example being able to close the match by scoring a golden goal, or overturning an unfavorable result in the space of a few seconds and so on. In addition to personal satisfaction, being able to solve the various challenges allows you to obtain player cards, with which you can then unlock various cheats and bonuses. Obviously there is no lack of a way to challenge your friends on the same console, but the big news and the reason why this Mario Strikers has gained particular attention is that it represents the debut of the Wii in the world of online multiplayer. Following a line of management of the service similar to the one already adopted with the Nintendo DS, in this case too Nintendo wanted to keep the situation firmly in hand, rather markedly limiting the offer compared to the incredibly robust one from Microsoft or the promising one from Sony. For example, there are again the friend codes, or rather the frankly annoying series of identification numbers of each user, to be entered meticulously in order to add someone (accompanied by a personal Mii) to your friends list. Obviously it is also allowed to challenge an opponent chosen at random from those online. Despite the rich component linked to game statistics, it is indisputable that the absenceof any communication between players, starting from the vocal one, significantly resizes the online experience offered by Mario Strikers Charged Football. On the other hand, the quality of the servers is very good, able to accurately indicate the goodness of the connection with another user before starting the game, thus avoiding running into games conditioned by lag. Finally, it is allowed to play up to 4 users, however divided on two consoles: therefore no games with four friends each at home. Moving on to the control system, the programmers intelligently preferred not to force by exaggerating the use of the Wiimote's capabilities; on the contrary Charged is controlled largely like a traditional title, where the only concessions in this sense are offered by the shoulder thrusts (shaking the remote control), the Megashock (shaking the Nunchuk) and the parade of Mega shots, which we have already talked about. The technical component, on the other hand, is in line with what has been seen so far on the Wii; the comparison with the episode for Gamecube in fact underlines a significant improvement in every respect, but nothing striking or sensational. The stadiums are good, about ten in all including the 7 of the episode for GC, each with its own setting and related peculiar characteristics. Comment Mario Strikers Charged Football represents a valid evolution of the episode that appeared on Gamecube, which finds its most valuable aspect above all in the online mode, capable of amplifying its distinctly multiplayer game qualities. Fun, immediately enjoyable but also endowed with a certain depth, however, it does not fully fall into the category of games to be recommended without reservations due to a mechanic that in the long run gives rise to some perplexities. Pros Fixes many flaws of the first episode Fun right from the start Finally online multiplayer on Wii Cons Friend Code and no chat between users Maybe too chaotic Sometimes frustrating It was the year 2002 when Sega released the nice Sega Soccer Slam, a rather original ultra-arcade digression on the football theme. Black Box Games, the team responsible for development, was then acquired by Next Level Games, which with the experience gained on this project managed to convince Nintendo to produce Super Mario Strikers (Mario Smash Football in Europe), released on Gamecube at the end of 2005 Given the good success achieved, in Kyoto they thought well of transforming the aforementioned debut into a series, which after the presentation in Leipzig last year, sees today the debut of the second episode on the Wii.", "date": "2007-06-07", "grade": null}
