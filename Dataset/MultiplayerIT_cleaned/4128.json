{"name": "The Banner Saga 3: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-banner-saga-3-recensione.html", "text": "The birth of The Banner Saga is linked to the Kickstarter boom: it was in fact 2012 when the trio of former BioWare employees made up of Arnie Jorgensen, John Watson and Alex Thomas resorted to the crowdfunding platform to implement their idea of a strategic shifts with a strong narrative component. The community of players welcomed the project, to the point of satisfying the economic request with 700% of the funds compared to the request of Stoic Studio to carry out the work. A support that in retrospect we can define undoubtedly deserved given the quality of The Banner Saga, which allowed the game and its sequel to also arrive on mobile devices and consoles, including Nintendo Switch for a couple of months. Despite the success, the soul of The Banner Saga has remained independent, and to complete the trilogy it was necessary to make a further step on Kickstarter. The Banner Saga 3 was in fact also financed through crowdfunding just over a year ago, and is finally ready to tell us about the end of the journey undertaken by its protagonists. It does it even earlier than the initially planned release date, brought forward by a good five months from December to July 2018: a rarity in times of postponements and delays. After spending another ten hours between Arberrang and dark places, here is our review. The plot: what time is the end of the world? As we said on the occasion of our last meeting with The Banner Saga 3, talking about the story of this final chapter forces us to make connections with the plot of the previous two episodes. It is in fact a trilogy whose chapters are strongly linked to each other, so there is no way to do otherwise: if you are interested in recovering this series, the warning is a must. Having said that, the events told in The Banner Saga 3 pick up directly where The Banner Saga 2 left off, with the caravan from Skogr now arriving at the gates of Arberrang, capital of the kingdom of Men. Besieged by the Darkness that has now spread to a very large part of the world, Arberrang is faced with the arrival of all the people seeking shelter behind its walls, driven not only by the unstoppable advance of the mysterious black magic but also by the presence in their own lands of the Destroyers, enemies of Men and Varl who are also fleeing their home due to the spread of Darkness. The collapse of civilization and the world is therefore imminent, but there is one last hope of salvation: the second group of Iver, guided by the words of the curators Juno and Eyvind according to which the possibility of putting an end to everything lies precisely in the Darkness. The varl and his strange company therefore have no choice but to enter the corrupted lands, in a kind of imitation of Frodo with the Ring while the rest of the world continues to defend itself to the bitter end. We have already said enough about the story of The Banner Saga 3 and we won't go any further, except to say that the game keeps its promise to give an epilogue to the adventure we started four years ago. The ending we are witnessing is also linked to the choices made in the previous chapters, but above all to what we decide to do in The Banner Saga 3, which as usual does not hold back in putting us in front of sometimes seemingly harmless crossroads, but capable of unleashing instead rather heavy effects. The choices we make touch on rather mature topics, teasing the player's ethical sense, surprising the latter also by their proximity to the historical moment in which we find ourselves in the real world. If all this sounds a bit sibylline, you'll understand when you play. As for the evolution of the plot, Stoic Studio adopts in The Banner Saga 3 what is somewhat the same philosophy as George R.R. Martin: No character is truly safe and can risk their life in the face of the wrong choice. At the end, we feel like saying that there were too many characters introduced during the trilogy. Some of them crop up every now and then in dialogue, but it seems like a gimmick to motivate their presence among our ranks without making a real contribution to the story. Others, on the other hand, remain only an alternative for fighting. By putting less meat on the fire, more space could have been dedicated to the main characters. The gameplay: lots of decisions and turn-based combat The game mechanics of The Banner Saga 3 remain broadly the same as its two predecessors, with some changes related to the two main aspects into which the game is divided. In fact, we recall that the gameplay of the series is divided between the role-playing-management phase, in which the many dialogues are faced and one takes care of one's group, and thatturn-based strategy, linked instead to the fights. As for the first, The Banner Saga 3 shifts the needle of its balance more sharply towards role-playing, using the evolutions of the plot to eliminate the need to look after the livelihood of the caravan. There is therefore a lot to discuss and many decisions to make, with no hesitation on the part of the developers in punishing the player harshly in case of a wrong choice. We imagine that these dynamics may be frustrating for someone, but in the intentions of Stoic Studio they serve to represent the sense of overwhelm that overwhelms the protagonists of The Banner Saga through an increasingly imminent end of the world. Turning instead to combat, everything happens as in the past: the attacker's life points and the defender's armor are the statistics that determine the outcome of an attack, net of the particular abilities of the various characters. Upon reaching level eleven, each of them can claim a heroic title, thus going to specialize with additional stats in a certain style of play. It thus becomes possible to specialize in a more accentuated way figures such as the solitary hunter, the tank that takes the blows for everyone, and so on. The most interesting news are related to the clashes that take place in the Darkness, both in terms of the new enemies we meet and the dynamics that regulate them. If you have read our tried a few weeks ago on The Banner Saga 3 you will know what we are talking about. Compared to it we can add that the clashes now make greater use of the obstacles on the map, thus offering in some cases an additional factor to take into account when developing one's tactics. As for the Valka spear instead, introduced for the Iver group instead of the horn which offers will points, we must say that we had mixed feelings: its diagonal advance between enemies makes it extremely difficult to use, but once primed a line the satisfaction of frying enemies is so much. A final note on the difficulty of the clashes, a little too much of a dancer: we happened to witness clashes in which you win effortlessly, followed immediately by battles where achieving victory was really complicated. This happened above all in the Darkness, where after a certain number of rounds reinforcements arrive for the enemies which allow them to turn the tide of the clash. However, the effects of a lost fight on the plot didn't give us the impression that they could have the same weight as a wrong decision in the dialogues, but to know for sure it would be necessary to go back several times through some stages of the game. Always inspiring graphics and sound On a stylistic level, The Banner Saga 3 remains a jewel like its predecessors. Even if in the epilogue we go much less to admire the wonders of the world conceived by Stoic Studio, the artistic work done by the development team remains commendable for its particular inspiration, whether it is to represent the decadent majesty of Arberrang and the its desperate population, whether the meanders of Darkness are to be shown. From the latter point of view it is quite interesting to take a look at the effects of dark magic on previously known lands and creatures, distorted by the Darkness. The enemies we face in the latter are in fact Men, Varl and Destroyers, who in contact with magic have been absorbed by it and transformed to become a species of purple zombies. As usual, most of the dialogues take place with semi-static shots of the characters, while the animated scenes intervene only in the parts most relevant to the development of the plot. Given the great expectation of the fans for the end of the story, in the final scenes a little more could perhaps have been done to describe the epilogue of a story that lasted four years, but we must not forget what has remained a low budget nature. The soundtrack signed by Austin Wintory is always very inspired and impressive, a name that has now become a guarantee for this composer who established himself thanks to the collaboration with Thatgamecompany. Unlike the first two chapters, The Banner Saga 3 arrives with the Italian translation already present in the subtitles, without forcing the player to resort to external updates. In the version played for the review in some cases the translation sounded a bit strange, and we had to resort to the English language to understand what we were talking about in detail. However, these are problems that can easily be corrected later.", "date": "2018-07-26", "grade": "8.2"}
