An objectively very short period of time, even for mobile standards, which however does not critically affect the value of a title that can count on undoubted qualities. Quick and painless The protagonist of the game is an anonymous astronaut charged with visiting a space station of which contact has been lost: however, it takes a few moments to understand that more than something has gone wrong and therefore a normal reconnaissance mission turns into a fight for survival. All this is declined in a product that could be defined as a concentrate of ~metroidvania~: the basic structure is therefore that of the 2D action adventures that belong to this large family, but it is devoted to the most absolute immediacy and simplicity, as there are no maps, no inventory screens, and no menus whatsoever. The character is controlled via a system of virtual keys on the screen, consisting of two arrows for movement, a button for jumping and another context sensitive, useful for example for picking up objects or activating mechanisms. While relying on such an elementary architecture, Space Expedition still manages to offer a lot of variety during the 9 chapters that make up the adventure. Mainly thanks to an extremely well-chosen design, capable of presenting very different challenges to the player: there are moments of pure exploration, environmental puzzles, classic platform-style sections, moments in which you have to show off your best reflexes and even some hint of a shooter . All in very rapid succession and without even a screen being wasted for a simple transition step. Space Expedition is a title that in (too) a short time manages to offer a quality adventure Space Expedition also enjoys overturning the canonical progression model usually adopted by all ~metroidvanias~: therefore the protagonist begins with a nice jetpack on which to rely to overcome the most difficult jumps, only to lose it during the adventure forcing the player to have to move much more carefully. While not offering particularly difficult passages, the title in certain situations relies on the ~trial and error~, supported however by a very generous checkpoint system that secures the gameplay from the risk of frustration. However, we must be careful when closing the application, since the progress is saved only at the end of each chapter: during our test we happened to interrupt the game at the current level and then find ourselves forced to start it all over again one after restarting the software. This is certainly not a big problem, given that the stages generally last a handful of minutes and the title - as mentioned at the beginning - is finished in less than an hour: in our case, we completed the adventure in 39 minutes managing moreover to collect all the crystals hidden in the various stages, the only possible replayability factor in case you want to see an alternative ending. This is not actually a great stimulus, considering the modest narrative sector of Space Expedition: the story is very simple and the causes of the disaster that hit the station remain too vague, barely hinted at by the short text messages that are recovered along the I walk. Instead, what works very well is the atmosphere, supported by an audiovisual sector that performs its task in a more than excellent way: the pixel art graphics succeed with a few elements in conveying the sensation of the amenity of the environment, while the sound uses absolutely effective music and effects, so much so that the game in the initial screen recommends the use of headphones.", "date": "2014-11-25", "grade": "7.7"}
