{"name": "Sixit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sixit-recensione.html", "text": "Sometimes it happens to be completely blown away by a small game for mobile platforms, as we see in this review of Sixit, struck perhaps more than necessary by a simple but irresistible idea and by a series of chained follies that seem tuned right into the right wavelength. It is even more surprising due to the fact that it is a title distributed practically for free, as free-to-play with some advertising, but absolutely devoid of any micro-transaction or mechanism that pushes towards in-app purchases: it is simply of a project that the Star Garden Games team wanted to distribute almost free of charge perhaps to spread their name a little, with the purchase for 1.99 euros to eliminate the advertising which is almost a duty towards the developers, considering also how the Ads hardly disturb the gaming experience. Also for this reason, it is a title that we recommend everyone to download and try: it won't last long, but it is able to offer a pleasant experience for anyone, net of some possible frustration that can emerge from some puzzles a bit too much wacky. History Sixit asks us to save a village from an impending cataclysm, but using only 6 actions The mechanics of the game are brilliant, in its extreme simplicity: the little fox (or rather ~some kind of mammal~) protagonist of the game, Pep, finds himself the only hope in a world threatened by a constant and sentient storm which threatens to wipe out everything. Beyond the strange story complete with rather crazy twists, the gameplay is all based on the possibility of using a maximum of 6 actions in a game, after which we are forced to return to the base and try again in a sort of roguelike structure but applied to graphic adventure. At first, Pep is unable to do anything but progressively he comes to unlock six possible actions with which to interact with the characters and elements of the scenario, allowing you to talk, jump, sprint, smash objects and other possibilities that open up new paths. just like in some kind of metroidvania. The mixture of characteristics borrowed from different genres may seem not very homogeneous, but somehow Sixit manages to amalgamate all these elements thanks to its basic strangeness, managing to take on a remarkable sense and a very strong identity. An adventure in six actions The limitations we have to deal with are essentially two: being able to perform only 6 actions in each game loop and the fact that we have to select which actions to ~take with us~ at the beginning of each new session, bearing in mind that these are arranged on a sort of circle and can only be performed in the sequence set by this menu, inevitably passing from one to the next in a clockwise direction. This imposes careful planning of every single move to be made for each trip in order to fall precisely within the imposed limits and requires a period of exploration, reconnaissance and testing to then elaborate strategies precise to the millimeter to fall within the requests. It is necessary to first understand what the precise effects of each action are on the subjects with whom we interact and study the correct sequence of maneuvers to be carried out to achieve the objectives, in a mixture of platform tests and puzzle solving from a classic graphic adventure. Every time we restart from the base we have to start over from the beginning, but the objectives achieved at the end of the ~quests~ remain, as well as the knowledge acquired, thus allowing us to progress in history. Sixit's characters are decidedly bizarre, like its story The result is a real multi-level puzzle, which ingeniously mixes the graphic adventure with the roguelike, with some platform elements, albeit very basic. As if this were not already enough to give Sixit considerable originality, its strange characterization makes it particularly memorable: all the characters, the dialogues and the situations in which we find ourselves are infused with a bizarre surreal and sarcastic humor, which clearly clashes with the It looks cute from a children's picture book. In many respects it recalls the excellent Pikuniku of Sectordub, with which it shares several elements in the aesthetics and in the spirit that pervades the strange game world, even if the mechanisms underlying the gameplay are decidedly different. The aim of the game is to bring Pep to confront the mysterious sentient storm directly, which will also put us in front of ~shocking~ twists, so to speak. However, it should be noted that it is possible to reach the ending in different ways, with the need to complete all the various questsoptional to be able to access the actual conclusion. However, it won't take long, as the game is short and can be completed within a couple of hours, but it's an experience worth trying.", "date": "2021-06-12", "grade": "8.2"}
