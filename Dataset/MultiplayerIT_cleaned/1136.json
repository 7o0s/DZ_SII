{"name": "Flatout: Recensione PS2/Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flatout-recensione-ps2xbox.html", "text": "I destroy you The heart of Flatout is one hundred percent arcade, once we have mastered the steering we just have to mercilessly press the accelerator, skid like a rally professional and hit the opponent. It is at this point that we meet the core of the game, which is the implementation of an all-encompassing physics engine and not just limited to the vehicle. The affected vehicles will skid crashing into piles of wheels, bins, fences and tanks and each object will probably react to the impact, unleashing orgies of fragments and debris thrown in all directions. As if that weren't enough, a nice head-on will cause our pilot to actually take off, making him splash over the windshield and ending up, at worst, against some obstacle. As if that weren't enough, the destructibility of the car has reached the ne plus ultra of this generation, sometimes leaving us aboard mere skeletons on fire and hindered in driving by the deformed axle, crumbled tires and the now non-existent set-up. Affected vehicles will skid by crashing into stacks of wheels, bins, fences and tanks and each object will likely react to the impact I destroy you As coachbuilders, even if we have to settle for less variety than a title in the Gran Turismo series, we will have various possibilities to customize and enhance our car, even going so far as to modify, albeit limited, the driving style and the effectiveness of the impacts. You scratched my car Flatout puts us on dirty and dusty tracks, deafened by a loud soundtrack and equipped with voluminous and bombastic cars. The races, 45, cross the United States circuit by circuit moving from the dust and farms of the Deep South to the asphalt, then reaching snowy valleys and stretches of road. Our career is to categorically destroy each opponent while preserving our vehicle long enough to reach the finish line and get the prize money. With the money earned we will therefore have the honor and the burden of increasing the performance of our car or buying a new racing car that will help us in the difficult task of annihilating increasingly fierce opponents. Our climb to success will take us through 4 different categories and will give us the opportunity to face improbable mini-games based on the physical peculiarities of the game. We will therefore have to deal with abysmal jumps or we will have to hit different targets by projecting our alter ego over the windshield, over the hood, over the obstacle just hit until we reach different objectives from time to time. While the most challenging mini-game with the most variables forces us to knock down pins with our foremen, the most satisfying for our destructive ambitions is the one that sees us projected towards the sky, beyond a football goal. As icing on the cake there are arenas that represent the true homeland of demolition derbies. Ellipses and closed spaces with an imperfect design are intended for clashes without escape and without a goal other than to resist the assaults of the opponents for as long as possible and to inflict considerable damage on them without compromising vital parts of our beloved sacrificial wreck. The arcade according to Bugbear The driving model, as anticipated, is distinctly arcade and draws both from Destruction Derby and its sprung machines, and from more modern titles such as Burnout and the result proves to be appreciable. We will therefore be able to reach great speeds but we will face ever greater instability with deadly consequences in the event of collisions when cornering or clumsy jumps. To achieve exceptional speed, or quickly recover optimal speed in the event of an accident, we will have a nitrogen superfuel at our disposal. Although the use of Nitro must be measured with a dropper and carried out in particular points of the route, as happened in the old Super Offroad, the way to obtain it is much more similar to that adopted by Burnout. In this case, instead of transgressing the rules of the road, we will have to demolish as many opponents and objects scattered on the field trying not to slow down too much and not lose control of the car. Nice but not too much Graphically Flatout performs well with a high and stable framerate despite the amount of objects scattered around the tracks. The choice of colors is spot on, especially when it comes to mentioning the dusty southern circuits where the demolition derby tradition was born. The detail of the cars is remarkable and in some cases we will even be able to see the Nitro tank or some cables dangling in the devastated interior. Despite this, the slopes are almost exclusivelyrural areas and the number of three-dimensional trees, albeit large, let us regret the presence of structures that deserve a look during the passage. the number of three-dimensional trees, albeit large, makes us regret the presence of structures that deserve a look during the passage... Nice but not too much The few farms and distributors present do not show exceptional textures and are almost always of Spartan workmanship. Of course, managing the physics engine of the running game shouldn't be easy considering that there will often be several dozen objects taking off or bouncing, but the general graphic aspect does not hold the comparison with the already mentioned Burnout3 and other titles of this generation. The most valuable technical aspect is therefore represented by the vehicles and the possibility of deformation of the same, a factor capable of generating real abstract sculptures in movement. Nice but not too much Like the other aspects of the game, the sound, as the English would say, is straight, direct, action-oriented. There is no shortage of rock music, screeching sound effects, samples for any type of collision with any kind of material and the high-sounding roar of the engines to dominate. Basically there is everything you need in a game like this. Comment Flatout is an instant fun game. Mastering the unstable vehicles takes some time but the tracks, while well designed, are simple to memorize and tame. However, in the long run, once the various destructive variations have been exhausted, Flatout collides with its own strong point: simplicity. The dozens of random variables related to car control make it almost impossible to try a timed challenge and the management aspect does not reach peaks capable of attracting car tuning enthusiasts. The presence of Live therefore becomes a dominant factor to fully enjoy the title, guaranteeing added value especially to arenas where the unconditional destruction of other players in the flesh is able to soar the production of adrenaline. Pros: Simple, straightforward, destructive Physics engine is more than just an addition 45 races and Live should satisfy fans Unusual and entertaining minigames Cons: Limited, long-distance gameplay Simplistic Extreme randomness can lead to frustration during a difficult race Available for PC, PS2, XBox. The Bugbears, when they had the Flatout project in their hands, must have thought that among the thousand immortal genres that divide the car games, one in particular had been forgotten for too long. The sequels of the icon of the genre, Destruction Derby, have not brought anything new, leaving many to think that equipping cars with missiles and machine guns was the only possible evolution. However, the improvement of physics engines has changed the cards on the table, opening up new possibilities. And one of the first practical applications is called Flatout.", "date": "2004-11-16", "grade": null}
