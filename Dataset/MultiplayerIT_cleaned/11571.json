{"name": "Crimsonland: Mobile Massacre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crimsonland-mobile-massacre_a.html", "text": "The protagonist of the game is an anonymous interstellar marine, left separated from his company after landing on an inhospitable planet, obviously populated by bloodthirsty monstrous creatures. The user's task will be to lead the soldier to safety, in the course of 30 levels full of enemies to be filled with lead. Crimsonland presents a bird's eye view that brings to mind classics such as Gauntlet, with one fundamental difference: to make life easier for mobile gamers, the movement of the protagonist is automatic and follows pre-set tracks visible on the screen in the form of dashed lines. All you have to do is therefore shoot at everything that moves, using the eight keys relating to as many directions. An operation that is not always easy, given the enormous amount of monsters that regularly crowd the scenarios and threaten the precarious health of our marine. The standard equipment with which each stage begins is also rather scarce, being composed exclusively of a simple pistol capable of inflicting little damage at a decidedly bland rate of fire. Fortunately, the levels are full of bonuses that appear randomly, to be collected by pressing a dedicated button as soon as the icon appears on the screen. These are divided into two categories, the real power-ups (which include weapons, smart bombs and so on) and the so-called Perks, or temporary abilities of various types that the user has the possibility to choose each time from a short list (but the game has a total of more than 30 units). Although objectively rather limited, Crimsonland is rather amusing, if only for the continuous carnage that stands out on the display of one's mobile phone: seeing whole hordes of enemies wiped out by a couple of well-aimed rockets (with consequent generous bloodshed) is always a pleasant effect and certainly gives a certain satisfaction. Which, on the other hand, cannot be said of the technical realization of the Herocraft product, which is very unimpressive. The graphics, already debased by a far from spectacular aerial view, offer completely bare scenarios and small and not particularly defined sprites, animated however in a summary way: it will also be the price to pay for the constant crowding of the playing area, but the end result is rather poor. The sound is also very meagre, for a product that obviously didn't focus on these weapons but which is nonetheless to be commended for other aspects, such as the amount of content (also guaranteed by two Quest and Survival modes and 40 different types of monsters) and a winning game formula, which combines action with a pinch of strategy. PRO Simple and fun Good amount of content AGAINST Technically unsatisfactory Long repetitive A bit limiting on rail system", "date": "2008-03-12", "grade": "S.V."}
