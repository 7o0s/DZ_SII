We had to wait for the Nintendo DS conversion of Gyakuten Saiban 1 (conversion provided, among other things, with Anglo-Japanese bilingual text already in the Japanese release) to finally get our hands on this much-vaunted ~lawyer simulator~ and understand if it has the possibility to meet our tastes. Given a theme with a strongly Western flavor despite the setting and the blatantly Japanese tones of the story, it would be natural to answer yes. But then, what would Phoenix Wright have that is so ~incompatible~ with our local conception of video games? It is urgent to make a clarification of vital importance: we are faced with a product with an adventure backbone in the most Japanese sense of the term, i.e. based on a series of anime-style portraits of the characters, who perform sudden changes of expression ranging from comic to the dramatic, all dominated by mountains of text that must necessarily be read and understood in its entirety. And yet, despite this oriental aftertaste, one also perceives a soul that strongly refers to about ten years ago, when LucasArts' point and click adventures were full of acclaim among the most avid gamers: perhaps it will be the humor, or the way to deal with characters and pixelated graphics. But let's go in order. Just like a true detective show, Phoenix Wright rests on an episodic structure whose cases, however, form a network of references and stories closely connected to each other for events and characters. The first chapter immediately presents itself to us with the scene of a crime, and then suddenly catapults us into the shoes of Phoenix Wright, a trainee lawyer on his first case. It was wisely decided, in order to teach the rudiments of the most peculiar game mechanics, to start the adventure immediately in court, where our aim is to present the decisive evidence that exonerates our client defendant, almost always at to the detriment of the testimony of witnesses who often turn out to be the real culprits. To do this, it is necessary to engage in a real battle with the public prosecution fought to the sound of objections, pressure on witnesses and presentation of evidence (collected in the inventory screen as they are presented and often subject to changes and updates as the of the plot). When, exactly, is it possible to carry out all these actions? The cross-examination phase is the real key: while the witness called to testify repeats his statements word for word, he is interrupted to ask for further information should it prove too vague or he is compared in real time with the evidence and documents at his disposal , and as soon as a fact is found that directly contradicts what was said, it is presented to the judge. The real challenge lies in identifying, by means of sometimes weighty and sometimes more intuitive reasoning, the right moment in which to play one's trump card: a moment of distraction is enough to transform one's moment of triumph into a descent into the abyss, because if we use evidence at the wrong time, the judge will decide to penalize us, up to closing the case in favor of the prosecution if the errors were to be repeated more than a certain number of times. The feeling of humiliation in these cases is alive and palpable, but fortunately the game provides a providential free save system that allows you to recover even from the most fatal slips. There are also moments of pure deduction in which one is called upon to express one's opinion (hopefully founded) or to indicate the controversial points of some visual material. Already in the prologue the twists and moments of tension, those in which one is not sure of having done the right thing or one has the impression of groping in the dark while our opponent performs a spectacular backlash, are not spared in the slightest , but precisely for this reason the satisfaction when you finally manage to prove you are right could not be greater. And the emotions are just beginning: already with the second chapter you get to the heart of the action and you have to deal with a whole new phase, the investigative one. Alternating with the three mornings in which the trial takes place, this part leads us to visit the places related to the crime to talk to the people involved or simply to collect important clues and evidence. It is at this moment that Phoenix Wright's more genuinely adventure nature obviously peeps out. The double control system, via stylus and keys, proves effective for all occasions and the two methods can be alternated without too much effort. The sstatic screens that must be examined to collect the objects and the dialogues with the colorful characters are very reminiscent of another DS adventure, that Another Code that has enchanted many (and disappointed others) with its delightfully old school mechanics. We can even say that, despite its previous birth, Phoenix Wright is everything the Cing title wanted to be without succeeding. As in Another Code and in ninety-nine percent of the adventures, however, there are moments in which one gets stuck for having failed to find an object hidden in a pixel of a certain screen, or for having forgotten to examine a single element of a scenario , nor moments in which one has the impression of simply scrolling along the tracks, going by attempts until the event that leads to advance in history is generated. Flashes of suspicion also emerge during trials, because although logic usually has the upper hand, it happens that you have to grope around using all the evidence in your possession (rebooting as many times) until you find the right one, or you have to question a witness thoroughly only to trigger the reaction of the judge or the prosecution. The Phoenix is reborn ~Rise from the Ashes~ is the title of the additional chapter specially designed to work perfectly on the DS. While suffering from an evidently forced insertion within the rigorous storyline of the series, the fifth case succeeds in trying to prolong the experience by offering the player new playful tools. Already starting from the second day of investigation, two indispensable objects are acquired: the Luminol spray, to be sprayed on the surfaces using the touch screen in order to discover bloodstains washed away, and the aluminum powder for detecting fingerprints. After being spread on the point of application, it is blown away with the microphone, and the impressions thus obtained are then compared with those in the archive. In addition, some animated recordings and three-dimensional examination of the objects add an additional touch. Whether it's a test for the making of Gyakuten Saiban 4, the next original episode designed exclusively for the Nintendo DS? The Court of Miracles However, the defects listed above should not mislead the real value of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The degree of addiction that the very good structure of his stories is capable of generating reaches peaks that only the great exponents of the genre manage to reach without any effort. The four 'basic' cases are progressively more engaging, complex and full of twists that follow each other at a dizzying pace and dosed to cause a strong addiction. This work of perfect clockwork would be useless, however, if the protagonists and dialogues weren't up to the stage set up with such skill by Capcom's small team (about thirty people at most). And so here is that a parade of characters now bizarre, now disturbing and fascinating, now completely idiotic, but always and in any case masterfully outlined, makes its appearance on the scenes of an over the top judicial comedy that never falls out of tone. Because the peculiarity of Phoenix Wright, or rather of the entire Gyakuten Saiban series, lies in its ability to never take itself seriously, resulting in it being incredibly touching and full of tension. Between otaku and dark lady, exchanges of barbs between lawyers and judges bordering on contempt of court, improbable forensic tragedies, irresistible puns and unsolved dramas that come back from the past, it's really difficult, if not impossible, to get bored and not smile at all time. All is supported by exceptional artwork, index of a high-level character design and animated according to the most canonical rules of Japanese animation, and by a simply indispensable sound: try to face the procedural sections without the (excellent) music and vehement ~Objection!~ of the young Phoenix and his rival Edgeworth and take note of the marked emotional downgrade they suffer. And when everything seems over and the end credits are over, an unexpected and decided ~One moment!~ arrives: it's time to face the fifth chapter, the one that justifies the entire DS re-release of the game and which is capable of introduce new interesting variations on the theme in lawyer Wright's investigations. A final clarification regarding the Italian translation, which made us wait a long time compared to other European languages before reaching the shops: fortunately the result is excellent, as Nintendo has accustomed us for several years now. Comment Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is linear, yes. blockto the player until he thinks according to his rules and forces him to continue within pre-established tracks, it is true. In light of these two facts, and given that it is, moreover, a conversion from Game Boy Advance, it might seem absurd to say that we are dealing with one of the most valid titles released so far on Nintendo DS. Yet, it is undeniable that this is the case. The game has the sweet and slightly nostalgic flavor of one of those old PC adventures that accompanied the green years of many gamers, but to this we must add the element of freshness and prestige represented by the inclusion, more what a welcome, from the procedural parties, the true heart of the whole experience. The crescendo of events is so well orchestrated and pleasantly over the top as to generate addiction in a short time, and whoever manages not to laugh in front of yet another curtain or not to feel satisfaction when he finally nails a lying witness has only two excuses: either he suffers from a severe allergy to stories with a judicial background, or simply viscerally hates this kind of video game. Pros It's a classic yet extremely original adventure High degree of emotional involvement Divinely characterized characters and stories Cons Too linear structure The farcical atmosphere could irritate those looking for a game with serious and rigorous tones Replayability rate close to zero The latest generation of consoles is seeing the continued affirmation of a decidedly commendable trend: that of bringing American and European players products that were previously thought to be suitable only for the more ~eccentric~ Japanese public. Lack of ideas on the front of ~games for all~? Perhaps. Want to expand a market that could attract a much larger share of users than the one that still follows it constantly, exactly as happens in Japan, where that of gamers is an extremely varied and multifaceted category? Who can tell. As fans of the video game as such, the one that gratifies and amuses those who use it, we can only be happy with the results that this renewed policy has produced in the range of titles available here on various consoles, both portable and home. This premise serves to explain that Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney belongs precisely to that large group of ~niche~ works that just a few years ago would never have had any hope of seeing the light beyond the lands of the Archipelago. It is, in fact, the perfect example to illustrate how times have changed: born in 2001 on Game Boy Advance with the very game we are reviewing today, the Gyakuten Saiban series then saw the birth of two more episodes, they too remained confined to Japan, where they received wide acclaim. In fact, decidedly illustrious personalities from Capcom took part in the project, such as Atsushi Inaba then creator of Viewtiful Joe and Shinji Mikami, a man who definitely needs no introduction; it all started from the idea of a young fan of detective stories and suspense, who wanted to create a game in which it was necessary to interrogate the characters to discover the culprit of a crime. Nothing particularly original, if it hadn't been for a small touch of genius: those same interlocutors didn't necessarily have to be sincere, as always happens in adventure games, but more often than not they would have lied to cover up small and big crimes, leaving the player with the task of unmask them. Once we understood that the best setting for highlighting this feature would have been a full Perry Mason-style court, with the defense attorney busy providing evidence to exonerate his client and at the same time contradicting perjured witnesses, the groundwork for the core of the ~action~ of Gyakuten Saiban was laid.", "date": "2006-03-29", "grade": null}
