One year, indeed nine months after the Japanese release which, as everyone knows, was postponed due to the tragic events of the Thoku earthquake, here comes the spin-off declined to the third-person shooter of the adventures of Kazuma Kiryu and associates, engaged this time not with tamarri tattooed on every street corner, but with a real zombie apocalypse. A real spin off, for a title that completely forgets the fighting game phases to immerse ourselves in a big-grained shooter, which unfortunately fails across the board. The events, while not putting mafia intrigues, vendettas and power games into a corner, are more focused on the plague that is transforming civilians into zombies and mutants - who run, kick and brandish weapons - thirsty for blood, the fruit not of some strange virus, but of military experiments carried out by ruthless arms dealers covertly transgender. Complete with a final mega-gun on who's really alive in interesting times like these. In short, nothing new, and what's worse, you wearily arrive at the end, in about fifteen hours of play, with little interest in the final solution. Red zone or red light zone? A spin off that partially shares the mechanics of the previous episodes. The first difference, as written at the beginning, is that the random fights in the streets of Kamurocho have completely disappeared. The phases in which you walk around the neighborhood serve only as a ~central hub~ for secondary missions, to carry out some steps related to the main story and more generally to stock up, buy and sell weapons and to modify your entire arsenal using the objects that zombies release. The narrative ploy that allowed the developers to divide Dead Souls into two distinct and separate zones is particularly effective. Kamurocho is not all infected. Some areas (which will increase exponentially as you progress through the game) have been closed off by the army using huge bridge carts, but through the sewers you can come and go as you please, either by following the story or by completing tons of side-objectives that see us through. committed to saving people, cleaning up some shops or simply entering to kill zombies with the sole purpose of accumulating experience to level up, thus improving your characteristics and skills. The ~random~ grinding has therefore disappeared, replaced by completely optional and optional possibilities, fortunately not necessary to get to the final stages duly prepared. Then there are all the recreational activities that have always distinguished Yakuza, such as game rooms, karaoke, hostess clubs, casinos, fishing and golf. All of this can also be played individually from the initial menu. Like Yakuza 4, four different characters are played, each equipped with a particular particular weapon. In addition to Kazuma Kiryu, foolish enough to enter the ~red zone~ unarmed, three old acquaintances of the series will join, namely Goro Majima, eye patch and huge shotgun, Ryuji Goda, returning from Yakuza 2, complete with huge arm-mounted machine gun and gold-hearted loan shark Shun Akiyama with John Woo-style double pistol. The story follows the events of the four protagonists, dividing the storylines into watertight compartments that are all too hermetically sealed, which will only eventually merge, but the feeling remains that everything is not very organic and frankly specious, put on the screen more to enhance the individual personality that to crown a choral story as we have seen in the fourth chapter of the franchise. Basic problems Yakuza: Dead Souls is therefore a third-person shooter, a bit Dead Rising, a bit Smash TV, which however doesn't work for a number of reasons that heavily penalize its use. The first, and perhaps most serious, is the control method. The aim is totally automatic, the protagonists should automatically lock onto the closest zombie in front of them, but most of the time it is enough that there is a millimeter difference between the backdrop, the positioning of the body and the objective to misfire and sadly hit a empty. We can therefore adjust the camera with the right stick, a pity that it often gets stuck behind obstacles and objects and that above all it is impressively slow in rotation, so much so that when they are being chased it is better to flee and shoot blindly towards the base of the screen without trying to frame the opponents, hoping that the lock works. To remedy this situation we can push the L1 key, with the telecamera that moves stuck behind the protagonist or worse it is possible, through L2 to stop and hit with precision in subjective. Too bad that the left stick is used to aim with the usual slowness, forcing us to twist our fingers never seen in a third-person shooter. A situation that in the most chaotic phases is exacerbated by criminal collision management. When from about the middle of the game Dead Souls throws all the available fauna into the fray, that is not only prancing zombies, but also undead runners, mutant skaters and avid karatekas, not to mention spitting harpies and mid bosses of various kinds, the the norm is to end up on the ground surrounded and filled with blows. At the start of the animation that sees us jump up, it is constant to get hit again to end up on the ground again, until the evasion timing in the exit ~corridor~ millimeter is correct or the low sweep is enabled. All then in the name of the camera that hides who is behind us or who does not show us the attacks from a distance. This situation is repeated endlessly given that Yakuza: Dead Souls certainly does not shine for variety and level design and indeed constantly recycles the phases of approach to the numerous bosses at the end of the chapter, in a constant and repetitive back tracking for an increasingly Kamurocho devastated and cluttered with rubble that pushes us to fight in narrow alleys, corridors, offices and only rarely pushes us to ~airy~ stages in the square or on the roofs. To overcome this nefarious congestion of zombies, the developers have inserted a system to score real area shots to quickly clean up spaces teeming with rotting bodies. Playstation 3 trophies Yakuza: Dead Souls rewards the player with 49 trophies that engage us in all activities in the game. The ~normal~ ones are obtained with the simple progression in the game, completing the various chapters, while the more complicated ones see us submit to particular conditions, such as killing a certain number of zombies with headshots or using the heat snipe, modifying one or more weapons, dedicating himself to secondary activities, but also fighting together with a hostess. And not only The system called Heat Snipe gives us the possibility, once a bar placed near the health bar has been filled (which is filled simply by raising the kill count), to shoot at particular objects with decidedly pyrotechnic results after the usual quick time event. Not only explosive cans, but also electric substations, tankers full of petrol, dangerously balanced pipes and much more. All generously reported on the screen. It's just a pity that by taking damage the bar decreases, thus returning to the problem of killer collisions set out above. However, we can use energy drinks to restore health and Heat Snipe, being careful not to clog the little space available in the inventory, especially when fighting the numerous bosses. Bosses that in addition to being completely generic and uninspired, despite the many attack patterns, in some situations exacerbate all the problems of the camera / control method combo. There is no shortage of examples, just mention when in a very narrow space we are asked to hit precisely the eyed tentacles of a sea monster dodging attacks that are not very visible or worse when we are forced to use L2 to snipe a fluttering monster while dozens of zombies try to to skin it. It's a real shame that all the good ideas thrown into the fray are then frustrated by basic issues like control and camera. In this sense, the ~roleplaying~ part is a good antidote to the deficient shooter mechanics. It forces us to carefully choose how to spend the money and which extra skills to buy, not only to enable a theoretically more effective head lock, to ~learn~ dodges or low sweeps, but also to increase the capacity of our inventory, to make the upgrades to the most effective weapons and armor. On a technical level, Yakuza: Dead Souls does not differ much from Yakuza 4. The engine is the old one we all know, which gives its best with the models and animations of the game's protagonists, while revealing all its old age in the side elements, with poorly defined textures and certainly not at the top resolution. There are some good special effects, and as usual the motion capture is amazing during the long dialogue phases that narrate the most important junctions. A decided thumbs down for the frame rate that for half of the game, that is, when there are relatively few zombies and mutants, moves smoothly, but when the situation worsens, when Yakuza: Dead Souls throws swithout solution of continuity and with a worrying repetitiveness all the possible infected often goes into crisis, dropping drastically and conspicuously. We close with the localization. As usual the audio is in the language of the Rising Sun while the tons of text are all in English.", "date": "2012-03-21", "grade": "5.5"}
