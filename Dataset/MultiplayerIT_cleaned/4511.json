{"name": "New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-joe-mac-caveman-ninja-recensione.html", "text": "In the early 90s it was really difficult to come across a child who didn't want to be an archaeologist when he grew up. The heroic deeds of Indiana Jones had cast an aura of disturbing heroism on the profession, while the fashion for dinosaurs went wild on TV, newsstands and, of course, also in the world of video games. Joe and Mac, moreover, are really children of that period, a pair of brothers who from the cabinets, to the Super Nintendo, through Mega Drive, Game Boy and many other consoles, with their debut chapter, published in 1991, knew carve out a good slice of fans who would have followed and supported them in the following years too, in sequels and spin-offs that expanded the celebrity of the mascots. After all, what decreed the fortune of the original chapter was above all the setting, which proposed the imaginative encounter between cavemen and dinosaurs, an anachronism that allowed the artists of Data East to create evocative scenarios, populated by brutes and creatures aggressive, but with a funny and light-hearted design. Joe and Mac themselves, brothers desperately searching for their respective daringly kidnapped girlfriends, flaunted a nice, affable, hypertrophied look to the right point. We played for the quality of the action, there is no doubt, but it is equally true that Joe & Mac was a child of its times, anchored to that dimension and to those trends that obviously, for one reason or another, do not exist today more. Let's see why in the review of New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja. No options, a revisable design The main menu of New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja is certainly not generous with available items Not that the passion for dinosaurs has been completely wiped out, of course, nor has the figure of the archaeologist completely lost its charm, but today it is undeniable that space is much more fashionable. Furthermore, video games have undergone a significant evolution, even when dealing with two-dimensional, deliberately retro products. The premise is necessary having to give an opinion to New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja, remake of the progenitor of the saga, further rejuvenation operation performed by the French Microids, which returns to draw heavily on the past of video games, after the more than discreet facelift performed with Toki a few years ago. If the glance of New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja can convince, the excessive recycling of scenarios and many poorly finished animations mortify the graphics of the title The magic this time was only half successful for a very simple reason: it is not known what the target audience of the developers was while they were creating this remake. The paradox, moreover, is immediately apparent, right from the evanescent options screen which, beyond the language, does not allow any choice. It might seem like a trivial detail, but in reality it testifies to the lack of impetus with which the entire production was conceived, which is content to add little and decides to modify precisely where it would have been better to propose something more in line with the original. The art design chosen, the result of Philippe Dessoly's inspiration, already appreciated without reservations in the aforementioned Toki, is not completely convincing. If you can like or not the look of Joe and Mac, indeed so far from the one flaunted in the 90s, you can move sharper criticisms of many inexplicably empty backdrops and animations that are anything but convincing. Where a revival in pixel art would have been welcome, or in any case an art design more similar to that of the original, this soft stroke, generous with bright colors, will surely annoy long-time fans, without necessarily satisfying newbies or those looking for something yes new, but at the same time attentive to detail as it was precisely for Toki. Prehistoric level designs As in the original, New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja also offers some crossroads in which to choose which level to face next Some criticisms can also be made on the gameplay front. The meager menu of options above, to begin with, could have been filled with a short tutorial explaining the basic game mechanics. Furthermore, it would not have been inconvenient to be able to count on some voice with which to mix the experience around one's needs. Difficulty level, extra credits, further aids, all possibilities that would certainly have made the experience more malleable and suitable for a potentially wider audience. Yes, because at present New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja is a two-dimensional platformer with rather challenging action colors and absolutely meager mechanics. New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja offers a challenging experience and out of credits availableyou will have to start the adventure all over again Only two choices can be made from the main menu. Arcade offers the same adventure from 1991. Beyond the jump, the duo of heroes can count on throwing axes with which to make their way through the enemies encountered along the way. By collecting the power-ups assigned to the task, the main weapon can be replaced with boomerangs, incendiary bombs, dinosaur teeth to throw. Furthermore, by eliminating each enemy, this will release food on the spot, essential for replenishing the health bar of Joe and Mac which, in addition to emptying following any collisions with enemies, constantly tends towards zero, except during clashes with end-of-level bosses. This is a feature that gives a rather high pace to the adventure, since the gamer will be indirectly forced to move continuously along the level, trying to eliminate as many enemies as possible. New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja offers a control scheme reduced to the bone: with one button you jump, with the other you attack. Nothing more If we really want, this is the only real distinguishing feature of a title that was certainly fun in 1991, but today much less fascinating, given the progress made by the genre in the meantime. From the platform sections, to the bestiary, passing through the boss fights, everything seems already seen and not even the Extended mode, which adds a handful of new screens for each level, strives to add truly memorable or up-to-date sections in terms of level design. The local co-op, which can be activated at any time, slightly increases the fun, but New Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja lives crushed in a paradox that has no real resolution. It's a remake of an undeniably aged classic from the past, but it does practically nothing to be a true remake.", "date": "2022-12-04", "grade": "6.0"}
