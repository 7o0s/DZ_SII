{"name": "Pro Cycling Manager - Tour De France 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-cycling-manager-tour-de-france-2008-recensione.html", "text": "A thousand opportunities, all good The managerial soul of Pro Cycling Manager 2008 is of exquisite workmanship, guaranteeing a disproportionate amount of different parameters among which to move freely: deciding on the bicycle frame, reading the sector newspapers or dedicating a few minutes to consulting emails, are only some of the activities that surround the most serious commitments in terms of sponsorships and renewal of contracts, team management and organization of resources. What is most surprising, positively, is how much the individual choices made influence all the other sectors of interest in a decisive way, so much so that practically never giving the sensation of not being able to take the executable tasks seriously, on pain of total or partial failure of the imposed goals. Each season is then made up of a very high number of official outings, which cannot necessarily be faced in full  indeed, careful planning is mandatory  but a reflection of the extreme attention paid to the re-proposition of the real commitments that a professional team has to face every year; in addition to the super classics, in Italy, France and Spain, there are a number of opportunities around the world, many of which are unknown to most but soon become the object of the attention of the shrewd player, who can rack up his first victories precisely during these minor events and some money. There are also some secondary defects: impersonating a seven-year-old manager is not very credible - but perhaps it is not even very smart to choose to take on this bizarre possibility - while it is more perplexing when, at the end of a won tender, one has to decide whether to speak with the rider either with the team or with the media, and not with all three. Venial defects, which in no way undermine the final experience, in this profound and long-lived sense. It's not enough to know how to count It's fine to be able to convince an athlete to renew his contract, a sponsor to disburse more money or plan the season to perfection, but then, once you have the pedals on your feet, you have to prove yourself tactically too. Once on the track, the main concern during the long stages - whose speed can still be altered with respect to the natural passage of time - is to make the most of the individual characteristics of each athlete, deciding when to sprint or drink and who to tow the rest of the group, using the statistics that are always visible and adapting the initially developed strategy to the moves adopted by the rest of the cyclists controlled by artificial intelligence. If the normal open-air races will hardly amaze the historic fans of the series, it will be much more pleasant to know that for the first time you can take part in track races, divided into three specialties and endowed with a completely new charm. All the events designed for the single player can also be repeated in multiplayer which, hosting up to 20 players, represents more than a mere tinsel but an incentive to keep alive the beautiful community that has already revolved around this series for some years. The offer is completed by the track editor and that of the cyclists, both complete and functional, even if obviously designed only for the most ardent fans. Practical but no frills From an aesthetic point of view, the first consideration regarding this Cycling Manager 2008 is how much the interface, in the management version or the one available during the race, is rational and well done, placing all the many keys in a clear way and simplifying operations quite a bit . The initial impact, when you are hit by dozens of parameters and screens, therefore wears out quickly and once you get to the first competition you will know exactly how to move to make the appropriate decisions, while during the individual sections of the race the double possibility of managing runners, via the side panel or by clicking directly on them, does not lend itself to any criticism. The discussion on the three-dimensional engine used during the stages is different: given that it would be unthinkable to ask this production to innovate the graphic standards of the current generation and that there are many cyclists on the screen and equipped with a good number of animations, the amount of detail characterizing the seabed is insufficient to say the least, unsuitable for current standards and in contrast with system requests. On the edge of reality is the musical accompaniment: a few kilometers from the finish, the lactic acid that fills the muscles and a couple of rivals who don't want to let go and in the meantime, a pseudo electronic tune in the ears that doesn't you understand how exactly it can return the effort and drama of the moment. This is the classic situationone where you will find yourself, hoping that next year we can get a more effective soundtrack. The commentary is better  the only episode in English but translated, on screen, into Italian  which does not add who knows what but does its job adequately. Bikers in your pocket Also this year the PSP will benefit from a specially designed version of Pro Cycling Manager, capable of adapting to the capabilities of the small Sony home console without making excessive compromises in terms of content and the availability of options. The heart of the title will remain the management of a team, chosen from 18 that actually exist, and will see the player engaged in fewer competitions than the PC incarnation, but still good. There will be track racing, the most important innovation this year, and multiplayer against another human opponent via local Wi-Fi. The release is scheduled for the end of July. Pro Cycling Manager - Tour de France 2008 is available for PC. Comment Pro Cycling Manager  Tour de France 2008 is a solid and well done manager, which continues on a path already traced and which is aimed at a rather specific public. Therefore, if you already own the previous editions, it would be better to understand if the few new features  mainly related to track racing  are worth the purchase, while new users should evaluate how exciting the reflective and technical gameplay can be. If these questions were successful, then the purchase would become recommended and you could prepare for a summer dedicated to cycling, even on your screens.
