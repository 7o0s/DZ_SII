Perhaps we least imagined that Massive flaunted it so blatantly. In working on the review of The Division 2: Warlords of New York however, we once again noticed the love that shines through for The Division and how this has remained unchanged over time, despite the ups and downs of the Ubisoft cover shooter. Warlords of New York is a turning point, a clear ~mea culpa~ compared to some past picks, but an important warning to other rivals in the market: ~we learned from our mistakes and came back stronger than before~. But let's see why. New York New York The snow has given way to unkempt grass, to the thousand abandoned waste deposits on the side of the roads that accompany your every tour around New York. The city of the big apple is beautiful, beautiful, it maintains an undeniable charm perhaps the result of memories of the first moments of The Division, yet after a few minutes it becomes clear that the sensations are not a legacy of the past, but an emblem of the present. The topographical conformation of New York allows you to play with the lighting between the buildings, with the reflections between the remains of the cars or with the noises between one alley and another of some group of enemies. In its desolation, New York is alive, full of more personality than Washington had in its immense history and culture between museums and monuments. Between one ray of sunshine and another, however, New York shows its dark, putrid, rotten side: the Rikers and the Purifiers preside over the areas and the snowy walks of the first chapter have given way to excited moments full of action. New York is certainly home, but a home that we have long since left and that is no longer the same as before. The pretext of a new beginning in Manhattan is therefore the perfect way to introduce the new endgame and narrative development system that will lead the years of support of the Massive Entertainment title from here to the future. However, together with the revolution, the artistic and design side does not change, as if to remark that the characterization of the settings is not an aesthetic frill but a Ubisoft trademark. Storytelling and progression However, the setting is also the fulcrum of the narrative of Warlords of New York, the city is in fact divided into zones each dedicated to a rogue agent (the Warlords in fact) that we will first have to track down and then face in a manhunt that will lead us to the arms of dear old Aaron Keener. The final chapter of the story linked to Aaron Keener is managed in a wise way thanks to the possibilities offered by New York and its characteristic neighborhoods. Each Warlords then has a well-defined peculiarity that takes full advantage of it within an ad hoc scenario and manages to create several memorable moments. Unfortunately, however, these situations are located only in the final part of each section with the traitorous agents, or the missions that lead to the clashes. Each preliminary phase, on the other hand, suffers from a certain watering down which unfortunately can occur in titles of this kind. The feeling seemed to us that of a story well orchestrated and skilfully thought out in its key points but which occasionally gets lost in putting it into practice, due to a system, that of in-game narrative documents, which today is perhaps too jagged and unintuitive. The insights into the figures of the Warlords are there, but for most they will be an optional and completely sideline addition being linked to the recordings and the ECHOs. To take advantage of this situation is precisely the figure of Keener who to date is perhaps one of the most successful of the entire The Division franchise. What didn't convince us, however, is the choice to re-propose this formula even after the end of Keener's narrative arc. Without too many spoilers, once your mission in New York is over you will have to face what is formally Season 1 of The Division 2, which just like other colleagues in the recent past has decided to opt for a seasonal formula of post-launch support. Therefore, given this will, it is essential to characterize each season, and re-proposing the formula of the ~four mini bosses to get to the final super boss~ twice in a row is perhaps not the right choice. Therefore, if narratively and artistically Warlords of New York is a beautiful reality, what makes this expansion truly full-bodied is the revolution implemented by Massive Entertainment in terms of gameplay. Let's start from the beginning: the Level Cap has been increased by ten points and therefore the campaign of about eight hours will allow you to passre from level 30 to level 40 without difficulty, whether you have chosen to carry your own character with you, or you have decided to start directly from this campaign with a default character of level 30. The plot will then have the objective of making you conquer four new abilities, obtainable from the four Warlords, which however we do not want to anticipate. These abilities fit fully into the re-evaluation of the loot and progression ecosystem which will now allow you a greater variety in terms of specializations. The progression from level 30 to level 40 is unchanged, you earn EXP, you look for loot of increasing rarity and effectiveness and you reach the cap. Here, however, everything changes and players can decide to focus on different aspects, thus choosing between finally effective builds thanks to weapons and armor chosen in order to maximize statistics and skills elevated to levels of damage and utility that defining ~divine~ would perhaps be demeaning. Clearly, the superior supremacy of exotic equipment remains present in all of this, but obviously these are elitist exceptions to be included in a context that now takes on a decidedly more marked strategic outline. Finally, the SHADE levels, introduced in an intelligent and contextualized way (even at a narrative level they have their own why) serve as an additional means of specialization since they will allow you to spend further extra points to enhance skills and give greater depth to specializations.", "date": "2020-03-11", "grade": "8.0"}
