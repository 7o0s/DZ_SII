{"name": "Yakuza Kiwami 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-kiwami-2-recensione-pc.html", "text": "Yakuza Kiwami 2 offers some truly spectacular moments on PC, and the funny thing is that these are normal exploratory sequences in Kamurocho or Sotenbori, fictitious neighborhoods located in Tokyo and Osaka respectively. The extraordinary richness of the details of the locations, together with the substantial improvements made to the Dragon Engine with the sixth chapter, also introduced in this remake, in fact transform the scenario from different points of view, increasing its realism, thickness and atmosphere as we go, at a slow pace or run, towards the next objective on the map. The differences compared to Yakuza Kiwami are therefore clear and it is inevitable to pay for them in terms of performance: let's say right away that to run the game at 2160p and 60 frames per second, with all effects at their maximum, you probably need to own an RTX 2080 Ti . In our case, with a GTX 1080 Ti we had to make some compromises, leaving the settings at maximum and the output at 4K, but using the convenient resolution scaler to go down to 70% of the real value, thus obtaining the sixty stable frames. Visually, this greater commitment of the GPU is clearly seen, of course, as is the clear distance from the PlayStation 4 version of the game, limited to 30 frames with a lower resolution and less sophisticated effects. The options screen is clear: compared to the previous remake, Yakuza Kiwami 2 introduces screen space reflections, motion blur and SSAO, all elements capable of visually enriching the scenarios and the characters that move within them. Once again it is the night scenes that benefit the most, with the illuminated signs of shops and restaurants actually reflecting in puddles on the street, a feeling of thickness applied to whatever object is on the screen and a fascinating use of blur for distant objects but also for camera rotations. The end result is amazing, both in the now well-known and assimilated Kamurocho and, above all, in the streets of Sotenbori. Added to this is an unprecedented degree of interaction, which allows access to many commercial activities without any loading, closely observing the care in the reproduction of the products on display; dropping bicycles and other obstacles (usable of course during fights) while running; and even visit the interior of buildings that are spread over several floors. We naturally expected a greater weight for Yakuza Kiwami 2 compared to the previous episode: we are really talking about two very different products in terms of detail and visual density, but we were equally surprised by the impossibility of adjusting the experience in order to increase performance without affecting the resolution: it seems that activating or deactivating antialiasing, ambient occlusion and even reflections in real time does not affect the frame rate, which only budges when we go down to 1440p or 1080p, depending on the GPU. Wanting to leave everything maxed out at 4K resolution, with the GTX 1080 Ti we move between 30 and 40 fps with a good feeling of fluidity, but it is obviously not the same thing as having sixty stable frames. Small parenthesis: we also tried to activate the dreaded SSAA, obtaining 6 fps. As mentioned, the greater weight is amply justified by the many changes made to the settings and by much more complex effects, but those who expected the miracle, rubbing their hands to savor the 60 frames per second for the first time in Kiwami 2, could stay there bad. Story, characters and structure Having exhausted the dutiful discussion on the quality of the PC version, it is certainly appropriate to talk about the most valuable elements of Yakuza Kiwami 2, which marks a clear step forward compared to the first episode in terms of structure and duration, moving between main missions and secondary towards the abundant thirty hours. After the events of Yakuza Kiwami, Kazuma Kiryu becomes involved again in the operations of the Tojo clan and reluctantly agrees to go to Osaka to discuss a truce with the very powerful Omi Alliance. To do this, he will first have to recover an old friend who seems to have lost his way, however, and prepare to face a fighting spirit very similar to his: that of Ryuji Goda, the ~Kansai dragon~. Big, implacable and easily recognizable because of his blond hair, Goda will soon show that he has excellent reasons to oppose peace between the two clans, giving rise to a new, bloody war that will flare up in the streets of Sotenbori and Kamurocho. In history there will obviously also be room for some of the issues most dear to the seriesand, like the controversial relationship with Chinese immigrants, the coexistence between the various mafias operating on Japanese territory and also a delicate love parenthesis which, for once, will warm the protagonist's heart. From the point of view of ideas, the first chapters of the campaign appear a little too hasty, but fortunately the rhythm becomes more cadenced in the central part and the whole experience acquires depth, also branching out among the numerous sub-quests available, many of which but they run out too quickly and leave little behind. Among the extras of Yakuza Kiwami 2, three unpublished chapters starring Goro Majima stand out, which we will be able to check again after Yakuza 0 to try our hand at a structurally simple mission but with very touching narrative implications for those who have played the splendid prequel of the saga. There are also two special activities, the Cabaret Grand Prix and the Clan Creator: in the first case, in the role of Kazuma, we will have to manage a cabaret club in the best possible way by sending the best girls to the customers' tables and making sure they spend as much as possible remaining satisfied with the service, while in the second area we will control Goro in strategic clashes and we will be able to recruit new fighters to resist the sorties of a group that wants to defeat the competition in the context of construction companies. Gameplay The Yakuza formula is faithfully reproduced in this remake, which as per tradition is based above all on the narrative cutscenes that form the glue for the in-game action. The latter is based on simple movements from point A to point B, environmental interactions of various kinds and, of course, fights against the minions who populate the streets of Tokyo and Osaka, as well as the powerful bosses who will occasionally present us with a bill savory. Unfortunately, the different fighting styles that embellished the mechanics of Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami are missing, replaced by a single position which at first forces a certain repetitiveness of the combinations. By improving the statistics and unlocking new moves, however, Kazuma's repertoire is greatly enriched and the situation changes, also thanks to the many objects that we will be able to collect on the fly in the scenarios to hit our enemies, even with spectacular and very painful finishers that can be activated when the bar of fury is at its peak. The yield of the shots is excellent as always, you really have the sensation of the impacts and this contributes in a fundamental way to the fun. However Yakuza Kiwami 2 is not just a beat'em up: both in Kamurocho and in Sotenbori we will be able to try our hand at various side activities ranging from battling center to billiards, from cards to karaoke, from golf to mahjong, passing through the crazy urination minigame of Toylets and of course for the SEGA Club, where we will be able to access the inevitable UFO Catcher and the Virtua Fighter and Virtual-On cabinets.", "date": "2019-05-09", "grade": "8.5"}
