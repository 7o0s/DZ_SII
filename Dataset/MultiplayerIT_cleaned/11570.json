{"name": "Dynasty Warriors 6 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynasty-warriors-6-recensione.html", "text": "Renbu Vs Combos Musou is the real campaign mode, Free Mode instead allows us to replay the previously passed missions even with characters gradually unlocked. An important feature of these two modes is given by the fact that the experience points earned by the heroes are persistent, thus giving the possibility to start a new game, or to play a single level, with one's alter ego being already sufficiently skilled. If we add to this a very large and varied roster of 41 characters, each with unique weapons, techniques and skills, a respectable picture emerges in terms of longevity. The control method is the simplest and most immediate, especially in light of the new features included. One button for blocking, one for an area special attack, one for a weak attack, one for a powerful blow and one for a devastating Musou attack. The Renbu system, new in this sixth episode, is linked to the number of enemies killed in succession without ever being hit by the opponents. The higher this number, even in the hundreds, the more powerful, diverse and devastating the attacks carried out will be. So always being at the center of the battle, as inactivity drops Renbu, is the absolute imperative of this new offense system. Renbu Vs Combos Given what has been written so far, Dynasty Warriors 6 would seem to be a decidedly intriguing and well-made title, and instead all the improvements made, including the cosmetic ones, do not act as added value to a title that is always the same, always prey to the now usual critical issues. The Renbu system, instead of innovating the game mechanics, mortifies them by eliminating the pleasure of varying attacks, in favor of a continuous and fast ~weak~ attack. one often remains at the mercy of the opponents for the time necessary to be hit, nullifying the chain of killings carried out to unlock the Musou. The powerful attack is used practically before entering a melee as an opening stroke, to decimate the opposing ranks, then finishing them with normal attack strokes. By repeating this operation at least 100 times each level, you will have a good chance of completing the Omega Force title in a reasonable time. The whole game is therefore a continuous push of a single button, and only occasionally the others, including the backbones for parrying and dodging. The jump on new generation machines, despite the renewed graphics, some new features and small improvements, fails to go beyond the historical defects of the series. Monotony and repetitiveness are unfortunately the critical issues that clearly emerge from this test, also caused by a new offense system that favors what the Anglo-Saxons call button mashing, or rather push the keys until cramps occur, rather than combined attacks and combos carried out with speed and timing. Neither the progressive and persistent development of the heroes, nor the mini-games of the Challenge Mode manage to bring out the KOEI title from a mediocrity, daughter of scarce innovation and little desire to renew itself, of a series unfortunately always the same for too long . Pros Renewed graphics Simple and immediate Interesting character development Cons Monotonous and in the long run repetitive Combo mechanism too simplified Poorly detailed side elements Too crippled? After the first moments of euphoria given by the fury of the fights, repetitiveness and boredom soon arrive, given that wandering around very vast maps in search of red points to conquer, furiously pushing a button without even ever giving too much attention to the requests for help from the own allies becomes a boring routine, difficult to break despite the many characters and the many possibilities of upgrading them. Even the objects that give momentary bonuses to the attack and defense values, which should vary the action, do not seem to tangibly influence our attacks: we are too busy pushing the X key like madmen to notice any real benefits. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is not a champion of aggressiveness and cunning, given that many times soldiers a couple of meters away from the protagonist will activate only when he approaches him, a problem that also afflicts enemy officers, sort of mini midboss which are in defense of the external points of the fortresses to be conquered or of some doors, towers and gates, these areas of necessary passage to arrive at the final victory. Another sour note is the lack of an online cooperative mode: unfortunately it is possible to play alonelocally. Too crippled? Even from a graphic point of view, the KOEI stock has no particular points of excellence. If the fog that obscured the nearby enemies, typical of the previous versions for PlayStation 2, has finally disappeared, in this sixth episode there are annoyingly recurring episodes of soldiers pop up, not only on elements in the distance, but also on those at a very short distance that appear magically suddenly, as if we were in the presence of a respawn zone. Still speaking of troops, one cannot fail to mention the poverty of detail and modeling of this, with all the same models and few animations. The same thing goes for the structures, decidedly sparse and not very nice to look at, even if quite varied, with a series of forts, valleys, lakes and imperial palaces acting as battlefields. To be honest, it must be said that the game engine, despite the very high number of models on the screen, is flawless, the action is always fluid without the slightest sign of failure, fixed on 60 fps. The heroes, on the other hand, shine where all the other aspects of the game suffer the most: textures, polygonal construction and animations are of a high standard, as are the special effects associated with the most devastating attacks. Particular mentions for the faces and the clothes, decidedly well made.", "date": "2008-03-12", "grade": null}
