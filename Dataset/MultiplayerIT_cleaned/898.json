{"name": "Goldeneye: al servizio del male", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/goldeneye-al-servizio-del-male.html", "text": "The playable demo of Metroid Prime: Hunters sounded like a call from the very beginning: Nintendo's Double Screen handheld represents a great platform for experimenting with different types of control in first-person shooters, and it's natural to expect a good offer of games of this type soon. Electronic Art is aimed precisely at the DS audience interested in this genre, with a very traditional FPS that draws on the famous villains and characters of the Bond-movies - without bothering agent 007 himself - and proposes itself with ~adult~ themes and a plot to evil and world domination. That EA wanted to be the very first company to offer an FPS, turning a blind eye to the design and refinement of the game for the benefit of a timely release on the market, is however evident: Rogue Agent will also be the first first-person shooter for DS, but it is an FPS which, while offering interesting variations to the control system, offers absolutely nothing new and, at the same time, shows many weak sides. With a not very interesting narrative system, a superficial game design and a technical realization not without some big flaws, Rogue Agent will only be able to conquer a few avid fans of Bond-movies, while FPS lovers will perhaps be inclined to wait for a title more inspired. Rogue Agent does not make the famous character of Bond, created by Ian Fleming and protagonist of the famous film adaptations of his novels, playable. The plot of the Electronic Arts title features a ruthless and ambitious agent, not at all ~in the service of His Majesty~ and only interested in revenge, global domination and the means to implement them: carnage. The trait d'union between this ~adult plot~ and the Bond-Movies is lent instead by the villains of the films of the series: Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp, Scaramanga and Pussy Galore are the final obstacles to overcome from setting to setting, moving from Hong Kong to Fort Knox until the clash with the fearsome Dr. No in the Caribbean. In this spin-off/narrative tribute, Goldeneye is a title that recalls one of the most recent and famous films of the series, but also the name of the secret agent protagonist of the game: his golden eye, implemented after the loss of that biological and equipped with technological resources that allow him an extraordinary use of visual functions, he also provides the pretext for a series of special functions in the game. Rogue Agent is a classic first-person shooter, which doesn't have particularly original or innovative features. You move around and sideways, explore and observe the play area in three dimensions and eliminate enemies with interchangeable firearms, collect weapons and objects and activate switches and controls of various kinds to open the passage in the rooms or overcome architectural barriers. By getting enough hit rates and exploration, you will unlock new playable levels and the ability to use arenas for training. In this traditional game system, a note of originality is the possibility of using the two arms separately, selecting different weapons to be used at will depending on the situation (unless they require two arms, as in the case of rocket launchers) . However, the most relevant novelty is the experimentation on the types of controls that can be used to make the most of the dual screen and the touch-screen function of the Nintendo DS. Rogue Agent offers various ways to interact, allowing you to use traditional controls, the stylus or the thumb-strap for character control and shooting. Depending on the case, the player will be able to control the shooting direction through the touch screen with the stylus, use the thumb with one of the two hands or choose a traditional control, in which it is possible to assign the aiming to the directional cross and the movements to the buttons or viceversa. In all cases, the firing of the two weapons takes place through the back buttons, and it proves problematic when the use of the thumb or the stylus prevents the use of the back button for the same hand. However, the implementation is not without flaws. In the first place, it is still impossible to use the shot with the back buttons in ~stylus~ mode, i.e. using the stylus: the button is unreachable. Secondly, the buttons to tap on the lower screen, which offer the possibility of picking up items or activating special modes, are too small and unreachable compared to the disproportionately large aiming area. The special features offered by Rogue Agent are a number of abilities: for example, the ability toswitch into sniper mode or to look through walls and other visual extras, or to use weapons that go through objects. The characteristics turn out to be game gimmicks capable, however, of only partially solving some problems with collisions. If Rogue Agent offers vision through walls, it is also true that very often these walls seem unjustifiably passable by enemy fire, while opponents do not offer any animation that signals when the shot is on fire and tend to become more difficult to deal with than expected they are not actually. In short, the use of the settings and environments as a strategic cover leaves something to be desired, affecting a very repetitive and sometimes monotonous interaction, in which the enemies are not equipped with sufficient artificial intelligence to guarantee different patterns from the cyclic attacks. In part, the game improves in multiplayer, offering the possibility of limited arenas with a single cartridge and full levels with an endowment of cartridges equal to that of used consoles. The clash with the human is certainly a factor of longevity, and it is a pity that the strategic interaction is plagued by problems with environmental shelters. Playing an FPS in wireless multiplayer on the Nintendo DS is certainly exhilarating at first, but in the case of Goldeneye, the pleasure soon fades. What's more, the monotony is not relieved by the narrative characterization (the levels are interspersed with predictable written dialogues alternating with images) or by the aesthetic one: if the visual presentation is of a good standard, sufficiently defined, varied enough and quite similar to the versions for home consoles, the creation of the music (especially that of the titles) is truly scandalous. Rogue Agent is equipped with a sound sector that is certainly among the worst in recent years: a large part of the composition and, above all, the quality of the sounds used when writing the music suggest a very recent creation, in disputes with the plug-ins used by composers or who knows what else. Rogue Agent is the first FPS for the Nintendo DS, but it was made too much, too quickly to capitalize on the lack of competitors. Electronic Arts has managed to implement a sometimes good control, which demonstrates how the Nintendo DS offers a control possibility which, in the case of FPS, is superior in pointing speed to the use of traditional analogs, and quite close to the speed of the mouse . However, Rogue Agent is very predictable, superficial and not without its game design issues. Furthermore, its aesthetic characterization is disappointing, especially in terms of the horrible sound. This first FPS for Nintendo DS just fails to convince, but it does its ~dirty work~: it proves that the genre can work great on this console. Let's wait Pros: Not bad touch-screen aiming Different control modes The first and still the only FPS on DS Cons: Shallow game design The ~stylus~ mode is there to number Gunshot/environment collision problems Some of the worst music I've heard in years", "date": "2005-06-29", "grade": null}
