{"name": "NHL 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-09-recensione.html", "text": "Inside and outside the rink The amount of options is huge, confusing at first: it is possible to play exhibition matches and tournaments both offline and online, customize every single element of the match and manage a team in the ~Dynasty~ mode. The heart of this edition are probably the ~Be a Pro~ and ~EA Sports Hockey League~ modes, which we will discuss later, while all the rest is material largely already present in the ~08~ edition, obviously updated to the new season. In this chapter, the innovative setting of the controls started by EA already in the previous versions, called ~Skill Stick~, is proposed again, which sees the use of the right stick to move the club as the main introduction. Instead of entrusting everything to the keys, the analog is used here to perform the entire repertoire of possible movements (passes, shots of various strengths, spin shots, feints). For the nostalgic, note the possibility of using the configuration prior to the introduction of this setting, and even of configuring the controller based on the original interface, dated 1994, with the two buttons covering all possibilities. All the rest takes up the possibilities already present in the previous iterations, essentially offering a complete reproduction of the possible actions in a hockey game, from the management of the attack/defense line, to contacts of various types with the opponents (up to the most violent blows), to various maneuvers on skates. The use of the right analog to move the club, combined with the new implementations in terms of collision between polygonal models, determines a large number of different game solutions. The free movement of the bat is in fact valid both in the attack phase (where it is possible to move the puck at will, in order to defend oneself from the attacks of the opponents, or to protect it with the body thanks to new preset movements) and in defence. In the latter case, by moving the stick it is possible to disturb the action of the opponents and also to intercept the passes, given that now the puck behaves in a more physically convincing way, with realistic collisions against players, skates and sticks. The result is a certain unpredictability, and therefore a realism far from what we were used to with the old hockey games: no more perfect passes from one side of the field to the other, with the ~puck~ that inexorably reaches the player with clean and undisturbed, the new collisions and the possibilities brought by the free movement of the club make everything more difficult, and also more challenging. On the other hand, a certain period of practice is needed to better master the numerous commands, which can easily seem cumbersome and make the approach to the game a little frustrating for those looking for a more immediate, arcade-style experience . Being a Pro The distinctive element of the latest EA sports productions is obviously also present here: the Be a Pro mode. In this one, we find ourselves interpreting the career of a young hockey promise from the minor league up to the NHL, obviously if we are able to meet expectations. A rather complete editor allows you to customize the appearance of our player and his game characteristics (role, position, various settings). Once the team of the AHL league (the minor one in the world of American hockey) has been chosen, our adventure begins: as the calendar progresses, we will have to satisfy certain requests from the club and the coach, based on the role we have chosen in team (precise objectives, such as a certain number of goals scored, assists made, points brought home, for example). Every moment of the match is judged according to our performance (team play, position holding, defense, attack, goals scored or conceded and more), and based on this we are assigned scores, which are then useful for distributing new experience points in the numerous characteristics of the player, to evolve, as in a sort of RPG, in order to become more and more competitive, until finally arriving at the NHL. In this mode, the match is seen from the perspective of the single player, therefore the camera focuses on him and we will be able to control exclusively our alter ego on the pitch (or off: when the player is taken out of the rink we will see firsthand the game from the edge of the field). It is necessary to stand out but also to play for the team in order to obtain good results, and it is not easy, given that in fact for most of the playing time we will not control the puck. It is in fact an excellent mode that however, it has a downside: it can be extremely engaging, but if you don't get caught up in the meccanismo can easily be boring having to watch the evolution of our teammates, while we struggle to free ourselves to serve us the disk. The culmination of this ~subjectification~ of EA's sports simulations is achieved with the EA Sports Hockey League, which allows the Be a Pro concept to be transported into a persistent online multiplayer context (however, building a different and parallel career to the offline one). . We therefore find ourselves playing with entire teams made up of individuals controlled by users, and if there are companions able to cover their role well, the game reaches an incomparable quality level, compared to clashes with the CPU. There is also a marked improvement in the stability of the online game, compared to the previous chapter. The coolest game on earth The depth of the simulation and the game structure corresponds to an adequate technical realization, which helps to strengthen the realism of the experience. Within the graphic engine - improved starting from last year's already good result - the players stand out, in particular as regards the animations: there are many movements and the improved collisions determine a convincing global effect, like a ~real game . The polygonal models are also characterized by a certain care in the creation of the facial expressions and textures that make up the various fabrics and materials of the uniforms, making an excellent effect even in the closer shots of the replays. EA has now accustomed us to the typical care in the reconstruction of the playing fields, and to the emphatic atmosphere of a pure show that all the extra-playful elements, so to speak, combine to create. This is even more evident in the simulations dedicated to typically American sports, and NHL 09 certainly makes no difference, making us feel at the center of a great show in every way. Also part of this apparatus are the audio commentary, the intradiegetic sounds on and off the field, the typical fanfares and excerpts of rock music to underline the salient moments of the match, as well as all the licensed songs profusely lavished within the menu. The only ones that can be found in the technical sector are certain drops in framerate that occur in the most chaotic situations and some camera uncertainties that lead to annoying shot reversals, found in sporadic cases especially in the Be a Pro mode. Comment NHL 09 is simply the best ice hockey simulation on the market right now. This obviously involves some clarifications: the minimum condition necessary for the appreciation of the game, due to the technical approach chosen by EA, is a certain interest in the sport in question. If you don't have this passion and desire to get into the mechanics of this sport, it's difficult to fully appreciate all the qualities of this NHL 09, especially in the Be a Pro mode, which is the true soul of the game. The complete control offered by the new controls can be cumbersome at first, but after a little practice it allows for unprecedented immersion in the game, with enormous possibilities in terms of game solutions. There are very few defects that can properly be ascribed to the work infused, with visible passion, by EA Canada for this superb sports simulation, which takes video game hockey to a new qualitative level, still surpassing the even excellent chapter 08. Pro Full controls and realistic Virtually impeccable technical realization Be a Pro mode well structured Solid and fun online multiplayer Cons Difficult to control at first You need dedication to be fully appreciated Xbox 360 goals The objectives of NHL 09 are relatively few: 27 achievements contain a total of the classic 1000 points. Most of the achievements can be obtained thanks to particular performances in online and offline matches, or by progressing within the Be a Pro mode. Some, such as ~Show off~ and ~Say Cheese~, are obtained simply by using the various options put available by EA to upload user content to the publisher's servers. Apart from these last rather immediate objectives, in general a certain effort is required to total the Gamerpoints up for grabs.", "date": "2008-09-15", "grade": null}
