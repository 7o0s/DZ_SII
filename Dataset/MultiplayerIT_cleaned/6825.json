The Souls series, Ninja Gaiden, Ikaruga are just some of the titles that grant nothing to the player. Do you want to overcome an obstacle? Learn the rules, practice, keep practicing and if that's not enough, practice again. Sooner or later you will overcome the obstacle. Otherwise, go down the avenue of failure and never show up again, like those Starship Troopers recruits who didn't qualify to become soldiers. Those who love challenges know what we are talking about, and will certainly remember the king of bastard games, the one who totally focuses on the search for perfect execution, the dreaded Super Meat Boy, which among other things has sold crazy figures, demonstrating the fact that not all of the public seeks cheap entertainment. But following the thread of memories, without a precise order, we also want to mention VVVVVV and La Mulana, or the elegant Dustforce. In short, what we are talking about is certainly not a thriving market, but there is no shortage of titles, and today another one is added, the merciless Fenix Rage, which, being a platformer, must necessarily confront the titanic Super Meat Boy. Well. Does it compare? If what matters to you is to participate, leave Fenix Rage alone: you would end up getting hurt Infinite lives Let's gloss over the story: pretend it doesn't exist, because those micro fragments of narration only serve to give the character a pretext to be in the world. Also forget the concept of tutorials. Fenix Rage explains to the player what the commands are during the first three micro-levels, and then immediately begins to make strong. From the first moments, one is struck by the game system, which, in its simplicity, is precisely the one that digs a ditch between Super Meat Boy and Fenix Rage. In fact, in Fenix Rage you can perform infinite jumps and as many shots, effectively revolutionizing an approach to platforms that has been repeated unchanged for decades. The extreme mobility of the protagonist, combined with the composition of the levels, offers the possibility of performing a sequence of actions at the speed of light, one after the other, without ever putting your feet on the ground, dribbling around moving obstacles in mid-air until blue portal that marks the exit of the level. This means that perfect execution of a level rarely lasts more than ten or fifteen seconds. It's a pity that between us and the perfect execution there is all the harshness of a game deaf to every plea. Fenix Rage is a cognitive trap that subverts any automatic eye / hand you may have internalized in your life as a player. The developers know that certain objects, if they move in a certain way, will lead you to instinctively act in a certain way. And rest assured that there, right at that point where you can't help but jump, they have set a deadly trap. Luckily you die and start again in less than half a second. On the other hand, however, the levels do not reset, with the exception of destructible objects. To do this, you need to press a specific key. This forces you to take an extra step when trying to race against the clock, but we're still talking about hundredths of a second. Another disturbing element is the chromatic choice, with unhappy combinations that make it difficult to distinguish the elements of the game. On the other hand, and that's what matters, the game system is as solid as a block of granite. Fenix Rage boasts ultra-responsive controls, laser-precise collisions and levels built to offer ever new challenges. But prepare to suffer. You will pray that there is a secret key to skip a level (there isn't). On the other hand, each world resets the difficulty level to almost zero to allow us to learn the rules it introduces, or find out how it has manipulated those already assimilated. So you can take a breather from time to time. But then the game hits hard again, and always a little more than it did in the previous set of levels. When you can't stand it anymore, a boss arrives to block the way. Sometimes we have to evade him, other times he dodges our attacks to protect his weak points. In any case, the challenge remains very high. Bitter biscuit Forgetting the annoying combination of colors, Fenix Rage has a nice graphics, in stark contrast to the inflexibility of its game system. Even the music immediately enters the head and stays there pleasantly without getting boring. The recurring element in the levels of Fenix Rage are the gelatinous blobs with a deadly touch, but there is also much more: teleporters that bounce us from one point of the level to another, ice cubes that are destroyed only after catching fire by sliding on the lava, flying crocodile heads and death machines shooting coRepetitive lethal lpis are just a few examples. There are even exit portals that disappear under our noses when we are about to reach them. New mechanics come into play from world to world as previously explored concepts change. But if you're really looking for a higher challenge (as if the basic one wasn't enough) then you have to deal with the extra content and try to collect all the cookies. As for the cookies, there is one in every level and you can try to collect it before you reach the exit if you like. If you collect enough of them, you'll receive a recipe for baking them. In addition to this stroke of genius there are the arcade challenges, which offer a slightly different game system from the main one, which can be accessed by finishing a sufficient number of levels with an excellent performance (good luck). And if that's still not enough, try to collect the red cubes before the countdown on them resets, so you can access a version of the same level stripped of all details. Finally, there are alternative game modes for those who want to continue improving, probably to be able to share the video of their game on YouTube. Fenix Rage is not a game for everyone, and some minor flaws prevent it from reaching the top, but with a game system as precise as a scalpel and an infinite number of stimuli designed for those who want to test themselves with an extreme challenge, it will make the happiness of all gamers who miss Super Meat Boy.
