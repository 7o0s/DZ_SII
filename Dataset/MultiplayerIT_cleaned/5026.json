After the controversies of the past few weeks, the echo of which has not yet subsided, we have tried to understand the room for manoeuvre, i.e. the possibility of playing, for those who only know Italian. There is a lot to read in Torment: Tides of Numenera The answer obtained after a few moments of play was clear: none. We're not exaggerating: inXile's latest effort floods the screen with text since character creation, requiring the player to complete richly described memories, thus making his first choices. Of course, at a later time it is possible to review the result, but also in the character sheet there is an abundance of text and, given the originality of the setting, some concepts risk being misunderstood, leading to mistakes if not understood more than well what is explained to us. In addition to this, speaking more generally, the style of the screenplay is characterized by refined and literary syntactic constructions, with a widespread use of archaic terms (in this case we are referring to the English language, the one we have selected for playing), which sometimes they can leave some interpretative doubts even if you know the language. In short, it's bad to start a review like this, especially given the final grade, but we want to avoid deluding you that we can do it regardless of understanding the text. As we will see, selecting a more aggressive character is not a solution to the problem, because the real focus of Torment: Tides of Numenera remains in any case the text. Is Torment: Tides of Numenera the masterpiece it seems? Find out in our review! Oceans of words If we had to indicate the main feature of the inXile game we would have no doubts: the dear, old, underrated text. It is flooded from the first moments of the adventure and is impossible to evade. It is enough to tell the first post-tutorial phases to understand what we are talking about. Our Last Castoff, i.e. the protagonist, so called because he is the most recent of the human shells chosen by the so-called Changing God to transfer his spirit, literally rained from the sky into an echo chamber in a mysterious area full of numenera, i.e. high-tech artifacts created by a civilization that lived billions of years before the current one, the city of Sagus Cliffs. The dialog is your best friend Despite the devastating impact he is not dead and, once he wakes up, not remembering anything about himself, he decides to find out what happened to him, also because there is a terrible creature, called Sorrow, who wants to kill him for reasons that are not clear to him. He is immediately faced with two characters who have rushed to the disaster site, who immediately join the party (you can also ignore them if you want). The two, evidently in strong contrast to each other, broadly explain to him what they have seen and give him information on the Changing God and the peculiarity of the place where he ended up, thus inviting him to follow them. Everyone will offer him a different solution to start his search for the truth, immediately calling him to make a first, important choice. Everything develops in a series of long dialogues, interrupted by short exploratory phases. Our character is a Dwarf (a kind of wizard who has nothing to do with the classic fantasy dwarfs) highly intelligent, skilled in the art of deception, but much less in that of combat. If we wanted we could have made him a Jack, i.e. a kind of adventurous thief capable of getting away with it in any situation, or a Glaive, i.e. a warrior. Our first objective when trying the final version of Torment: Tides of Numenera was not so much to discover the game mechanics, already very clear from the beta and the development updates released over the months by inXile, but to understand if the game system really was as versatile as fabled. After all, we are faced with the spiritual sequel to Planescape: Torment, so it was right to find out if it was really possible to finish the whole adventure without a fight. The short answer is that yes, it is possible. Freedom The first dialogues and the first interactions serve not only to introduce us to the world born from the fertile imagination of Monte Cook, author of paper role-playing games from the Dungeons & Dragons school, but also to give us some information on the gameplay. What will be hidden behind these mirrors? To find out, you must first solve a problem by beating your hands or using your ingenuity The places we will venture into are fascinating and all have their own story to tellrci Without going too far, most choices are made in the dialog that appears at the bottom of the screen. It is there that, in the more classic Baldur's Gate style, we will be able to choose what to say, how to act and how to exploit our intellectual and social skills, by selecting one of the various sentences available. From this point of view, the work done by inXile is truly mammoth and we don't believe that there is another virtual role-playing game that gives so much freedom of approach in solving individual situations, from the most minute (e.g. understanding the function of an object) , to very complex quests. All of course takes place in an impressive text frame. Let's take a direct example: as soon as we leave the place where we woke up we will have to face a group that has set out on our trail. By facing them we will have different possibilities for resolving the dispute: deceiving them about our identity, fighting them in a direct confrontation, fighting them using the technologies present in the area and so on. There are probably more or less depending on the character created, but we can believe that the example is clear enough. But let's see another case, concerning a quest that can be obtained in an advanced stage of the adventure: by visiting an infamous area we will have to solve a serious problem born of a strange race of creatures who feed by digging the earth. Even in this situation we will have multiple solutions available, including persuading them to leave, after having remembered their language (the protagonist can awaken memories belonging to the Changing God), or blackmailing them after stealing precious objects kept in their lair. It should be noted that both situations briefly described then had repercussions on subsequent events. This is a fundamental feature of Torment: Tides of Numenera: the choices made create a dense network of effects, slightly or clearly modifying some of the subsequent events. Strong relationships But let's take a step back and exit the site where we crashed. We are in the Circus Minor neighborhood. Exploring it we discover it inhabited by dozens of people of various backgrounds with whom it is possible to talk at length, including merchants, slavers and pleasant characters belonging to strange and horrid cults. Said like this, it might seem like a simple gallery of the fantastic, but by talking to each of them you discover their many facets and, above all, their relationships with other characters, other factions or with the game world in general. One of the maps This place represents the mind of the protagonist and, over time, will be enriched with connections We learn about distant places that we won't even visit. Heartbreaking stories are discovered, others ridiculous, others still disturbing. Depending on how we respond to the dialogues, we can improve or worsen our relationships with the various factions or with the citizens, obtaining points in the various traits of what we can consider the character of the Last Castoff, i.e. his public person. The system works underground so as not to let us develop strategies in advance that clash with our interpretation. In this way we can only imagine the effect of our statements on others. However, in the advanced stages of the game, the reactions that are obtained from the characters will be filtered naturally by the behavior that we have held up to that moment. In short, if we have behaved like villains, we cannot expect to be considered heroes... Some actions will require the spending of the points of one of the three basic characteristics of the character, physical prowess, speed and intelligence, to be successful. Let's take an example: we want to persuade someone to sell us an item we need to solve a quest. After selecting the appropriate option in the dialog, the portrait of the character will appear with the base percentage of success chance of the action. To improve it, you will need to spend points (in this case intellect). Depending on the characteristics of the character who will perform the action (in many cases, but not always, it is also possible to use the other party members), this will be more or less easy and will require spending more or less points (how many are expendable for each action depends on the character). Once the action has been performed, the points spent are lost. To recover them you need to sleep or use objects. Some actions can become automatic for highly specialized characters, or require the spending of very few points to be sure of success. This is a core feature of Tides of Numenera, which appliesalso to the combat system, where points can be spent to have a better chance of landing and landing attacks. In general, those who want to play without fighting should try to have as many points as possible to spend on solving situations in the dialogues. We even beat hands For the sake of statistics we can tell you that just to get out of the first district, including the prologue and the tutorial, we spent about four hours, most of which was spent talking to the other characters. Indeed, to be honest we never fought ... on the other hand as for the rest of the game. We must confess that we have been so captured by the possibility of solving every situation by speaking, that we have literally forgotten about the combat system. In the course of the game you also have to solve murder cases To test it we had to force some situations by reloading old saves. It is a classic turn-based system in which the characters act one at a time by attacking or defending themselves. The techniques that can be used are many and vary according to the equipment, the skills developed and the Cyphers possessed. The latter are technological artifacts that can be linked to the character, giving him bonuses, or maluses if they are too numerous (each character can have a certain number of Cyphers connected). The peculiarity of these objects is that after being used they literally shatter. So you have to be very careful not to waste them. The weapons available to the party are the most diverse. The fusion of technology and magic that characterizes the world of Tides of Numenera has made it possible to implement a varied arsenal, made up of classic weapons such as swords, maces, shields and so on, but also by other more technological ones such as pistols and ray guns. In reality, sometimes the fights aren't even fights and have variations, such as the presence of Numenera in the scenario which, if used, produce original and unexpected effects. The substance is that after experiencing a few clashes we felt like replaying the whole adventure with a more combative character. Torment beyond Torment If you haven't figured it out yet, it's better to make it explicit: Torment: Tides of Numenera can be easily played several times. There are so many things to discover that with a single adventure of a few dozen hours (the overall duration depends very much on what kind of approach you choose to have) it is simply not possible to do it. Even just delving into the different game systems, often in conflict with each other in practical terms, makes at least a second round advisable. A start with a bang... in every sense From this point of view it is the most 'open' role-playing game ever created, which goes even further than what Planescape: Torment has done in the past, its main point of reference. In fact, it's difficult to find other titles to compare it with, because Pillars of Eternity itself, with which it shares the engine, is decidedly more closed in terms of possibilities, focused as it is on the combat system. The only other title that comes to mind is the excellent indie Age of Decadence, which in turn had the aforementioned Planescape: Torment as a reference. A nice loop, no doubt about it. There is much more to say about the game itself, but in closing we want to say a few words on the technical side, the weakest of the entire production. It is true that while playing you pay less and less attention to the graphics, but some problems are noticed, such as the disconnect between characters and scenario, very evident when zooming in a lot. Even from the point of view of expectations, something more could have been done. Apart from the initial loading, which is not too long, some nasty pauses occur when selecting dialogues, especially if dubbed. Evidently the game crashes to load the audio file related to the chosen phrase. The effect, unfortunately, is not great. Nothing that really spoils the game, but it pays off.", "date": "2017-02-28", "grade": "9.0"}
