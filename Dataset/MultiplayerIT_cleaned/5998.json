The former was left with only the branding of the game and the need to entrust it to a new studio, while the latter kept all the contents, moving under the wing of Sega to give life to the ~new~ Football Manager. With the latter immediately becoming the reference point on the market, Championship Manager tried for a few years to make a timid competition, before hoisting the white flag in 2010, the last year of life of the desktop version. Three years later, in 2013, Square Enix decided to turn to the mobile market with the first Champ Man, hoping that there could be more battle margin against Football Manager, which in the meantime also landed on Android and iOS. Champ Man 16, which arrived a few days ago, therefore represents the third title of the new course: we have tried it for you. If you are looking for a free-to-play football manager, Champ Man 16 could be for you No badge, no party Champ Man 16 can be downloaded for free from both the App Store and Google Play, giving you the opportunity to start playing without spending a penny. In doing so, however, there is a nice limitation: in the various championships available (23) in fact, only a few teams can be chosen, selected by the developers from among the weakest in the competition. Starting his career in Italy, for example, the choice we were given to do it for free was restricted to Frosinone and Hellas Verona, evidently considered the least strong clubs in Serie A on the basis of their statistical values. To choose a team right from immediately you have to spend 0.99 euros to buy the so-called ~coach badge~, alternatively sending an invitation to at least five friends on Facebook. The social network is quite common among the ways to get bonuses, so if you are among those who don't mind annoying their friends with requests of all kinds, you can take advantage of this opportunity; as seen in other free-to-play games, Champ Man 16 occasionally also offers the vision of a commercial, thanks to which you can have a small prize. The structure of the microtransactions present in the game is based on two different currencies: the first is of the virtual type, and can basically be used to obtain temporary boosts, while the second is called CM$, and can be purchased with real money in packages of various denominations . In this way, you can unlock the biggest limitations in the game, for example by adding infinite funds to your transfer budget or by forcing the market to open to register other athletes. It goes without saying that such an approach, however consolidated in the mobile world, can end up ruining a managerial experience like that of Champ Man 16. WiFi and crashes Our experience with Champ Man 16 turned out to be a bit problematic when we started playing on an iPad equipped with iOS 8. Activating the wireless module when starting the game caused it to crash, forcing us to start the game. 'app while remaining offline to avoid similar problems during the game: on the occasion when this happened, the progress was completely wiped out, forcing us to start all over from scratch. Thankfully, the iOS 9 update seems to have improved things by allowing game launches without Wi-Fi conflicts. The other problems we continued to encounter concern the Continue button, on which you sometimes have to press more than once to make the game really go on, and an annoying notification concerning always the same message repeated from time to time. The net swells In its essence, Champ Man 16 takes up the dynamics of the series to which it belongs, stripping them of everything that is not part of the coach's fundamental activities. The game interface consists of a main screen, from which it is possible to access the menus dedicated to the transfer market, various improvements, manager profile and team management, a section in which we will spend most of our time. The management of tactics does not offer the possibility of arranging the players on the field by hand, but the component dedicated to the instructions proves to be sufficient to customize the game of the eleven who take the field to one's taste. There is also a training section, where you can choose from five different types of fundamentals in which to improve your players: from this point of view, it would have been better to have been able to customize the training sessions, thus diversifying them according to the roles. Going down the field, you find yourself instead in front of thehe usual screen dedicated to the game, with the ability to access player ratings in real time. The match is described through a text summary, accompanied by an indication of the areas of the green rectangle where the action takes place: therefore, no 3D engine, unlike Football Manager. The lack of a button with which to simulate the match is also noticeable, especially useful for summer friendlies or in any case for matches of which we are of little interest for some reason. On the technical side there is, for obvious reasons, little to say: the texts are entirely translated into Italian, even if here and there there are some small grammatical inaccuracies or contents in Spanish, while the sound is reduced only to the environmental effects of the stadium when a game is played.", "date": "2015-10-05", "grade": "6.5"}
