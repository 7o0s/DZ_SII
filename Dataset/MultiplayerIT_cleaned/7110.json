{"name": "Palle al balzo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131957-sparkle-2-palle-al-balzo.html", "text": "Might as well premise that Sparkle 2 is certainly not the most original puzzle game you've ever seen: to begin with it's a match-3, and there are too many of those around, and then it's a real clone of Zuma, the PopCap title that has been raging since 2003 in various incarnations and on various platforms or browsers and which certainly is not the first time it has been imitated. 10tons Ltd tried it a couple of years ago with its Sparkle for mobile devices: it worked and the company then proposed a sequel for iPhone and iPad improving on the already excellent foundations of the franchise. That same sequel arrives today on PlayStation Network, and in a cross-buy version: buy it once and you can play it on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. But what did this step mean for the game in and of itself? From iPhone and iPad to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, a really fun mach-3 puzzle PSVita trophies There are twelve bronze Trophies that we will be able to unlock: for some it will be enough to complete the game and the unlock will come practically by itself, but for others the skill and timing will count a little more, for example when we have to ring combos of a certain importance. Roll roll roll Just take a look at the screen to immediately understand that there are very few differences between Zuma and Sparkle 2. The general layout looks a lot alike; the toad in the center of the screen is just missing, replaced by a sort of magical crossbow with the same function: shooting colored marbles in any direction. And the aim is also the same, that is to shoot those same marbles against the rows of colored balls that slide along tracks that become more numerous and intricate from level to level. Each ball is pushed by the previous ones, which means that a form of ~physics~ is in force: eliminate the balls in the center of the row and the leading portion, deprived of the push of the balls that follow it, will stop on the path until the tail of the train of marbles will not have reached it. It's a very simple concept on which a practically age-old and immortal mechanic is based: the crossbow is loaded with one colored ball at a time which, once fired, will fit into the moving row. Line up at least three balls of the same color and they will all burst, earning you points and eventually stopping or slowing down the movement of the row, which does not have to reach a specific point on the screen. It sounds easy, but the movements will get faster and faster, the paths more and more erratic, and aiming will become much more complicated. That's why a series of power-ups and bonuses come to our aid that will be unlocked by completing the various levels of the story. Why yes, there is also a plot, however superficial and nonsense, which talks about an enchanted world where five magical keys are hidden which we will have to get our hands on. A very subtle premise that justifies about ninety levels of effort, and above all highlights the commitment made by the guys of 10tons Ltd also in this aspect of the game that if it hadn't been there no one would have noticed. As we said, by completing the levels, various bonuses and the slots to equip them are unlocked: some will allow us to slow down the movement of the balls, making the task easier but lengthening the duration of the stages, others will double the speed of our launches, and so on. The twenty equipable ~perks~ combine with the various power-ups that will appear, floating, on the screen; just hit one to enhance our next launch with the corresponding magic, perhaps transforming our colored marble into a kind of joker that is good for any color or perhaps charging it with energy so that it explodes on contact, destroying not only the marbles against which has been launched but also the surrounding ones. Learning how and when to use power-ups is essential to chain the explosions of the marbles, accumulate more and more points and overcome the various levels more easily, especially in the alternative Survival and Challenge modes. From a technical point of view Sparkle 2 is certainly not a sophisticated product, but it brings the homework home with fluid and colorful graphics and a pleasant sound accompaniment, with distinctly fantasy notes in line with the general atmosphere. The two versions don't differ much, except for the optional controls represented by the touch screen on PlayStation Vita and by the DualShock 4 touch pad for the older sister. If there is little to say about the convenience and precision of the laptop's touch display, except that we were perfectly at ease, we have to spend a few words on how 10tons Ltd implemented the touch pad controls for the PlayStation 4 version: initially selfIt's almost like using a laptop's touch pad, the feedback is almost clumsy and it takes some getting used to and controlling the crossbow more confidently. At that point the results improve and bode well for the future exploitation in the same sense of the small touch pad of the controller. The latter, then, has a gem: the Light Bar lights up with the color corresponding to the ball loaded and ready to fire. Nonsense, but as we said the guys at 10tons Ltd like details.", "date": "2014-05-21", "grade": "8.0"}
