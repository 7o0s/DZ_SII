Using a first-person view, our goal in the game will be to wander the streets and houses in search of traces of energy, the only thing left of the inhabitants, listening to speeches and observing situations that, like pieces of a puzzle, will help you understand what happened. To complete this task we will have to rely on our sense of direction, check the county maps from time to time for the use and consumption of visitors and follow a mysterious luminous cursor that will sometimes show us the direction in which to move. Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is a fascinating and very valuable story Six characters in search of an author The storyline of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture takes place over several days and different areas of the city. Over the course of the story, which takes around five hours to complete, probably less if we decide to move fast (the ~run~ is activated by holding down the right trigger, but takes a few seconds to engage and however one should not expect to go really fast) , we will follow the story of six different characters, each connected to the others in some way. We will find out what happened when there were the first signs of the problem, how the protagonists and their friends reacted, but above all how the situation evolved when there were the first health problems among the inhabitants and the first mysterious disappearances. . The light tracks actually represent the only interactive element of the game, given that by holding down the left trigger and moving the analog stick as if we wanted to ~tune in~ to a certain frequency, we will be able to witness dialogues that took place when people were still alive. There is no narration in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, there are no suggestions or narrative shortcuts, therefore everything we will learn about the story will depend on these exchanges, masterfully recited with a view to one of the best Italian dubbings we have ever heard, and assisted by a sound design of rare beauty, capable of skilfully sipping the songs of the extraordinary soundtrack to the full advantage of the atmosphere. Solve the mystery The first memories we will have to deal with in the game are those of Dr. Stephen Appleton and his wife Kate, both working on a project that has to do with the VALIS observatory, but which soon turns out to be a serious mistake, opening the doors of our world to a creature that comes from far away. This is the central point of the story, and everything else develops from there, like the stories of Father Jeremy, the parish priest of the city, who feels helpless in the face of what is happening and questions his faith; Wendy Appleton, Stephen's mother, who doesn't look kindly on Kate but has no interest other than her son's happiness; Frank Appleton, Wendy's brother, who in the course of the story finds himself having to deal with his own anger; Lizzie Graves, Stephen's former flame, who hasn't been able to forget her feelings for him after years; and finally Stephen Appleton and Kate Collins themselves, who represent the beginning and the end of the story, witnesses of the event right from the start but also those who try to put a levee on it to save the world. Deepening the knowledge of each of the characters means adopting a meticulous exploratory approach, turning on any radios and televisions, observing the CRT screens of the Commodore 64 mounted in doctors' offices and offices, but also answering disturbing phone calls from the past. All against the background of a town with wonderful views, further emphasized by a direction that uses lights, shadows and atmospheric agents to create certain atmospheres and underline a non-trivial, indeed fascinating and not at all obvious message. The PC version The strengths and weaknesses of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture have remained intact in the transition from PlayStation 4 to PC. As mentioned, in fact, we are faced with a ~dynamic~ story rather than a real game, with very few interactive elements and a great focus on the story, the dialogues, the characterization of places and characters. It is difficult to define puzzle solving as the simple need to find the right path or the ~tuning~ of the lights that give life to certain sequences, so it is clear that if you do not like the genre and its assumptions, the title of The Chinese Room will hardly make you changeidea, indeed. However, we expected a better use of the CryEngine, which on the Sony console showed the side of frequent uncertainties in the frame rate but also does the same on the Windows platform, in a completely unjustified way. The graphics settings allow you to change the resolution, activate or not vertical synchrony and antialiasing (but without being able to select the type), as well as effects such as motion blur, but making different choices also on the front of textures and shadows does not seem to affect on the consistent drops in frame rate that occur when we observe the scenery, preventing us from maintaining the sixty fps except in interiors or in narrow shots. In short, a minimum of optimization is missing, and this is an important aspect if we consider that in the game there are no characters or particular visual effects, just a single very large environment, with a few houses that can be freely visited. The CryEngine has shown much better performance in much more demanding titles, see Crysis 3, and having to limit the frames per second of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture on PC to 30 to avoid blunders is hardly justifiable.", "date": "2016-04-18", "grade": "7.0"}
