The decision to abandon more or less direct porting in favor of a more reasoned approach to console transposition has so far given encouraging results, even for those titles that at first glance are so distant from the gay world of gaming machines, comes to mind as a prime example of this new conception the excellent Sid Meier's Civilization: Revolution. It's not just a problem of the interface - which remains fundamentally the biggest obstacle to overcome - but also of the concept, of different audiences, of how they enjoy video games and what they expect in most cases. The Sims series is another example of a game naturally linked to the PC: it lends itself to game sessions with a diversified approach (fast, long, ~creative~ or simply passive), it is contemplative and requires an interface capable of making easily spend a lot of time between menus and options to select and, last but not least, makes customization one of its founding elements, complete with the possibility of modifying features and game elements at will, which over time has favored an anthology of mods and machinima by one of the largest and most robust communities in the history of video games. These elements are quite distant from those present in the normal playful offer on consoles, therefore a profound reworking of the game by EA was probably necessary. In the end however, despite a year and a half of delay compared to the PC version, The Sims 3 does not present itself as a revolution (or distortion, as purists might think) in the concept of the original, rather a slight simplification but structured in such a way to still contain all the characteristic elements of the PC version, with some particular additions and obviously an interface built to be managed through a controller, instead of the good old combination of mouse and keyboard. However, starting from a general softening of the structure already carried out on the PC version, The Sims 3 introduces some new features while leaving the mechanics of the original unchanged, from which it differs in the use of the controller (which remains an element against, given the pointer setting derived directly from PC) and for the addition of karma and the ability to trade user-created game content across online platforms. Xbox 360 goals In The Sims 3 there are 50 achievements for the usual 1000 total Gamerpoints to collect, located within the vast world of possibilities offered to the player. Generally they are related to the satisfaction of special requests from the Sims or to the achievement of the objectives constantly placed on the player as the game progresses. Since this is not a title with a story and consequently a real scan in levels, to reach all the achievements it is necessary to devote oneself to numerous activities and explore the possibilities offered in depth. Virtual men The first impact with The Sims 3 is rather soft, despite the enormous amount of notions to learn and actions to perform from the first hours of the game, the introduction to the management mechanics of the Sims is gradual and supported by a valid help system and layered instructions that allow you to get a pretty clear view of the game action. We obviously start from the character editor, a complete but not dispersive tool, decidedly friendlier than other more serious tools such as the related construction systems of the protagonists present, for example, in Bethesda titles. The options available for modifying the appearance are well illustrated and in a few steps it is possible to obtain the desired result, then if you want to immerse yourself in the glittering world of extreme customization of details, looks and clothing, we will certainly find bread for our teeth , but what is still noticeable is the ~user-friendly~ setting of the editor, which in a few minutes allows you to build your own virtual family or your own single character, in case you want to immediately jump into the action, while allowing however, to deepen the creation for the maniacs of customization. After the physical characterization we move on to the character and psychological one, another novelty of the third chapter, with a series of preferences to be granted to the various characters to define their identity. The possibilities are many but we can only choose 4 distinctive traits per person (for example: ~party animal~, ~lonely~, flirtatious~, ~emotional~ and so on), as well as 3 preferences to be agreedking between musical style, favorite food and color. All of this will affect the life path of the Sims, determining personal inclinations in terms of career, hobbies, preferences in terms of friendships and interpersonal relationships. In this chapter the double soul typical of the series remains, that is on the one hand the simulation of life, with all the actions to be carried out, the control of the state of one's characters through the various bars that indicate their physiological and psychological needs, and from the other is the construction of a world to your liking, connected to the possibility of modifying houses and the surrounding environment, buying objects and customizing the game environment with the large amount of options available. If you want to temporarily leave out the core of the game to dedicate yourself exclusively to the modification and creation of objects, clothes, houses and so on, it is also possible to directly access the ~study~ from the initial menu. Omnipotence and karma At any moment of the game it is possible to call up a simple general menu which allows you to switch from controlling the ~life~ of the sims to building and managing the house, as well as managing the new powers linked to karma and controlling the ~challenges~. Essentially what we have to do in the game is try to make our sims as satisfied as possible, and this happens both by ensuring that they lead a more or less healthy life (that is, by keeping an eye on the physiological and psychological parameters and acting accordingly) between food, hygiene, sleep and personal relationships, and trying as much as possible to make their wishes come true. These are largely determined by the character predisposition of the characters and concern various achievements from the working or study sphere to the artistic, sporting, economic and sentimental sphere. The fulfillment of these requests determines the conquest of positive karma, which can be spent to obtain material goods (objects, food or anything else) or to use special karmic powers that make it easier to achieve certain objectives or change the status of sims, perhaps by instantly removing a negative mood or allowing us to win the attention of a person instantly, but we must use them sparingly because an abuse of powers can result in a flow of negative karma capable of launching real ~curses~ on the sims . Ultimately, this is the most innovative element introduced by the console version of The Sims 3, an addition that integrates well with the fabric of the game, also because this chapter is characterized by a greater scansion of the objectives and the ~missions~ to be accomplished for each sims, thus limiting the sense of disorientation that the amount of possibilities for action proposed, as well as the presence here of a vast world to explore freely, would arouse in the player. On the other hand, it is always easy to get lost in the maze of the menus and the HUD, on the other hand the choice to propose practically the same interface present on the PC but adapted to the controller was from this point of view risky. It takes some time to precisely memorize the functions of each single key and understand exactly the meaning of the numerous ~curtains~ and icons that appear on the screen. Once the mechanism has been assimilated, everything goes quite smoothly, but a certain perseverance and conviction is needed to be able to fully get in tune with the interface and with the mechanics of a particular game like this. A world to live Another fundamental novelty introduced by this third chapter of the series is the presence of a vast world to explore freely, synthesized yes in points of interest but still present in industrial quantities. From the general map it is possible to zoom in on the individual sections, to observe the life of the sims in a detached way or to act directly with one's own characters. Outside the family home we therefore find a bit of everything: theme parks, gardens, shopping centres, workplaces, swimming pools, libraries, museums and many other topical places for the development of many different lives. In each of these places it is possible to interact with all the objects present through various actions of your choice, or of course socialize with the numerous passing people who populate the miniature world in a rather realistic way. It is clear that the possibility of ranging at any time from one place to another, compared to the watertight locations-compartments to which the previous chapters had accustomed us, gives a whole new depth to this one which is proposed in an even more convincing way as a simulation of life into a video game, a fundamental step towards the evolution of the series. Years after the second chapter,then, the graphic improvements through which the whole system of the game has passed are obvious, with greater attention to detail and more convincing polygonal models, but anchored to the particular semi-caricatured representation that has characterized the series for a few years this part. Of course, it is nothing particularly spectacular from an aesthetic point of view, with necessarily simple polygonal modeling and great austerity in the representation of textures (as well as some uncertainty recorded in the interpenetration between polygons or in the loading of structures which sometimes leads to imbalances in the scenario) , but the atmosphere of the Sims world is all there, happy and carefree as always. Note, however, an audio accompaniment which, beyond the sound effects and usual ~simlish~ dialogues, performs its duty very well even with spot-on accompanying music.", "date": "2010-10-26", "grade": "7.5"}
