I study the task of reinterpreting the mechanics of the original Digimon World in order to pack a new chapter of the franchise for PlayStation 4. In reality Next Order was born as a title for PlayStation Vita, released in Japan almost a year ago and translated on the Sony flagship in a very similar way to what happened with Cyber Sleuth, that is, retaining the simple polygonal geometries of the portable version, improving the textures and doubling the frame rate, which in this specific case passes to rock-solid sixty frames per second. A technical result which unfortunately does not strike much due to the poor quality of the graphics, but which however does not in any way want to act as one of the strengths of this production, capable of leveraging other elements. Digimon World: Next Order takes the peculiarities of the original for an experience dedicated to fans only Something old, something new Digimon World: Nexto Order starts or - better - starts again from the characters, starting with Takuto and Shiki, who return from the original Digimon World. While trying to turn on the device that allowed him to manage his virtual pets, the protagonist we have selected is sucked into the digital world and there, escorted by two Digimon, he is forced to face a dangerous opponent. This first battle serves as a tutorial with respect to the novelties that characterize the game's real-time combat system, with the back buttons used to give orders to the two monsters that make up our roster, through the appearance of a wheel with a variable number of options, and the X button which allows you to encourage Digimon by increasing a particular gauge. Performing this action during the attacks multiplies the score and allows, at a certain point, to perform special moves or even the ExE, a fusion between the two monsters that gives life to a very powerful Omegamon until the end of the fight. Once this introductory phase is completed, we come across dear old Jijimon, who asks for our help to ensure that the city of Floatia can grow and develop thanks to the arrival of new Digimon, which we will therefore have the task of ~recruiting~ during our explorations of the scenario. In return we will receive the help necessary to return to the real world, but getting to that point in the adventure will be no mean feat, which depending on our familiarity with the peculiarities of the monsters and with the rules of their world could require something like forty hours or more, in the perspective of five long chapters. Work out, eat, sleep, poop The mechanism of training, essential to increase the capabilities of our Digimon in terms of strength, endurance, speed, wisdom, hit points and magic points, has been substantially speeded up compared to the origins of the franchise, however this does not make it in any case modern or pleasant, indeed the repetitiveness of this and other aspects of the experience must necessarily be taken into account: if you are a longtime fan of the series maybe you won't even mind, but if you approach the Digimon universe for the first time it is the case that you know what awaits you. We were talking about training: having reached the Floatia gym, a city that serves as a hub for missions, we will be able to use a simple device and select the training that interests us to improve the individual stats, while performing a trivial minigame in which you have to stop a cursor moving in order to get an extra bonus. Naturally, one cannot train for months and leave the gym with two monstrous strength warriors, however things are not very different from this: it is absolutely necessary to avoid that the fatigue bar is pushed beyond half, to let the monsters, feed them in the best possible way (a character from Floatia will provide us with some rations of meat every day, while we can find other foods around or as a reward for fights), remember to make them go to the bathroom when they ask us (unless we don't like the idea of them pissing themselves, with serious repercussions on their mood) and finally making them sleep when they are sleepy. Despite the care and attention we will put into breeding Digimon, inevitably at some point we will see them die out of the blue: their life cycle has a precise end, and although it is possible to increase it with some tricks, we will have to accept it and ... start all over again. An element capable of generating grandand frustration, it is clear, but which is mitigated by the concept of ~offspring~ which involves the new eggs that we are going to hatch: some of them will have inherited certain statistics of the deceased monsters, making their evolution faster and perhaps even longer life expectation; all from the point of view of a bestiary that has over two hundred Digimon, including color variants. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-five Trophies of Digimon World: Next Order are linked to the completion of the long campaign, but also and above all to the management side of the experience. In fact, there are achievements that are obtained by leveling up Floatia and her activities, acquiring certain materials, completing the most advanced digivolutions and engaging in battles in the Colosseum, which is unlocked at a certain point in the game. Go out and have fun The training activity and everything we will find ourselves doing in Floatia, with many new possibilities that will be unlocked as we manage to populate the city with new Digimon, act as a preparatory phase with respect to exploration and combat, factors these that determine the progression in the story. The map is fairly large, made up of interconnected areas, although in practice empty and poorly interactable, beyond some objects or materials to collect around. You have to remember where to go by following the details of the mission on duty and possibly get in touch with the enemies to give life to clashes that will be resolved in our favor or that will see us badly defeated (and sent back to the city) depending on the level we have reached up to that point. The in-game indications are unfortunately not generous and detailed from this point of view, and it is therefore essential to use the first experience points obtained by the protagonist to improve his ability to give orders to the Digimon, firstly unlocking new attacks and secondly the fundamental ability to parry the blows of enemies. The management of the clashes is not random, in the sense that the enemies are in sight and we can avoid them if we want (or they will avoid us themselves, when they see that we are too strong), but there are circumstances in which it is very difficult to escape a fight and there is the feeling of a ~hole~ from the point of view of gameplay precisely from the point of view of grinding, see for example the opponents we will have to face during one of the first main quests, excessively powerful compared to our level. As mentioned, the combat system can be enriched by many facets as you progress through the story and unlock certain elements, but its impact on the enjoyment of the experience is not extraordinary, probably due to the semi-automatic approach which makes it complicated intervene when there is really a need or in any case take full responsibility for the confrontation. The biggest problems, however, are the very heavy backtracking we are forced to do to return to the various areas (unless you want to spend fairly high sums to buy ~passes~), the ~virtual pet~ elements that appear in the least opportunities (if you don't have a portable bathroom, it's a pain...) and, in general, a mediocre technical sector, which does not exploit the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in any way: the polygonal geometries, as mentioned, are very simple, worthy of a handheld, and the characterization of the scenarios is consequently poor, clinging almost exclusively to color tones or other expedients in order to obtain a minimum degree of variety. A similar argument can be made for the sound sector: there is good music, even a song sung in the introduction, but the fact that they are repeated so often pushes them to deactivate them at a certain point, whereas the effects are really ugly.", "date": "2017-01-30", "grade": "7.0"}
