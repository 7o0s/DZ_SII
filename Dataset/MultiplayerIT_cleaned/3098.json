{"name": "Deep Rock Galactic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deep-rock-galactic-recensione.html", "text": "Dwarfs, whether they live in a fantasy or sci-fi world, their job is always the same: dig, dig, dig. In the Deep Rock Galactic review we will see how those protagonists of this title are no different from the others. Indeed, if we want the product Ghost Ship Games is the sum of the mythology of the dwarf, one of its purest and most pristine representations, given that there are no other races to counter it. The story that forms the background to the action is a rather superfluous canvas that would not even be worth reporting. Let's say that our mission is to go and recover materials inside some large asteroids on behalf of an intergalactic mining company, Deep Rock Galactic, so as to scrape together money and other resources with which to improve and customize our character. If you like, it's the usual race to accumulate, or rather a not too veiled celebration of the capitalist system, but in this case done particularly well, especially if shared with friends. Gameplay The gameplay of Deep Rock Galactic is very simple to explain: having chosen our dwarf from one of the four available classes (Gunner, Explorer, Driller and Engineer) you have to select one of the available missions and set off on an adventure alone or in the company of a maximum of three other dwarfs. As we will see, the latter is the ideal configuration for playing, but let's not rush too much. Each mission offers a reward appropriate to its level of difficulty. Usually we are asked to collect a certain amount of a given mineral, but there are also variants that include the collection of hidden objects, such as eggs, or others in which you have to kill particularly difficult enemies, or still others in which you have to arrange damage caused by those who preceded us. In any case we will have to dig. The caves we will enter are procedurally generated and are completely destructible. Each class of dwarf has its own specific equipment, but he never fails to carry a precious pickaxe with him, which allows not only to crush the veins of precious ore, but also to dig into the bare rock. Throughout all the missions we will be followed by a mineral storage unit, which we will be able to use to get rid of what we have collected and to ask for supplies, in case we run out of bullets or other useful objects such as grenades or grappling hooks. At the end of each mission, our dwarf will be rewarded not only with the pay he is entitled to, but also with experience points. The latter will unlock levels, linked to the upgrades of the dwarf or equipment. Ghost Ship Games has worked hard to make the characters as customizable as possible, both aesthetically and in their endowment. The progression system really takes into account every aspect of our dwarf and allows you to upgrade each piece of his equipment, with some improvements that are unlocked only after leveling up and which cannot be accumulated with others of the same range, but can be kept in the if you want to try them later (or want to recover them). In this way it is possible to experience all the bonuses, without however unbalancing the game making our dwarf too powerful. Cooperative mode But let's go back to the caves. These are usually mazes of rock, lava, crystals and so on (depends on the selected biome) that require you to go deeper and deeper to hunt for what the mission requires. Once the primary objectives have been achieved, the extraction ship can be called which will take us back to the base, retracing the entire road traveled. Sadly the caves aren't depopulated...in fact, they're full of giant insects that can't wait to tear us apart to protest our aggressive expansionist policy (or because they were designed that way, Jessica Rabbit would say). Under normal conditions there are not many enemies around. The real danger is represented by the hordes, i.e. the large waves of insects to be killed mercilessly. The only way to stop them is to survive long enough for them to run out. Now, imagine four dwarfs helping each other in such a narrow and dangerous environment. Is there a chasm too high? The engineer can create platforms for everyone to pass. Do we want to know what's in a cave whose characteristics we can't see well? We can send the Scout forward with his portable zipline, which will also support the whole team with his flares. In Deep Rock Galactic, teamwork pays off and is challenging, to the point that we would define it as one of the best cooperative games on the market. The developers havefollowed the many recommendations given by the community and have released about thirty updates since the launch in Early Access which took place now more than two years ago, expanding the content and fixing what needed fixing. The sensations you feel in some moments are truly peculiar, such as when you are surrounded by a horde in a narrow space and you feel surrounded, but you manage to make each other stronger, using the ideas of all the players involved to to survive. The contextual communication system is also excellent, allowing you to indicate resources and enemies with great clarity. In this case, the community also takes care of the classic icing on the cake, really helpful and very supportive of novices, as well as one of the least toxic in the video game industry. We hadn't played a title online for years without suffering insults of all kinds or seeing some gruesome scene. Let's hope that with the post-launch success the situation doesn't deteriorate. The only flaw of the cooperative mode, if we want to call it that, is the friendly fire which can cause some moments of frustration. Nothing dramatic, but it's not nice to accidentally hit a teammate (or be hit). The single player Unfortunately, as Deep Rock Galactic is excellent when played in cooperative mode, it is repetitive when played alone. The reason is simple: in more people it is possible, if not really necessary, to exploit the full potential of the individual characters to get out of the mines alive, while in single player many stimuli are missing, despite being the player in the company of a drone. In particular, we end up noticing the repetitiveness of the objectives to be carried out which, despite the presence of different biomes, are always reduced to doing the same things. The developers have promised that in future updates they will increase the variety of missions, but for now the situation is this. Also add that the enemies become less aggressive, castrating some particularly tense situations such as the already described encircles of the hordes, and you will understand why in some circumstances it seems to be faced with a different title from that of the cooperative mode. After all, it is clear from the main hub that Deep Rock Galactic was designed to be played in coop, which is a kind of pub base where, in addition to carrying out all the micromanagement activities of the character, there is also room for a little of sociability. A beer with friends strengthens team spirit, not much to say. Graphics From a technical point of view, the Ghost Ship Games title performs quite well, at least for what its objectives are. Bear in mind that there isn't much spectacular, but some of the caves offer some nice views, despite being procedurally generated. In principle, the advanced biomes are more beautiful than the first ones, which are largely anonymous. Compensating for this is the fact that the entire game world is completely destructible. Of course, it makes little sense to dig blindly stressing this feature, but knowing that there is nothing that can withstand the blows of our pickaxe gives us a certain taste. The enemies are also well done, all substantially large and very dangerous insects, which when they attack en masse make their appearance. The soundtrack is less incisive, which does its job but does not remain impressed that much, despite the presence of a rich sample of effects and some catchy songs.", "date": "2020-05-14", "grade": "9.0"}
