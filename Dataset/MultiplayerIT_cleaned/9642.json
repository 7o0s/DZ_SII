Every now and then a piece gets lost along the way, but for those who aren't intimidated by challenges, this is the best opportunity to understand what Kinect can do in the future. Good and bad From Knuckles, to Shadow, up to Tails and Amy (obviously Dr. Robotnick/Eggman is not missing), all the most loved characters of the saga, but also the super forgettable ones, are part of the roster of runners that can be selected to play Sonic Free Riders. Apart from the online modes, free racing on the 16 tracks available, and the cooperative or versus modes for two players in split screen, the game is based on a progressive campaign, made up of short races to be overcome by fulfilling requirements ranging from collecting a certain number of rings within a certain time, rather than performing certain stunts or finishing first in a limited number of laps. The different races are connected by a story, the details of which you will want to skip hands down (and it is appropriate to say this since to skip the films you have to reach out for the Kinect), told with static images and dialogues in English, subtitled in Italian. The campaign, in reality and together with the tutorial, is used to familiarize yourself with what the game asks you to do, and that is no small thing. Once you have chosen the character and the event, you stand perpendicular to the television and lean forward or backward to turn, as if you were on a skateboard. What is of fundamental importance and which will change your relationship with Sonic Free Riders is a small event that occurs before each race and which asks the player to follow a Chao for a short stretch of road so as to adjust the steering during the competition. What is not explained, but which is understood after a few attempts, is that here we must not lean excessively while following the little creature, but instead we must decide what degree of inclination will represent for us the maximum steering to the right, rather than to left. In a nutshell, if you lean too much during this calibration, Kinect, for example, before making Sonic bend during the race, will wait for the player to lean just as much, making life essentially impossible. It is therefore necessary to record contained movements that can be replicated normally during the game. The problem is that as a first approach and, given the speed of the action, combined with a little delay with which Sonic receives commands during the game, anyone who does not understand this mechanism will label Sonic Free Riders as not very manoeuvrable, running away get up. Xbox 360 goals The life of Achievement collectors won't be easy with Sonic Free Riders, as you have to sweat to collect the 50 steps in which the 1000 points are divided. By finishing the campaign, expect to get between 250 and 300 points, while to go further you need to use all the characters, play online and set record times on the tracks, even in the Expert version. Sonic = Hardcore We were talking about the depth of the gameplay which actually puts into the player's body all the possibilities that are usually entrusted to the buttons of a pad, linking them, however, to movements naturally executable in life. By picking up a bowling ball to throw at the opponents, this is thrown with the relative movement of the hand holding it. Collected, however, a can of soda, it must be shaken to make it explode and to be used as a turbo during the race. And these are just some of the power-ups that you meet along the tracks, well done and running smoothly all the time, even if they certainly don't scream a technological miracle in terms of detail or texture quality. Not counting these extra powers, we must consider that along the track there are pylons to hold on to, extending your arms, to find hidden paths by making 90 degree turns; jumps to be made, even by pirouetting, and which sometimes end up in rings suspended in the air through which to fly by spreading your arms. When you end up in the water you have to mimic the strokes of a nuotata to maintain speed, stooping accelerates and, stretching the back foot forward and then kicking, the turbo is used, as if it were a push on a skateboard. Obviously, there are rings to collect, which are used to buy new boards and unlock powers (two for each board) and which help you slide better along the curbs or stay in the air longer when flying, for example. Just the collection of rings, among other things, makes us understand the difficulty of bringing gameplay from the pad to Kinect without any assistance, given that to take the rings you have to impact them with the same precision that would be required with the pad. However, obtaining it by tilting the pelvis forward or backward is a completely different matter. There would also be voice commands, but since they are not yet enabled in Italy, one has to limit oneself to navigating through a menu that is difficult to use (really not very precise), spending more time than necessary. Sonic Free Riders is a long-lived game, which even in split screen offers fun and a lot of sweat, which however would have needed a few more months of development, also given the particular calibration we told you about and which, however, is given for taken for granted in the long tutorial needed to learn how to play properly. The slight delay with which the game registers the player's movements and the frantic speed of the action don't go well with the precision with which the software asks you to perform the different movements (and there are many), but once you get used to everything, you you can get some satisfaction.", "date": "2010-11-17", "grade": "6.5"}
