The Winged Cloud visual novels have shaken the dreams of gamers who have had the opportunity to try them, thanks to the presence within them of increasingly undressed female protagonists, unequivocally linked to the Japanese soft erotic genre which is identified with the term ecchi. Although in such cases it is quite easy to fall into spicy clichs, Sakura's contents have more than once reached a level worthy of the most embarrassing situations seen in the films of Boldi and De Sica. All this preamble to say that after having made us experience the stories of the busty protagonists of the visual novels, the development team has decided to take a moment's break to land within another genre with Sakura Clicker: as suggested by the name, the new effort is in fact a game based on incremental dynamics, where in other words you always have to repeat the same action with the mouse. To accompany us we find the aforementioned little women: the fanservice is practically served, but we still try to understand if there is something more. Little girls in skimpy outfits and mouse clicks to make them moan: Sakura Clicker has arrived among us Orgasmic blows It's useless to be vague, we know it very well: if you've played any of the games that make up the Sakura series, you've wanted even for a fraction of a second to touch the abundant softness of its protagonists. Know that the thing becomes magically feasible thanks to Sakura Clicker, or at least it becomes so if you agree to ideally transform your limb into the mouse pointer. In fact, this game has very similar dynamics to those of Clicker Heroes. The main difference is that in this case you don't find yourself having to click on monsters, but on kind damsels in skimpy clothes, in order to inflict the damage necessary to defeat them and then get money to reinvest in a continuous cycle made up of more clicks and moans. The enemies take turns one after the other, offering clothes that leave very little room for the imagination. In describing the heart of the gaming experience we could practically stop here, but luckily there is a little more on the side dish: maintaining the similarity with Clicker Heroes, Sakura Clicker offers the player the possibility to hire some allied heroines with the coins obtained, increasing the level from time to time and unlocking their skills to inflict greater damage on the unfortunate enemies, with a higher amount of hit points as the game progresses. There are even bosses, but aside from even more health, they too must be clicked down (within a set number of seconds). Among the various skills of our allies we find the so-called Rebirth, through which to start the whole experience from scratch, however acquiring permanent bonuses to facilitate the road to obtaining billions and billions of coins in a shorter time compared to the previous game. Cliccorides From an aesthetic point of view, Sakura Clicker offers us a series of female figures taken with both hands from those that populate the various chapters of the series: round and buxom, with an unmistakable Japanese-style design that combines human and animal features or other cool elements. In addition to these ~enemies~ who ask us to mistreat them excessively, on the main screen we also find our protagonist, also engaged in exhibiting her forms that the player can customize to his liking, choosing from the small set of options available at the start or among those purchasable via Steam: although Sakura Clicker is distributed for free, inside there is in fact a shop in which to buy additional items. A choice that seems quite questionable, given that the items on sale could have been an incentive to go on with one's series of pleasurable clicks: in this way, the game instead ends up tiring after clicking on the billionth pair of boobs. It must be said that to push the player to continue playing, Winged Cloud has put in place the minimum of effort elsewhere too: the damsels that appear on the screen reproduce practically the same models with sometimes imperceptible differences, always remaining still except in moments when which tremble under our blows and begin to moan innocently, for a total of zero animations but eight hundred and more squeals that open the door to moments of unbridled masturbation.", "date": "2015-08-17", "grade": "3.5"}
