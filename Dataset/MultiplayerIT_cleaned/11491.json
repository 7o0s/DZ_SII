{"name": "SEGA Superstars Tennis - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-superstars-tennis-recensione.html", "text": "It is no mystery that sports spin-offs are a genre that Nintendo, in particular, has been working on for several years: we have seen Mario engaged in practically every sport, with fluctuating results. Well, SEGA also boasts a number of 'heritage' characters and is determined to capitalize on their popularity in the same way. And so, after Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, it's time for an arcade-style tennis game in which you can control as many as sixteen different characters from the most famous titles produced by the Japanese company. Outline mode After an animated introduction that mocks the ~self-celebratory~ atmospheres of Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers for Wii, we can start a quick game (with completely random parameters), enter single-player modes or access multiplayer. The latter is only available locally: we can challenge up to three friends (by organizing a double, of course) or share a single cartridge. Guilty, the online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is missing: it would have been an interesting possibility, capable of significantly increasing the longevity of the product. Single play allows us to participate in a single game or tournament, or to try our hand at a series of games whose mechanics are inspired by the SEGA classics. What do they consist of, exactly? Well, we will have to face a series of missions set in scenarios taken from titles such as ChuChu Rocket!, Jet Set Radio, Space Harrier, Sonic the Hedgehog etc. The purpose of each mission is different, for example in the Space Harrier scenario we will first have to run while avoiding the flying rocks, then hit them with the tennis ball. In the Sonic scenario, however, the trials are often based on collecting a certain number of rings before time runs out, and so on. The road to victory In SEGA Superstars Tennis it is the single player tournament that represents the most substantial mode. After selecting one of the available characters, we will have to face a sequence of opponents to finally arrive at the fight with Dr. Eggman. Each player has different skills: there are those who are fast (like Sonic), those who are powerful (like Amigo), those with good control (Ulala) or capable of giving spin to the ball (Tails). Once on the pitch, these differences are very noticeable, influencing our approach to matches. It is possible to play using the stylus and the touch screen, but it is a stopgap (to be activated in the options, however) compared to the classic controls via d-pad and buttons. There are two shots available, the tight one and the soft one, and the collision setting is very similar to the one seen in the Virtua Tennis series: you have to press the button before the ball reaches its destination, loading the shot and then determining its trajectory via the d-pad. There is little room for improvisation, unfortunately: pressing the button without advance often results in missing the ball. After a few exchanges, an indicator will fill up that allows us to activate a special shot using the back button R. It is a different shot for each character, which sends the ball into the opponent's half of the field in the most disparate ways: through rapid zigzags, proceeding in flames or falling like a bomb. In reality, resorting to it does not change things much, especially against human opponents: the trajectory of the shot is easily readable, you just have to be careful of the timing of the response. Technical realization Being the Nintendo DS version of a multiplatform title, it is clear that the developers had to give up many special effects and a certain level of detail. The characters have been reproduced in the best possible way, even if it is not difficult to notice the ~edges~ that usually characterize the simpler polygonal models. The animation is of a decent level, and the effort put into distinguishing each player according to his peculiarities must be commended: Nights flies and performs numerous somersaults in mid-air, while Sonic sometimes rolls towards the ball, etc. The stages are really nice, each one reproduces the typical settings of one of the characters, with an excellent use of colors. The game moves smoothly, without any uncertainty, thanks also to the use of a far from high number of polygons. As far as the sound is concerned, it falls within the average of titles of the genre: nice effects but nothing more, while the music stands out because it reproduces some of the most famous themes of the 80s and 90s, reminding us of when the soundtracks of games still had the power to stay ahead. We have already mentioned the control system: the version that uses the stylus and touch screen starts right upimmediately as a second choice, far from exciting, while the ~classic~ option is always ready, precise and immediate. Comment Having created one of the best tennis titles ever, SEGA had all the numbers to try the road of the sports spin-off involving all its most famous characters. The final result, unfortunately, is not as good as could be expected: SEGA Superstars Tennis is certainly nice and immediate, with its minigames, but it lacks the depth necessary to make the leap in quality. The graphics are the right mix between quantity and quality, with the players drawn and animated with care, but it is the gameplay that leaves something to be desired; also and above all due to a calibration of the busted difficulty, which allows us to tear everyone up and then bang our nose against a real wall, in this case a Dr. Eggman clearly stronger than his colleagues. In short, we are faced with a discreet but not excellent product, which SEGA fans should buy regardless but which will make tennis fans turn up their noses a little. Pros Different and well-characterized characters Nice and colorful graphics Excellent reinterpretations of some ~classic~ music Cons Approximate balance of difficulty Lacking in particular depth The minigames leave the time they find", "date": "2008-04-14", "grade": null}
