{"name": "The Outfit - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-outfit-recensione.html", "text": "Dressed to kill In the extremely picturesque scenario created by Relic, the Outfit is nothing more than a special team composed of three incredibly stereotypical characters: it is J.D. Tyler, Deuce Williams and Tommy Mac, classic American brutes tamarri beyond belief and above all armed to the teeth, which the user finds himself in command within a series of missions held together by a rather subtle storyline. Basically, all that the plot has to offer lies in the struggle of this heroic trio against the evil Nazi forces on French soil, with the cameo of some sui generis character to give a minimum of variety to the whole. And that The Outfit is not exactly one of the most exciting single player experiences that Xbox 360 has to offer can already be understood from the first bars of the campaign, which does not shine for completeness and entertainment capacity. Each of the 12 levels that make up the game can be tackled by choosing one of the three protagonists, different in skill (speed, health, power and leadership) and equipment, whose only common element is represented by an infinite supply of grenades. The peculiarity of The Outfit lies in the so-called Destruction on Demand system, the fulcrum of the strategic part of the Relic title So here Tommy Mac is equipped with a machine gun, flamethrower and can launch a gas attack; J.D. Tyler, the fastest, has a sniper rifle and another shotgun; Finally, Commander Deuce Williams is not subtle with his combination of revolver and bazooka. Beyond the choice of the hero of the moment, the peculiarity of The Outfit lies in the so-called Destruction on Demand system, the fulcrum of the strategic part of the Relic title and whose operation is extremely simple and intuitive. The annihilation of enemy forces leads to the accumulation of points, which can be spent on the purchase of support elements - to be selected via a pop-up menu - dropped in real time onto the field: in addition to simple soldiers (one can manage a maximum of four), the aids made available to the user range from fixed positions to armored vehicles up to powerful air attacks, theoretically to be used with full knowledge of the facts based on the scenarios in which you find yourself. In reality, the Destruction on Demand system, however interesting on paper, demonstrates all its limits pad in hand, caused primarily by an extremely linear stage design, which leads the player to often have to make forced choices rather than dictated by the own strategic instinct. Power without control Unfortunately, linearity is not the only flaw of The Outfit, which indeed makes big mistakes precisely in the characteristic elements of its gameplay. From a title that strongly encourages team action, it would be reasonable to expect optimal management of this aspect: instead, The Outfit offers the user a few simple orders to give to the troops, who moreover respond with dubious efficiency, due to an AI not exactly cutting edge. Reverse speech for the enemy troops, discreetly organized and above all equipped with an enviable and at least annoying aim. What's worse, is that the path of solitary action to make up for the deficiencies of one's fellow soldiers is not easily practicable: the fault of a woody and really imprecise control system in pointing, which indirectly makes enemies tougher than they actually would be . We then add that the weapons overheat within a few seconds, that the reload times are very slow and that some invisible barriers sometimes prevent the bullets from reaching their destination and the omelette is done. Relic also sins of ingenuity in the rendering of the splash damage (i.e. the collateral damage caused by explosions), almost non-existent and which literally halves the effectiveness of grenades, rockets and cannon shots, given that it is absolutely necessary to make a perfect center of one's objectives, including infantry. Insipid when not downright frustrating in single player, The Outfit manages to redeem itself in its online modes, venues that are decidedly more suitable for your type of gameplay. Bland if not downright frustrating in single player, The Outfit manages to redeem itself in its online modes Power without control A dozen well-crafted maps host deathmatch sessions or a sort of variant of the classic capture the flag, in which it is necessary to take possession of certain positions before the enemy. A maximum of six people divided into two teams can participate in the battles, and although the control problems persist even here, everything is decidedly more tolerable: and the opportunity offeredfrom the game of facing the campaign in cooperatives it makes the same significantly more reasoned and enjoyable. Speaking of graphics, however, The Outfit returns to less convincing levels, offering a cosmetic that doesn't really have much next-gen. Flying over the bad character design, the Relic title offers wide-ranging scenarios to the eye, albeit not very rich in details, mostly destructible but with visual effects in this regard that are anything but exciting. At least the frame rate always proves to be stable, even in the most agitated situations, but it's a rather meager consolation looking at other aspects that definitely don't do justice to the potential of the Xbox 360: the animations and the polygonal models of the characters themselves are in fact extremely crude for current standards, and some of the textures show off a definition of a baseness unthinkable for the Microsoft console. Finally, little to say about the sound sector: the banal military marches that form the backdrop to the action, the standard sound effects and a B-movie dubbing are such anonymous elements that you almost don't realize their presence. Comment The Outfit is not a bad game, but rather a naive title in putting its most characteristic aspects into practice with lightness and a certain superficiality, nullifying its potential. Simplistic and linear in its tactical elements and incomplete in the compartment action, The Outfit suffers particularly in single player, even if the online modes prove capable of resolving the situation, at least in part: the non-exciting quality level of the audiovisual department of the Relic title does not in fact, it helps the global evaluation of a product that simply appears a little too uninspired. Pros Enjoyable multiplayer High level of destruction Some innovative aspects Cons Lacky gameplay Unconvincing audiovisual production Rather bland in single player So far, the vast majority of titles based on the Second World War have essentially divided into two large groups: the strategic and the fps, not without some interesting mixing within these same genres. However, the excessive proliferation of war-related products has ended up oversaturating the market, objectively sated with video games reproducing the exploits of heroic American soldiers against Hitler's evil Germans. Probably also for this reason Relic has decided to go against the tide with his The Outfit, a third-person shooter with tactical appearances decidedly devoted to destruction...", "date": "2006-04-20", "grade": null}
