How many times have we faced such a situation on iPhone? With the growing popularity of tower defense, such mechanics are now almost part of the ordinary administration. Yet Crap of Defense looks more like an action game than a strategic one, it replaces tactical decisions with timing and offers us the beauty of seventy-two stages distributed between two different campaigns (standard and ~winter~), in turn divided into three difficulty levels. The gameplay is extremely simple and immediate: within each scenario we have to identify the approaching enemy soldiers, load the cannon and release shots capable of creating a more or less large explosion on the pitch, complete with a crater to testify the violence of the impact. A bar indicates what the power of the bullet will be, and is loaded by holding your finger down on the touch screen until we remove it and fire the cannon, which will impact at the exact point where the pressure on the screen stops. Depending on the type of our opponents, who gradually become faster and more resistant, we have to calculate the time it takes for the projectile to reach the target and aim accordingly. Hitting a line of enemies ~grazing~ often means that we will see them fall and get up and then proceed back to our base. What a defense of m... Once the game has started, we can select one of the two campaigns and then try our hand at each of the three difficulty levels present, overcoming the stages one at a time. The mechanics always remain the same, fundamentally, even if at the beginning of each mission we can read a short textual briefing that clarifies the key points of that particular level: sometimes you simply have to eliminate all the enemies, others you have to resist for a certain number of minutes , and so on. Going forward, more powerful and/or faster cannons are obtained when loading shots, as well as from each crater power-ups can emerge to be used there and then, by touching them, and which offer us extra explosive charges, time bonuses, etc. Crap of Defense is offered on the App Store for 1.59 euros, and the recent update to version 2.0 has led to the addition of a new campaign which effectively doubled the number of stages available. Therefore, bearing in mind only the numbers and the quality / price ratio, talking about a advisable title is little. However there are other aspects of the iFun4all branded game that strike from the very first moment, among all the very original technical realization. Although the ~background~ for each campaign always remains the same, i.e. a digitized photograph which, in contrast to the other elements, is so ~trashy~, the whole has been thought of as a sort of collage made by a child, with our tank and enemy soldiers represented as drawings on scraps of paper. At school we all enjoyed playing games like this (hopefully not during class...), and seeing the same solution applied to a video game can only make you smile. Let's say that the approach is very similar to that of the very popular Doodle Jump, although in the case of Crap of Defense the idea is even better. Let's also add some deliberately ~out of tune~ music, a sort of parody of the epic soundtracks of certain war films, and the picture is complete.
