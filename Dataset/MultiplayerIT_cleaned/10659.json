To be precise, in the Disgaea series evil people are condemned to be reborn in the form of Prinny, creatures that have everything in common with penguins apart from the ability to speak and a worrying tendency to explode. So numerous as to form an army of a thousand unity, the Prinnies follow the orders of the despotic princess Etna, who never misses an opportunity to punish them in an exemplary way. This time the situation is truly desperate, however: someone had the audacity to steal the mistress's Ultra Dessert, and the Prinnies must recover the ingredients within a certain number of hours, facing six different stages full of pitfalls and crowned by the clash with increasingly more and more bosses. dangerous. One in a thousand makes it As mentioned above, the Prinnies form an army of a thousand units, and in the game we will have a thousand attempts available to complete all the stages and recover the ingredients of the Ultra Dessert: as soon as our character dies, he is replaced by a perfectly identical. Anyone who thinks that the total number of lives is disproportionate and abundantly sufficient to complete the game, however, will end up changing his mind after a few minutes. Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero? it is in fact an extraordinarily difficult platformer, which in most cases sees us face several enemies together, moreover with very limited resources available. It is possible to jump (even double) by pressing the X button, while the Square button is used to attack with knives. Hitting during a jump translates into an offensive maneuver that is as spectacular as it is effective: the framing changes from the classic 2D to an isometric view that underlines the polygonal composition of the graphics, while our blows are projected onto the ground creating small blue explosions. It is also possible to perform the most classic of flying attacks, the ~cascade~ one, by pressing the d-pad down while jumping and pressing the X button again. This solution is used to daze certain opponents and proves to be essential during the fight with the boss. The Triangle button allows us to pick up and throw objects or enemies (when they're groggy), while the Circle button is loaded and released to produce a quick sprint when we need it. Finally, holding down the right back button while using the d-pad allows you to glance up and down the stage before plunging into the unknown. Old school We were saying that Prinny is a very difficult platformer, and its difficulty depends on two factors: on the one hand, the presence of several enemies who attack us simultaneously, on the other, the heavy limitations on our character's movement. The Prinny we control cannot ~manage~ the jump after he has made it, as happened in Ghosts 'n Goblins, and the only way he can not fall into an abyss, for example, is to direct the second jump (double) in another direction. At the same time, moving is far from fast, and shooting is reveals a maneuver too slow to perform, which in most cases tends to be excluded. It therefore appears clear that, with these constraints, facing very cunning enemies in their attack patterns (all while fireballs are shot at us from afar) becomes a truly complex undertaking, which requires patience and precision. There is no shortage of checkpoints within the stages, the only problem is to reach them without losing too many lives. And at the end of each level we will find a boss waiting for us, often very resistant and equipped with a sequence of attacks to memorize to organize our strategy. We will have to work with what we have, without being able to count on power-ups or any ~growth~ of the character. The alternative situations, in which our Prinny gets on board vehicles equipped with weapons, are unfortunately few and poorly conceived, therefore they fail to make a difference in the gameplay economy. Playability or replayability? Completing Prinny is not easy, but the most savvy players will be able to complete the company in less than ten hours. At that point, some new modes will become available, such as the one in which the stages can be replayed with changes in the setting to obtain alternative endings. Technical realization The first thing that catches the eye (literally!) of the new title developed by Nippon Ichi is the high quality of the graphics: from the design of the characters to the composition of the stages, from the use of colors to the fluidity of the animations, Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero? it really looks spectacular. Penguins take on truly hilarious expressions, in pure Japanese style, and they steal more than a smile from us. The ~human~ characters appear more anonymous, while the enemies are quite varied and imaginative, with a rather large movement set. The polygonal constitution of the graphics stands out on more than one occasion, the shot changes are spectacular and the scrolling is always fluid, never faltering. The action is accompanied by a sound sector that is finally up to the situation: the Prinnies talk to each other with spot on and amusing voices, while various well-crafted pieces of music color their deeds.", "date": "2009-07-02", "grade": "7.4"}
