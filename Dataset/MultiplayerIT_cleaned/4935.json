There are titles, however, so incredible from the gameplay point of view that they are still unsurpassed in certain aspects today, absolute pearls that even after twenty years cause moments of reckless pleasure even in the most upright and imperturbable of individuals. Bayonetta is exactly a little thing of this type: a total masterpiece among the ~stylish~ action games, son of the bombastic man who practically invented the genre with the first Devil May Cry (Hideki Kamiya) and amazing evolution of that gameplay, it is a title that deserved much more successful than actually achieved, despite a ~cult game~ status achieved over the years and a fair amount of copies sold. Here, after several years this shiny gem has also arrived in the homes of computer owners, thanks to a PC port announced with great pomp by SEGA on which - due to not very pleasant past experiences with the ports of Platinum Games products - there it was more than a few troubling doubts. Yet, destroying expectations as usual, the most iconic witch in the gaming world has arrived on Steam without forcing fans to hold their noses and wait for the inevitable corrective patches. Yes, you got it right: Bayonetta on PC runs like a marvel, and today we are going to explain to you in detail why you should make it yours as soon as possible. Bayonetta has arrived on the computer, with all the class that distinguishes it: our review! Heel. Tip. Combos. Before delving into the technique, it is necessary to remember why Bayonetta remains, after all this time, still a bulwark among action games, approached only by a few masterpieces (such as the latest Devil May Cry and Itagaki's Ninja Gaiden, so to speak) and surpassed only by its sequel when it comes to the finesse of the mechanics and spectacularity of the clashes. So much goodness comes not so much from the complexity of the combinations of blows - however enormous due to the possibility of equipping different weapons for the legs and arms of the protagonist, and of switching between two sets in combat - but from the incredible pace that the game allows you to maintain while you fight, due to some ingenious mechanics. During a combo, for example, it's possible to keep the combos in the ~buffer~ (memory) if you use the loaded variants of the attacks; this allows in all respects to start a combination, perform a certain loaded maneuver, dodge and continue it after the movement while keeping your action plan unchanged even while the enemies attack the protagonist. Once mastered, everything turns into a magnificent ballet, where precision must be absolute and reflexes well filed, since as in all Kamiya's games, even in Bayonetta variable medals are obtained based on the score, and just a tap from the enemies to send to hell the effort made up to that moment. Then consider that to this exceptional base - which gives a not indifferent replayability to the title - accessories are added to customize the fighting style, extra bloody scenic moves, shots with projectiles from a distance to keep certain types of enemies at bay, and a variety of textbook opponents, and you'll soon realize why Kamiya and the Platinums have made a name for themselves among longtime video game enthusiasts. So it matters little if the narrative of the game is excessive to the point of almost grotesque, caciarona and forgettable: Bayonetta is pure gameplay in its highest form. If you have been playing video games for some time, it will make you cry with emotion at each level faced. A fine job But let's go back to the heart of the conversion, because we already knew how exceptional Bayonetta is from the point of view of mechanics, and the question that needs to be answered here is the usual: does it run worthily on PC? Well, as mentioned already in the introduction of this piece, the answer is yes. We are faced with the best port ever made of a Platinum game, a little gem that has never given us half a problem, and works divinely on almost all configurations. We tried it on a mid-range computer, but we looked around and found that in its current state Bayonetta runs more than passable even on PCs with a toaster instead of a graphics card. Medium-low configurations allow you to play in 1080p at 60 frames per second granite; up the ante of the components and you can tinker with the various graphic options (rather basic, but cohowever rich) and enjoy it at very high resolutions without any jolts. Of course, this is a Platinum game, so forget about exceeding 60 images per second (the reasons are also mathematical, because action games of this type have almost fighting game mechanics and are therefore programmed around these figures), however it is fantastic to see a total absence of hiccups, snaps and dips in a game where fluidity is essential. The novelties are less good, practically absent: the only problem with this version lies in the fact that the title is unchanged from the original, and has no extras of any kind apart from the graphic options and the ability to use the mouse and the keyboard. Understandably we wouldn't recommend jumping into this pair to get the most out of it, but at least the controls are well implemented, with no weird mouse acceleration and sensibly mapped keys. For the record, the cost of the game is far from prohibitive and is around twenty euros. Money well spent, there's not much more to say.", "date": "2017-04-17", "grade": "8.8"}
