{"name": "Die Hard: Vivere o Morire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/die-hard-vivere-o-morire.html", "text": "Very rarely the tie-ins, or precisely the games based on films, have also brought with them a sufficient quality in the gameplay; with the fourth effort by John McClane, Bruce Willis's alter ego, the transalpine software house has chosen to play it safe, aiming for the umpteenth time on the proven formula of action/platform games, based on a playful structure that unites a good portion of titles in the Gameloft catalog. Therefore, most of the time is occupied by the standard levels, with a side view, in which the hero must try to reach the end of the stage by eliminating all the enemies that appear in front of him. Certainly the good John will be able to have weapons of various kinds, but the ideal situation for the free-range character played by Bruce Willis is one in which he can rely only on his fists. The programmers have in fact dedicated particular attention to hand-to-hand combat and above all to the animations of the protagonist, really rich and well done. Even the aspect of the plot and the non-playable sequences has been treated with particular attention, so as to make the title in question one of the most ~cinematic~ products present today as today in the mobile gaming market. But more generally Die Hard Live or Die is a title that confirms once again the indisputable technical skills and knowledge that Gameloft has in the field of mobile games, offering environments full of details and very well designed, with levels of parallax and a more than satisfactory use of colour. If we had to stop at the graphic side, therefore, this Die Hard would deserve a promotion with full marks; unfortunately, as already anticipated, it is impossible not to have to point the finger again at the static nature of the game designers of the software house, now anchored to a game scheme that for those who have gotten their hands on Splinter Cell, Mission Impossible 3, the Pirates of the Seven Seas and so on can only appear as an enormous and continuous dj-vu. In this sense, Gameloft to differentiate the titles seems to focus only on the mini-games or on the secondary levels; in this case we are faced with sections driving a police car or other means, with a view from above, trying to avoid other cars and obstacles on the road. The mini-games are instead resolved in defusing bombs or moving lasers, all through a very simple and immediate interface. Looking at Die Hard with the eye of someone who has never dealt with Gameloft products, there would really be nothing to object to, except for the excessive brevity with which the end is reached: excellent technical aspect, good playability, pleasant side dish, and in general a care in the realization that you hardly see in mobile games. But the total lack of originality and the now unsustainable recycling trend that is distinguishing the latest Gameloft products imposes a much less flattering judgment.
