In short, of course, otherwise you would fall asleep instead of rushing to replay the masterpiece created in collaboration between Level-5 and Studio Ghibli (attention: the writer practically never uses the word ~masterpiece~). It began in 2010, with the arrival of Ni no Kuni on Nintendo DS; yes, the main adventure had to begin and end on a portable console. That game never came to us, but in Japan the following year the leap from Nintendo DS to PlayStation 3 was made, with an expanded, revised and even richer and more long-lived version. It still took three years before Ni no Kuni: The Menace of the Ash Witch could also arrive in Europe, in 2013. And today, six years later, we are still here, talking to you about Ni no Kuni: The Menace of the Strega Cinerea Remastered, which this time also arrives on other consoles. How did the conversion go? Well. Very good. Gajarda, as Lucciconio would say. The port to Playstation 4 Ni no Kuni: Menace of the Cinerea Witch Remastered is the revised, corrected and technically modified version of the original title, a port intended for current generation consoles. The company QLOC took care of the remake, which perhaps some of you will remember for having also taken charge of the porting of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice and Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, just to mention the first ones that come to mind. The conversions of QLOC have not always made a miracle cry, but in this case Level-5 and Bandai Namco have adequately supervised the works and you will hold the result in your hands on the next 20 September 2019; we already anticipate that it is a truly remarkable restoration work. We tried Ni no Kuni: The Menace of the Cinerea Witch Remastered on PlayStation 4 Pro, so it's only right to say a few words about some options available exclusively on the Sony flagship. The main menu will put you here in front of two very specific choices, each of which can be freely modified and selected at any time by returning to the title screen. The first option allows you to play in real 4K with 30 FPS, the second at 1440p and 60 FPS (only on PC there is an option for 4K with 60 FPS). Now, we have changed this setting several times trying to notice a graphic change on the 4K home TV: the writer has come to the conclusion that the visual beauty of the title does not disfigure at all in 1440p, and that it is worth holding dear the 60 FPS during exploration and combat. From a technical point of view, however, the port made by QLOC is a real gem: the original title was already beautiful to see and play on PlayStation 3, and now on PlayStation 4 Pro it is simply enchanting. The anime-style cutscenes have only been partially revised, but all the transition phases made with the game engine have been modified by improving images, artwork and backdrops. From time to time the silhouettes of the protagonists stand out a little too much against the background, even in the brightness of the colours, but the effect doesn't bother us at all, on the contrary we believe that at least partially it was sought precisely as a function of a choice of the artistic direction. Bearing in mind the version of the first Ni no Kuni for PlayStation 3 and Ni no Kuni: The Menace of the White Witch Remastered for PlayStation 4, the differences are considerable, and this is good for a re-proposition that ultimately had to deal only with this: to restore without modifying. Within the limits of the possibilities of the current generation of course and without distorting the basic product. Plot After having dedicated the right space to the technical issues of what on balance should be considered first and foremost a remastered edition, let's also recover for a moment the plot of Ni no Kuni: The Menace of the Cinerea Witch Remastered. Someone, probably the youngest, could almost by mistake notice the little boy protagonist and his funny companion on the cover, and wonder where this game so similar to the animated films of Studio Ghibli comes from. Ni no Kuni: The Menace of the Cinerea Witch Remastered, as the starting title at the time, was born right there: from a collaboration between Level-5 (the guys from Professor Layton, Inazuma Eleven and Yo-kai Watch) and the studio of Japanese animation probably the most famous in the world. The narrative begins in a very similar way to what has been seen in many Studio Ghibli films: there is an eserene and peaceful existence in a small community that is soon shocked by a terrible event, not so much in proportion to the vastness of the outside world as to the depth of the protagonists and their psyche. In detail, little Oliver's mother dies and the latter begins a journey in a parallel world, the Ni no Kuni, in an attempt to bring her back to life. And since he is there, he will also lend a hand to the local population and his new friend Lucciconio, in defeating the terrible enemy of darkness. Nothing too original, but the linearity of this narrative thread actually hides an incredible care for the characterization of the protagonists and secondary characters, as well as an equally profound, original and unforgettable context. Once you finish the story of Ni no Kuni: The Threat of the Ashen Witch Remastered you will really feel a void in your heart; first, however, you will spend 50 to 60 hours, if you also take a look at the side quests from time to time. Playstation 4 trophies Ni no Kuni: Menace of the Ash Witch Remastered returns to PlayStation 4 with a new list of trophies to unlock. New in the sense that you can get them all back from the beginning, but in reality the tasks are in line with what we saw years ago on PlayStation 3. The Platinum Trophy will require you to strip the flesh of Level-5's adventure well, seeing all this that offers and obtaining all the spells of all the protagonists, as well as a considerable number of secondary collectibles. Gameplay We recall at least the main game mechanics of Ni no Kuni: The Threat of the Cinerea Witch Remastered, even if you can always withdraw the review of the original Ni no Kuni, since nothing has been changed in terms of content. On 20 September 2019 you will recover one of the freshest jRPGs of recent years, that is a purely Japanese role-playing game, where the exploration of rather vast environments (articulated between the main world map and the various specific dungeons) alternates with fights in time real against tons of enemy creatures. The game world of Ni no Kuni is in fact populated by a remarkable and incredibly varied fauna, even if not always with a brilliant design: in any case, the player controls a main party divided between the protagonist and any allies (the familiars, little monsters born from his pure heart), and leveraging now one now on the other, he routs the enemy hordes. Strategy is everything in Ni no Kuni: The Threat of the Ashy Witch Remastered, because you have to dose the constant exchanges between Oliver and the Familiars well, as well as keep in mind the weaknesses and resistances of familiars and opponents, and you still have many spells, attacks physiques, and the ability to defend against relentless attacks. When you manage to strike with the right timing, bonuses are also unlocked, capable of turning the tide of the fights. All the characters level up and are upgraded, the pets evolve by changing their appearance (a bit like Pokmon), and from the very rich game menu you can also study the curiosities of the world, the characters, the heroes and the individual spells.
