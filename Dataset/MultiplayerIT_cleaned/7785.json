In this case 7 Grand Steps could be an interesting option given the absolutely atypical structure of the Mousechief game which is inspired by the mechanical coin ops of the turn of the century. In fact, the title mixes board game mechanics and typical peculiarities of the videogame medium, creating a strategic game that is difficult to contextualize and therefore surprising. The aim of the game is simple and to create a dynasty, a memorable family history that passes through prosperity, divine blessings, abundant harvests, technological inventions and love stories. The field on which this intergenerational challenge takes place is a fraction of a round board, divided into wedges, which rotates, by one wedge per turn, in the direction of a group of hungry crocodiles. Risking his neck in the first person is the protagonist, the father of the family, who while fighting for survival must find a wife and, if luck assists him, father children. On the other hand, the head of the family gets old, and is sensitive to crocodile bites, and for this reason he absolutely needs heirs without whom the game is inexorably destined to end. Strategic coin-op The gameplay of 7 Grand Steps passes through the production and use of a series of coins, in a meta reinterpretation of the old mechanical coin-ops. Tokens that have a different effect depending on the slot in which they are inserted and marked by an image that identifies them. When a coin is spent on a pawn, i.e. the head of the household or his wife, it goes to the nearest square that bears the same icon engraved on the token. When, on the other hand, the coin ends up in a child's slot, it guarantees the child a permanent bonus in a specific sector and can also prevent succession disputes by avoiding the emergence of unhealthy situations for a family that pursues success. In short, the whole title is based on the balanced use of the aforementioned coins, with the movements of the pawns that also allow you to collect a series of special tokens, the accumulation of which guarantees important advances. But these are also coveted by our computer-controlled neighbors, and making a move can be more beneficial than granting a bonus to a child or generating coins. The creation of these, in fact, consumes the round of a piece that cannot interact with the partner or with the neighbors controlled by the computer, if the latter has already used its turn. For this reason, sometimes it is necessary to make one's wife interact with a neighbor and since the type of interaction is not specified, the temptation arises to interact with the wife of the damned neighbor, just to balance things out. Once all the possible actions have been completed, which are not many, all that remains is to press the large button which, as we have anticipated, rotates the central part of the board by one square, bringing the pawns closer to the crocodiles. Keeping away from the threat, given the possibility of choosing where to move, seems easy, but when the objectives are not achieved, or there is no offspring ready to take over the role of head of the family, the available space shrinks. A real wall reduces the number of checkers available by squeezing us into a few squares with the neighbours, who prevent us from moving. And here the ravenous animals become more menacing than they were on a hot summer morning, when your wife was not a pain in the ass but a young and charming damsel, a symbol of a bright future. The arcade side of human evolution The parents, as we said, are the pawns that actively move on the board when a coin is used, while the children are present exclusively as icons, in the upper part of the screen, waiting for their turn to start a family, manage a kingdom and advance in evolution. But not everything goes smoothly and some moments, such as a child's transition to maturity or the entry into a new era, can have unexpected results, in full board game style. An approach that shapes the outcome of a game and its narrative implications, resulting in sudden fortunes and misfortunes, in a succession of triumphs and thuds typical of the narrative linked to the great dynasties. An important element of 7 Grand Steps which, although modestly made, wants to involve us in a race through the evolution of humanity and for this reason subjects us, perhaps too mercilessly, to the whims of fate. It all starts ina biblical era made up of myth, misfortunes, sudden fortunes and omens that transform themselves, from era to era, into ever more demanding administrative tasks. Sometimes these activities are solved with mini-games while in other cases we are called to draw up annual plans and invasions through a complex interface, almost like a grand strategy. Surprises with an unexpected depth and capable of reinforcing a formula which, although technically dry, is undoubtedly engaging and complex, also thanks to a series of choices granted to the player. These, excluding the administrative tasks and returning to the family affairs that form the pivot of the experience, are mostly limited to the objectives and love relationships but a large part of the title is structured precisely around these two elements as, on the other hand, the it is almost the entire history of man. In short, simple and complex at the same time, but even if the peculiarity of the formula makes it difficult to formulate an unambiguous judgment, it is quite easy to understand if 7 Grand Steps is for us. The graphics are already a remarkable watershed, with characters turned into rigid pawns and barely animated icons. The most vital elements are the legendary tokens, which leap on the squares of the board, and the narration is exclusively textual like the management elements in the grand strategy style. In short, not for everyone, which is already evident from the gameplay which has as its pivot the calculations related to the movement of the checkers. Of course, the movement becomes more and more complex as new rows of squares become accessible but, however long a game may last, large armies made up of millions of polygons will never appear to animate the screen. And as a further peculiarity we also find the choice to combine the particular strategic formula with an arcade setting, also presumably inspired by the mechanical coin-ops we talked about at the beginning of the article. Games can last hours or minutes and only one autosave is allowed which cannot be resumed once a loss is recorded. A setting that further enhances the role of luck with all the pros and cons, such as the potential frustration, of the case. 7 Grand Steps takes us, turn after turn, through 7,000 years of history", "date": "2013-06-18", "grade": "8.0"}
