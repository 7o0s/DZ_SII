{"name": "Master of Alchemy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/79801-master-of-alchemy-tutto-si-trasforma.html", "text": "Practiced in ancient times in various parts of the world, alchemy is a sort of cross between science and magic, and boasts many points of contact with the procedures that characterize modern inorganic chemistry. Among its basic elements there is undoubtedly the search for a method to transform any material into gold, but more generally the changes of matter in the round are studied, mixing this research with some philosophical ideas. And it is precisely the transformation of matter, in this case the passage between its three stages (solid, liquid and gaseous), at the center of the gameplay of Master of Alchemy, a ~physical~ puzzle game created by the Italians DarkWave Games for Chillingo which has already won over iPad owners and garnered widespread acclaim from international critics. The conversion of the game for iPhone and iPod Touch has therefore become an obligatory step, and the developers have done everything possible to keep the structure and the particular feeling intact. Gargamel knows best The sixty stages that make up the game, interspersed with textual sequences that unravel a plot of a certain thickness, are based, as already mentioned, on the concept of transformation of matter. Each scenario presents ~pipes~ from which liquids of three possible colors (yellow, red, blue) come out: our task is to place devices that collect this material and change its state from liquid to gaseous or solid, to depending on which direction we want it to move. There is in fact a sort of path to follow from time to time (the signs with arrows testify to this) to bring the material of the color that interests us towards its final container. At that point each part of our collected element will move the counter which determines whether or not the achievement of the ~minimum requirements~ necessary to complete the stage. For example, you may have to arrange to transport fifteen parts of the yellow matter in the appropriate container, with the path starting from a dripping pipe located in the upper left part of the screen. In this context, it is first necessary to place a device for the transformation from liquid to gaseous under the pipe, then follow the path of the gas (which clearly rises) up to the upper limit of the scenario, where a second device can transform matter into solid. At this point our ~cubes~ will follow the force of gravity, going to settle in the container placed under them. The procedure just described is regulated by a series of factors: firstly, the complexity of the path increases as we complete the levels, pushing us through trial and error to find the most suitable solution to our problem; secondly, the ~merit~ system which determines the unlocking of the next stage, which is based on the stars (gold, silver or bronze) obtained through the speed of our performance. So not only do we have to understand how to move, but we also have to do it quickly. This element of the gameplay certainly manages to increase involvement and give the player a constant sense of urgency, but at the same time it ends up colliding with a control system that does not always bend to our needs. Master of Alchemy was born on the iPad and in this context the player is given ample room for manoeuvre, with the scenario displayed in its entirety and on which we can act starting from an overview. On the iPhone and iPod Touch, inevitably, the stage must be constantly zoomed and scrolled, forcing us to always do a few ~test rides~ before being able to complete the level with the score we deserve. Furthermore, the management of the devices necessary for the transformation of matter appears a bit imprecise, also becoming very cumbersome when we have to place two of them at a short distance: in this situation, the system struggles to understand which object we would like to manage. The technical sector of the DarkWave Games product moves between ups and downs, but generally appears to be of a good level: the choice of colors, the splendid images of the ~characters~ between one level and another, the design of the scenarios are really spot on and contribute to the creation of a particular atmosphere, underlined by music with an almost medieval flavour. The matter regarding the visual representation of the material in its three stages is different, a bit too simplistic. Finally, the physical context, essential for the gameplay of MoA, proves to be convincing from the early stages.
