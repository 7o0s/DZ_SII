{"name": "The Alliance Alive HD Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-alliance-alive-hd-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "Released unceremoniously in late 2017, when Nintendo 3DS was nearing its end, The Alliance Alive went unnoticed not only because nobody advertised it, but also because it served as a spiritual sequel to the mediocre The Legend of Legacy, also developed by it from Cattle Call, Furyu and Grezzo. Despite the same combined authorship, The Alliance Alive was a much better title that would have deserved the attention of fans, instead of being swallowed up in a black hole. It is clear that someone really believed in it, however, because we were pleasantly surprised by the announcement of this remastered version ... which comes out in an unfortunate period, barricaded by triple A titles on every platform. In the next lines of this review we will explain why you might want to recover this little gem even further when, after the storm, you are looking for a good old school JRPG. The master's touch The name Yoshitaka Murayama probably won't say anything to many readers, but JRPG lovers with a few years too many behind them should recognize it: Murayama has in fact signed the scripts of the first three Suikoden, as well as some other minor projects. Anyone who chews bread and JRPGs, at this point, should be even vaguely interested in what Murayama has to say with The Alliance Alive, a title that in several respects recalls the fantasy atmospheres of the Konami series. In the world of The Alliance Alive, humanity has been subjugated by Daemons, otherworldly creatures who have descended upon us, divided the world with magic, and darkened the sky. Over time, small hotbeds of rioters have ignited here and there who would like to restore the natural order, and we will spend the first few hours of the game getting to know these rebels better. The very long prologue, in fact, is told to us from different points of view and defines the protagonists who, after starting the adventure separately, will meet and join forces against a common enemy. Ironically, the cast includes just a few Daemons and other humanoid creatures that give this band of heroes a motley and colorful flavor. After the first few hours, the plot takes on a more linear approach, even though it winds through a series of twists and turns that do not spare some dramatic moments, as well as the classic skits that soften the tones and recall Japanese anime. The cast is interesting and the relationships that are established between the various characters hold the player's attention, although not all the protagonists have been characterized with the same skill. Some, like Galil and Azura, are well written and convincing, while others, like Ignace, seemed a little too stereotypical: in general, this discrepancy doesn't disturb too much because each of them has something to say in the story, even if they end up on the sidelines in the final stages, when the script focuses on the most important protagonists. In a case like this, it would probably have been better to dub the dialogue to give each character a bit more characterization. In the transition from Nintendo 3DS, in fact, The Alliance Alive HD Remastered has not been dubbed. It is the weak point of a modest sound sector that boasts the excellent music of Masashi Hamauzu but underlines the tight budget not only of the original edition released a couple of years ago, but also of this conversion. The attention of the small Japanese developer has been devoted entirely to the aspect of the game which, to be honest, has gained a lot: the polygonal models have been practically rebuilt and, enhanced by a good anti-aliasing and a convincing cel shading, they wander around maps that combine the soft pastel color of hand-drawn details with an all-new resolution. The artistic direction has favored a super deformed, vaguely ~chibi~ style, which in the remastering process has gained in detail, color and cleanliness. In this regard, it must be emphasized that Cattle Call has completely redesigned the interface which, in the Nintendo 3DS version, was divided between the two screens of the handheld: the new one is not invasive at all and appeared streamlined and sufficiently informative. Playstation 4 trophies The Alliance Alive HD Remastered total 35 trophies include 5 gold trophies, 11 silver trophies and 18 bronze trophies. Most are obtained by progressing through the story, and therefore by recruiting the various characters and defeating each boss, while for the others you have to work a little harder and discover each secret. Custom fights The Alliance Alive HD Remastered follows an all in all traditional structure that sees us moveArc from city to city across the wide open spaces of a scale world or explore dungeons, catacombs and treacherous castles. The developers of Cattle Call wanted to fill the dungeons with ingenious environmental puzzles that require a certain amount of attention and sometimes even a pinch of patience. As we wander around the map and collect clues or key objects, we obviously have to deal with the monsters that appear on the screen in the form of black shadows. The size and shape of these shadows suggest the power of the enemy we are going to face: most of these opponents will not give us a particularly hard time, while others could represent a surprising challenge for less prepared players and force them to ~grind~ a bit of fighting, an activity fortunately facilitated by the possibility of speeding up the animations during the fight by up to two or four times. The combat system of The Alliance Alive HD Remastered is only traditional in appearance. We can deploy up to five characters, choosing between different formations that will define the roles of each of them. It will therefore be important to evaluate who to deploy in the front row, because they attract the enemy's attention, and who instead to keep in the rear so that they can help the party undisturbed. The point is, we decide how to specialize our heroes. Each character can wield any type of weapon and the learning of the arts is almost completely random: each successful attack has a chance to unlock a new art and the stronger the enemies, the more this possibility increases. In this way we can specialize each character and try different strategies, however we must also consider the talents, passive bonuses that must be purchased by spending the points earned at the end of the fight. In short, the roles of the individual characters are defined by the combinations of equipped weapons, learned arts and unlocked talents. This ensures a remarkable level of customization; on the other hand, some characters are more skilled than others in the use of certain weapons or spells, not to mention that it is necessary to ~farm~ points and monsters to acquire all the skills that interest us. In fact, the game has this bad habit of giving points with a dropper, forcing us to plan the progression of the individual characters from the very first hours in order not to waste them or not to have to farm too much. These mechanics, as well as the final attacks that temporarily destroy the weapons and which therefore must be launched sparingly, are learned organically during the first hours of the game, but in reality none of them, however original, has the opportunity to really stand out , except when you fight the optional bosses and mini-bosses and the difficulty rises significantly. In these cases ~grinding~ is of little use for the simple fact that there are no experience levels and the statistics grow more or less randomly at the end of each fight: strategy and preparation are fundamental, but little is felt in the rest of the game. adventure, given that most of the common enemies, who all look a bit alike despite the fact that the various regions are extremely different from each other, tend to succumb within a few turns. Despite this, The Alliance Alive HD Remastered is a title that can give many satisfactions to lovers of the genre, especially when you defeat a particularly insidious boss with an ad hoc structured party or simply enjoy the possibility of exploring the world on board some wacky steampunk vehicle that reminded us of the JRPGs of the 90s and the freedom they gave us when we weren't yet prisoners of the open world concept. The title Cattle Call owes much to the Japanese role-playing games of that era but does not let itself be carried away by nostalgia and, on the contrary, tries a different approach than usual, surprising the player with particularly ingenious mechanics which, perhaps, would have needed some small balancing here and there to express yourself at your best.", "date": "2019-10-17", "grade": "7.8"}
