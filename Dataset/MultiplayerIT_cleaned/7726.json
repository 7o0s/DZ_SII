We are obviously talking about a cheap title sold for 800 microsoft points, about ten euros on other channels, and not a shelf blockbuster. So we'll take everything with a grain of salt and with the right yardstick. It's not easy to make a title of this kind with a super cheap budget and it's not difficult that somewhere there could be a flaw, even a big one. Unless you create a graphically more contained title, with less pretensions, and perhaps of a non-inflated genre. Quite the opposite of what Scourge: Outbreakm does, given that there are now hundreds of space shooters, including many excellent titles, and the setting (both visual and general design) is that of a triple A title. Too bad that the available funds have made it possible to create only a very faded copy of a title of that genre, seasoned with technical problems, graphic glitches, a general flattening of weapons and many gameplay problems that make it a truly mediocre title. The stride longer than the leg The Spanish software house Tragnarion Studios, based in the beautiful and sunny Palma de Mallorca, has pulled out of the hat a title that is absolutely out of its league: accustomed to games for iOS and Nintendo DS, the limited budgets available have allowed the creation of a game for PC, PS3 and X360 in digital delivery, even if the game structure is exactly that of a large production. Scourge: Outbreak is a complete title, albeit a mediocre one. There is a single player with a story to follow, full of all kinds of macho and futurist cliches. There's also multiplayer, and co-op which is always in fashion among shooters. Scourge: Outbreak therefore aimed high, even with limited means. In a title costing around 10 euros, however, we don't expect who knows what, but only to find at least one fun and satisfying gameplay and that's not really a matter of budget but above all of ideas and skill in realizing them. First of all, ideas immediately seem to be in short supply, starting from the main ~theme~, the much abused trend of the space marines, which makes one's mouth turn up a bit at the end of the generation since we've really seen all sorts of things. It would take something fresh, while remaining in the sci fi theme, but all they can think of in the development team is to create a shooter along the lines of Gears of War (easy!), with clear references to other blockbusters such as Crysis or Army of Two. The end result is quite tragicomic, because full of limitations and technical problems that undermine the much sought after and coveted ~gameplay~ which is the heart of the game, the one that gives fun and passion. After a long presentation and a superfluous tutorial we begin the adventure with one of four selectable characters, each with different (however irrelevant) skills and weapons. We obviously choose the biggest and baddest, full of tattoos and foul language as it should be in this game mouse. The super-assisted aim (we will call this nice feature like this) is certainly not a good start, but even the artificial intelligence immediately appears quite limited and limiting, given that the enemies often and willingly ~throw themselves~ into our arms regardless of the danger , or they do not notice our close passage by continuing to cover themselves two meters from us. Scorges: Outbreak arrives digitally loaded with good hopes and little else Xbox 360 goals Scourge: Outbreak is giving away 400 points to be unlocked through just 12 objectives. Eight of them relate to the story, and it will be enough to complete it 100% (about 4-5 hours of gameplay) to get them all. The others are obtained by playing multiplayer, but they are quite simple: making full loot is a matter of little. Matter of feeling Anyone who has been chewing video games for some time cannot fail to experience that strange feeling, playing Scourge: Outbreak, which makes the title seem already old even before having put their hands on the pad. The game draws here and there from all the most famous shooters of recent years, but above all from Gears of War of which it follows the aiming system, the covers, the running and the rolling, even some design choices. It also shares the graphics engine with the Epic masterpiece, that Unreal Engine (the third) of wonders, which however in this case is not so wonderful. The textures are in low definition, the edges ofpolygons crammed with jagged lines, the animations few and poorly constructed. The physics of contacts is also bad: often the corpses of the enemies remain suspended in mid-air, or in very strange positions that offer moments of hilarity. The weapons are badly balanced and even their use sometimes creates some problems: for example, using the machine gun you have the classic ~kickback~ effect that raises the aim, but once you reach its maximum peak there is no animation that it snaps it back to the neutral position and a pretty bad-to-see downward ~click~ ensues. Even the game view is slightly wrong, given that the controlled character is too close to the camera, with the consequence that as we approach walls or covers, they sometimes disappear from the screen because the camera gets too close. We find ourselves for a few moments displaced and disoriented until the character reappears before our eyes. Despite all the graphic, technical and creative glitches, the commitment and ardor is still appreciable (because it is clear that whoever made this little game is a fan of ~big~ games) Scourge: Outbreak has all the cards in its deck , including multiplayer and co-op. The latter is the mode that obviously gives the best moments, precisely and also by virtue of the ~ugliness~ of some game situations it will not be uncommon to have a laugh with friends for a cheerful afternoon. The game doesn't take long, around five hours to complete the main story, but we doubt you'll dive into the multiplayer afterwards. If there aren't enough friends to join the game, the game's AI proposes to join us to get to four players anyway: this too is appreciable, apart from the fact that, as previously mentioned, the intelligence of the game is not very developed. Positive notes: some nice effects every now and then (the sun filtering through the trees with its rays) and a sound accompaniment definitely above the graphic one. Scourge: Outbreak is a penniless title that promises nothing, and in fact has little in return. Definitely a must try before you buy, even for super fans of the shooter genre.", "date": "2013-07-14", "grade": "4.5"}
