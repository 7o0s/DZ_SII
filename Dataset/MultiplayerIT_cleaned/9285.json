However, preemptively branding this particular ~submarine simulator~ as a disappointment could prove to be a big mistake. The reason is obvious: we are faced with a product that is very different from what we imagined, which completely bases its gameplay on the inertial context within which we have to move to lead our submarine to its destination. From the start screen we can access three different modes: ~Speed~, which contains the actual game between standard missions and timed challenges; ~Precision~, a minigame that we can face in three different scenarios and which calls into question the gyroscope integrated into the Nintendo console; ~Strategy~, playable alone or with a friend in Download mode, a sort of advanced ~sea battle~ that can be quite entertaining. In the first mode we can decide to face the missions or timed challenges aboard three different submarines, which represent the easy, medium and difficult level of difficulty due to their specific characteristics. The easiest-to-control submarine, for example, does not require tilt adjustment as it can fire one torpedo up and one torpedo in front, and simultaneously responds more quickly to horizontal and vertical advance stresses. The ~medium~ submarine, on the other hand, constitutes a balanced middle ground: it can only fire its torpedoes head-on and therefore requires tilt adjustment when it comes to hitting targets that are above or below our position, while from point of view of the movement it proves to be fairly simple to control. Finally, the ~advanced~ submarine is the one capable of firing the largest number of torpedoes at the same time, but requires an additional effort due to the inclination of the hull (to be operated by acting on a rotating rudder) and at the same time greater attention to manage its displacement . We all live in a yellow submarine... So how does Steel Diver's control system and interface work? In the upper screen of the 3DS we see the unfolding of the action, with the submarine and the scenario within which it moves to reach its goal from time to time. On the touch screen, on the other hand, there are a large number of commands and indicators: in the upper part there is a radar that can alternate between two views (close up or from a distance) and shows us what are the rocky obstacles along the underwater path that we must follow. In the lower part we have an indicator of the available air placed on the left, then the ~masker~ button to make it come out and mislead the enemy torpedoes (which will take different directions instead of hitting us), and in the center of the screen a ~rudder~ which rotated to the right or left allows us to tilt the submarine accordingly. Further to the right are the buttons for firing the torpedoes, while the two analog controls that regulate the horizontal and vertical speeds complete the picture, i.e. they allow us to operate the engines in order to advance or retreat, ascend or descend according to our needs. Controlling both ~levers~ at the same time is impossible, so you have to alternate quickly between one and the other, also taking into account the inertia which substantially influences our movements underwater. The final result, as you can imagine, is an extremely complex and multifaceted control system, like a pure simulator, which must be mastered with lucidity and patience and which therefore represents a considerable obstacle for those who cannot bear the slow and reasoned action of this kind of products. The 3D effect Steel Diver is not the ideal example to show friends the three-dimensional capabilities of the new Nintendo portable console, and in fact implements the 3D effect in the simplest and least invasive way possible, adding depth to some elements of the scenario (refractions of the water, volcanic rocks, etc.) but overall it can be largely deactivated. Hunt for Red October As mentioned above, the ~Speed~ mode includes seven standard missions, in which our goal is to reach the ~finish line~ by avoiding traps and eliminating enemies, and eight timed challenges which instead simply focus on how quickly we can to finish each path. At the end of the missions, the minigame starts which can also be accessed from the ~Precision~ mode, and which looks like a simple shooter iIn first person view with our submarine sitting in the middle of the water and a series of enemy ships moving all around, which we must locate and sink quickly. We can control the movements of the viewfinder using the touch screen, but it's much simpler and more intuitive to use the gyroscope, so move the 3DS like in augmented reality games and open fire by carefully calculating the distances and speed of the torpedoes. Fun but very limited, like the ~advanced naval battle~ offered by the ~Strategy~ mode. The technical realization of the game is fundamentally functional to the action both in terms of graphics and sound: both combine to create the best environment for our missions, but without overdoing it. The scenario flows smoothly and without uncertainties, but given the low polygonal count it would have been more difficult than anything else to be able to snap it.", "date": "2011-05-12", "grade": "7.1"}
