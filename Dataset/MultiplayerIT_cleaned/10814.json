{"name": "High Speed 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/high-speed-3d.html", "text": "In the last year, mobile gaming has made great strides, and while remaining within the Java platform, the various development teams have challenged each other with extraordinary titles, adopting innovative and spectacular technical solutions. The racing game genre, in particular, has undergone an incredible evolution, covering in a matter of months a path that on other systems took years to complete. So now on mobile we can admire racers equipped with rather complex and fluid polygonal graphics, with discrete textures and ever greater attention to the controls and management of the car. High Speed 3D, with all its features, represents the sum of the results achieved so far: we can take a picture of ourselves and associate it with our profile, while the graphics boast adjustments through which it is possible to increase or decrease the details to meet to the characteristics of our terminal. Finally, from the pause menu you can not only rotate the screen to get the classic 4:3 aspect ratio, but also adapt the controls accordingly. The game offers us two modes: the inevitable fast run and career, with the latter being the core of the new HeroCraft title. Selected a car among those available (we can customize it by changing the color at will), we will be able to face the numerous races belonging to two different categories, to be unlocked one at a time. Right from the start we realize the solidity of the gameplay and the accuracy of the controls, which thanks to the automatic acceleration function (activated by default, but can be deactivated if desired) allow us to concentrate on setting the trajectories and managing the any drifts. The races take place within urban tracks and the traffic component is very strong, so we will always have to be careful of the cars traveling in the opposite lane as well as those that we will inevitably have to overtake to go and get our direct opponents. At the top of the screen you can see the turbo bar, which can be activated using key 5: the car is ~shot~ forward at very high speed, through a maneuver that serves to recover ground but must be exploited with great wisdom, because otherwise winning becomes almost impossible. Let's also say that this is the biggest limitation of High Speed 3D: the opponents are too fast and even at the lowest difficulty level it becomes a real challenge to beat them, because it's not enough to avoid accidents... you almost have to perform miracles. When you start winning, all the mechanisms that are usually part of the ~career mode~ of racing games are activated, again with particular attention to detail. High Speed 3D graphics are fully polygonal and, as anticipated, can be adjusted to work best on different devices. In its best setting it boasts excellent fluidity, rather convincing scenarios and a good level of detail. Traffic management, in particular, appears quite convincing, with collisions undoubtedly of an ~arcade~ nature but well thought out. The icing on the cake is represented by a lighting system that colors objects according to the position of the sun, with only discreet results but of an almost science-fiction value for what mobile gaming has been up to now. Probably Need for Speed Undercover still remains a step higher, but the fight is very close and the HeroCraft product certainly has no rivals in terms of customization possibilities.
