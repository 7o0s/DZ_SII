{"name": "Metal Slug Mobile 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-mobile-4_a.html", "text": "The story of Metal Slug is known to everyone: after having produced various fighting games in matches, SNK has seen fit to dedicate itself to the creation of a classic action game, with a war background but with numerous humorous elements. Thus was born the first episode of the series, which met with great success in theaters and brought a breath of fresh air to the genre: the protagonist (characterised by an Italian name, moreover) could eliminate enemies by firing the weapon equipped or by throwing grenades, but also piloting an armored vehicle (the Metal Slug, in fact) equipped with its own energy bar. A collection has recently been released for Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP, Metal Slug Anthology, which brings together the first seven chapters of the series. As far as mobile gaming is concerned, Metal Slug has not enjoyed a classic conversion, but has been redesigned to better adapt to the characteristics of Java-compatible devices, with particular attention to gameplay. Metal Slug Mobile 4 represents a bit of the ~summa~ of all the good things that have been done to bring the SNK action game to mobile phones, also and above all from a technical point of view. The game has little to do with the fourth episode of the original series, and allows us to control a character chosen between Leona and Roberto, as usual without substantial differences between the two. The control system sees the use of the d-pad for movement and jumping, while the 5 key is used to use the primary weapon and the 0 key to throw grenades. The management of the diagonal and vertical shot has been managed in a particular way: you have to press the 1 and 3 keys respectively to shoot diagonally to the left or to the right, while holding down one of the two keys the character shoots up, above himself. You can try your hand at a ~quick game~ or start from the first of the four missions available, each divided into three stages plus a boss fight. There is the possibility to continue the game indefinitely and pick up the ~story~ where we last left off, so completing all the levels will only be a matter of time. Once in the middle of the action, we realize a first big difference compared to the original Metal Slug: our character has an energy bar, so he doesn't lose a life as soon as he is hit by enemies. This is a solution that certainly makes the experience less frustrating, but which together with a downward-adjusted difficulty balance can only decrease the overall longevity of the game. Technically, this new episode of the series in its mobile incarnation is really top-notch, and perhaps even expects too much from the current mid-range mobiles. Both the protagonists and the enemies enjoy excellent animations, the stages are always very populated and this often translates into heavy slowdowns, especially during explosions (very well rendered). The realization of the locations is excellent for variety and detail, as is the excellent use of colours. The four bosses we will have to face are not original creations, since they refer to the arcade episodes, but they still make their own figure. The sound is extraordinary for its quality, since it combines sampled music and effects in a mix that is rare to see on mobile phones: a pity that activating it sometimes results in an all too drastic slowdown of the action. PRO Animations of great quality and quantity Playable and addictive like any Metal Slug A good number of internships AGAINST Frequent slowdowns The sound turns out to be ~heavy~ for some terminals A little easy", "date": "2009-01-26", "grade": "S.V."}
