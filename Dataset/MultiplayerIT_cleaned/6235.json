And with Her Story we found ourselves right in the face of this impasse: one of those videogame projects where the gameplay component is practically overshadowed in favor of a more or less clumsy attempt, to involve the player in the story perhaps by sending a load emotional that is difficult to experience in other situations. It happened in the past with David Cage's titles and over time most of Telltale Games' episodic video games have followed this direction with fluctuating results. However, Her Story tries to go even further by offering a non-linear narrative cue that puts the player in the role of a cold observer, practically unable to carry out any action and forced to suffer almost passively what the screen and the speakers transmit to him. The result, however interesting, full of potential and with an artistic load that has very few comparisons in the videogame field, however, did not fully convince us. But let's proceed in order. Her Story is a non-linear tale that will keep you engaged despite the basic gameplay It's not a search engine Just trying to define what Her Story is, concretely, puts us in front of quite a few difficulties. It is a sort of investigative-themed graphic adventure where the player takes on the role of a character whose identity will remain shrouded in mystery until the epilogue. The peculiarity of the title is that all the ~action~ takes place in front of an old CRT TV from the mid-90s perfectly recreated by the developer through the game interface complete with reflections of the environment and curvature of the angle of visual. In fact, the entire gameplay sees us interacting with the computer connected to this monitor thanks to which we will be able to limit ourselves to searching and observing 271 different clips of an interrogation operated by the police over about three weeks against a woman, Hannah, who represents the only visible character in the entire video game. In this juncture of time we will witness the evolution of a story that begins as a banal report of the disappearance of a person, the husband of the protagonist, and which soon takes the form of a particularly elaborate and convoluted murder that we will have to try to analyze and understand. But let's not say anything else because the entire video game system of Her Story focuses precisely on the story and even the smallest description of the plot can turn into a spoiler ruining the whole experience in an instant since, basically, the game almost does not c 'And. What makes the gameplay of this product particular is in fact its extreme simplicity that travels on the thin border of banality. As written above, in fact, our avatar can simply interact with the terminal using the mouse and keyboard (or touch if you play the iOS version, as in our case). All we will be allowed to do is write words in the computer's search engine and see the clips that match the search keywords used. We will be able to search for real phrases using quotation marks or put together several words to narrow the number of results. Every single clip of the interrogation is in fact fully subtitled and all the words spoken by Hannah are indexed. So where is the difficulty? Simply, the database will always and only return the first five clips that match our search and this will force us to go ahead by logic, intuition, brute attempts and strokes of luck to be able, little by little, to watch ever new clips to try to reconstruct what really happened. Her Story soon turns into an absolutely non-linear little puzzle (the order of discovery of the films is in fact totally dependent on the order of searches made by the player) which will put your patience and your ingenuity to the test, perhaps forcing you to put it aside when you're frustrated but always ready to come back to it to try that term that just popped into your head. There's a little trick that will allow us to keep an eye on how many clips we've discovered and how many are missing, a ~database checker~ that we'll be able to run from our terminal along with a handful of other silly applications that serve as artistic tinsel. Basically Her Story is all here. When we have viewed about two thirds of all the clips, through a small narrative trick we will be able to choose to watch the short epilogue sequence and, once this is over, we will be able to return to the terminal in an attempt to unlock all the clipsremained unexplored by exploiting a couple of aids that will be unlocked. A sinking heart If that weren't clear enough yet, all the beauty of Her Story is based precisely on its ability to involve the player with a retro taste that reminded us so much of the old experiments of the 90s that had tried with little luck to demonstrate ~the incredible~ potential of the CD-ROM. Let's talk about the various Phantasmagoria, The 7th Guest, Gabriel Knight 2 and beautiful company. The curriculum of Sam Barlow, the designer behind this project, is pretty heavy, and this is noticeable as soon as you start the game. In fact, among others, we owe him the last two Silent Hills considered above expectations, Origins and Shattered Memories, and his attention to detail is clearly evident in the game. Her Story has aesthetic connotations that are different from the usual and that attention to detail typical of the indie experiments of the last few years, and all those fake low resolution movies that try to simulate the quality of the VHS and that have the talented and charming Viva Seifert as protagonist, they certainly catapulted us in an instant into the atmosphere of twenty years ago. And to recreate the precise feeling of that era there are also the splendid sound effects made of mouse clicks and keyboard keystroke noises recreated in a manic way and perfectly synchronized with our actions, accompanied by the subtle but constant buzzing of the terminal which in a moment it will become an integral part of your ambient noise and you will only realize its existence when you turn off the game. Even the music is pleasant, however minimal and reduced in quantitative terms and everything seems to fit perfectly into the framework designed by Her Story to the point of being easy to consider it a small jewel from an artistic point of view. However, there is a huge warning that we are obliged to make in this review: the game is entirely in English, including subtitles and, although it is easy to understand, it is obvious that if you do not master the Albion language properly, the product loses immediately all its appeal given that the gameplay certainly takes a back seat. Too bad for the missed opportunity since in the end the dialogues, while representing the backbone of the entire experience, are not that full-bodied and could have been translated with a certain agility. But for the moment it is an element that you absolutely must take into consideration.", "date": "2015-07-01", "grade": "8.0"}
