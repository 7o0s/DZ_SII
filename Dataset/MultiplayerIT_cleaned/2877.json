For heaven's sake, they're great and exalt us, but when it comes to playing COD, Gears of War or any other product in this range, we know that behind the next level there will be a daring vehicle escape waiting for us, the inevitable phase with the fixed turret or the twist where the protagonist is overwhelmed by the usual explosion capable of sending yet another alien base / fortification / bunker of the Second World War upside down. These declinations are part of an often abused clich and in an attempt to imitate the older brothers even in indie or low-end productions the same situations begin to arise more and more frequently. Here then when we are surprised the heart can only beat with joy, taken as we are to enjoy what we play and not just for the bombastic images of an immobile narrative iterated for the hundredth time. A few years ago similar sensations occurred to us with the amazing Devil Daggers and today we can once again immerse ourselves in a title with a reduced cost, we are talking about about 15 euros, capable however of entertaining us for dozens and dozens of hours. Ready to open your wallet? We explain why you should in the BPM: Bullets Per Minute review. A rhythm game with a retro flavour If Doom and Crypt of the Necrodancer had a child, it would be called BPM: Bullets Per Minute. This is the easiest and most precise way to tell you in two lines the essence of the new shooter from Awe Interactive, an independent development studio determined to self-publish on Steam and ready to bring their work to consoles in the future. The setting is rather strange and fascinating, a sort of Nordic pantheon where, by controlling the valkyries, we will have to explore procedural dungeons by slaughtering everything in front of us. Surviving will not be easy at all since already on easy difficulty, the starting point, it will not be easy to reach the second level, at least in the first round. The gameplay of BPM asks the player to keep time while shooting, while jumping and even while trying to dodge shots through the dash with the ultimate goal of increasing the score multiplier and setting a new personal best. You lack timing and in addition to losing points you will be inhibited from pulling the trigger, with a sharp noise that will prevent the hammer of your gun from firing, often leading you to suffer unexpected wounds. Four hits are enough to knock you out of the game and with game over you will also say goodbye to all the progress obtained up to that moment. Like any good self-respecting roguelike, in fact, the ultimate goal of the game is to get to the final boss and kill him using only one life, but there are several options that will make your journey easier. The most important thing to know is that the kills will often reward you with gold coins which you can then go and use to buy upgrades of various kinds or recover some energy. The generation of these objects is random as usual and therefore luck will also count a lot to have facilitated runs. In addition to the objects, you can then spend your treasure to enhance passive statistics, such as damage and movement speed, enhance the range of shots or perfect the use of special skills. In fact, Awe has decided to add special defensive and offensive spells to the shootings, capable of turning the clashes in your favor for a varied and particularly interesting ecosystem. An incredible soundtrack As the rock music increases in pace and the enemies become more and more dangerous, the adrenaline rises, inevitably leading to headbanging (yes, even if you have little hair). The soundtrack, which changes at every level, is perhaps not at the level of Doom but it is still of very high quality, so much so that the idea of bringing it home as a bundle on Steam could very well cross your mind. The rhythm must not be kept only for shooting but also the reloading action must be performed following the beat, otherwise you will run out of ammunition in the magazine until the next alignment. One of the most interesting found in this case is the particular reload of each single fire mouth, which will force you to follow a different rhythm. We have to admit that, most likely, the best results will come with the initial gun, both for its simplicity of use and because BPM seems to have been designed right around it con adding later weapons only at a later time. Different weapons obviously work better against different specific enemies and, for example, if you have an easy time against the bosses with the rocket launcher, trying to exterminate the infernal flies that are buzzing around you will become a task that must necessarily be delegated to other guns. However, the game offers a more than excellent variety of both, leaving you all the freedom to experiment and find the best way to tackle the dungeons. Obviously we didn't expect too much from an indie studio in terms of enemy design and if the models leave little to be enthusiastic about, the color palettes have been exploited in an intelligent way, in order to give a unique and recognizable style to the production, a indelible mark that will imprint it on you right under the halo. To close the package then, several extra modes will take care of it, with a treat for lovers of pixelated graphics and several valkyries with different bonuses and maluses, so as to further diversify future runs and simultaneously increase replayability. There is work to be done on balancing some items and equipment (for example, we find game breaking the possibility of having infinite ammunition), but generally you will find a more than excellent challenge capable of keeping you busy for a long time and making you want to come back again Asgard, game after game.", "date": "2020-09-28", "grade": "8.5"}
