The idea behind the project is simple: to renew the line-up of titles available on iOS and Android terminals, introducing not only structural innovations but also and above all a freemium business model, which allows you to use each game for free as long as you some advertising, or eliminate the ads by paying 2.29 euros. And so, after Sonic The Hedgehog, Altered Beast, Phantasy Star II, Kid Chameleon and Comix Zone, here comes the first title belonging to the game library of the glorious Dreamcast: Virtua Tennis Challenge. As with the other products, the application has been updated to match the style of SEGA Forever, but in terms of offerings everything has remained the same: the initial menu allows you to try your hand at the SPT World Tour, with a single Exhibition, with the training to learn the various movements and with competitive multiplayer, usable locally via Bluetooth and online via Wi-Fi. From the point of view of the controls, there are four layouts to choose from, specifically a solution to gestures and three different virtual controllers, equipped with more or less buttons on the screen. Once these aspects of the experience are adjusted, the first few bars are not only intuitive but also terribly solid, thanks to a faithful reproduction of the gameplay that SEGA fans still remember well today. The thumb of the tennis player There is no doubt that Virtua Tennis has aged well: released for the first time in 2000 (but it had arrived the year before), SEGA's arcade tennis has been revisited from a graphic point of view and the mobile version is very beautiful to look at, net of some edges of the polygonal models. The atmospheres are those of the original and the wide choice in terms of controls ensures a smooth, immersive and fairly challenging experience. The developers have managed to insert some assistance mechanisms that do not leave us at the mercy of ourselves and allow us to take full advantage of touch commands, without going to extremes: a solution that works really well and gives life to spectacular exchanges, with an excellent yield of impacts to further excite. The heart of the game naturally lies in the SPT World Tour mode, with its different prize tournaments and a currency system that implies a certain degree of risk, as well as the need to ~grind~ a minimum to be able to access the more advanced competitions. As for online multiplayer, it is disappointing to find that years later the system still suffers from a minimum of lag which makes many maneuvers difficult, above all the precision adjustment of the stroke. In general, the validity of Virtua Tennis Challenge undoubtedly remains, the excellent technical realization and the solid gameplay full of personality, but at the same time no substantial innovations have been made in conjunction with the relaunch on the SEGA Forever platform.", "date": "2017-07-19", "grade": "8.0"}
