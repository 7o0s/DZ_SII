Over the course of seven years it has met with incredible success with audiences and critics, quickly climbing the ranking of the best action-games of all time. This is thanks to a series of elements that combined together have allowed the saga to establish new quality standards for the genre, both from a playful and technical point of view. Compelling storyline, a charismatic character and extraordinary gameplay, these are basically the ingredients of the success of God of War. Precisely the aforementioned gameplay is the flagship of Sony production, with its perfect balance that offers an always adequate level of challenge in each episode, combined with a spectacular game progression, the absence of loading between one section and another and to the quicktime timed sequences, used in abundant numbers, but without abusing them, to finish off the most difficult enemies and bosses. The incredible thing is that despite passing from hand to hand in terms of direction from David Jaffe to Cory Barlog to finally arrive at Stig Asmussen (each episode has seen its Game Director capitulate for reasons that are never fully clarified. The team, on the other hand, has always remained the same same for the main series, Santa Monica Studio), but also from console to console, strictly Sony, however, the series has not been affected in the least, to the point that even the chapters for PSP have proved to be two authentic gems. Entrusted for the occasion to Ready at Dawn, another group of developers, who have succeeded in the difficult task of remaining faithful to the atmospheres and feeling of the chapters for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, Chains of Olympus and The Ghost of Sparta, these are the titles of PSP products, in fact proved to be two of the best games ever released on the old Sony ~portable~, even able to walk calmly with their heads held high alongside the two major episodes. Chains of Olympus It is therefore no wonder that, exactly as happened with the two episodes for PlayStation 2, Sony has decided to collect them both with all the extra content they already had, including a documentary with lots of behind-the-scenes and interviews, remaster them in high definition and reproduce them in a full-bodied Blu-ray for PlayStation 3 entitled God of War Collection II (God of War Origins Collection in USA). Before going into the general technical aspects introduced by the developers specifically for this special edition, including graphic improvements, which we will analyze in a separate paragraph, let's start by analyzing the two games individually, retracing their plot and gameplay. Let's start from Chains of Olympus which from the point of view of the story narrated is ideally positioned just before the original chapter for PlayStation 2, and after Kratos had been saved by Ares, the god of war. The strong Spartan warrior is now in the forced service of the Olympians in order to atone for his sins and get rid of the nightmares that afflict him perennially. His adventure starts from the city of Attica, where he is sent by the Greek gods in order to defend its citizens from the Persian army. Defeat the latter for our hero will open the doors of an adventure that will lead him to the depths of Hades, against powerful enemies such as Charon and Persephone, and in which a decisive role will be played by Morpheus, who will try to affirm the darkness and death taking possession of Elio, god of the sun and conductor of the solar chariot, symbol of the manifestation of life. Speaking from a purely playful point of view, the title is confirmed as well-made even in this high definition transposition, with its mix of action, enhanced by the fluidity of the constant 60 FPS, and puzzle solving, with the progress of events as always characterized by breathtaking fights and interspersed with absolutely spectacular non-interactive sequences. Nice but a little short Kratos, as tradition dictates, has the ability to perform jumps, light and heavy physical attacks, bloody grips and parries. These can be enhanced during the adventure by the solar shield and by the favors guaranteed by the gods, which enrich, among other things, the collection of magic available to the Spartan with new techniques such as for example the strength of Efreet, capable of creating a fiery shockwave, the Wrath of Charon, which damages and temporarily immobilizes weaker enemies, and the Light of Dawn which consists of a solar orb capable of destroying enemies from a distance and with remarkable precision. There could be some concern about the control system, since the development teampo had to adapt the original one to the PlayStation 3 DualShock. Well, everything works wonderfully, and performing combos, dodges and quick attacks proves to be very intuitive and natural. The experience is therefore completely comparable to the other chapters previously released for home consoles, and also in this case the difficulty level, available in three different variations, is perfectly balanced for both newcomers to the series and longtime players. The defects of the game, if we can define them that way, remain the same as the original, and it could not be otherwise since it is only a high definition transposition of the PSP's Chains of Olympus. In detail, even if the title remains fun and well balanced, unfortunately it has a low longevity, few bosses to face and only a handful of puzzles to solve to break up the gameplay action. However, it is also true that once the adventure has been completed, a new level of difficulty and numerous extras can be unlocked, such as different challenge modes, videos and costumes. These elements, which could make the most avid players happy. Playstation 3 trophies God of War Collection II introduces Trophies for Chain of Olympus and The Ghost of Sparta. The two games have fifteen each available, plus another twenty secrets each. The known awards are divided into 1 of Platinum, 5 of Gold, 6 of Silver and 3 of Bronze. To obtain them, as always, you must satisfy some requests of the game with increasing difficulty. For which they range from the request to upgrade each weapon to the maximum for minor Trophies, to the collection of all Gorgon's eyes, to the execution of at least 1000 combos gradually until the games are completed in hard mode and the maximum objective is reached to unlock every secret, to get the coveted Platinum. God of War: The Ghost of Sparta The other title included in the God of War Collection II is God of War: Ghost of Sparta, the most recent to see the light on PSP. This time the plot takes place, on a temporal level, between the first and second chapter of the main saga, and is centered around Kratos' search for his brother Deimos, kidnapped by the gods when both were little more than children. As tradition dictates for the series, during the journey of the protagonist we find ourselves meeting a whole series of places and characters from Greek mythology, starting from the mythical Atlantis. As for the gameplay, like the other game mentioned in this review, it is practically identical to that of the three chapters developed by Santa Monica Studio: the progression of the adventure is linear and guided, but there is a particular dynamism in the situations offered. Also the pace is always high and the combat system and character growth are the same as always. The only real novelty must therefore be sought elsewhere, in our case in one of Kratos' abilities: it is a power that can be gained from the titan Tera, and which consists in the ability to set Athena's Blades on fire. Which is quite useful not only to be able to overcome some specific passages, but also to take down the most difficult enemies. In this context, it is a pity that there are very few monsters that are particularly difficult to defeat and of large dimensions, which clashes with the tradition of the saga which made differences in size between creatures and heroes, with a scale of measures always against of the protagonist, one of the key and most fascinating elements of the entire gameplay. As far as the control of the main character is concerned, also in this case the PlayStation 3 DualShock behaves excellently and certainly confirms the fact that with this pad the title is played better than the PSP counterpart. While in reference to the overall longevity, the title proves to be more long-lasting than Chains of Olympus with about six to seven hours required for the completion of the story, to which a whole series of extra challenges must then be added for those who want to stay longer in the role of the spartan hero. Remastering, what a passion All the improvements of God of War Collection II are in any case addressed to the technical sector, which synthetically sees three big improvements: the resolution, which thanks to the skilful work of the graphics who have practically increased the number of polygons for the characters and increased in size the textures, redesigned, has now risen to 1080p (but of course you can also play at 720p). Then 60 frames per second constant without any uncertainty and full support for stereoscopic 3D (at 720p). The result is surprising in general, with an even better response to commands and a performance on Full HD TV that proves to be quite valid, a sign thatand the resolution is one of the main aspects to enjoy a video game on current televisions, and the excellent work done by the graphics with the two God of War proposed for the occasion. Going into more detail, let's say that in the first chapter, Chains of Olympus, the shortcomings compared to the current generation of consoles obviously come to light, with graphics that appear pleasant but simple, yet capable of giving some glimpses that are very nice to see, supported from fluency and resolution above. Things get much more interesting with God of War: The Ghost of Sparta, which had already thrilled audiences and critics on PSP thanks to graphics enhanced by splendid polygonal modeling of both the characters and the settings: by virtue of what has just been described, in this case there is a substantial increase in detail, effects and variety which, combined with an artistic sector rich in style and color, return an extremely pleasant impact. Let me be clear, the impression is always that of being faced with a game born on a less powerful console than the PlayStation 3, but overall the visual quality pleases the eye. The only note that can possibly be moved from this point of view is the lack of that 2x antialiasing present in the previous collection which, especially when playing at 720p resolution, would not have hurt. In its place is a milder antialiasing scattered here and there in some elements of the scenario or on the characters. But what really left us positively surprised is, as already mentioned in the preview, the excellent support for stereoscopic 3D for both titles. Thanks to it it is possible to enjoy a remarkable sense of depth in the various scenarios, able to further enhance every single action performed by Kratos. Too bad that with active 3D you have to give up the high framerate a bit, returning to the original 30 FPS of the PlayStation Portable versions, but it's a ~sacrifice~ that you do willingly and that doesn't affect the general usability of the product in the slightest. Final note for the sound sector, another strong point of the saga as always, which also remains at high levels for both titles, with a soundtrack enhanced by Dolby 5.1 and flanked by an excellent dubbing in Italian.", "date": "2011-09-14", "grade": "9.0"}
