{"name": "Pokmon Colosseum", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-colosseum_a.html", "text": "The Lord of the Pokmons An element that necessarily distinguishes Pokmon Colosseum from Pokmon Stadium and Pokmon Stadium 2 is the new Story Mode. While in the two titles mentioned above the player could alternate the sessions of hard and pure combat in the arenas only with simple entertainment mini-games, in Pokmon Colosseum Nintendo had the foresight to deepen the playful experience by inserting a mode that allows the player to step into the shoes of a rather unusual coach to face an adventure with a decidedly more mature tone than the one seen in the various episodes for Game Boy Advance. The protagonist, in fact, is an ex-bandit of a terrorist group, Team Snagem, who exactly like the dear old Team Rocket, Aqua and Magma seen in the episodes for GBA, uses Pokmon for criminal purposes, stealing and mistreating them in addition. In short, in the role of this bizarre anti-hero, accompanied by a young and mysterious girl, we will have to stop the evil plans of the bandits and at the same time recover the Pokmon in their possession and free them from the darkness that has infiltrated their hearts. In short, the plot is still a pretext to give rise to an infinite number of pre-determined battles, but while on the GBA its development was practically non-existent (and indeed in Sapphire and Ruby there were several rather interesting narrative elements) in Colosseum it evolves unexpectedly becoming really interesting. On the other hand, the ~freedom~ factor granted in the paperback versions is strongly lacking, which also affects the acquisition of Pokmon as we will see later, and a rigid linearity in both narrative and playful progression is evident. Speaking of the acquisition of Pokmon, Colosseum presents an interesting novelty which however has its pros and cons, namely the technique called ~Snag~: in practice, the protagonist as a good ex-criminal can steal the pokmon of the other trainers. A similar practice has always been frowned upon and therefore impossible to implement in the various Pokmon episodes, but in Colosseum the end seems to justify the means: the only Pokmon that can be stolen, in fact, are the so-called ~Shadow~ Pokmon, monsters made evil by their trainers and which can be captured with classic Pokballs and added to our team. A Shadow Pokmon initially has only one ability and only after using it as much as possible in battle and having acquired its trust will it return to a normal pocket monster, learning the specific techniques of its species. The problem with this original capture system is that the Shadow Pokmon are the only pokmon that can be captured in Story mode and once you miss the opportunity to catch them, you may never get another chance to do so... and this it also applies to those Pokmon that, ingeniously, Nintendo has included as exclusive and that will necessarily have to be captured to eventually complete the GBA Pokdex. Welcome to the Stage of History The other mode present in Pokmon Colosseum is the usual Battle Mode which, really, adds little or nothing to the consolidated structure with the two Stadiums, apart from the pseudo-unpublished mechanics of Sapphire and Ruby. In summary, the player registers a team of up to six pokmon to participate in the various battles and fights until he is defeated or becomes the winner of the tournament, also using two Pokmon at a time, with the ~turn-based~ mechanics already seen in Sapphire and Ruby. The monsters that can be registered are those owned in Story Mode or downloaded from Sapphire/Ruby via connection to the Game Boy Advance. In this regard, one remains a little perplexed by the possibilities offered by the connection: up to four players can take part in a fight and while one has the entire screen at his disposal and the possibility of viewing the menus relating to the pokmon in use by recalling them with a few keystrokes, the other players have to settle for the displays of their Game Boy Advances, obviously more limited in terms of managing menus and options. Apart from this, the GBA-GC connection which should be one of the strong points of the game offers practically nothing and the Battle mode, in short, is reduced only to a sequence of fights in which to admire the Pokmon who give it a good fight. Which was totally predictable and is part of the intrinsic concept of the game, so there's not much to complain about, if you consider the inclusion of the Story Mode which beautifully replaces the Pokmon Stadium mini-games. Obviously, all this if you have the Sapphire and Ruby cartridges, as the game completely loses its charm if you don't use your own little creatures, painstakingly trained for hours and hours of play...Pokmon Cube As we said at the beginning, the definitive version of Pokmon Colosseum partially dispels the doubts that arose from viewing images and videos on the occasion of TGS 2003. Pokmon are divinely made and enjoy exceptional animations perfectly consistent with their original characteristics of two-dimensional sprites; moreover, although the creatures in combat never physically collide, each attack or special move is made with an excellent use of light effects, lens-flare, motion-blur, distortions and anything else that is possible to achieve with the Gamecube chipset to make the fights spectacular (honorable mention for the Hydro Pump attack of aquatic pokmon such as Blastoise or Kyogre). Too bad instead for the rough polygonal models of the coaches, angular and detailed the minimum necessary to make them presentable, although the general character design of the characters, especially in Story Mode, is more than satisfactory for the ~dark~ turn undertaken in this narrative line. On the other hand, the various environments and locations are simply spectacular, not so much for the technical realization, which is always excellent, but for the general inspiration that has caught the Nintendo artists to create always different and characteristic places. As for the audio, the usual pleasant tunes already heard on GBA return to accompany us in Colosseum, remixed properly and even more pleasant, while it is very sad not to hear the verses of the pokmon known in the animated series and now become characteristic, supplanted by the ~ sample~ (often nasty) of the portable versions. No ~Pikachu!~, in short, but a simple squeak. Sin. Comment Did Pokmon Colosseum live up to the expectations of trainers who loved at least Sapphire and Ruby? No doubt. Colosseum has everything a dedicated Pokmon trainer would want on the Gamecube and even more, that Story mode that really enhances a game that otherwise offers little to anyone who isn't a die-hard fan of Satoshi Tajiri's little creatures. Technically the game has its ups and downs but the balance certainly leans more towards the former and for once it shows that the first photos are not always better than the finished work. The Story Mode, however linear and restrictive, engages the player for a good thirty hours, with a discreet plot that maintains a certain interest, always within the limits of a simple production and certainly not at the narrative levels of more elaborate products such as various Final Fantasy. In short, Colosseum remains recommended above all to fans of the series but always and only if they have the Ruby and/or Sapphire versions, without the bailouts of which much of the fun is lost. Second Comment From the two Pokemon Stadium for N64 it was possible to use the pocket monsters for duels in glorious TV technicolor. The episodes for GBA continue the success of the series and Colosseum arrives on a GameCube certainly healthier than the N64. The flagship in the dark times, Pokemon were and have remained a mass phenomenon. Animation, games, merchandise, together: as in historical precedents such as that of the ninja turtles, but this time the video game was at the center. The brand is healthier than ever and Colosseum is proof of that. We can face each other with Poke-shots on the new TVcolor and enjoy the computing power of the Cube to animate the monotonous little monsters. New features include a Story Mode that is independent from the battle mode and, indeed, essential to continue, but also the possibility of stealing Pokemon from your opponents and a new, more captivating storyline, with a sort of background ~ethical problem~ (the use of Pokemon to cause harm). Solid but very simple RPG, it is entirely shifted to the side of the battles. The latter are very little innovative compared to the numerous prequels. But it matters little, given that Nintendo's interest was to guarantee a good home Pokemon for a large audience, mainly very young, for this hardware generation too, based on a solid and functional RPG to the concept of unbridled collection and cataloging that made the fortune of the series. Also given that, unlike the prequels, it ~stands up~ on its own without the GBA episodes, Colosseum is a highly recommended title for all young Cube owners. In theory, then, we do not recommend it to anyone. VOTE: 7 Marco Benoit Carbone Pokmon Channel was just a sop for the little ones, older trainers knew they had to wait for Colosseum to be able to enjoy pokmon to the third power as they had done with Pokmon Stadium on the Nintendo64. Let us remember, however, that the images shown months ago at the Tokyo Game Show had done quasi shouted at the scandal for a technical realization that had nothing cubic at all. Now that we have Colosseum in our hands, we can reassure the doubters of two main factors: the first, that technically Pokmon Colosseum is much higher than poor expectations; the second, that the much-vaunted RPG mode exists and greatly enhances the product. In short, do you have a Game Boy Advance, Pokmon Sapphire or Ruby and a cable to connect everything to the GameCube? Dust them, you will see some beautiful ones.", "date": "2004-05-09", "grade": null}
