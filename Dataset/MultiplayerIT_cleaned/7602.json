The puzzle game, by its nature, has a very large potential, based on more or less sensitive variations of a now well-established and certainly functional structure, cemented with the experience of the spin-offs which also offered what was partially missing from the 'original, or a bit' of different settings and characterizations. Precisely because of this variety of proposed solutions, the presence of a real ~2~ next to the name of the original should have guaranteed some effective step forward from a structural point of view. Where is my water? 2, on the other hand, struggles to earn that number which should attest to its essence as a sequel, and therefore the substantial evolution of a puzzle that has already expressed a large part of its potential. It is also true that, since it is an enjoyable game, a ~more of the same~ is certainly not unwelcome and the additions applied, in the form of new modes and levels with a different setting than usual, are appreciable, but the feeling is whether it is really the minimum effort made by the developers to continue to squeeze a brand which, after an excellent initial idea, has given way more to marketing experiments than to new game solutions. Sure, it's a free game, so even those who have practically consumed the original probably won't hesitate to dedicate themselves to it, but a certain structural tiredness is already evident from the first levels, thanks to the recycling of situations and graphic elements from the first chapter. Then there is the question of in-app purchases: precisely from the free essence of the title, the potential strength of a sequel that may not have much to say, one of its worst flaws is linked instead, given a truly questionable management of this business model. Where is my water? 2 brings back the original mechanics with some additions and various micro-transactions Hygienist alligators and more The structure of the game is always based on the physical behavior of the fluids and the model is the excellent one already used in the previous chapters, but in this case the parallel presence of Swampy, Cranky and Allie is more rooted in the progression between the levels since start, which helps to diversify game situations in a more rhythmic way. The three different alligators require the same actions as they did in the past: Swampy needs water to power his shower, Cranky wants acid to ~clean~ his waste, and Allie requires steam to operate his organ. In all three cases it is a question of ~deleting~ the dirt present within the levels by channeling the fluids into particular paths, while trying to collect ducks and various objects or by activating switches and taps. The major novelty present in this sequel is the presence of variants with which to face the same scheme, allowing a good amount of game solutions that expand the already vast amount of levels present. Among the new introductions we point out the possibility of facing the levels upside down, with a consequent distortion of the strategies adopted in the first step, the variant that requires you not to touch the ducks and switches and the presence of levels based on the new mechanics of automatic vertical scrolling, which forces us to follow the movement of the screen by acting quickly, so as not to leave the water outside the frame. The hundred levels present are divided into barrier macro-areas, with access linked to the quantity of ducks collected, therefore returning to levels already completed to obtain better scores becomes necessary in order to continue. The micro-transactions present in the game are not necessarily linked to unlocking new levels, but are continuously integrated into the fabric of the gameplay. In addition to the simple ~standard~ purchase of power-ups that can facilitate the action, the most invasive element is given by the presence of an energy bar that decreases with each attempt to complete a level, whether it ends successfully or not. This means that the bar drops progressively regardless of whether you play well or make mistakes, and once it runs out you have to either pay to fill it up or stop playing and wait patiently. The times are also quite long for the complete recharge, in stark contrast to the brevity that characterizes the levels, which annoyingly breaks the pace of the game, especially in the more advanced stages when the failed attempts begin to be various. The proposed solution is therefore ~spam~ on Facebook (option peraltro constantly reminded, via warnings and pop-ups, during the game) or the purchase of energy packs, which in any case are always consumable, despite the fact that in some cases they reach absolutely remarkable figures.", "date": "2013-09-25", "grade": "6.0"}
