However it is also true that with a little inventiveness many screenwriters still manage to rework concepts, characters and stories taken from other productions, even transversal ones, and to obtain valid material for their work. In the case of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 unfortunately this has not been the case up to now, and between somewhat trite situations and a fairly soft story, the game has proved to be discreet up to now but unattractive for the general public. Yet things could change with this third installment, which from a certain point of view could mark an important turning point for the production. In ~The Condemnation~, the situation seems to improve and finally, we anticipate it immediately, what happens during the episode partially lifts the production from a certain basic flatness, and not only at the plot level. But let's proceed in order. Resident Evil: Revelations 2 comes alive and finally gives the first real emotions Revelations If in the first episode the central theme was the escape from prison, at least before discovering that you are on a remote island, while in the second it was to reach the tower to reveal the identity of the mysterious figure who spies on the protagonists and seems involved in the kidnapping of the girls and in the experiments, in the third the goal is to eliminate the latter, get rid of the bracelets and run away from Zabytij. The episode opens with Claire and Moira standing in front of the tower entrance, still shocked by Gabriel's fate, and worried about Natalia, Neil and the mutagenic virus infection in their systems. The primary objective is still to reach the tower, but to do so they have to change their route and cross an old factory complete with a slaughterhouse, and the sewers. An undertaking that will prove to be very complicated and full of pitfalls. This time in fact, the game finally seems to take the right path, offering some moments full of intensity in the fights and, partially, in the story: it is not something epic or original, but given the previous installments, the novelty is welcome. As always, we won't go into details so as not to spoil the surprise, but it is with the duo Claire and Moira that perhaps the most interesting moments of this phase of the adventure will be experienced, for example by discovering why Barry's daughter hates firearms, or a portion of the truth about the experiments on the island. Also towards the end of their ~episode~ we will see a dramatic and well-structured confrontation with a really difficult boss infected with Uroboros, an advanced strain of the Progenitor virus created by Albert Wesker. In the second act, for their part, Barry and Natalia finally discover the identity of the creature who has been spying on them hidden in the shadows since their meeting. For this character, obviously linked to the Resident Evil universe, applause should be given to the graphics who conceived and developed the design, given that in this sense it is in our opinion one of the most appropriate in the Capcom horror saga. In some ways this monster looks like a modern and mutant version of the scary witch from Snow White, with her hunched shapes, her face disfigured in an eternal grin by the effects of the virus in her body and an attitude that brings to mind the antagonists of certain fairy tales black of the past. In any case, immediately after the meeting, attacked by dozens of creatures, the disturbing Revenants, Barry and the little girl escape by a miracle and find themselves having to cross the sewers first, and then go to the mines. Also here for the gamer there is a fight with a boss, which in some moments will prove to be a little frustrating to face, above all because he will be accompanied by a couple of tormentors. The ideal is to get there with a few Molotov cocktails and a couple of extra magazines for the magnum. Lethal virus Moving on to something else, in terms of general mechanics The sentence confirms the positive things we had seen in the previous episode, with the support characters more involved in the game mechanics and therefore quite useful in various situations. In the same way, also given the nature of the enemies to be faced - some of those who in the first two episodes had been the bosses at the end of the area, have now become ~ordinary~ monsters, in the sense that they can be encountered around like the more ~normal~ ones ~ Afflict yourself. The management and use of healing objects at the right time is becoming increasingly decisive and dhe secondary weapons, from Molotov cocktails to explosive bottles. In addition to the normal bullets for heavy weapons, such as the magnum or the assault rifle, to be sipped for special occasions. As for the technical part, the patch released by Capcom to fix some of the defects encountered by users over the previous few weeks seems to work quite well, at least on PC. In many points where it dropped dramatically before, the frame rate appears, for example, more stable, with some hesitation only in certain situations, such as an adventure phase where you have to escape from an area that is about to explode, and therefore there are flames, explosions , objects and pieces of scenery that collapse on the characters. Repeated game crashes also seem to be finally resolved. Even many textures, especially those relating to indoor areas, seemed better to us in this episode than in the others, even if in general not everything is still always fluid and free from problems. However, it is positive that the Japanese company has undertaken to try to solve the flaws, as well as unlock the cooperative mode for users who play on computers, it being understood that certain things should be resolved before distributing a product on the market. On the other hand, we have already praised the sound sector several times in the two previous reviews, so in addition to confirming its goodness, we do not add anything else if not ironically, for statistics lovers, that the number of bad words from Moira has dropped significantly in this episode.", "date": "2015-03-10", "grade": "7.5"}
