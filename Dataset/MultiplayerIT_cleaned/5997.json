Much of the success is linked to the 2007 anime signed by the Gonzo studio, where the protagonist, an African-American samurai with Jimy Hendrix-esque hair, is voiced by none other than the famous actor Samuel L. Jackson. The whole story, steeped in blood, revenge and perversion, revolves around the possession of two legendary bands, Number 1 and Number 2. Whoever holds the first becomes a real divinity and can only be challenged by whoever wears the second, while the latter can be faced by anyone who wishes, condemning him to a cursed life and eternal battle. In 2009, from Okazaki's work, Bandai Namco translated a discreet hack n' slash in cel shading onto PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which despite being sinning in terms of repetitiveness, was nonetheless enjoyable thanks to the fascinating technical sector and the solid narrative. Six years after the video game debut, the license ended up in the hands of the American team of Redacted Studios, which with a very limited budget attempted to bring the horrors and introspections of the Japanese manga back to the screen. The result, we can already anticipate it, is a full-blown seppuku (Japanese ritual suicide). If you suffer from gaming addiction, Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma can help you overcome it Playstation 4 trophies Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma features twelve trophies divided into nine bronze, two silver, and one gold. No platinum goal for the work Redacted Studios. The easiest trophies to conquer are related to the completion of individual levels, the two silver ones are linked to killing one hundred enemies with specific moves while the only gold one is unlocked by completing the game. Double T as earthquake and tragedy The plot of Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma follows the narrative plot of the original work and puts the player in the role of Jinno, an orphan who accuses Afro Samurai of being responsible for the massacre in which all his companions lost their lives. Overwhelmed by pain, Jinno attempts suicide by jumping off a cliff while embracing the battered body of his little sister Otsuru, but is saved by the ~Empty Seven~ clan and transformed into Kuma, a sort of cyborg with an improbable and gigantic bear mask, reworked around that of his sister's favorite puppet. Strengthened and filled with rage, Jinno plans his revenge against the Afro Samurai by launching a ruthless manhunt, which extends beyond the ending of the original manga. The foundations for an engaging plot are therefore all there, nevertheless the work of systematic destruction carried out by Redacted Studios is also evident in the narrative sector. In the two hours necessary to complete the game, about half of the time is spent listening to delirious and insipid monologues, in a slang full of foul language whose interpretation is made difficult not only by the total absence of subtitles, but also by inconceivable audio errors, between sudden changes in volume, overlapping voices and sighed phrases repeated until exhaustion. Progress is accompanied by such petulant shouting that you will turn down the volume so as not to listen to yet another rant. If that weren't enough, the cutscenes developed with the game engine are so ridiculous that it would be less embarrassing to be caught watching adult videos on the internet. Leaving aside the technical discourse, which we will address in the next paragraph, what displaces is the dementia of the dialogues and the use of the direction, which lingers with inappropriate shots even by the standards of home movies at birthday parties. Among the most emblematic sequences are the entry into the scene of a flamethrower tank, framed for half an hour while it is maneuvering, and the entire battle against the boss Two Hammers, the most ridiculous we have ever faced. The only thing that is saved to support the ~story~ are some hand-drawn tables, really well done. If the story is a complete catastrophe, the gameplay is a real insult to the concept of a video game. Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma offers fights, climbs, Quick Time Events and sections from Endless Run developed one worse than the other, in a horror festival that has very few rivals in this last gaming decade. Our character has three different fighting styles, namely Afro, Kuma and Master, each with its own specificity: with the first we can deflect bullets and break the enemy's defensesthere more tough, the second allows you to enter ~rage~ mode, while with the third, more acrobatic, you load a Fatality capable of killing multiple enemies with a single rotating shot. Each style features an utterly meaningless skill tree, points for which are earned in droves without knowing how or why. In less than no time it is possible to complete the branches of the individual skills, with a deficit of dozens and dozens of points which will continue to accumulate anyway. To unlock the last slot of each style, however, it will be necessary to wait for the release of Volume 2, given that we are before the first chapter of a hypothetical trilogy. To win fights, you just need to madly press the square button and sometimes the triangle to deflect the blows of the enemies, whose artificial intelligence is comparable to that of a tapeworm. As much as he tries to direct the blows, Kuma begins to whirl haphazardly around the screen giving epileptic seizures to the player, also busy coordinating with the ignoble positioning of the camera. The hitbox is bad and the sensation of slashing impalpable, even when you start the ridiculous executions with dismemberments. The obscene combat system is accompanied by chilling wall-climbing, completely deranged quick time events and stages from Endless Run so badly done that the character is sometimes faster than the shot itself, remaining suspended in mid-air waiting for the camera ~ hang up~ sequence. Just awful. Even the World Map for stage selection is problematic and beyond the campaign there is nothing that pushes you to take the pad back, not even a set of collectibles. There as a lake of blood Do you remember the fascinating cel-shaded graphics of the original chapter developed by Namco Bandai? Here, forget it, because Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma from a technical point of view is not worth a penny of the work done by the Japanese team. It's so ugly and buggy that you'll wonder if a badly programmed PlayStation 2 emulator has started on your PlayStation 4 by mistake. The textures are horrible, the aliasing engulfs any surface, the polygonal interpenetrations are the order of the day and the level design it's bad, since the stages are all made up of skimpy corridors with invisible walls and elements of the scenery that suddenly disappear. Despite the aforementioned defects, the worst aspect of the title is the frame rate, so limping that you will get a headache from continuous jerks and slowdowns, which accentuate even more the awkward and woody animations of the characters. Such a poorly optimized graphics engine had not yet been seen on next-generation consoles, and one wonders frankly how such a title managed to pass the quality control of Sony and Microsoft. It's a mess that easily reaches ten frames per second, staging a truly depressing show. The only thing that stands out is the hip hop soundtrack translated from the animated series, while the sound effects are cheesy and shoddy like the entire scaffolding of the project.", "date": "2015-10-05", "grade": "2.0"}
