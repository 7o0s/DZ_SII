{"name": "Speaking Simulator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/speaking-simulator-recensione.html", "text": "Let's try to close the Speaking Simulator review in three lines because it's not really worth dedicating more space to it. Meanwhile, don't be fooled by the title, because the simulation of the act of speaking does not exist. Tested with any controller with two analog sticks, the game boils down to being a kind of very bland rhythm game, in which the left stick is assigned the movements of the tongue, while the right stick is assigned those of the mouth. All the player has to do is move his mouth as indicated by some arrows and press buttons placed inside the oral cavity with his tongue when they turn green, avoiding them when red. Why are there buttons in the protagonist's mouth? Because it's a robot controlled by an alien who wants to take over the world. Learning to speak is the only way not to be discovered by humans. The missions that make up the single player campaign, if we want to call it that, see us from time to time in front of a different human trying to compose sentences with the movements of the mouth and other parts of the face that are unlocked by leveling up , complicating the controls a bit (other buttons that must always and only be pressed when told to do so also come into play). Our goal is to try to be as convincing as possible. When too many mistakes are made, the degree of suspiciousness of the human exceeds the guard level, making us discover. That's all? Yes... and unfortunately we have gone far beyond the three lines. In reality we were hasty, because Speaking Simulator is something else: a title that is repetitive to the core, technically ugly and very short... Hey, finally a good thing! But let's slow down and return to the canons of the good reviewer. Gameplay The idea of Speaking Simulator isn't even bad and for the first ten minutes of the game it's fun too. After all, it is easy to see ourselves behind the vein of comic simulators, those that have titles such as Surgeon Simulator and Goat Simulator as leaders. Unfortunately, the little it has to offer exhausts its thrust in a very short time, making its immense flaws soon emerge. The editor placed at the beginning of the game allows you to create your own robotic human choosing between skin color, hairstyle and other general characteristics of his appearance. Theoretically Speaking Simulator aims to elicit a few laughs thanks to the absurd deformity of the protagonist's face, between jumping teeth, mechanical ears boiling and other similar gimmicks that occur during conversations. As mentioned, it works for a few minutes, but the fun lasts long enough to realize that we are dealing with a rough game without any bite. The face, the only animated element of the character, as well as the 'place' where the game takes place, is the fair of interpenetrations. Facial deformations often look like glitches rather than features. The missions are connected to each other in a very vague way, with the dialogues being the fair of banalities and phoned jokes. The scenarios where the conversations take place are static and bare (offices, bars, apartments). It's really hard to find anything that saves. Maybe if it was a simulator of nasty conversations with people you don't want to meet...", "date": "2020-02-04", "grade": "3.5"}
