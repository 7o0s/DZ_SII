{"name": "Un impegno concreto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82519-cities-xl-2011-un-impegno-concreto.html", "text": "The city builder genre certainly does not reach the levels of other more inflated products such as shooters or role-playing games in terms of diffusion and fame and, indeed, it can be defined as niche, such as turn-based strategies or simulators, being able to count on a few names to represent what are essentially its two main souls: the Faraon and Caesar series which, together with Zeus and some spin-offs such as Sons of the Nile, have reached the highest peaks when it came to simulating existence and life of ancient civilizations, while, for fans of modern city simulation, it is the Sim City series that has demonstrated how engaging titles can be created even by dealing with topics that seem boring and trivial at first sight, such as the management of a municipality. Cities XL, born in 2009, has tried to recover the glories of the Sierra series by even inserting them in an online context, effectively creating a multi-player city builder in which the goal, in addition to building the perfect city, was to collaborate with those of other players managing imports of missing resources in your area and obviously exporting those made. How did this experiment end? Unfortunately not well: although the title showed some good ideas, it was afflicted by some serious shortcomings both on the gameplay side and in the mere support of the community, which was already reduced due to the lack of diffusion of the genre. Basically, less than a year after the opening, the servers closed their doors and a new version was created in a hurry, almost a gigantic patch rather than a real sequel, to bring the series back on the right track, starting from the single player. Millions of jobs Cities XL 2011, in fact, represents the single-player version of that predecessor who, having fallen victim to his own ambition, is now trying to get back on track among fans by offering a more classic but also simpler approach to the game structure: once again you will find yourself impersonating the mayor of a city in full development, starting from the first stone (the town hall) up to metropolitan levels worthy of New York or London. However, there is no ~plot~ or in any case a level progression in development, as there could be in Faraon or in other classic Sierras: having chosen the geographical position on a world extremely similar to our Earth, viewed the characteristics of the place (beach, mountain, plain and so on) and having given the city a name, the game begins with a desert expanse to be connected to the main roads on which to develop your own ideal metropolis. As in ~reality~, the primary objective of every good mayor is to give its citizens, or potential citizens, good initial jobs, and in fact the first agglomerations will revolve above all around the industries and only later will offices and related apartments be created for skilled workers. As the population grows, the time will come to assign lots for shops and general commercial activities and, at the same time, to build important infrastructure such as arteries connecting the various districts, police posts, hospitals and so on, all while maintaining a high level of employment and productivity of the enterprises, so that the coffers of the town hall are always in surplus. And it is the number of inhabitants that conditions access to increasingly impressive and particular buildings, businesses and services: at the beginning, for example, only generic shops and businesses will be buildable, while once the first hurdle of 1000 inhabitants has been overcome, it will be time to increase the offices and, only above 2000, will it be possible to lay the first hospital. Going forward in satisfying the demands of citizens, it will be possible to access new options, such as police stations, theatres, schools, skyscrapers instead of villas and so on. This means that, unlike in other management systems, it is no longer possible to lay the foundations of a neighborhood and immediately supply it with everything necessary (firefighters, policemen, shops, cinemas and so on) waiting for the inhabitants to settle in the domestic lots, but rather it is necessary to always leave some ~outlet~ in which to be able to add those services that will be available when the city will have grown. For this reason, the real central nucleus of CitiesXL 2011, as after all in a real city, are the streets, which, strengthened by an almost infinite number of options for their creation, must be carefully planned by the player not only with a view to immediate exploitation, but above all thinking about the future developments of the city: for example, making a main road with a couple of lanes along which to place a first series of houses/pwork places is fine for a small town of 2-3,000 inhabitants, but once these become 10-20,000, the road itself will prove unable to bear the amount of traffic that has arisen, and widening it will not be so easy given that you should tear down the buildings on one side. These are the problems that a good mayor knows how to prevent by simply putting more lanes right from the start or, perhaps, starting development only on one side (at least as regards the main artery or the future city centre). Not to mention how much worse things will get when it's time to create a public service network above or below ground, also because the secret of the city's prosperity is precisely in giving citizens the possibility to reach the relevant jobs. Safer streets! It is well known that the biggest obstacle for a city builder is the difficulty of balancing the demands of citizenship with the space and resources available, and let's face it, how many times in Caesar have we cursed the patricians who asked for an amphitheater away from home when there 'was there already one a few blocks away, knowing that, once they were satisfied, they would complain about the lack of a fountain that was knocked down to make room for the newcomer? Well, in CitiesXL 2011 the problem is obviously present, even if in fact the citizens are less fussy about the immediate availability of services, provided that there are enough roads and buses to take them wherever they want without ending up in traffic. Furthermore, the councilors will keep the mayor constantly informed of city problems, giving the possibility of intervening promptly where the need arises: it is even possible to access the specific map of the missing services, which, colored differently based on the level of satisfaction achieved in the various areas , will give prompt information on what is missing and where. A little too easy? In fact, a little yes: compared to other city builders CitiesXL 2011 offers a certainly lower degree of challenge, and, if on the one hand it opens the product to a wider range of audiences, on the other it reduces the construction of the city to a continuous routine of new buildings created at the request of the program, leading to boredom in the long run. In fact, having made a city, it will be difficult to find a higher challenge or even a variety of strategies in the next one (if we obviously exclude the tourist setting which for a marine area will certainly be different from that of high mountains). Which among other things represents a big problem given that part of the gaming experience would also be that of creating commercial / tourist exchanges between the various cities created, along the lines of what was once possible in the now defunct online version. There was this risk in Sim City and Caesar (to name just two), but there was no lack of elements capable of varying the gameplay by placing the player in front of real and serious problems: from barbarian invasions to revolts, passing through the possibility of a Cesare dissatisfied (it's too funny to make Cesare angry Ed.), and arriving at for floods, earthquakes and even Godzilla (yes, there was!). In this case this does not happen, indeed, it does not even happen that there are demonstrations or fires: simply, lacking this or that service, the area automatically decays and factories, houses, shops and so on are therefore abandoned, bringing the entire municipality to bankruptcy if not optimized the situation in time. More space for public parks Speaking of the mere graphic aspect, CitiesXL 2011 does not disappoint: the hundreds of buildings present, however variable according to the ~culture~ of the area and complete with unique ornamental elements such as the Statue of Liberty or the Eiffel Tower, prove to be excellent both in terms of variety and level of detail, even if, to tell the truth, at the maximum zoom level they appear a bit inanimate, as well as cars and various vehicles. On the other hand, the animations of the citizens are good, especially those engaged in particular activities such as sport or chases between thieves and policemen (very sporadic and on which obviously the player has no way to put his hand). The backdrops and environments are excellent, which, from the mountains to the sea, prove to be evocative and pleasant, and it is above all at the maximum zoom level that the total view of one's magnificent city can give the player considerable satisfaction, at least the first time. On the other hand, the audio and musical comments are a little less evocative, revealing a certain underlying repetitiveness. Nothing to report on the AI of councilors and citizens: the former are always very loyal in reporting problems and the latter capable of exploiting new arteries or occupying new lots or jobs.", "date": "2010-11-22", "grade": "6.7"}
