However, in terms of mechanics, the small Austrian software house has continued to travel in the same direction previously undertaken by mixing turn-based gameplay, isometric view and connectivity. It is no coincidence that the original name of Shadowrun Chronicles was Shadowrun Online but between misunderstandings and changes of direction it was necessary to adopt a title that did not suggest an MMO. Shadowrun Chronicles includes a shared hub that allows players to meet and unfortunately also makes the permanent connection mandatory but is divided into missions that can be tackled in cooperative and single player. In essence, those who prefer to play alone have nothing to fear and can count on a plot also enhanced by dubbing in English or German which, although limited to some characters, significantly increases the player's involvement in the narrative dimension. Any lack of human companions is obviously filled by the classic non-player characters who, by the way. they can also be the characters of currently disconnected players. The gameplay is pretty simple. If Herebrained Schemes' Shadowrun includes all the complexity of the most advanced turn-based strategic RPGs, the one signed by Cliffanger Productions relies on an automatic cover system that makes no difference between the types of protection. The game system does not provide time units but always allows you to carry out a movement phase and an action that can be used to move some other box. Furthermore, the dynamics of Shadowrun Chronicles do not include the automatic return fire which is one of the cornerstones of this type of title. In essence we are faced with a fight reduced to the bone with the roll to hit decided automatically based on the distance and points spent on a certain skill. But there are still many factors to keep an eye on. The most important concerns the choice of the type of weapon or spell with the effectiveness that also varies according to the resistance of the target to the three types of damage foreseen by the game. There is also no shortage of secondary fire modes, grenades, turrets, units capable of moving for long distances and other modifiers that require a reasoned approach focused on the specific skills of the character. The customization starts from the selection of the race which is not bound to classes whatsoever. Whatever the ethnicity chosen, we can combine it at will with one of the numerous backgrounds that bestow bonuses and maluses with rather important effects. At this point, all that remains is to complete missions and forfeit nuyen to buy items and karma points that can be spent to unlock a large number of skills. There is no division between attributes and skills but a series of branches of specialization of equal importance that encompass different skills. In the branch dedicated to the body, for example, there is also lockpicking which coexists with the obvious passive skills that increase the character's resistance. The complexity, in essence, is not extreme but with the addition of cybernetic systems, which if installed decrease the essence and therefore the magical potential of a character, the latest updates have considerably brought the title closer to a real RPG set in the world of shadow runs. In all of this it is important to underline that the secondary missions are available only in certain junctures of the campaign and the successfully completed missions cannot be replayed therefore it is not possible to go farming to overcome a particularly difficult task. Shadowrun Chronicles tries to have its say by mixing turn-based RPG and four-player cooperative For a fistful of nuyen Although Shadowrun Chronicles has officially come out of the Early Access phase, we are not dealing with a fully usable title. The three chapters of the Boston Lockdown campaign offer content in quantity but the experience is marred by a huge latency which is sometimes so high as to make the title almost unplayable. And it doesn't matter if you choose to play in single player mode since everything passes through the official servers anyway, making it impossible to save in the middle of a mission. Furthermore, there is no skill reset system and this means that to try a new configuration it is necessary to create a new character and occupy a new slot of the only three available. It also lacks the net altogether with hacking only leveraged, like other skills, to gain access to itemsotherwise unreachable. Fortunately, the developers are working on the latency problem but it is obvious that many players were disappointed by yet another problematic launch of a game that decides to sacrifice itself in the name of permanent connectivity. To appease the discontent Cliffhanger Productions has decided to compensate those who have already purchased the title with an additional slot for the characters, two cybernetic implants that have no cost in essence and the flamethrower to vent frustration on enemies. In any case, the obvious flaws, some of which are clearly solvable, do not prevent us from taking into account the points in favor of Shadowrun Chronicles. Playing in cooperative mode, now extended to four players, is fun all the more since, apart from latency, everyone can decide their action at the same time in the same turn. However, there is no automatic party system and this means that you have to socialize in the hub or in the global chat. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially if you don't disdain a pinch of self-produced RPG. The other important factor to take into consideration is the degree of challenge. The artificial intelligence is not perfect but tries to make the most of the covers and manages to put players in difficulty by concentrating fire on a specific character. And it's fortunate that it is since the missions are almost exclusively focused on direct combat and don't offer much variety. Fortunately, the graphic style is not bad and respects the paper universe of Shadowrun while allowing itself some license in relation to the proportions of the races. Furthermore, even if the setting may seem very similar to that of Herebrained Schemes' Shadowruns, Boston Lockdown uses a three-dimensional engine. The detail is conspicuously inferior but it compensates with destructible scenery elements, with short cutscenes for the spectacular kills, with the camera that can be rotated and zoomed. Furthermore, we are granted extensive aesthetic customization which includes neon tattoos, weird miniskirts, gadgets of all sorts and a lot of other pleasures ranging from fantasy to cyberpunk. Obviously, these are side elements and from the point of view of equipment, excluding weapons, the variety is not exceptional. But here it is important to underline that between contents and interface the Cliffhanger Production title has grown considerably compared to the beginnings and the developers intend to improve it further. For this reason, it might be wise to keep an eye on an imperfect project that is nonetheless not devoid of peculiarities and potential.", "date": "2015-05-05", "grade": "7.0"}
