First of all the controls: these would not be too bad, even if it must be said that the Pg does not always respond promptly to the commands given to him, a pity however that some of the actions that can be performed with them are useless and harmful. For example, the game expects our monk to automatically collect the objects he finds between his feet or near them. ~Good~, you say, ~so at least we don't run the risk of getting distracted while we fight~. But no. This action is carried out systematically in every juncture or situation, even the most disparate and soon turns out to be harmful: let's suppose that the shaolin is about to throw an enemy downwards from a shelf above, keeping him suspended on his head with his arms up. If at that precise moment he should find himself unfortunately close to an item, he will let go of his grip on the opponent, freeing him, to pick it up, even if he were dazzled by the object like a magpie... Even the AI of our companions certainly doesn't shine for logic, and on the contrary, it appears rather limited, effectively nullifying any possible collaborative ambitions (as we will see later, they will follow us in various scenarios forming a sort of team). When surrounded by enemies, their presence comes in handy since they act like blacksmiths, but when the melee thins out and the opponents decrease in the arena, they often find themselves in the trajectory of your shots, taking them out. As if that weren't enough, they will not turn the other cheek to the blow received, but rather, irritated, they will react by throwing a hook at you. Not to mention the fact that in other moments they will run to grab all the special items and power-ups on the screen like crazy, often leaving you empty-handed, perhaps at a time when you need them most. Mode The game mainly offers two modes, the Adventure and the Showdown one. The first is none other than the classic story mode already seen in other titles, and consists in facing a series of missions with various objectives to complete, at the guide of the other three adventure companions, while the second is practically a ~ battle mode, where each player or character fights against all the others for the control of a certain area, many of which are unlockable in the other game session. Xiaolin Showdown also has a Multiplayer mode, but it only consists of sessions where you can fight against 4 friends over Wi-Fi. From a graphic point of view, the game does not disappoint, and it is globally liked: the use of cel-shading goes perfectly with this kind of cartoon-inspired productions. Especially if the latter already have a fairly flat and non-detailed computerized coloring as some Japanese anime. The result is therefore a very valid, colorful aesthetic component, seasoned with animations of discreet workmanship, personalized even in the case of the protagonists, with scenarios in line, visually, with the television counterpart. The same goes for the sound, which, although not excellent, adapts well, for music and various effects, to the videogame context in which it is located. Conclusions Xiaolin Showdown is a title that is difficult to judge. Not so much for the quality of the product itself, all in all nice, considering that it fully manages to capture and recreate the typical atmosphere of the cartoon of the same name, but rather for the target to which it seems addressed. In fact, if you evaluate it with the ~eyes~ of a kid, or rather, of a fan, then the title in question is discreet, to the point of allowing you to overlook the defects beautifully. Conversely, looking at it from a different perspective, it appears perhaps a little too simplistic and repetitive in some points, not very playable in others, and therefore not suitable for a ~normal~ audience. Therefore, if you fall into the first category of users, easily add half a point more to the final grade. If not, check it out before any purchase or look elsewhere. Pros: Atmosphere faithful to the cartoon. Context-appropriate graphics. Cons: Sometimes repetitive. AI to review. Controls not very precise. The Xiaolin Showdown animated series is one of the most loved by American kids. Created by Christy Hui and produced by Warner Bros in 2003, this ~cartoon~, broadcast in Italy by Cartoon Network, is set in a magical and fantastic world, in which four young Shaolin monks fight against the forces of evil, while protecting ancient magical artifacts known as Shen Gong Wu by the ravenous claws of witches, wizards and thugs of every stripe. Elements, these, that we find verbatim in this PSP video game produced by Konami. In it, infacts, the player plays one of the four heroes of the animated series by selecting the favorite among the various Omi, Kimiko, Raimundo, and Clay, and guiding him throughout the adventure. The latter mainly consists in protecting the relics we were talking about a moment ago from the designs of Jack Spicer, a young evil genius, and Chase Young, an evil wizard with mystical powers, fighting ~one against all~ robots and other opponents, in areas similar to the arenas of Super Smash Bros. And it is precisely the latter title that Xiaolin Showdown seems technically inspired. In fact, its gameplay tends to emulate the concept of the battle royales of the Nintendo game, and therefore it is immediately fun in the first few bars. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say ~only in the first bars~. The title, in fact, after the initial enthusiasm aroused in the user by the dynamics of the clashes, shows some gaps such as to make the game almost withdraw into itself, making it gradually more and more monotonous. Already in itself the very concept of this type of product tends towards a certain repetitiveness, unless other external complementary factors are integrated into it, such as extra levels perhaps in a platform or driving style, to revive its playability.", "date": "2007-11-19", "grade": null}
