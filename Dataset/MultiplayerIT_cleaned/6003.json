Since then dozens of titles have followed, including ups and downs, based on existing or completely new franchises. The greatest success was undoubtedly the various Pokmon Mystery Dungeon, but it was the stand-alone titles such as those of the Shiren the Wanderer series, free from the confines of another brand, that expressed the maximum potential of such a niche genre. To play the Mystery Dungeons you need cojones of steel, strong nerves and a lot, a lot of patience. Coincidentally, they are more or less what it takes to play Etrian Odyssey too, especially at advanced difficulty levels: the Atlus signed series also belongs to the roguelike genre, but faces it from a different perspective, the first-person one of the historic Eye of the Beholder. So what would happen if the two brands became one? Etrian Mystery Dungeon is a winning cross-over and one of the best roguelikes out there A whole new odyssey The title itself is not very original, but in three words it tells you everything you need to know, and even more: Etrian Mystery Dungeon is a Mystery Dungeon set in the world of Etrian and, therefore, in the Etrian universe Odyssey. In a moment, if you know the two intellectual properties at least a little, you will understand that you will be wandering through randomly generated mazes, eliminating hordes upon hordes of increasingly fantasy monsters, rejoicing at each new loot or level up and carefully micromanaging a party of heroes from distinctly Japanese features. And in fact that's exactly what you do in Etrian Mystery Dungeon, and for no specific reason. Unlike the latest subtitled Untold iterations of Etrian Odyssey, in which it is possible to play following a real storyline, Etrian Mystery Dungeon catapults you into the adventure after a few minutes of play, without giving you any concrete explanation except in certain underground labyrinths of Aslarga there are some incredible treasures just waiting to be recovered. Point and stop. As the dungeons follow one another, a very subtle interweaving is revealed, but it is so light that little attention is paid to it, also because at that point one has already been sucked into the vortex of loot, leveling and strategy. In this sense, Etrian Mystery Dungeon pampers the player a bit. It allows him to create a party already at the beginning of the game that exceeds the limit of four characters that can be actively brought into the dungeons, choosing the gender and profession of each recruit of our fledgling guild. The members who stay on the bench level up together with those who fight even without lifting a finger, so that if the player suddenly decides to change his team, he doesn't find himself penalized and forced to ~grind~ the difference levels. There is also a bank in which to deposit objects that we do not need at the moment and which would only take up precious space in our bags, and the head of the guild of adventurers takes us by the hand and explains each new dynamic of the game to us, which is decidedly also useful for all Etrian Odyssey fans who have never played a Mystery Dungeon and who might feel a bit lost by the changes. After all, there's no map to draw on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS, and you don't explore the mazes in first person: the camera pans from above, and the party moves on an invisible (or visible, depending on your choice) at the same time as the enemies. You take a step, and they take a step. You attack them, and they probably attack you, and they do it in real time, almost like an old The Legend of Zelda where the AI controls the other three party members, except when you face the gigantic bosses at the end of the dungeon: at that point the team scatters across the battlefield and the fight takes place in turns as in a normal JRPG. If up to here it seems all in all clear and simple, it's because this is just the tutorial... The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect of Etrian Mystery Dungeon is not as incisive and engaging as that of the last Etrian Odyssey for Nintendo 3DS, but it is pleasant and highlights the menus and illustrations, giving depth to the scenarios shot from above. The hard life of the explorer Let's make one thing clear right away: Etrian Mystery Dungeon is an RPG developed with a specific goal, and that is to bring even the most tenacious of players to their knees. Veterans of Etrian Odyssey, once opened the profile of each character, will feel at home: they will recognize the elaborateto tree of skills that can be enhanced at each level up, spending the points you just earned, to improve those you already know or unlock new ones, active and passive, to be used while exploring dungeons to fight enemies or interact with characters. 'environment. To these are added the Blast skills which depend on a special indicator, which is filled by fighting and allows you to use very particular strategies, for example by ordering team members to scatter around the dungeon or giving the player the possibility to choose their individual actions for a certain number of turns. As if that weren't enough, during the exploration you have to be careful of everything, and not only the monsters, but also the invisible traps, the amber spots that recharge the TP and the hunger indicator which, once exhausted , slowly consumes the leader's life energy until it is killed. The first games are hit and run: you enter a dungeon, explore some floors to become familiar with the control system - indeed a bit complicated - and with the game dynamics, then you return to the city to refresh yourself and start over boss. The dungeons change layout with each entry, and the only way to ~lock down~ the map is to establish a fort on one of the already explored floors. The fort is not only used for this, however, but also to grow the characters on the bench faster, which we can put in his defense, and to slow down the DOE. The latter are the Mystery Dungeon version of Etrian Odyssey's FOE, very powerful optional bosses who roam the dungeons and go up one floor every time we go down one floor: without a fort to block their way, the DOE can reach the city and raze it to the ground, preventing us from using certain services until we have enough money to pay for its renovation. Defeating a DOE is far from easy, but Etrian Mystery Dungeon is not an ignorant RPG in which whoever does the most damage wins, but whoever thinks better: most of the skills of the various classes inflict anomalous states that can literally immobilize a target, preventing him from acting, and with a little healthy ~trial and error~ it is possible to nail any enemy, including bosses and DOEs. The alternative is a not entirely tragic end: there is no game over, in fact, but all the objects painstakingly earned up to that moment are lost, and in some cases one would prefer to die a slow and atrocious death. Etrian Mystery Dungeon can be frustrating in these situations, and if you don't proceed with lead feet you risk throwing the Nintendo 3DS against a wall. On the other hand, it's always the player's fault if they want to rush into a title where they don't need to. It must also be said that the loss of equipment is exacerbated by the fact that both the characters and the weapons they wield are visible in Etrian Mystery Dungeon, which establishes a form of visual and emotional bond between the player, the party he has painstakingly raised and the weapons he found by sweating the hell out of shirts. In this sense, in short, it is even more important than in the past to be patient, grow the characters in the right way, micromanage the inventory and skill shortcuts and study the bestiary to learn the weak points of each enemy, remembering to empty the inventory to unlock new items at the shop and by repeatedly visiting the locations in the city to undertake new missions, line your pockets and, little by little, conquer Aslarga and its labyrinths.", "date": "2015-10-01", "grade": "8.0"}
