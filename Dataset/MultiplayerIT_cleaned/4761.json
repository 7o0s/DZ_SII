Street Fighter X Tekken, Marvel Vs. Capcom or, to stay on the subject of role-playing games, the highly anticipated Kingdom Hearts III have shown that characters from different universes can easily coexist in the same video game and share mechanics and designs such as to bring them together and make them appear at first glance part of a single series. The strength of finding dozens and dozens of characters in the hands is strengthened when the artists strive to create common lines, skilfully outlining the models so that each protagonist is recognizable but, at the same time, well blended into the context. Artdink tries the jab with Accel World Vs. Sword Art Online, bringing an action RPG to the screens of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita that manages to have its interesting moments, facilitated in the task of merging the two series given the common origin coming from only mind, and pen, of Reki Kawahara. Bandai Namco then returns to the market with yet another title dedicated to Sword Art Online after Hollow Realization, however proposing a turning point in the game mechanics. Playstation 4 trophies Most of the Accel World Vs. Sword Art Online trophies are hidden and mostly relate to the story. Mission after mission you will unlock the rewards for each chapter reaching the end of the game with more than half of the trophies already completed. However, there are more difficult trophies to recover, which ultimately require hours upon hours of farming, with the need to bring a character to level 1000, reach the maximum level of skills or upgrade weapons from the blacksmith. Then there are titles to collect and missions to complete with a specific group. Perfectionists will thus find the necessary stimulus to stay on the title for many more hours, perhaps taking advantage of the new game plus mode. Straddling virtual worlds For Artdink, the excuse to bring the two series together turned out to be simpler than expected given that both Sword Art Online and Accel World essentially live in the same universe, simply located on the same timeline and deal with worlds engulfed by virtual reality. Despite what the title might suggest, the two universes will not collide but will have to collaborate with each other to find out what is happening on the Alfheim Online servers, leading to the union of the two realities with the characters of both series united under one aegis. The story does not reserve particular surprises and is not epic as one would expect from a Japanese RPG but having reached the umpteenth iteration, and with some forcing to unite the two universes, the result is still satisfactory. Sure, these are excessively repetitive but the narrative is still followed with pleasure. In fact, if you love the series, you must know that Accel World Vs. Sword Art Online differs heavily from the last chapters, focusing more on combat rather than mere exploration. Don't get us wrong, discovering new places and visiting the vast environments is still one of the main dictacts but the combat is the element that manages to keep the player's attention alive more than anything else. In fact, the game universe does not shine for its panoramas which, on the contrary, are very bare and devoid of any artistic talent, often bordering on sufficiency. Flying islands, ruined castles and ruined cities are still present but their realization leaves more than a few perplexities and if you are the least demanding from a graphic point of view, this title probably isn't for you. Even the enemies, in the same way, are generated continuously in large groups, more to hide a deficient artificial intelligence than for narrative reasons. In short, walking around the lands of Alfheim is not particularly exciting and to make the situation worse, you also need an inaccurate compass, with quests and indications for missions often deficient and without clearly visible objectives to be achieved. For some, this element could be a plus, but as mentioned, the downside is to get lost in settings that just can't convince. At the edge of the blade The combat system thus takes care of trying to patch it up, designed mainly to be performed in flight and aimed at aerial combinations between the members of the party, who always fight in groups of three. The peculiarity of the combat system is to be found in the very large number of active skills available to each character, with a control system that is probably not very immediate, but certainly designed to be assimilated after a few hours of practicetica. The rapid changes of direction, with the camera managed freely by the player, have never been problematic and even putting combos of ten or twelve skills in series is a function with natural execution going forward in the story. If the characters of Sword Art Online are almost all capable of flying, many of those of Accel World are instead anchored to the ground, with the exception of a mega jump between skills, which undoubtedly makes them more difficult to manage and without any real advantage compared to the corresponding roles present in the ~competitor~ series. Unfortunately, running with three party members at the same time you have to rely on artificial intelligence, which certainly does not shine with acumen, often leaving allies exposed to enemy attacks or not caring for us in times of extreme need. If during exploration this problem is not very incisive, during the battles against the bosses it emerges forcefully, often requiring you to jump quickly, manually, from one character to another in order to come out victorious. In order to really have fun with Accel World Vs. Sword Art Online, you can then think of dedicating yourself to online cooperative missions, accessible from the main HUB and able to make you fight together with other players against the bosses you have already faced. Here things get quite fun, with the limits imposed by the combat system, but without the thought of having to manage three characters at a time or the fear that one of them could take a devastating attack in the face without even realizing it. There is also a competitive mode but the balance, in this case, is not exactly successful. In short, after seeing how it works, you will hardly want to go back to it again. The game, not splendid, tries to have a spark when it comes to longevity thanks to its abundant thirty hours to complete the main campaign and a new game plus mode which, as always, allows you to restart the adventure while maintaining the level of your characters and equipment collected during your first game.", "date": "2017-07-25", "grade": "6.5"}
