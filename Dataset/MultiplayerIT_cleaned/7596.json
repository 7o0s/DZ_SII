Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Sport hunting has always been the protagonist of videogame transpositions which, however, hardly leave their mark. On the one hand there is perhaps the lack of commitment of the development teams who decide to create a deliberately niche product, on the other the fact that many people would not even touch a hunting game with a finger, for ethical reasons that go beyond whether or not to eat meat, but rather to conceive of killing an animal for entertainment. Putting these speeches aside, we think that this time it is appropriate to talk about the new Glu hunting game, simply because it is a fun, immediate and well done title. As well as free. Available for iOS and Android devices, Deer Hunter 2014 offers us three scenarios (Pacific Northwest, North Africa and British Columbia), with a fourth to be added soon, full of hunts to complete, tournaments and special events . Our alter ego can use a sniper rifle as his main weapon and reserve a more powerful alternative as a secondary weapon, thus accessing dozens of missions that revolve around the killing of one or more animals belonging to various species, from deer to wolves , from wolverines to goats, finally arriving at bears and elephants. Each stage basically has the same characteristics: in front of an uncontaminated landscape, our goal is to identify our target, place it in the viewfinder and open fire. More often than not, however, mere killing is not enough and you need to score precision shots to the heart or lungs, using infrared to identify these vital areas and changing position so that they are better exposed. Deer Hunter 2014 is a fun and beautiful looking hunting game, even if a bit easy and repetitive We are hunters Very simple, even trivial in its intentions, Deer Hunter 2014 has the great advantage of boasting a top-level realization not only as regards the technical sector, made up of detailed and fluid graphics, with luxuriant settings full of elements, as well as a particular attention to the animations of the prey (~dirtied~, unfortunately, by many episodes of polygonal interpenetration), but also the gameplay, which uses solid and concrete mechanics, thanks to a precise and reliable touch control system. The buttons on the screen are in fact few and well positioned: two arrows on the sides of the touch screen to change position in the scenario and rotate around the prey, a button to use the viewfinder and infrared (with an additional battery in case the charge ran out, which represents a first hint of the freemium nature of the title), with a lever to increase or decrease the zoom, and finally a key to open fire. When the target is in our reticle and we pull the trigger, a spectacular ~bullet time~ shows us the path of the bullet from the gun barrel to the prey. Furthermore, in some situations, the killing of two or more animals requires a ~flying~ fire technique, to be used, for example, against a wolf that notices our presence and charges us with not exactly friendly intentions. The freemium dynamics, in addition to the aforementioned infrared battery, are revealed in the presence of an energy bar which limits the duration of our games, even if it recharges rather quickly, and in various facets concerning the upgrading of weapons, an aspect of the very well done game but a little too ~piloted~ to take on the connotations of a feature capable of arousing real interest.", "date": "2013-09-28", "grade": "7.8"}
