There are several party games of the same type that boast exceptional quality and manage to entertain a lot, primarily those made by Nintendo, but in this case the situation is quite different. Jackass minigames, in fact, often struggle to involve for one reason or another: some are too short, others too simple, still others are cumbersome. And the rough technical realization doesn't help. Ultimately, we are dealing with a product that has many points in common with the TV show from which it is based: you can like it or not, with very few in between. Pros: ~Target~ structure Very faithful to the transmission Thirty-five minigames ... Cons: ... all too short and lacking depth Technically just enough Not long-lived Jackass: The Game is available for Nintendo DS, PSP and PlayStation 2. The version tested is the one for PlayStation 2. Born a few years ago as an amateur product, Jackass has been able to carve out its own space in the MTV television schedule, has even landed in cinemas and now also finds a transposition into video games for PlayStation 2, PSP and Nintendo DS. Probably the success of such an ~on the edge~ transmission lies in its own absurdity, in creating amusing situations even where there would be very little to laugh about. A politically incorrect, scurrilous and irreverent show, therefore, which can now be recreated thanks to Jackass: The Game. Are they stupid or are they crazy? The start screen of the game shows us the available modes: the story, the challenge and the multiplayer. It goes without saying that the ~story~ mode is the one that encompasses the bulk of the action and boasts a ~target~ structure: you try your hand at the seven available episodes by tackling them one at a time, with the next one unlocking only once you've scraped together a certain amount of money. Each episode contains four or five different activities, each with objectives to be achieved so that it can be said to be ~completed~. To give a practical example, we will have to try our hand at a very dangerous race on the roof of a skyscraper, aboard shopping trolleys. In this case the objectives are simple and concern the total distance that you manage to cover with each attempt, while to win you just have to stop after your opponent, obviously without falling off the building... Not all activities require the presence of someone from beat, however: at some point you'll have to roll a snowball in for a downhill slope, and the objectives will be to ~swallow~ a certain number of skiers and snowmobiles, as well as to destroy some wooden houses. Either way, success in minigames translates into earning money that can make access to the next episode possible. The minigame fair Jackass: The Game is a collection of thirty-five minigames, therefore. It is not possible to access the more advanced games without having first thoroughly experienced those available immediately, this is due to the ~achievement~ structure previously mentioned: you necessarily have to practice with everything that the game has to offer, possibly focusing on the more enjoyable disciplines at the expense of the less successful ones. It is clear that much of the fun comes from a visual factor: the characters on the screen behave in a very faithful way to the real ~conductors~ of Jackass, and the situations that are shown are so bizarre that they get more than a smile. All this is not reflected in the playability, however, given that the simplest minigames do not go beyond the continuous pressure of a button, while the more complex ones even appear cumbersome and find it difficult to involve. Completing each episode and setting new records in the various disciplines results in the unlocking of minigames within the challenge mode, as well as the availability of new characters and new outfits. Finally, multiplayer allows us to face some specialties in competition with a human opponent. Technical realization It's sad to think that the development teams currently working on PlayStation 2 don't put the achievement of certain technical results first, despite the fact that the machine they have to work on is now an open book and has shown us some amazing things. Going into the specifics of Jackass: The Game, we have graphics that on the one hand faithfully reproduce the protagonists of the show, also from the point of view of animations, on the other it is based on a mo~dancer~, which never fails to guarantee a stable frame rate and which offers a mediocre level of detail. As for the sound, we have a series of dialogues interpreted by the characters of the show (subtitled in Italian) and a certain number of ~signed~ songs in the background, mainly from the usual punk genre. The control system varies for each discipline: there are rhythm game-style tests in which you simply have to press certain buttons in rhythm, while in other contexts we will have to control the movement of the character with the left analog stick, as in action games. The response to the inputs is quick and precise in all cases, apart from the ~musical~ sections, in which the pressure of the buttons must be anticipated slightly for the intervention to be intercepted correctly.", "date": "2007-10-25", "grade": null}
