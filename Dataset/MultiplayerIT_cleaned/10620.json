Published by nGmoco, Rolando 2: Quest for the Golden Orchid maintains the characteristics of its predecessor by improving the graphics sector and relying on a more refined software with the aim of enhancing the superb sensitivity of the internal accelerometer of the iPhone. Not mentioning a great inspiration towards the LocoRoco phenomenon for Psp would be a heresy given that every detail recalls the Sony brand, even if Rolando can count on some additions of depth and particularly spot-on gameplay. In fact, the protagonists of the game are roundish beings just waiting to be transported from one part of each level to another, trying to fulfill all the additional tasks present in each stage. In fact, three medals are ready to be won as long as you achieve the objectives based on the number of Rolandos rescued, the amount of diamonds collected and the time used to reach the final door. In addition, it is possible to find special golden idols, exploit them as artifacts and use them as objects for teleportation towards the end of the path. In Rolando 2, however, life is not always easy since in most cases, passing the level is subject to the solution of some puzzles, to be solved by exploiting the number of Rolandos and their peculiar abilities. Rolando' style In fact, the diversification of the skills of the Rolandos is very good, given that the little beings can count on some innate abilities linked to physical factors. For example, some of the protagonists scale any type of wall without problems, or the Rolandos of the royal family manage to open every door that appears in front of them. Going through the 50 levels available, the player will come across many other unique prerogatives, ready to be used to the fullest in a stimulating way. Not to mention the possibility of choosing whether to control one or more Rolandos at a time simply with a touch of a touch; not a small feature given that the solution of managing each Rolando independently or creating teams amplifies the depth of the gameplay and above all the complexity of the quests to overcome. The transition from Rolando to Rolando 2 is visible thanks to the use of 3D in this second episode. Colourful, lively and never visually boring, Rolando 2 boasts a really well-crafted graphics engine with particular attention to the characterization of the Rolandos and their impact on the environment: the chubby ones, for example, move more slowly and sink to the bottom in the water while the lighter ones float but cannot move some details of the seabed. The faces of the protagonists themselves are also very inspired, nice in all their expressions and without a shadow of a doubt so placid as to attract even the skeptics. The audio tracks are convincing, always in line with the trait designed for Rolando 2: Quest for the Golden Orchid and in many cases particularly pressing. The developers of Hand Circus have not included alternative game modes but have seen fit to exploit the network connection by establishing a sort of global challenge between players, giving the possibility to connect to dedicated servers and challenge friends and not in every level present in the story principal. Furthermore, support for the Push service has been guaranteed, including sounds, alerts and badges.", "date": "2009-07-17", "grade": "8.0"}
