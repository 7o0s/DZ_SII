By promoting the saying ~the winning team does not change~, this second chapter of our review does not in the least hint at distorting the formula of the predecessor, rather aiming to please the fans with a new batch of levels to be faced in the role of feline protagonists. The negligible narrative device in this case is the invasion of the world by some tin soldiers that evidently only our kittens are able to fight: as often happens in the mobile sector, it is a mere pretext to give as soon as possible the start to the action, which once again refers to the 16-bit platform of the time but with a strong eye for a tailor-made control system on touch devices. Gameplay and controls Continuing on the path taken up by the prequel, Super Cat Tales 2 refuses to fill the screen with virtual keys, focusing everything on the most extreme simplicity: therefore, the inputs that the user must physically impart on the display are only those of pressing on the right side or left of the device to move the kitten in the relevant direction and double tap to make it run. The rest is all delegated to the excellent game design work of Neutronized: the jumps are made automatically by sprinting towards the edge of a platform, while hitting the vertical surfaces you get the result of destroying the temporary ones and climbing the unbreakable ones. In this very simple system, variety is safeguarded by the different abilities of the eight protagonist felines that are progressively unlocked during the adventure: there is one capable of eliminating enemies with a charge, one capable of swimming against the current and so on, and switching between them only requires opening a dedicated menu by tapping the icon in the upper left corner of the screen. In addition to this, Super Cat Tales 2 also adds the element of a slot in which to assign one of the many items offered for sale in the appropriate shop and which guarantee certain bonuses. In doing so, Neutronized highlights even more a feature that had already been appreciated in the first chapter, namely the need to retrace one's steps in order to collect all the collectibles offered by the various levels. Few of the three bells hidden in each stage are in fact obtainable on the first visit, while the vast majority require the skills of the kittens unlocked later or the help of objects worth several hundred coins. Potential longevity undoubtedly gains from this dynamic, but it must also be said that Neutronized seems to have overplayed an aspect that will not necessarily appeal to all players. The same goes for the control system that we described at the beginning, objectively very simple but which on more than a few occasions makes you feel the lack of a more classic model that guarantees greater control over the movements of the kittens. These are, in fact, the only variables that can influence the satisfaction of a product which, for the rest, carries out its work in an impeccable manner. The level design maintains a constant quality throughout the (long, considering that we are talking about 100 stages) duration of the adventure, the difficulty is well balanced and the technical implementation can count on graphics that preserve the retro style of the prequel but improve it underneath all aspects, while the sound shows off very convincing chiptune music. Dulcis in fundo, the free to play formula is exploited honestly, with advertisements that can be deactivated upon payment of a heavy tax and in-app purchases useful for simplifying life but not essential to continue.", "date": "2018-10-11", "grade": "7.9"}
