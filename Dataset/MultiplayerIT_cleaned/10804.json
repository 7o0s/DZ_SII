{"name": "Unit 77 a rapporto!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/elite-forces-unit-77-recensione.html", "text": "Elite Forces is a title that seems to come from another era, from the years before polygons: same feeling, same brutality towards the player. The project is all European, to be exact all Spanish, given that both the producer (Gammick) and the developer (Abylight) are Iberian. Although Abylight was created recently, in 2004, the four founders (Nacho Garcia, Alberto Gonzalez, Daniel Lopez and Ricardo Fernndez) boast projects for NES, SNES and even Spectrum in their curriculum: it is therefore not surprising that Elite Forces, first console game after a long time spent developing on mobiles, has a retro vibe. Four soldiers to defend the earth The introduction, both narratively and visually, leaves us rather dumbfounded: a sequence of digital illustrations, with an oscillating quality between amateur and professional, shows the kidnapping, by an unspecified international terrorist group, of eminent intellectuals and excellent scientific personalities. Naturally (?) this terrible rat poses a threat to world security, and, equally naturally, a team of only four soldiers is sent to avert the danger. The incipit lives up to Bush's best orations, which would suggest the worst, but fortunately it soon leaves room for action, definitely the best (and most important) part of the game. The adventure develops in its entirety with a slightly overhead view, which, although at the beginning it may suggest a partial proximity to the RTS, over time it strengthens the link between Elite Forces and the old action games of the 80s. The control system is completely focused on the use of the Touch Screen, so much so that the buttons are used only on a few occasions and, above all, in combination with the stylus (to activate a secondary weapon, for example). Touching a specific area of the screen moves the character to that point, while, if you drag the stylus, you get more direct control, similar to what you would have with an analog stick, associated with the one admired in The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. In general, the control system works more than decently, however there are some slight inaccuracies, annoying in situations (few, fortunately) in which it is required to pass through small paths and, above all, when it is necessary to defuse explosives, an action that is not rarely and through no fault of the player, it ends with the involuntary activation of the mine. Artificial intelligence Each of the four members of the team is equipped with a shotgun with infinite ammo, which, while limiting strategy, on the other catalyzes immediacy and action, qualities more appropriate to an action game like Elite Forces, which, rather than falling in trivial contaminations, he does without it completely. To shoot, all you have to do is touch the desired enemy with the stylus, a process that works fairly well, if it weren't for the rare but annoying inaccuracies mentioned above. The four members of the team have, probably but fortunately, also qualities that make them unique (only one, for example, can see and defuse mines). This component of the game, absolutely necessary, however, has not been developed in the best way, both because the possible puzzles that it could have originated are few and rather predictable, and because, unfortunately, the military controlled by the CPU behave in an absurd way. The unselected soldiers, one or three, follow the controlled one in single file, and also help to shoot, but they do not do it on their own initiative or autonomously, they only follow the initiatives of the momentary leader: during a firefight, therefore, the player he is forced, in order for all the members to survive (the death of a single component entails the end of the mission), to continuously change the controlled character. An easy way to solve (or rather, mask) the problem would have been multiplayer, online or offline, which unfortunately is completely absent from the game. Old school We have already reiterated several times that, for thematics and immediacy, Elite Forces seems to be extrapolated from an NES cartridge; the factor that most unites it to the action games of the 80s, however, is the ruthlessness of the save system. The game itself isn't very difficult, but deaths are frequent and often involve repeating an entire mission. Within a level there are very few save points, and the fact that enemies suddenly emerge from underground (the radar seems to mock the player rather than have any use) force memorizing the map as it happened, appanointed, back in the days of the NES. This feature, like it or not, also increases the longevity of the game, which otherwise would have been quite low. Technically Abylight has done a decent job, although not particularly sophisticated, in line with the rest of the production: the worst part is represented by the artwork which, as pointed out at the beginning, sometimes have rather gross defects and consequently appear almost amateurish.", "date": "2009-03-22", "grade": "6.0"}
