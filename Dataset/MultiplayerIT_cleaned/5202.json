The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition, in fact, includes the base game updated graphically through a series of high resolution textures, new particle effects such as volumetric light rays, new shaders for snow and water and a higher quality depth of field. All corroborated by the support for mods, which, albeit with certain limitations, is an addition that should guarantee access to many of the best modifications from the huge list of those released on PC (the famous Frostfall is available on Xbox One), the presence of all the separately released expansions in the past, i.e. Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn and some of the minor ~historical~ bugs of the original game. But let's proceed in order. TES V: Skyrim - Special Edition is the best available on console despite some flaws The Eater of Worlds The main story is set in the cold region of Skyrim, northern province of Tamriel, two hundred years after the events of Oblivion. During the year 201 of the Fourth Era, a terrible civil war breaks out in the country due to the assassination of Torygg, King of Kings, at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak. The latter has always refused to disavow a cult that is very important to his people, and also aims to make Skyrim independent. But the fratricidal war is nothing compared to the terrible threat that looms in the background, linked to a ~character~ known as the Eater of Worlds. The game begins with Ulfric, some of his men and the protagonist, captured by mistake with the rioters and summarily sentenced to death, who are led aboard two carts into the courtyard of the town of Helgen. It is right there that, once off, the user can customize his alter ego by choosing his name, race and gender with the classic physical editor that offers several possible combinations. This is an important moment because there are no classes in the game, and the choice of race becomes fundamental because each species then has particular bonuses, from resistance to poison to the ability to breathe underwater, which then lead to certain powers that can be used once a day. Each character also has 18 skills that increase with their use, and that level up by adding up to the experience accumulated by completing missions and killing enemies, plus many other parameters to ~cultivate~ with patience and attention. In this sense, the gamer has the freedom to have his character ~specialize~ in the style he prefers to face the game. However, once their choices are made, the action restarts and leads the group to the point where they are to be executed. But just before the execution, a black dragon appears in the sky and sets fire to the area, allowing the hero to escape and start a very long adventure to try to find out who and why is bringing the dragons back to life , believed to be extinct for years, in an attempt to drive them back to where they came from. As for the gameplay, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition obviously does not intend to distort the play system of the original title, or to modify it. The gamer then finds the exact same adventure of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, with a huge world to explore populated by hundreds of characters divided into different factions and guided by their own interests, who live in the different areas available on the map. You can interact with these individuals for a thousand reasons, even to obtain dozens and dozens of primary and secondary missions. On the other hand, the settings are very varied and full of surprises, both in terms of level design and characterization, and therefore there is something to get lost for hours and hours often without a break in continuity just for the sake of exploring, observing, discovering. Because in the world of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition there is always the feeling that something new can be found. Indeed, to be honest in most cases it is easy to come across scripted situations and scenes that tell small and big stories, which perhaps will not always be used to progress in the main adventure, but certainly make the experience complete, vast and fascinating underneath every punt of sight. Much of the time is clearly spent fighting every type of creature imaginable in never trivial battles, where physics has its importance on the heaviness of the blows and on the activation times of the spells, where the weight of the effort in casting them is perceived. Especially when weapons and spells are used together, including Shouts (the protagonist is a Dragonborn or Dovahkiin, the deadliest hunter of these flying beasts), a form of arcane magic, without the need to interrupt the latter, to the full advantage of rhythm and fluidity. Or by taking advantage of the deep crafting system to do practically anything and everything. In short, as a game in itself, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition remains the great title that we have all come to know, net of its defects, and therefore ~the same~. Playstation 4 trophies There are 76 Trophies offered by the main adventure of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition, plus another 25 unlockable from the three DLCs included in the collection. As in the original versions, they can be obtained by completing certain primary and secondary missions, or by satisfying certain requests such as absorbing a certain number of dragon souls, buying a specific artifact, starting a family or entering the Academy of Winterhold, and so on. The world of Skyrim Where instead The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition differs from the original is in the technical system. In this sense, the game betrays its old-gen nature, and does not reach peaks of absolute excellence such as to leave the player speechless or to show a true generational leap. Of course, we always talk about a product with several years on its back, but in our opinion a little more could have been done, especially in terms of optimizations. In any case, from a visual point of view, the title still manages to ~satisfy~ due to a cleaner and more defined image at native 1080p compared to the original edition on consoles at 720p, as well as for the care in recreating from a point of view from an artistic point of view, a living and credible world, capable of offering breathtaking views, thanks also to an excellent management of the new particle effects and lights. The environmental ones, when outdoors, offer for example changes of color and intensity depending on the point of observation and the time of day, with a day/night cycle that takes place in a realistic and ~soft~ way, i.e. without clean breaks. Then when atmospheric effects such as rain, snow or the mist typical of snow-covered areas or forests rich in humidity intervene, perhaps at dawn, an almost magical atmosphere is often created, which contributes greatly to immersing the player in this diverse fantasy world. The dynamic depth of field, the good detail of the vegetation, the reflection effects or the contemporary number of particles rendered on the screen at once, in short, do their duty without making one cry for a miracle. To tell the truth, there are some flaws that seem to highlight a lack of cleanliness and finishing in certain elements: many of the textures that cover the objects in the open spaces, once approached, denote for example a certain lack of detail, and even in this re-edition there are several bugs that we observed years ago in the original game. So it still happens, despite two official optimization patches released on day one (1.01 and 1.02), to see characters who penetrate a table as if nothing had happened, or who literally disappear for a fraction of a second from a point to reappear a little further on , as if the game ~skipped~ the passage of movement and positioning of a subject from point A to point B. All elements that obviously do not affect the correct use of the game, but which clash considering the fact that after five years problems such as these shouldn't even show up, and which denote a certain ~laziness~ on the part of Bethesda in getting their hands on his creature to the end to optimize it to 100%. It almost seems that the software house has limited itself in this sense to the homework, ~cleaning up~ the bulk and visible, and neglecting the rest. In any case, the frame rate at 30 frames per second was fortunately good and, on the PlayStation 4 version we tested, it was quite stable for most of the time, except for one or two slight slowdowns that occurred in as many moments of adventure; for the record, we also ran into an annoying freeze once that forced us to restart during a dialogue, even if it didn't happen again on the second try. Only discreet, however, the modeling of human bodies, which show a certain underlying stiffness in facial expressions, whatinevitable given that basically they are the same as five years ago covered with slightly more refined textures, like the rest of their animations, which appear for the most part a bit woody and approximate, as if they lacked key points in the movements. However, this does not prevent the player from playing without too many regrets in the third person, except in dungeons or interiors, where it is more convenient to use the first-person view so as not to miss the smaller objects scattered here and there. As for the loads, they remain frequent when entering or leaving certain locations, but fortunately the times are shorter than in the past. The audio sector is excellent, especially the soundtrack, which has always been one of the distinctive features of the titles of the saga, which is reconfirmed here as one of the flagships of the whole game. But more generally all the sound works, at least on PlayStation 4, including effects and dubbing which is completely in Italian and offers a good level of acting, which in some points reaches quite high levels, at least for the main voices . The acting, in these cases, is almost always valid in terms of intensity and tone to the point of giving greater emotional strength to the personality of the various characters, and consequently making them more ~alive~.", "date": "2016-10-29", "grade": "8.0"}
