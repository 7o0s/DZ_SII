The spaceship he is on seems to have been attacked by unknown forces, and the dark corridors now devoid of electric light roam zombies, menacing androids and all sorts of hostile creatures. Our goal will therefore be to explore the ship, find out what happened and maybe survive long enough to escape, taking any other people who escaped the attack with us. The prerogatives of D.A.R.K., the latest Chillingo product for iOS platforms, appear very clear right from the start, when the introductory sequences give the impression that the developers have done a great deal of direction and direction. The feeling of being faced with something more than the average mobile game, however, gradually diminishes and situations that are too similar to each other begin to follow one another, with the gameplay failing to go beyond a few small illuminations. Indeed, the adventure elements turn out to be limited and ends in themselves: the protagonist sometimes has to operate switches, open doors, collect keys or perhaps interact with another character, but the practical realization of these moments is too simplistic to be able to speak of real riddles. They come out the fucking walls! The structure of D.A.R.K., after an initial phase deliberately devoid of great emotions because it is set up as a sort of tutorial, therefore presents itself as a continuous alternation between exploratory sessions and fights. Unfortunately, the two things don't coexist: when enemies appear in the scenario, generally a wave made up of a certain number, the game warns us and our character goes into offensive mode. Likewise, we are notified when the fight ends. This is an inexplicable solution in many ways, given that it reduces almost to zero the chances of suddenly being faced with monsters to face, or in the context of a battle it reveals to us when the opponents are finished and therefore we no longer have to expect surprises. From one phase to another the controls also change, but marginally: the virtual stick on the left of the touch screen, which is used to move the space marine, is joined by a second one on the right which determines the trajectory of the fire. A little higher up, a third touch button allows us to perform a quick lateral swerve, an evasive maneuver which, however, we have never had to resort to. The setting is therefore that of shooters with a top view, which however does not go well with the rich arsenal that we will be able to access by spending the money earned around the ship. The protagonist can in fact be enhanced in terms of strength and resistance, and his equipment can count on various devastating weapons: a shotgun, a flamethrower, a heavy machine gun and more that will complement the service rifle. However, opening fire with a weapon that fires cadenced shots using the control system implemented by the developers proves to be an unedifying, quite cumbersome and inaccurate experience. The semi-automatic aiming system helps in this sense not to waste ammunition, but does not solve the problem completely. Finally, the presence of very small magazines and ammunition that must be purchased from time to time puts us in the position of preferring the default weapon to all the others, for a simple matter of practicality: the bursts are better directed and the bullets are infinite. . The technical sector, on the other hand, is almost flawless, in the end the best aspect of this production, the one that most of all places it above the average of the titles available on the App Store. The graphics of D.A.R.K. it is in fact very well done, fluid, with a large number of polygons on the screen and even a good variety of scenarios (which is anything but easy to achieve, when the location is that of a spaceship).
