How many titles based on the Star Wars license have we seen and how many of these have turned out to be valid? Few, too few. Knights of the Old Republic thought about it to reverse a trend that was getting really worrying. In fact, the Bioware game managed to convince everyone, enthusiasts and newbies, thanks to its underlying goodness due to the care that the developers put into creating the product. From that moment on it seems that something has changed and that Lucas Arts itself no longer wants so many titles based on the famous saga, but rather fewer but high quality games. With this ~burden~ on their shoulders, Pandemic Studios set to work to create Battlefront: it had to be set in Lucas' infinite universes but, above all, it had to convince, it had to exploit all the possibilities offered by the Saga. The environments, the vehicles, the characters had to be functional to the game they wanted to create: the war between the factions, on a large scale. Now that we have the game in hand, or rather on the console, it is time to pull the strings and verify if the work of the coders has actually given the desired results. The game differs decisively if played in multiplayer via Xbox Live or if played only in single campaign and for this reason we will analyze these two aspects separately. In the single game we will be able to choose which challenge to start: the Historical Campaign or the Galactic Conquest. Choosing the first mode we will immediately be asked in which era we want to start, having the possibility to choose between the Clone War and the Galactic Civil War. Once started, all we have to do is win all the battles proposed to move forward, in strict chronological order and unlock all the extras present. Between the various missions there is always an interlude taken from the films of the saga which tries to increase the level of immersion in the game, rather low in this mode mainly due to the excessive linearity and poor cohesion between the various missions. After all, the storyline of the films could not be changed. The second game option, however, provides for the Galactic Conquest, much more interesting and more engaging. The player will have to immediately choose which side to fight for between the Empire, the Rebels, the Republic and the CIS. After making the choice, you will have to decide which planet to attack, obviously trying to conquer, in line with the objective of the mode, as many planets as possible. To conquer each world it is necessary to win confrontations with the enemy on two different battlefields, and in the end the territory will be ours. After defeating the opponent, the planet guarantees the player a bonus that can be used to increase our offensive capacity (we only tell you that it is possible to deploy Darth Vader on the battlefield ...). Whoever of the two sides conquers the planet keeps the initiative and has the right to choose which area to attack. After conquering at least four planets it will be possible to use special weapons, in addition to other unlockable bonuses, which are particularly effective and devastating: does the Death Star tell you anything? It alone is capable of destroying an entire celestial body. The aim of the game is to annihilate enemies on the battlefield Is strength synonymous with greatness or is it a thorn in the side? Star Wars Battlefront is presented as a first-person or third-person shooter, depending on the user's choice. The aim of the game is to annihilate the enemies on the battlefield and, to do this, it is important to deprive them of the ability to obtain supplies. How to do it? Simple, just gain control of the Command Posts. The reinforcements of the various armies will arrive in these locations, so once they have fallen into enemy hands they can no longer be used to obtain new troops. It is therefore obvious to understand that the fewer Command Posts the opponent has, the easier it is to defeat. The whole game revolves around this concept. To conquer these areas it is sufficient to approach and control, together with other fellow soldiers, the area for some time. In the event that you are killed, in a few seconds the map is re-proposed which clearly indicates the respawn areas, coinciding with the command posts, and you can choose your favorite one: close to enemy lines, in the middle of the battlefield or in the rear perhaps to take control of a fast speeder bike. In addition to this choice, the player will have to decide which unit to impersonate, each with its own peculiar characteristics, which not only vary within the same army, but also vary with respect to other deployments: forsimplify we could group them all into five categories: soldiers, stormtroopers, pilots, snipers and a special class that has no counterpart in other armies. On the battlefield we will be able to guide our men with simple commands such as the call to action or to stop near strategic places. Surely, however, the most useful and exciting is the one that allows you to order bots to follow us, effective and exciting (it seems to be a general escorted by troops) that allows unmatched offensive sorties. The other truly remarkable aspect is the presence, in the various battlefields, each with its own characteristics perfectly replicated by the cinematic versions, of the various war vehicles. From the aforementioned speeder bikes, to AT-ATs, spider droids and various fighter jets. All controllable and absolutely deadly, if mastered properly. The massive presence of bots on the screen makes the battles truly engaging and exciting, but it is a pity that their artificial intelligence is not exactly top-notch. Sure, they number in quantity, but unfortunately more than sometimes the soldiers ~go around in circles~, not only on foot but also with vehicles, as if they weren't on a battlefield. The incompetent or panicked soldier also exists in reality, but the problem is that sometimes in the game this aspect is exceeded, compromising its realism. Massively Multiplayer The long presentation of the single-player game allowed us to describe it in every aspect, but we can't forget how much Star Wars Battlefront is devoted to online play. In fact, up to 16 players can challenge each other on the Xbox Live servers and we guarantee that the experience is truly rewarding. The impression of being on a battlefield is very high, furthermore, together with the players, a fair number of bots will thicken the ranks of their respective armies. In the online game, however, due to their smaller number, the ~deficiencies~ that we have analyzed before related to their A.I. they fail and, by giving the right orders, it will be possible to command a small squadron even if we were Darth Vader himself. Never like this time ~it's good to play together~ Massively Multiplayer The game maps are very well done and, much more than in the single game, it will be necessary to know them perfectly, to avoid possible ambushes and indeed to make the most of the natural defenses. The combat vehicles in the game via Xbox Live are essential and can turn the tide of battles, when used in the right way. Apart from some maps where there is only one chance to win the battle, in the vast majority of them it is possible to win by choosing opposite tactics. It is useless then to remember the emotion that it gives to fight together with your army by giving orders to the other players or asking for help to conquer a damned command post. Never like this time ~it's good to play together~. From a technical point of view, the game is well done in every detail: from the polygonal models, to the animations of the characters, not to mention the really well-studied maps. In single player mode the game runs smoothly without uncertainties while in our numerous online games we have often encountered the presence of lag, even if it varies depending on the host connection and connection time, which unfortunately damages the normal functioning of the game . We hope they increase the available servers as soon as possible. Comment Star Wars Battlefront impressed us well and, although some small flaws, found especially in the single-player mode, damage the Pandemic Studios product a bit, we are in the presence of a title that does justice to the charm of the Star Wars saga. The online experience definitely enriches the game and does it in such a meaningful way as to make us define it, if played only in offline mode, as missing a fundamental component. This is anything but a criticism, but serves to indicate how the online player will be much more satisfied, more satisfied and conquered by the stellar battles. Precisely for this reason our final vote will have to be increased by half a point if you have an Xbox Live subscription, given that it is one of the most engaging online experiences available on the Microsoft console. Battlefront is a successful game capable of guaranteeing many hours of fun. Whether you're a Star Wars fan or not, don't miss it. Pros Perfect Lucasian setting Technically well done Online game at the highest levels but Cons sometimes presence of lag Artificial intelligence of bots to be reviewed Star factions Rebels Led by Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia fight cowithin the oppressive imperial power. The Empire Led by the ruthless Darth Vader imposes terror and its terrible laws throughout the galaxy. The Republic The order established before the galactic civil war, is defended by the Jedi knights together with the clone army. CIS The army of droids used by separatists in continuous fight against the republic. Battlefront on PS2 by Antonio ~Tanzen~ FucitoThe Sony console version of Star Wars: Battlefronts shares the same strengths and weaknesses of the Xbox counterpart, with the necessary exceptions: on the one hand we have a single player weakened by a level of difficulty that is too low and by an artificial not exactly ~intelligent~, on the other hand a multiplayer (also online, 16 players on PS2, 24 on Xbox) of excellent workmanship, engaging, with a good number of maps and offensive solutions. Technically the work done by Pandemic Studios is commendable, if we exclude the proverbial mediocre graphics cleaning of PS2 and a fluctuating frame rate in the higher game maps. Recommended for multiplayer lovers and of course Star Wars fans. The ingredients are all there: capable programmers and with a title like Full Spectrum Warrior as a calling card, the Star Wars universe as a setting and the captivating game genre in itself: mass guerrilla warfare. A dish composed in this way cannot be something in between, it is either a good game or the disappointment is destined to be even more burning for what it could have been but was not.
