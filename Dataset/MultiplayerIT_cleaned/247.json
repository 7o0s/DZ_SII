{"name": "Viva Pinata - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viva-pinata-recensione.html", "text": "Love Dance! Mating takes place via a mini-game, which is different for each animal species. Once two creatures have fallen in love, it will be the player's task to guide the male towards the female in a labyrinth, framed from above, bordered by bombs that explode on contact. The difficulty is that each Pinata walks in a different way, often skidding vertiginously, and that the mazes are increasingly complex. After so many contacts, the male gives up and the couple explodes! Green thumb Viva Pinata owes more than a vague inspiration to games like Populus and, above all, to the genius Will Wright's Sims. We are asked, in fact, to cover the role of an aspiring gardener who, at the beginning, has land little bigger than a handkerchief, all covered with shrubs and rubble, which prevent plants and grass from growing freely. Armed with a spade and a watering can, and guided by a kind helper, the first task is to level, till the soil and sow the first tender grass. The first animals, small caterpillars, begin to appear timidly. Thanks to a somewhat tangled menu and too many lines of text (almost the paranoid attempt to make a game that can become really complex immediately clear), it is possible to know exactly which characteristics of the terrain have attracted the creatures; what requirements are necessary for them to settle on our property; and finally, what needs to be done for them to fall in love and reproduce. Right from the start, a real emotional bond is created with these little creatures, made in a surprising way, so much so that it is instinctive to cuddle, feed and give them a name. The irreverent nature of the game is immediately shown with the arrival of new animals, in our case, the very tender pigeons. From the beginning, a real emotional bond is created with these little creatures, made in a surprising way Green thumb A quick glance at the characteristics necessary for their mating puts us in front of a terrible truth: to fall in love, pigeons must eat the worms that we have grown with so much love. From then on, Viva Pinata is an explosion of possible combinations, of seeds to plant and water, of experiments to try, each of which leads to new species and new struggles. Because foxes are delicious, for example, but they devour rabbits, whose house we have built with so much effort, and which we have seen grow with irresistible movements. And then you have to build fences and fences, which, however, will be useless against the predators that arrive from the sky and against the evil Pinatas, all red and unmanageable, which will begin to damage our lives, attracted by so much movement. Each species successfully attracted, each plant cultivated, and each progress lead to the accumulation of chocolate money and experience points which increase our skills with ever new powers and which guarantee us an ever larger garden, where we can build houses and facilities to house new animals. The game, among other things, is dotted with a dozen absurd supporting characters, including guardians, gardeners' helpers, beggars and shopkeepers, who sell everything: fruit, seeds and fertilizers, with which to indulge oneself to discover new things. Until the screen bursts with events and clashes between incompatible pinatas, underlined by continuous audio-visual signals, which can disorient those very little players to whom Viva Pinata seems to be aimed in the first place, but which will not fail to excite all those who they'll want to try and conquer every single creature hidden beneath the surface of the DVD. Central pinata In the background of the game, there is Pinata Central, a center for collecting animals, which ships them to birthday parties all over the world. At regular intervals, the player will be asked to deliver certain types of Pinatas to the factory and in a narrow time interval. The reward in money and experience is succulent, but it involves increasingly demanding requests and increasingly difficult time limits to meet Long-term... Each Pinata can be dressed up with a thousand gadgets. The garden can be embellished with dozens of objects, from torches to fountains, to toys to entertain the animals during the day. Planting the unidentified seeds gives a genuine sense of adventure, which culminates in the many plants that grow and which, sometimes, bear fruit necessary for the arrival of new creatures. Precisely this sensation of wonder guides much of the fun one experiences by playing Viva Pinata, which, however, remains a management game and which may not appeal to those players who find themselves uncomfortable faced with dozens of choices to make over a period of few moments. Pressedfrom foxes that eat rabbits, bees that pester spiders, nasty pinatas that infest the garden and that bloody deer that just doesn't want to get out of the woods and come pay a visit to our beautiful grounds. Luckily, you can also have fun by progressing more slowly, carefully pondering the choices, and changing the shape of your property several times, or, more simply, enjoying the delightful graphics. The online mode, unfortunately, is a bit too limited, since it only allows you to send boxes to contacts on your friends list. These boxes, not necessarily, must contain welcome gifts, but they can also house the evil Pinatas properly captured and packaged. We really feel the lack of a way that allows us to go and visit the gardens of our friends, perhaps exchanging objects, advice, or even just to have a chat on the sunny days of Pinata Island, which can be really delicious. Long-term... Paper Animals Pinatas are paper animals, stuffed with candy, that are tied up and beaten at birthday parties, mostly overseas. Rare, with what seems to be an evolution of Conker's Fur Shading on Xbox and Star Fox Adventure on Cube, has managed to make this universe colorful in a delightful and unique way. A few moments of play are enough to be enchanted and to find yourself admiring these creatures with a paternal and amused eye. The backdrops, among other things, are rich in colors and details, not missing refractions and effects worthy of the most performing titles released so far on the new Microsoft console. The sound commentary is also excellent, especially in terms of effects. With the thousand verses emitted by the Pinatas that make every event that happens in the ever-growing garden identifiable. Goals 360 Viva Pinata points are divided into 50 achievements, many of which are secret. The beauty is that there is a pleasant and continuous sense of progression that naturally leads to unlocking one goal after another. Watch out, though, you'll have to sweat the 1000 points... Comment Away from the pressures of the Xbox 360 launch, Rare churns out Viva Pinata, and it's in fine form. Those who bought it just to have a fun and carefree title, with which to convert their girlfriend to video games, or with which to spend Christmas in joy, could find themselves playing this title again in the spring, as ruthless as mother nature itself. In fact, under the aspect of a simple management system, created with excellent care, there is hidden a game full of goodies and real gameplay, so much so that, perhaps, just the youngest players could lose heart in the most advanced. Dozens of animals, gadgets and surprises guarantee a long life for a title capable of captivating Pokemon or Sims fans for many hours. Too bad only for a somewhat skimpy online mode, and for a somewhat cumbersome interface, otherwise excellence would have been touched. Pros: Irresistible graphics So much substance and so many possibilities It never ceases to amaze Cons: Interface a bit complicated Online mode to the bone The uploads to enter and exit the menus Two things could mislead your judgment on Viva Pinata, looking at the images scattered here and there on this page: those cute and innocent little animals, and the copious sweets they distribute when they are eliminated. Indeed, it would be a mistake to classify Rare's latest work as a simple game for children, or as a commercial ploy to launch a television series that is already a success in the United States. Viva Pinata is worthy of the utmost attention, thanks to several interesting discoveries, so much so that, once you get over the crackling and carefree beginning, it will put you to the test with a thousand decisions to be made in a short time, and with the most ruthless rules of the food chain . Having left behind the traumatic launch of the Xbox 360, the historic British software house comes up with a minor project only in name, but which is worth every minute of the time you will want to spend on it.", "date": "2006-11-29", "grade": null}
