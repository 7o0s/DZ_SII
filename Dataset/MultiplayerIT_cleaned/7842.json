It is therefore with justified interest that one approaches Haunted Hollow, either for the refined pedigree of the authors or for a game structure that promises to find an ideal point of connection between strategic rigor and casual accessibility. So let's find out what the end result was. The new monsters A few minutes of tutorials are enough to learn the basic mechanics of a product that undoubtedly starts off on the right foot, effectively seeking a compromise between the classic stylistic features of the genre and the immediacy required by the mobile platform. The aim of the game is to scare all the inhabitants of a village using the monsters generated by your haunted house, in competition with an opponent (either a human or the CPU) who also owns a sinister mansion on the opposite side of the scenario. At the beginning of each turn, you have the option to expand the structure with a room that allows you to spawn a specific creature, bearing in mind that adjacent rooms of the same type allow you to spawn even bigger and more powerful monstrosities. The keystone of the strategic system consists of the so-called Fear Points, to be spent to perform all kinds of actions and which are redistributed each round based on the progress made on the game map. There are no limitations linked to a single pawn, therefore in theory it is possible to spend all the Fear Points at one's disposal by directing them also to a single character: in this regard, Haunted Hollow offers three types of monsters, respectively oriented towards frightening the inhabitants, in combat or performing special moves. The variety of creatures is definitely appreciable, and you can go from totally unbalanced specimens on a single skill to others that act as a compromise between two different classes. As we said at the beginning, the game is won by the player who first manages to take possession of all the houses in the village, causing the terrified inhabitants to flee: each unit added to his count increases the experience, and leveling up allows you to choose one of powerful single-use items made available. Again, when the villagers driven out of their walls reach a certain number, they arm themselves with pitchforks and torches and move around the map destroying everything they find in their path, becoming a real mad splinter in the playful economy. In short, as is evident from what has been written so far, Haunted Hollow certainly does not spare itself in inventiveness as regards its gameplay: it is only a pity that the Firaxis title lacks a ~small~ detail such as the fun factor. In fact, a couple of games are enough for the product to have essentially exhausted the topics: there is only one setting, only one level of difficulty and the only game mode offered is that of the single march, be it against the CPU or a human opponent via both local and online asynchronous multiplayer. It also doesn't help the fact that, apart from a reduced package of basic monsters, all the (many) creatures created by the developers can be downloaded for a fee from a special shop, which the game does not fail to advertise at every turn: the consequence is that, unless you intend to put your hands on your wallet, interest in Haunted Hollow is destined to last for too little time. The unpleasant sensation of being faced with an application created with the pure profit given by the aforementioned microtransactions in mind is finally increased by a truly basic technical realization, with a single backdrop on which small and too sufficiently animated two-dimensional sprites move.", "date": "2013-05-10", "grade": "6.0"}
