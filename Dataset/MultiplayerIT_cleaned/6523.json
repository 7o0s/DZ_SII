{"name": "Amazing Bomberman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/amazing-bomberman-recensione.html", "text": "Among the most interesting trends that we have seen emerging in Apple Arcade is the evident attention paid to the Japanese gaming scene, which has led to the recall of various historical names within the Apple program and the recovery of some forms of game and somewhat outdated series. We have seen the return of the classic JRPG with fixed angles with the splendid Fantasian of Hironobu Sakaguchi and classic titles with new declinations such as Pac-Man Party Royale from Bandai Namco and ChuChu Rocket! by Sega. Among these we can now add another historical name of the Rising Sun, as we see in this review of Amazing Bomberman. Again, the developers have not limited themselves to taking the classic formula and transporting it to the mobile context, but have decided to rework it with some new ideas in order to present a rather different experience, with results that are not too convincing, but interesting nonetheless. The basic structure remains the historical one: within levels set in grids, we find ourselves controlling a character capable of placing bombs whose explosions are able to open new passages and eliminate enemies. The peculiarities of this version refer above all to some stylistic aspects and in particular to the attention dedicated to the audio accompaniment and to the harmony between this and the video elements, with a search for ~synesthetic~ effects that somewhat recall similar experiments such as Rez or Lumines, even if in this case everything seems decidedly more tending towards aesthetic tinsel than to actual variations in the dynamics of the game. Bomberman in psychedelic version Amazing Bomberman is halfway between a game and a video clip The basic gameplay is therefore always the same, and is still perfectly valid: four players move within levels made up of corridors arranged in grids, trying to open new passages by destroying blocks with bombs and then trying to eliminate each other framing the opponents so that you can hit them with the range of the explosions, also taking advantage of power-ups capable of increasing the quantity and range of the bombs, allowing them to be lifted, moved or thrown and more. It's a gameplay that hasn't changed since 1983 and is still fun, it just doesn't seem supported by particularly convincing variations and side elements. Over almost 40 years, the series has gone on trying to insert new more or less marginal elements to the gameplay and offering new game modes, with rather fluctuating results but still recording a substantial evolution. The idea is that Amazing Bomberman is not destined to go down in history as a particularly memorable and decisive chapter in the long history of Hudson Soft's bomber, limiting itself to proposing the standard mechanics with only the multiplayer mode available and a new characterization that concerns exclusively the aesthetic aspect, without however being too convincing. The soundtrack is very pleasant and interesting, with a large amount of licensed songs ranging from J-Pop to other similar derivations of pop, while the graphic characterization offers dynamic backgrounds that intersect with graphic effects of explosions and outlines of levels and characters, with psychedelic effects that can however make the game action a bit confusing. The general chaotic climate is probably intended to create further dynamism to the action, but it can be a bit annoying, especially when it gets stuck with another dubious element of Amazing Bomberman: the control system. Amazing Bomberman, unlockable customizations The virtual stick clashes, more often than not, with the purely ~2D~ precise and sudden movements in the four supported directions that are required in order to win games and this feature creates a sort of vicious circle with the graphical chaos that can derive from the new representation. Fortunately, the problem can be partially solved using an external controller, but for a title born for mobile platforms it is perhaps not the most immediate and convincing solution. The game offer, in terms of modes and variants, is very limited: Amazing Bomberman focuses on the essentials by exclusively offering competitive multiplayer, against human opponents online or against the CPU, with no real progression beyond the unlocking of some badges and elements for customization. It is possible to play with friends in ~LAN~, but there is no split-screen game option, which somewhat limits the possibilities of resorting to the good old multiplayer in presence which represents a pillar of the experiencenza of Bomberman. In general, in this respect the proposal appears rather lacking, even compared to various other previous chapters of the series.", "date": "2022-08-14", "grade": "6.5"}
