{"name": "Pi Rayman per tutti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/160347-rayman-adventures-piu-rayman-per-tutti.html", "text": "With Rayman Jungle Run and the subsequent Rayman Fiesta Run, Ubisoft had brilliantly demonstrated that it was possible to bring the typical feeling of the platform series even into mobile territory, simplifying the formula enough to meet the modest performance of touch control systems and offering a good amount of content at an attractive price. In a somewhat surprising way, the transalpine software house has decided to radically change register with this new Rayman Adventures, modifying the game setting, adopting an unprecedented free to play model and granting an exclusive time period to the Apple TV version: now that the game is also available on iOS and Android devices, let's see if this revolution has borne fruit... Free to Ray The core of the gameplay of Rayman Adventures is substantially the same as in the previous titles: the protagonist runs alone along the two-dimensional scenarios, and the user must take him to the end of the various levels by touching the screen to make him jump and swiping forward to make him execute an attack, two basic actions accompanied by some variations which, however, do not weigh down a control system which is confirmed to be simple and effective. What changes (and quite a lot) is everything that revolves around these fundamentals: instead of presenting a simple succession of stages, the game is divided into micro-adventures made up of a handful of levels belonging to three different categories in terms of setting and methods of awarding of points. There are therefore sections based on combat that require you to eliminate as many enemies as possible, others in which you have to try to collect all Lums and finally the more exploratory ones that reward those capable of finding every hidden treasure. In an evident attempt to make the title truly accessible to anyone, Ubisoft has preferred to offer short and decidedly affordable internships, perhaps sinning a little too much of doing good: especially for those who have had experience with the previous Raymans, it is difficult to hide a certain disappointment for all too simple levels that in the long run don't always prove to have great variety and bite. A partial consolation comes from a technical sector that confirms the absolute excellence already appreciated in the prequels, showcasing colorful graphics full of characters that seem to have come straight out of a cartoon and sound with the usual load of personality. In this unprecedented free to play guise, Rayman Adventures does its duty without impressing Catch them all! The bogeyman of free to play is managed by Rayman Adventures in a fairly painless way, since it tends to involve a secondary component of the playful experience. During his journey, in fact, the player gets eggs containing creatures that can provide support in the gameplay (helping him find secrets, collect Lums or provide him with a shield against enemy attacks) and these are the main object of the dynamics related to in-app purchases: from the food necessary to feed them to the elixirs useful for improving their characteristics or speeding up processes, everything passes through the disbursement of blue crystals obtainable in a minimal part by playing and for the rest present in various packages in the appropriate online shop. With a little patience, you can therefore tackle the adventure without having to shell out a penny, provided you neglect this aspect a little and settle for Rayman's main costume, given that all the variants of the case are also paid . More than this sales model, what makes Rayman Adventures turn up their noses is the decision on the part of the developers to prevent the user from retracing their steps and facing the levels already completed once again: once an adventure is completed , this becomes unreachable, for the sake of all those who would like to recover some Lums lost along the way or aspire to a better score. Not very well - at least in the version we tested at the time of writing the article - also the stability of the application's network functions, which requires an active connection in order to be used: on several occasions server-related problems prevented us from continuing , and it also happened that the consequence of one of these errors was the partial loss of our progress. We close with a note regarding the Apple TV version of the title: if on the one hand running Rayman Adventures on a TV does even more justice to its fantastic graphic rendering, on the other hand the control system via the remote control is undoubtedly inferior in terms of precision and reactivety to that of a touch screen, although it must be said that the option of using an MFi controller with all the necessary improvements is still contemplated.", "date": "2015-12-08", "grade": "7.4"}
