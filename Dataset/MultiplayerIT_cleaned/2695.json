The King of Fighters XIV did not, however, intercept this trend, anchoring itself to an old-fashioned arcade mode, with all its limitations, and showing the signs of a technical realization below expectations, the daughter of an unhappy transition from the splendid two-dimensional sprites that have always characterized the franchise to polygonal models with an often generic design. Well, four and a half years later, the game is back on PlayStation 4 with a definitive edition that includes the improvements made so far and eight extra characters: basically the same version that has been available on Steam for some time. worth waiting so long, especially considering that this year we will see the launch of the new chapter in the series? And is the price of this version adequate for the content offered? We tell you in the review of The King of Fighters XIV Ultimate Edition. Gameplay Let's start with the good news: in terms of gameplay, there is very little to complain about The King of Fighters XIV Ultimate Edition: as reported in the review of the original version, we are talking about a fighting game full of depth and technicalities, very precise in its mechanics and collisions, endowed with an excellent enhancement of the impacts and therefore with an undoubted personality. What speaks here is obviously the long history of the series, which in the second half of the 90s practically dictated the law in the arcade thanks not only to its amazing crossover nature, capable of bringing together all the characters of the various franchises in a single experience SNK, but also and above all to a very solid combat system, able to give satisfaction to both newbies and experienced players, based on how you decided to approach the experience. The developers have granted something to less savvy users, see the simplified combo (Rush Mode) which however shows major limitations in the competitive areas of a certain level, but in general we are faced with a fighting game that lends itself to various interpretations: from classic game with simple and special shots, always very spectacular and effective, to the most complex and devastating concatenations. The execution of special moves, super moves and the so-called Climaxes is regulated by a renewed system of indicators, which, as per tradition, are filled dealing damage to opponents and parrying their blows. However, there is also room for further facets between cancel and boost, confirming how complete the system developed by SNK is. Personages Finding yourself in command of the various Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard or Ryo Sakazaki is like putting on a comfortable suit: they are characters as reliable as a Swiss watch and even in this new edition they do not reserve surprises, providing old fans with a solid starting point. Then there are the new entries, starting with the Chinese protagonist Shun'ei to get to the various Alice Nakata, Bandeiras Hattori, Kukri, Nelson and Zarina. Although some aesthetic choices are perplexing, there is no doubt that even the characterization of these new figures boasting precise peculiarities, distinctive traits that give personality to the fighters: an aspect that is then strongly reaffirmed when one goes to verify their repertoire of moves, very varied and convincing. Staying on the subject, the Ultimate Edition is mainly characterized by the presence of eight extra characters, although only one of them is in its first appearance: the Arab warrior Najd. The rest are throwbacks, see Blue Mary, Ryuji Yamazaki, Rock Howard, Heidern, Whip, Vanessa and Oswald: often minor figures, who have been missing for years and which the developers wanted to recover for the occasion. So let's talk about a roster made up of the beauty of 58 fighters, all of them interesting, which guarantees this edition an extraordinary variety and degree of replayability. Too bad that nothing has changed in terms of final bosses: at the end of the story mode we will always have to face the wrestler Antonov and the supernatural entity Verse. Mode Unfortunately, the Ultimate Edition of The King of Fighters XIV does not add structural content, therefore the list of available modes remains the one we already knew: a generic story mode, with small additional cutscenes depending on the characters used; an online sector that includes the classic one-on-one games but also variations on the theme such as Party Mode,for a maximum of twelve participants; and then survival, versus, time challenge, tutorial and training, all quite traditional. Naturally the longevity of the game depends in this case on the breadth and variety of the roster, which as mentioned is quite rich and interesting, with few new entries as well but many welcome returns from the past of the series; and it certainly also depends on the competitive online, which during our tests proved to be generally stable, although not very populated. Playstation 4 trophies While a portion of The King of Fighters XIV Ultimate Edition trophies is tied to simply completing the story and obtaining collectibles, the bulk of achievements can only be obtained by dedicating time to practice, executing special moves, completing of tutorials and tests, as well as of course the online component. Technical realization The technical realization undoubtedly remains the least successful aspect of the game, which has lost a lot of personality in the transition from 2D to 3D graphics. The quality of the polygonal models leaves something to be desired, it appears dated and in several cases the translation from the original design to the new one shows a substantial loss of details which makes the face of the fighters very generic. Clearly this factor weighs even more more than four years after original release: the idea that such an experienced and talented development team has found itself starting from scratch in the approach to polygonal graphics is equally sad and inexplicable, even more so considering how the gameplay has instead been translated in a loyal. The scenarios, also a characterizing trait of the series, as well as of SNK fighting games in general, alternate evocative and detailed landscapes with frankly modest solutions, sometimes made even more unhappy by the use of ugly textures. Here too, in any case, the numbers allow for a recovery in extremis: the game includes no less than eighteen settings in addition to the gym. Little to say, however, about the soundtrack and the audio sector in general, which can count on some rather rhythmic and engaging, perfectly functional to the action that is shown on the screen, together with the classic phrases in Japanese during the execution of the special moves.", "date": "2021-01-28", "grade": "7.3"}
