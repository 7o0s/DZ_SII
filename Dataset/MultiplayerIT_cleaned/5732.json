A sort of popular tradition, often associated with other elements such as the collection of objects of various types, secret passages and the presence of bricks of various types to be hit with the head or destroyed in other ways, in order to reveal any hidden bonuses. The combination of these elements recreates the magic of the platform game in an instant and allows you to wear the game as a sort of old and friendly glove made of known and more or less still valid gameplay. It is not difficult to see the mustachioed plumber at the origins of this tradition, progenitor and practically unsurpassed paradigm of the entire genre, built on such solid foundations as to make even the clones, often, pleasant games thanks to the simple relevance to the canon. This is exactly what happens with Super Phantom Cat, a very classic platformer in various respects, which however finds its strength in the balance of its fully derivative but well-thought-out structure and in its particular minimalist and geometric graphic creation. Once again it is a question of jumping on platforms, hitting enemies on the head and collecting collectibles around the levels, but everything is well organized, with a simple but rigorous and pleasant level design that also allows for a certain depth of exploration given the amount of secret passages and alternative routes present. An academy platformer, one could say, but for this reason very enjoyable, thanks also to a rather reactive control system for the touch screen and a rhythm designed in such a way as to be suitable for use on mobile devices. Super Phantom Cat makes us feel at home with its classically platforming structure Transformative cat The protagonist of the game is a white cat who wishes to become a super-hero and is guided in this personal quest by a sort of master (also a cat) who sends him to complete the levels of a strange world called Phantom World. The story obviously has a very relative value, as befits the genre, but the characterization is interesting, especially thanks to the geometric graphic style adopted by the Veewo team which really manages to give a specific identity to the game, despite its structure being all other than original. The control system is unfortunately the usual virtual pad proposed on the touch screen, but it proves to be very responsive and precise, without ever being an obstacle. The only comment that can be made, in this sense, is that the very low position of the ~keys~ on the screen makes the grip uncomfortable if you are using a tablet, being a solution probably designed keeping smartphones in mind above all. In addition to the graphic sector, the most convincing aspect of Super Phantom Cat is the level design, which leads to deepen the exploration of the various settings in search of the numerous secret passages and hidden stars (three in each level), arranged in such a way to be somehow understandable. Although they are often false walls that magically open into new passages, their arrangement is not too arbitrary and is often suggested by the arrangement of the elements on the screen. To deepen the mechanics, some power-ups intervene as per tradition, called ~sprites~, which amplify the cat's abilities allowing you to shoot, carry out an attack on the ground, throw bombs or teleport, all elements which, in addition to enriching the possibilities of attacking enemies have important reflections on the interaction with the scenarios, so much so that the same level design adapts to these additional abilities, arranged in a very precise way in the game's path. A particular element of Super Phantom Cat is the possibility of extensively modifying the appearance of the protagonist with a vast series of ~skins~, unlockable by collecting the luminous objects scattered throughout the levels.", "date": "2016-02-03", "grade": "8.2"}
