Then came Nintendo with the Wii, and together with the casual revolution of the market it also decided to take care of the health of gamers, too often associated with images of sedentary people, with a few extra pounds and anything but athletic. Wii Fit and its sequel Wii Fit Plus, released between 2007 and 2009, managed not only to realize the above bizarre idea, but even to sell a total of well over 40 million copies worldwide, even generating a new trend followed by other publishers; just to give an idea of the success of the brand, we are talking about the sixth and seventh best-selling game ever in the history of the very successful Nintendo console, capable of putting themselves in front of stuff like Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda and Super Smash Bros. Brawl just to name a few. The reason for this plebiscite is undoubtedly a series of contingent factors, such as the greater sensitivity at the level of public opinion precisely for physical well-being (especially in the USA) and - no less important - the choice to combine the software with a simple hardware peripheral, very easy to use and not at all intimidating like the Balance Board, or more commonly known as ~the balance~. In reality, not only a platform capable of measuring body weight, but capable of determining the center of gravity and movements so as to act as a support for the entire series of exercises offered by the ~game~. Almost 6 years after its debut, with the third episode of the series, the franchise also arrives on Wii U. Wii Fit U expands on the original formula with some interesting additions Too sexy for my car Wii Fit U, this is the far from original name of the product, is a title evidently developed with the intention of giving continuity to what was offered with the previous episodes, guaranteeing a feeling of familiarity for the veterans of the series that is perceived from the first moments. All this starting from the peripheral, which is the exact same Balance Board used in the past; in this sense Nintendo therefore preferred to build on the foundations already laid, expanding the contents rather than changing the cards on the table. It is a choice which, if in other contexts it could be translated as a laziness to criticize, in this specific context instead appears completely logical: the success of the first two chapters has in fact demonstrated that the formula is successful, so much so that they are not missing testimonies of those who have lost dozens of kilos through Wii Fit. Of course there is also the downside, and such examples are mostly related to people who have simply found the switch in Nintendo's software to trigger an already present motivation. Because Wii Fit U, just like the previous ones, leaves a little too much room for the user's will: although there are recommended specific training routines for different purposes (toning up parts of the body, losing weight, increasing muscle mass) they continue to lack of programs organized day by day which in a certain sense ~force~ the user to do activities. A weak point which is now evidently part of the way Nintendo has chosen to offer the product, and which consequently may or may not represent a real defect depending on the individual case. The software is therefore structured on the basis of 77 different activities, divided between yoga, aerobic exercises, muscle exercises and balance games: as already mentioned, a large part of them have been recycled from previous episodes, even if there is no shortage of innovations especially in the of the more strictly playful offer. In fact, exactly as in the past, if on the one hand there are classic exercises conducted in an essential and ~serious~ way by the now famous virtual coaches (ready among other things for their sensational debut as wrestlers in the next Super Smash Bros.), on the other there are much more playful and colorful challenges in which Miis are the masters. These are pleasant minigames that help break up the monotony of training, even if the proposed mechanics do not always go well with the capabilities and limits of the Balance Board. The Dance mode is completely new, which promises to burn calories through dances of different complexity; in this case, however, in addition to the scale, two Wiimote Plus are also needed - one in each hand - to obtain a correct, albeit obviously cumbersome, detection of the movements. Instead, the use of the GamePad is extremely appreciated, which in fact allows for the first time to be able to access the software without the need to turn on the TV (except forless than 10% of activities that require dual screens); it is an extremely convenient feature both for simply activating and using the product, and for the possibility of doing one's exercises while watching a television program, consequently making everything more pleasant. Walk as you go On the other hand, the sales formula chosen by the Kyoto house is very interesting, evidently intended to favor and pamper those who had already embarked on the world of fitness by Nintendo in the past: in fact, it is sufficient to already own the Balance Board to be able to download from the eShop and try it for free for 31 days Wii Fit U in its entirety, without restrictions of any kind. An entire month represents more than enough time to understand if the novelties of the package, or simply if one's desire to sweat again in front of the TV, are such as to entice one to continue further. In this case, just buy the Fit Meter and synchronize it with your console to completely unlock the product. And what would this Fit Meter be, you ask? Basically it is a simple pedometer with belt clip to always carry with you to monitor your movements (even with altitude detection) and the calories burned; the accessory is also equipped with a small black and white lcd screen and three keys through which it is able to provide updated activity data to be consulted at any time. Then just bring the Fit Meter near the infrared sensor of the GamePad to synchronize the information with the software. Nothing revolutionary then, but rather an interesting way to allow Wii Fit U to be aware of one's activity even in ~daily life~, beyond just training sessions, and consequently propose a more complete picture of the physical profile of the user. However, there is also the playful application for using the Fit Meter, which resolves itself into a series of travel challenges both in length and in height: for example, walking through London or climbing the Eiffel Tower, with movements that are translated from those actually recorded by the pedometer. Considering an accessory selling price of less than 30 euros, it becomes clear how an ~historic~ user of the Wii Fit series can therefore access this chapter for Wii U with a very modest expense; in the same way, bundles containing the Balance Board are also obviously available in stores, intended for those who on the contrary want to try the experience of the Nintendo franchise for the first time. Finally, the possibility of transferring the save data from Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus to this new version deserves mention, thus allowing you to carry on your routine without losing the (virtual) progress built with months of (real) effort.", "date": "2013-12-06", "grade": "7.5"}
