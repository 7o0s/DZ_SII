Hardly Just Dance, yet since 2009 the Ubisoft franchise has been churning out a new episode at regular intervals, apparently oblivious to the implosion of the casual bubble and that, closely connected to it, of motion control. Evidently the formula works beyond all else, and there are still quite a few people who find it amusing to stand in front of the TV in the living room and dance bizarre choreographies to the tune of their favorite songs. Being able to renew a product with such immediate mechanics is not at all simple, yet necessary to make sense of the new episodes beyond a different tracklist. Just Dance 2016 is still the same game, plus some interesting new features Watch your smartphone Just Dance 2016 has no intention of affecting the gameplay that has decreed its success, which is why this version is played in an absolutely identical way to the previous ones: it is - for those who don't know yet - more of a party game than than a real dance simulator. In fact, each song among those present has a choreography to be followed in a more or less precise way: the detection of movements, deliberately very condescending, and the great predisposition to multiplayer make Just Dance sessions fun in which anyone can participate even without having any kind of confidence in video games. On the other hand, this has always been the reason for the success of the French series: an extraordinary accessibility that does not pose any kind of barrier, except that of modesty and personal embarrassment. Precisely on this concept, namely that of accessibility, Ubisoft wanted to focus this year to try to minimize any possible technical obstacle encountered by users. An important step had already been taken last year with Just Dance Now, a version for mobile devices that allowed you to enjoy an experience almost identical to that of the console editions using your smartphone as a controller to detect movements. Precisely on the basis of that experience, Just Dance 2016 allows you to completely eliminate the need to use or have a dedicated controller for your console (Wiimote, Playstation Move or Camera, Kinect) by using an iOS or Android smartphone instead. Among other things, this also allows you to increase the total number of players, which on Wii U can be 6 total against the maximum 4 using Wiimotes instead. A welcome novelty which, beyond the indisputable implications of economic opportunity and security of one's device (getting off several hundred euros of mobile phones while letting loose to Jason Derulo's notes is not exactly the best) in fact makes the experience local multiplayer truly within everyone's reach. On the Nintendo console, the need to connect the sensor bar, a hated and uncomfortable legacy of the Wii era, to use remote controls has finally been eliminated: menu navigation now takes place via the digital cross without having to point at the screen. From the point of view of the modalities, however, Just Dance 2016 adds a couple of new options: with Dance Quest we find ourselves facing a sort of missions challenging the CPU in a series of three songs, while Showtime uses the camera to record a video clip with templates dedicated to each of the available songs. Nothing particularly incisive to tell the truth, and in our experience we preferred to spend most of the time in the classic main mode or the online one that allows you to challenge users from all over the world. As far as the tracklist is concerned, we cannot deny a certain perplexity in the face of some of the choices to compose the group of 44 tracks on the disc: if in the past we had already criticized the excessive heterogeneity of the songs which, with the intention of meeting the almost everyone's tastes ended up not having a precise focus, in this case the situation was ~aggravated~ by the presence of semi-unknown artists, at least in our country, such as Buraka Som Sistema, Nikki Yanofsky and Prince Royce, plus some pretty forgettable covers. Another interesting novelty is the inclusion this year of a subscription service, entitled Just Dance Unlimited, which replaces the single song shop present in the past. In this case, however, at the cost of 6.99 for a month, 14.99 for three months or 39.99 for a year, it is possible to access a very vast and constantly expanding catalog (it currently has about 150 songs), inside of which there are decidedly more known and popular hits from the chartscompared to those in the basic list. The suspicion that Ubisoft has deliberately chosen to reduce the appeal of the disc offer to stimulate subscription to the additional service is therefore at least legitimate. Finally, little to add on the technical component, which remains absolutely faithful to the previous episodes with a stylized and very colorful graphic style that is still pleasant and characterizing today.", "date": "2015-11-17", "grade": "7.3"}
