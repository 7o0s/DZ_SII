{"name": "Call of Duty", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty.html", "text": "Schizophrenia take me away To be able to give you a more complete idea of what this war meant and above all how it really involved a large part of the globe on which we all walk, the Infinity Ward programmers thought of offering you different points of view, more perspectives let's say, and so you find yourself playing an American soldier trying to make his way in the occupied Norman land, a British soldier in various sabotage missions and a brave Bolshevik soldier fighting for Mother Russia. Nice idea, I must say, invigorated by the fact that your companions all speak with the typical accent that in fact they should have (they .. you are of few words ..) and the weapons vary from time to time . The only flaw is the complete lack of any link between the different campaigns, so much so that if you are not paying attention to the plot, which ultimately resolves itself in a series of different missions one after the other, this ingenious gimmick could even escape you. However, the individual campaigns are inclusive of somewhat different missions, from holding a bridge while resisting the onslaught of a tide of enemies, to escaping aboard a car chased by the Germans, from infiltrating an enemy aircraft carrier disguised as Nazis at the most classic Put the dynamite  blow up the anti-aircraft guns missions. There is no means to drive and the possibility of visiting any interior at your leisure, there is only one way to follow.. complete with a compass that will show you the direction to reach your next goal. In short, you won't have to make your brain work too much, but have good aim and be quick to move the mouse. Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers? Being both creatures of Steven Spielberg it is surprising that this has not thought of suing the software house producing ~Call of Duty~. The atmosphere you breathe is exactly that. The game has a very cinematic style, underlined by scripted sequences that add emphasis and pathos worthy of the best Second World War film. If we leave out a small number of solo missions, where you will have to play the Rambo ante-litteram of the situation, one of the game's greatest strengths is the cheerful brigade of fellow soldiers that you carry with you on every outing. In addition to being a pleasant company, they will be very useful to you. It will often happen that some of your comrades save your skin just when you thought you were ready to go home in a coffin, killing an enemy on the spot while you were just trying to figure out how to reload that kind of rifle you carry around . Your troop moves very well, even if you won't have the possibility to give any kind of order. They are independent and tenacious and some crucial characters, usually the commanders, in addition to issuing orders by shouting and ranting have the curious ability to be practically immortal. Regardless of the numerous bursts of other people's machine guns, they continue to rant and rant against the enemy, while if you were the one who received all that lead as a gift, you would already be at the creator. Unnerving indeed .. but what can you do? They must be the privileges of the ranks, in fact your companions in a more modest role drop like flies and it could happen that you find yourself surrounded by friendly corpses, alone against everyone. But don't worry, script magic, after a few minutes you'll turn your head and you'll find them all there, ready to give you a smile. It was not destiny that you remained alone and abandoned. The fastest reinforcements in the world? If you want to put it this way Graphics and audio We now come to the strengths of this nice little game: the audio above all. Few words to describe it. Engaging is somewhat reductive perhaps, but it can give you an idea. If you play with the volume of the speakers too high, it is probable that some of your neighbors, perhaps some old war veterans, will run to get lots of supplies and boards to nail the windows, waiting for the Germans to return. In some missions it's fun (as well as useful) to just lie behind a bush, enjoying the deafening noises of battle. Screams in various languages, the whistling of bullets and falling bombs will drag you through the battlefield, as well as making you partially deaf in one ear. Which really happens in game, if a bomb or a cannon shot falls too close to it. The dazed effect is accentuated by a slowdown in the graphics while for a few moments the noises will seem miles away.the. Nothing new perhaps but very well rendered, especially if we think that when your hearing returns you will be thrown back into that hell of gunfire and roars. If you combine all this with fantastic music, you will have a vague idea of what awaits you. Towards the end of a bloody battle you will be accompanied by enchanting melodies, sad and slow, which will give that extra touch to the already very apt atmosphere. The graphics are well detailed and some landscapes are done really well. The water effect is remarkable (Morrowind style to be clear) and the smoke effects are also impressive. Technically a really good product that certainly keeps pace with other titles of the moment. Playing on the net The multiplayer part could not be missing and consists of different modes, some of which are particularly interesting. Leaving aside the Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch that everyone knows by now, some of these such as Behind Enemy Lines are very fun and with a touch of innovation, which perhaps is missing from the single player part. A small group of Allies is surrounded by enemy troops and you will have the opportunity to accumulate points by surviving as long as possible and killing as many enemies as you can. If you play on the side of the Germans instead, every time you mate a Yankee you will have to respawn wearing the American uniform. The smile you had painted on your face, strengthened by the fact that you were overwhelmingly supernumerary, will turn into a grin of terror when you understand what your opponents were feeling up until a few moments before. There is no shortage of modes such as Search and Destroy where to win a team will have to eliminate a series of objectives while the other will try to defend them or Retrieval where in a certain time limit a team will have to recover secret documents and bring them back to their safe area . Conclusion It's nothing new, all stuff already seen and the missions, even if with some attempts to make them more original (see the escapes in the car or on the trucks or some time limitation to be able to put salt on your tail) know a little deja vu. But the theme of the Second World War is now inflationary and you can not expect this game to be original. It has an impressive technical achievement, truly remarkable audio and graphics and the advantage of still being fun to play. The difficulty is obviously selectable, even if I would advise you to leave out the first two: Greenhorn or Regular since the opponents seem like targets ready to be hit at any moment, perhaps useful for getting some practice but rather boring in the long run. The cinematic style is enjoyable and gives a very ~action movie~ style cut to the story. Fans of the genre will not miss it. It remains a great game about the Second War and collecting is collecting. The multiplayer part gives that longevity that is always lacking in a mainly scripted single player, after the sixth time you redo a mission it may also be useful to know where all your opponents will come from, but in any case this will take away some of the pleasure of playing it. If you really sucked FPS you wouldn't be here reading, and this is a nice FPS that will give you moments of panic during the bloodiest battles and satisfaction when, all by yourself, you will have managed to get out alive from the enemy's lair. For the more undecided there are also two nice demos to try... Pros: Spectacular graphics and audio Multiplayer extends its life Very cinematic Cons: Still the same WWII game Scripted single player Lacks real story A FPS on the Second World War finally arrives on the shelves, a theme never treated before, full of innovative and revolutionary ideas and situations. Would you have ever thought that such a topic could ever be transposed into a video game, incredible truly a novelty. Leaving aside the subtle (??) irony for a moment and above all leaving the fateful question suspended: ~Was there really a need?~ let's analyze this umpteenth dive into the most ~popular~ world conflict of the moment.", "date": "2003-11-17", "grade": null}
