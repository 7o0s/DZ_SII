{"name": "Spodestiamo il Barone!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85189-stacking-spodestiamo-il-barone.html", "text": "The Game is available for download on the PSN service and Xbox Live Arcade Version tested: Xbox 360 At Double Fine they pay particular attention to making each of their works unique, after all how could it be otherwise when you have Tim Schafer among the founding members who helped create milestones such as Monkey Island, Grim Fandango and Psychonauts up to the recent Brutal Legend. All his creations boast strong identities and exceptionally detailed worlds that are engraved in memories thanks to the astonishing artistic coherence offered to the eyes of the players. Stacking is certainly no exception, proving to be a project that does not suffer from the ~digital delivery~ syndrome which sometimes leads many titles to offer castrated experiences if not in the gameplay at least in the artistic realization as if online distribution were an alibi for less ambition of the developers. Stacking, on the other hand, proves right from the start that it is a game with a great personality and superfine attention to detail. From Russia with fury Stacking drags us into a microworld populated by living nesting dolls immersed in a context that recalls the 1930s in style. We impersonate Charlie Blackmore a small doll, indeed the smallest ever who has the task of finding his brothers put to work by the evil Baron to pay the debts that the family was forced to contract after the father never did it again homecoming. Although the story is worthy of a tearjerker dramatic film, Stacking actually has the merit of dealing with raw and important themes with a surreal and light-hearted canon, so as not to make the narration emotionally heavy but rather, the situations Charlie faces often tear a smile at the innocent lightness with which they are presented to the player. In fact, the world of Stacking is very similar to a playful dimension where sometimes some objects magically transform themselves into parts of the scenario, such as cigars acting as smokestacks on a cruise ship. In addition to this, a color palette veering towards warm hues reinforces the feeling of a historical contextualization of the title together with the presence of some characters that recall the stereotypes of those years. Despite the typical ovoid shape and the famous horizontal division of the body, the very numerous nesting dolls are well characterized and diversified from each other, made easily recognizable from each other by the finely painted skins that cover their wooden body, but beyond this it amazes how the designers of Double Fine managed to give life to this unusual population. In fact, each character expresses emotions through funny body movements and the graceful animations of the spherical face drawings. Concatenation The peculiar feature of Stacking's gameplay is that of being able to enter the other dolls (thanks to the small size of the protagonist) thus being able to control their movements and the peculiar ability of which each matryoshka is provided. Following a rigid order of magnitude, it is also possible to chain several dolls of increasing size so as to be able to carry more subjects useful for certain situations. To achieve the goal of reuniting his family, Charlie must overcome challenges in different contexts (one for each brother to be saved) such as train stations, cruise ships, airships and so on. Each scenario has its own mini story to tell that is intertwined with the mission of our little protagonist, a story that must be developed through the resolution of challenges that can be overcome by exploiting the heterogeneous skills of the dolls, many with truly hilarious effects capable of making more than one smile . These challenges often do not turn out to be very complex given that a few steps are enough to arrive at the solution and also the identification of the way forward appears in some cases almost obvious, which could make long-time adventurers turn up their noses, those who have gain experience on the cornerstones of the genre, but this is how Stacking should be approached: relaxing and enjoying the magic of this singular world, perhaps deepening your knowledge of it as much as possible by searching for all the unique matryoshka dolls present in each area or by linking the sets together of dolls so you can see a few short scenes from their lives. It should be specified that each challenge is reset once completed, so as to have the possibility of being able to face it again following a different approach since every little puzzle in the game has more than one way of overcoming it, all equally weird and brilliant. Surely be able to unlock all the different ricelutions presents a whole other level of challenge for the player. There are also numerous tricks also linked to the skills of some dolls so as to make happy those players who have the desire to complete each goal one hundred percent. Xbox 360 goals Finishing the game unlocks half of the 200 points to be won, to reach the full loot it is necessary to collect all the unique dolls and overcome the challenges in all possible modes. Polished dolls Stacking offers a pleasant glance, although it does not flex its muscles in terms of graphic opulence, after all there would be no reason as the slow action and the design far from any pretense of realism. However, it is appreciable how the image on the screen is clean and free from ladders and how the difference between the various materials is well rendered, in particular that of the matryoshka dolls characterized by the classic glossy lacquering typical of Russian dolls. The audio accompaniment is never invasive while the dubbing is totally absent, replaced by balloons during the in-game phases and by silent cinema-style interludes during the films. The longevity of the title does not stand at sublime levels, in case you want to complete the adventure without caring about secondary objectives or to redo the challenges already faced in a different way, a handful of hours are enough to reach the end credits, but We warmly invite you to linger among the animated nesting dolls to enjoy the magic of the game as much as possible, enjoying every challenge and objective available. It seems that Tim Schafer's touch in characterizing settings hasn't rusted at all and, if a lot of water has passed under the bridge since the days of Grim Fandango, our author's ingenious vein still seems far from running out. The care that Double Fine also puts into apparently less ambitious projects can only bode well, as well as representing a sign of respect for the mass of gamers who have made the fortune of this eccentric character in the past.", "date": "2011-02-15", "grade": "8.3"}
