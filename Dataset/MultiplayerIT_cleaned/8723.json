{"name": "Pirati tagliuzzati", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99556-one-piece-unlimited-cruise-sp-pirati-tagliuzzati.html", "text": "In one of the recent chapters of the manga, Luffy and his crew come across a fire-breathing dragon and after a violent fight they also meet a pair of hairy talking legs, devoid of the rest of the body. Luffy's first reaction is: ~Join my crew!~ It is thanks to this genuine irony that One Piece, the famous comic written and illustrated by the mad Eiichiro Oda, has been one of the best-selling shonen-manga in the world for years. Originally conceived as a spiritual heir to the world-famous Dragon Ball, One Piece quickly acquired a personality of its own, churning out increasingly absurd sagas after sagas, incredible fights and truly hilarious characters. The relative merchandising could not fail to include a copious amount of action video games and One Piece: Unlimited Cruise was released in 2008 for the Nintendo Wii as the first episode of a bilogy that would end only a year later. In the full spirit of the traditional ~recycling~ of games to be revived on Nintendo 3DS, Namco Bandai did not miss the opportunity to pack a version that in our area is, to use a rather explicit term, even castrated. The statue is better... The Japanese version of One Piece: Unlimited Cruise SP includes the first episode, Treasure beneath the Waves, the subtitled sequel Awakening of a Hero and a sort of extra chapter specially designed for Nintendo 3DS, Episode from Marineford. We poor Europeans, on the other hand, find ourselves with a half-finished compilation: probably with the aim of inserting the text in four languages (including Italian) into the cartridge, Namco Bandai had the tragicomic idea of removing the second episode entirely, sweetening the pill with an elegant cardboard packaging that contains a cute super-deformed figurine of Portgas D. Ace, the half-brother of the protagonist Luffy. Frankly, there is no gadget that can make up for the sensational lack of what, to all intents and purposes, is mid-game and the rumors that suggest a future release of the second stand-alone episode are not at all consoling, especially if the quality general stock is so low. But let's go in order: the story of One Piece: Unlimited Cruise SP is ideally set shortly after the Thriller Bark saga; Luffy's crew in full force, including the afro-haired skeleton Brook and the cyborg in his underwear Franky, finds himself in spite of himself thrown into a mysterious archipelago together with some of the most famous antagonists of the series, who needless to say will often be the bosses on duty. The basic idea is quite simple: the player controls one character of the crew at a time, with the possibility of replacing him on the fly, and must explore the various areas of each island by defeating all the enemies that he will come across with the repertoire of skills and special moves of the various characters. From this point of view, the game is quite faithful to the original series and our heroes gradually acquire new techniques and attacks that should theoretically make the combat system a varied and fun experience. Instead, it is a practice that quickly becomes boring and frustrating: defeated enemies reappear as soon as you enter another area and are incredibly stupid and slow, a combination that makes the fights all too easy and repetitive, especially when you consider the 'imprecise control system that will often see us launch empty attacks in an attempt to hit the closest opponents. Absurdly, the bosses turn out to be disproportionately stronger than their henchmen, to the point that each battle becomes more of a contest of endurance than an exercise in skill. The 3D effect As in most cases in which the 3D effect is integrated afterwards, also on this occasion we are faced with a game design that is absolutely not influenced by it in any way: it does not facilitate jumps, which are already made difficult by a far from perfect camera, and it doesn't offer any sort of practical benefit. Some shots are also pleasant, but we are far from the quality of the 3D integrated in other older ports. ... or the game? In short, the fulcrum of One Piece: Unlimited Cruise SP is the combat, the problem is that you will have to fight for practically the entire game since the progression depends solely on an unbridled farming of the enemies. The game is full of items to be collected by defeating the various opponents you come across and most of the barriers you will encounter blocking your way are linked to these items, which will be converted into points to access new areas or used in the Thousand Sunny, the ship of the gang, to produce other objects, with which it will be possible to remove those elementsthat hinder progression. It may seem intricate, but in reality the system is really monotonous and linear: it forces the players to go to certain areas of the map to recover the necessary objects, then perhaps to the Thousand Sunny and finally to the point where our adventure stopped, to then find out that in the next area you will have to start all over again. The repetitiveness of the entire structure is already evident in the first minutes of the game and unfortunately the situation does not improve, if anything it worsens, and even rapidly. To comfort the player there is not even a technical realization up to the hardware, the same one that, we recall, hosts titles of the caliber of Resident Evil Revelations. It is true that One Piece: Unlimited Cruise SP is a conversion of a game for Nintendo Wii from almost four years ago, the problem is that practically nothing has been done to update the look of the Namco Bandai product, apart from applying a three-dimensional effect in many cases barely perceptible. Furthermore, the conversion was carried out in a decidedly superficial way, as evidenced by the rough and blurry textures or the often difficult to read texts. One Piece fans will certainly appreciate the care placed in the animations of their favorites and in the realization of their most famous special shots, probably the best aspect of the game, while all the other casual players will be occasionally satisfied by pleasant glimpses of the landscape and nothing more. Finally, the sound accompaniment re-proposes many of the music originally belonging to the cartoon and a completely Japanese dubbing which at least enhances the numerous cutscenes.", "date": "2012-02-24", "grade": "5.0"}
