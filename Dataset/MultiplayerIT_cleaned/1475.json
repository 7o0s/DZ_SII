There has been a lot of talk about it, it has managed to generate a fairly important hype, and it cannot be hidden that many players have reserved a lot of hope in Lionheart for a genre, that of 2D RPGs, which has already appeared in decline for a couple of years. 'years. The plot of the title Reflexive kicks off in the year 1192, when Richard the Lionheart, ruler of England, was preparing to face the Third Crusade. To ensure victory, at the suggestion of his trusted advisors, he brings to the city of Acre some very rare and very powerful sacred relics on which he performs a ritual that according to the advice was to grace the will of God. Unknowingly Riccardo finds himself instead performing an ancient magical ritual that creates an immense gap in reality and unleashes unknown and magical forces on earth. All these premises are narrated in the initial sequence of the game, which is very reminiscent of those of Icewind Dale and its sequel in the style of static representations. Having realized the crime, Riccardo and Saladin try to stem the unknowingly unleashed evil force in some way, forming an alliance, but the worst had already been accomplished! The spirits that emerged from the gap had already merged with men, animals, inanimate objects, creating havoc and enormous natural cataclysms of such power and devastation as to change the appearance of north-western Europe forever. The game, or rather our adventure, will begin about four centuries later, exactly in the year 1588 in Barcelona. Obviously not everything is as it should be... history has been radically changed, now magic flows powerfully in the descendants of the touched by spirits, while the human race is now classified not by religious beliefs or skin color, but by the affiliation with magic. The Inquisition becomes an organization aimed at the eradication of magic on earth and the nations are divided not by their approach to the Protestant reform, but by their affinity or otherwise towards magic. To lead this fight against the arcane is a combative Spain, which organizes itself in carrying on the reasons of the pure blood against those of the users of magic who find refuge in England. The Anglo-Spanish war is about to break out and the Grande Armada is ready to sail towards the white cliffs of Dover. And this is where we come into play The good hopes After attending the presentation and noticing that the background of the options screen changes with each start, we will find ourselves having to create our character. We will be able to choose a pre-packaged one or put in the effort and create one of our own. As already mentioned, the creation system is the s.p.e.c.i.a.l.. This set of rules (which I frankly consider the best around) is extremely versatile and finds its most significant strength in freedom of character development. Of course, the first thing we will choose will be the race of our character among the different types of humans that came to be created after the Disjunction, which incidentally is the catastrophic event we have already talked about. Our choices will range from the ~Pure di Sangue~, i.e. pure human beings, untouched by the effects of the Disjunction. The Democyns, half humans and half demons, fascinating beings but strongly persecuted by the Inquisition. There will be the Sylvants, human beings in tune with magic, but with somatic traits that distinguish them from the Pure Blood and therefore will make them recognizable even at first sight, and consequently under the ~control~ of the enemies of magic. Another choice are the Feralkin, half human and half beast, with the prevalence of their bestial spirit. Choosing the race we shouldn't worry about choosing our class since the special system makes us create and grow our own character without having to assign him a ~job~ or rather his class. You can develop your own baby as you see fit. What will be ~touched~ are the skills, the abilities, which will naturally be related to the activities that our hero will develop. It is clear that pumping physical skills will make us prone to war, lockpicking and hiding skills will make us a good petty thief, while characteristics such as the gab and diplomacy, very important in Lionheart, will create a character skilled with brains rather than with hands. We could also decide to do a little bit of everything, resigning ourselves, however, not to excel in anything The good hopes Thebasic characteristics of our character are Strength, Perception, Resistance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck and the skills that we will assign him, we will be able to choose every certain number of experience levels also called Perks which are particular characteristics of the character, literally accessory skills, which can be useful in the continuation of the adventure and unlike the skills they cannot be improved level after level with the assignment of points, once learned they will be ours forever. Honestly, the defect of the special system is that if we are not used to it we have the feeling of not having understood which character we have created... but the beauty is just that... the flexibility of this set of rules allows us to gradually improve and shape the our avatar, with the consequence of actually seeing our character grow and not only through a numerical fact, but also through the improvements that we will have during the course of the game. Even if in reality the limitations of the game don't allow us to do it completely, the beauty of the special is that of adjusting some features that we discover important only in an advanced stage. Once we have made the character, our adventure will begin inside a prison in Barcelona, where our guiding spirit will welcome us... who will tell us that we are not the types to throw away... and that we have juicy potential just waiting to be put into practice. practice. Once escaped from this cell with the help of the spirit, the real game will begin in Barcelona, where we will meet Leonardo Da Vinci, who will show us the first things to do... and without going too far he will tell us that we have an important role in the history of the game and I would like to see otherwise what do we do, do we stand by and watch?? Honestly, being passionate about screenplays, I find the plots of video games a triumph of banality and an insult to the so-called ~creative effort~, but I must say that Lionheart, in the first hours of the game, can be very, very intriguing... thanks to the excellent dialogues ( that we can appreciate in our language) and a very rich story of sub-quests, which gradually unravels as we go along, all in a very very fluid and captivating way The adventure takes place in nine different areas for a total of one hundred of maps where we will have to deal with about 150 non-player characters with whom to interact with a tree dialogue system very similar to the one seen in the Baldur's Gate saga. NPCs depending on our actions, our race and affiliation will behave differently, showing sympathy or antipathy towards us, all with a rich variety of dialogues and situations. Lionheart is not a game where we will command a party. We will continue with our character, except for some sporadic collaboration with npc managed by the pc. The annoying realities Lionheart starts with very very interesting premises  remembering, and perhaps surpassing the glories of Baldur's Gate and its memorable quests. This phase of wonder lasts about nine hours  after which the Black Isle title enters decidedly less charismatic canvases. But first things first, I tried to ignore the disgusting character animations but I couldn't. The game's engine, the Velocity Engine, is a clear ~homage~ to Interplay's Infinity Engine, i.e. a detailed 2D engine, but with the addition of the ability to put 3D characters on it. The game world is in an isometric view and you will advance in screens, just like BG and company. Too bad because the game areas don't seem to be exactly vast, for example Barcelona, in theory the largest city in the game is made up of only three areas... while the buildings we will be able to enter will be formed inside by a single room, between 'other explorable only in a limited way. Technically Lionheart looks like a game from two years ago the interface is nice, but big and intrusive and I repeat, the animations are disgusting. The music is ordinary, by now the soundtracks of the games are all more or less good, while the main theme is nice. Returning to the graphics, the level of detail is good, even if by now this style is well tested (with all due respect to the 2D artists who work on it) and frankly it seems to be dated. But Lionheart manages to wrap, especially at the beginning, with very very beautiful and above all varied quests. In addition to always different dialogues, where our choices will be able to orient the game considerably. Your name is Lionheart and it's not con the chatter you will get out of this m In the early hours, Lionheart looks like a tough and bad role-playing game with lots of dialogue and lots of situations to untangle but then as you go on, the game slowly expires leaving out the possibility of very often evading the fights, quests 'last, from a certain point on, however, become mandatory. By choosing never to fight, running away or trying to talk to enemies, we will be faced with a lack of experience, which will make the game very difficult or rather impossible to finish. However, having the high stealth skill, we can escape, while with good diplomacy we can talk to the most important enemies. For example, I managed to get away with a bad and ugly demon who wanted to beat me and hurt me claiming to be a very powerful and omnipotent demon and his master had sent him to kill me my character got away with saying the demon that if he was really that powerful, he didn't need masters and convinced the demon to go and kill his master!! These are goodies that will make us appreciate Lionheart, but be careful ... to enjoy these nice pearls you need to have high diplomacy. The truth is that Lionheart is a game based on combat well disguised in the first hours of the game. Like any good self-respecting Rpg, even in Lionheart you will have to defeat monsters. There will be more than a hundred different types of enemies ranging from mythological monsters to the classic undead to the most unique beings born from the fusion of spirits with animals and men. Combat is real-time, with limited ability to pause to access your inventory and target specific parts of your opponent. The pause will not be ~active~, so the game will effectively stop and therefore we will have to go back to fighting in real time. The style is very similar to that of Diablo, with the annoying feature that when we meet more than one enemy, once we kill one, our character will stand still waiting for our click to assign it to another enemy thus taking a lot of beatings in the hectic situations full of enemies, which is a good 70% of the game after the first nine hours. Obviously the enemies will attack us in droves forcing us to advance a little step at a time to get them out a little at a time, in short, a somewhat sad thing for a game that comes out in 2003, after we had learned this thing with Baldur's Gate in '98 . The fighting styles are different: Hectic allows you to fight faster and less accurately, useful for melees and Calculated which on the contrary will be a slower but more precise fighting style. Obviously we can also use magic, choosing between three types. Tribal: the magic of the earth, based on the interaction with the natural elements allows animal control and the dark arts of necromancy. Thought: the magic of the mind and the elements, allows the control of heat, ice and electricity to protect oneself and attack others. Divine: based on magical spirit control, primarily from protective and healing uses. In total we could cast 60 spells, divided into 12 skills that will allow access to them (5 per skill) incrementally. To simplify, if we choose the Fire ability we could launch the Fire Orb, increasing the ability we would have access to the Dragon Breath and so on. The magical power we will draw on to be able to cast will be the classic Mana, the amount of which will depend on our Charisma and our Perception. It goes without saying that the ~divine~ type will be the most useful, given the continuous need for healing magic... and it must also be said that the really effective magic is essentially the effect magic. I was hoping to subvert the common opinion that Lionheart is a two-faced game but unfortunately I haven't found good reasons to do so. In this regard there are different opinions there are few people who love games composed mainly of fights at least if we go into the category of role-playing games Lionheart, in the first half (more or less) looks like a really great crpg with the characteristic of interact with very charismatic historical characters who literally ~catch~ the player... the large amount of initial quests, combined with the dialectic skills that are really useful for the game, lead us to an initial exaltation worthy of the big Black Isle titles... too bad that man hand Lionheart deflates little by little the quests decrease. You just go on exploring and fighting and the dialogues are reduced to a flicker making this title a long rigmarole made up of swarms of enemies, many of the fights between", "date": "2003-11-21", "grade": null}
