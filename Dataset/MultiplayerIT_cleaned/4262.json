Last Tuesday, La Mente Bellica was released, the second awaited DLC of Destiny 2. On the shoulders of this new piece of the game, there is not so much the weight of completely reviving the title, but at least that of getting it back on track. Who has bread and no teeth The Warmind campaign is short and the story is the most classic clich there can be. We are called by a distress signal from Mars, which we sling on immediately: here we meet Ana Bray, a beautiful hunter who will be our guide in the countryside. Ana warns us that warmind Rasputin is in danger on the red planet because it is attacked by the enemy on duty. Let's avoid going into spoilers but know that it all ends in four missions that are certainly beautiful and evocative, but that four missions always remain. We also have some adventures (finally with rewards) that spice up the story a bit, but once again Bungie sips a few drops of a plot that would also be very interesting, but which is too short and seems left in three quarters. It's up to us to connect the dots or hope that a conclusion is reached in the future. Because Destiny is always like this, like one of those beautiful dreams that you have every now and then but that you can't complete because the alarm goes off and we have to imagine its end. A lot of criticism has rained against the assaults, an activity that for the second time translates into a reboot of the campaign missions, only more difficult and with slightly more elaborate mechanics. Exceptions are the owners of the PlayStation4 version who, thanks to the exclusive with Activision, have a totally new assault. However, we want to give you a different interpretation regarding this aspect, not necessarily acceptable but which perhaps will make you better understand the reason for this change of course. In the first chapter of Destiny almost all the missions of the various campaigns were developed on the explorable map, which is certainly not wrong but which reduced us to seeing the same place several times to do different things. Destiny 2 is exactly the opposite: almost all the missions take place in unique locations which, if it weren't for these assaults, would no longer be visited, certainly taking away something important from the game. This perhaps explains Bungie's choice in transforming missions into assaults and making sure that these locations are always replayable and not lost. What had to be done If the choices on the campaign and on the assaults are questionable, the same thing cannot be said for the end game phase, starting from the changes made to the progression system which turns out to be slower and more demanding and which consequently exponentially increases the longevity of the game. To reach maximum power, now at 385, it will no longer be enough for you to complete only those simple but profitable activities that you did before, you will also have to perform all the much more difficult ones that will allow you to reach and break the wall of the two inserted ~soft caps~. the first at 340 the second at 370 points. Not everyone will like that the acquisition of equipment in the various activities is linked to the character class, so if you have three Titans you will not make three rounds for the items but only one: this restriction has been inserted to prevent those who use only one class can swap all equipment and start at a higher power level before claiming weekly rewards. Calculate that in just over 50 hours of play we arrived around 355 finishing all the milestones and all the activities with the three characters except the most demanding ones, so we were under-powered. Not only is this the change made to the in-game economy, even more important is the revisiting of almost all exotic weapons. The modified weapons are much more efficient and the gameplay is now more satisfying when we hold them. Furthermore, the prodigy has been added, an upgrade that will be found by means of catalyst crystals which will require us to perform specific tasks in order to activate them and make them definitive. There are many other small minor changes included in the game, from the restocking of items purchasable from vendors della Torre to the reduction of the experience points necessary to obtain the aesthetic engrams (effectively decreasing the pressure on the microtransaction factor) up to the emote wheel which today allows us to equip four of our choice. However, the bulk of the changes was devoted to the search for the maximum possible longevity, thus inviting longtime players to return to the Destiny galaxy, stimulating their appetite and also with the return of two old exotic icons such as the Suros Regimen and the Simulator Sleeper, obtainable through a rather long quest. As far as we are concerned, the fact of bringing back weapons from the first chapter - as long as the new ones remain in greater numbers - gives a sense of continuity to the game universe calculating that the events of Destiny 2 take place a few months after the third year of the original. Escalation protocol Even in terms of new things to do, Warmind certainly doesn't hold back. Finally the map is exploited in an intelligent way with objects to find, quests and points of interest scattered everywhere; it is not yet an RPG map, but certainly some progress has been made. Here comes the second den of the raid called Pinnacolo Siderale, which concludes the trilogy of the raid The Leviathan: here too Bungie focuses on longevity and difficulty by considerably raising the minimum power to be able to survive and proposing a significantly longer den than the previous one seen in the Curse of Osiris, seasoned with new mechanics that not only entertained us, but which in the final stages required us a lot of effort to be able to understand how it works. Too bad that being under leveled we had to give up after hours and hours of attempts. Finally, here's the icing on the cake: Escalation Protocol, Destiny 2's new horde mode, consisting of seven waves of enemies of increasing difficulty and number. To date, this mode is absolutely the most challenging that the game can offer, with a recommended light of 370 for the first two levels, 380 for the next three and 400 for the final two. Activated without the need for any consumables, directly on the surface of the planet, this activity is the most beautiful wave mode included in the game as well as being the most difficult. To date, only a handful of adventurers have managed to complete it, players whose luck has played a decisive role since Intensification Protocol can be activated on patrol and therefore can be faced by all users on the planet by dividing the burden among the various connected groups . Surely it is nothing new or overwhelming in terms of originality, but the community is definitely in agreement in promoting it with full marks as we are too: we had to document ourselves to be able to see it at the highest levels (we, in addition to the first we can't go on for now), and actually seeing a dozen players engaged in facing hordes of increasingly fierce enemies trying to survive at any cost makes me want to turn on the game and try again. At this juncture Bungie hasn't missed a beat this time, all the various activities are beautiful to look at and play, there's nothing more to add. What about PvP? As for the multiplayer sector, the news are not many but quite important. Let's start with ranked matches, with the ranked system it is divided into ~value~ for quick matches and ~glory~ for competitive matches: nothing new under the sun, this is true, but certainly something more for PvP lovers who climbing to the highest ranks of the competitive playlist will see Redrix's Greatsword pulse rifle delivered, praised by Bungie as an ~ultimate~ weapon for multiplayer. We also tried a lot in the various modes and we must say that some improvements are felt. Clearly the exotics do the bulk, which as previously written, thanks to the big changes, make their way heavily in the meta, lowering the ~time to kill~, one of the most discussed elements .. The games make their (re)appearance private, loudly requested and whose lack at the release of the game was one of those ~unpopular~ choices which, added to everything else, put the Bungie game in difficulty. The private ones have hardly been changed from what they were in Destiny: same type of customization such as timer, respawn time and game modes, and still missing the spectator mode. It is difficult to say whether it is an obligation dictated by technical limits or a precise choice, the most attentive of you will remember that during the reveal of The Warmind one of the players wore the Major League Gaming shirt, thereforenothing forbids that in the future we could see MLG events held and organized on Destiny 2. Destiny's multiplayer is still to be understood even after this DLC, for now a patch with balancing does not seem planned or at least not until September, so if you loved the Destiny 2 PvP you will love it even more, if you hated it you will not change your mind.", "date": "2018-05-14", "grade": "8.0"}
