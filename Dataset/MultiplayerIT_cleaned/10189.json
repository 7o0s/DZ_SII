The question is not far-fetched, in the sense that the public always assumes that the hero fears nothing and does not hesitate in the slightest in the face of danger. In particular, the video game protagonists have always shown superhuman abilities, managing to face dozens, if not thousands of opponents without flinching and being able to drink dozens, if not hundreds of healing potions and mana within a few minutes without ever having to go to the bathroom . What if it wasn't that simple? What if the constant clashes with horrible creatures cost them something in terms of sanity too? Has anyone ever thought that, blow after blow, downed enemy after downed enemy, sustained wound after sustained wound, even the toughest of heroes might need some psychological (and urological, in the case of RPG protagonists) support? action)? In the Darkest Dungeon 2 review we will find out whether or not it is worth leading a party of heroes always on the verge of madness. In the carriage! The relationships between the characters are important The first Darkest Dungeon put the player in command of a group of heroes who had to enter dark dungeons to hunt for enemies and treasures. The Lovecraftian smell had led the developers to focus the game system on madness, that is, on the progressive loss of sanity of the characters to which many of the other mechanics were connected. Darkest Dungeon 2 replicates the concept in an almost slavish way, but places it in a completely different scenario. Once the party is assembled, the player must in fact take control of a carriage carrying the light of hope. Then he must begin the journey that will take him from city to city, from inn to inn, until his final goal. On the road, however, anything can really happen and the bold heroes will have to contend with demons of all kinds, internal and external, so to speak. The idea of the carriage probably stems from the desire to create something more dynamic than the first Darkest Dungeon, eliminating the concept of operational base from which to start all operations. In this sense, the sequel is more of a travel game, literally on the road, with procedurally generated maps that offer many branches and many places to find to get bonuses, equipment or to go down another step towards the abyss of the mind. When you arrive at an intersection, you are asked where you want to go, with the type of main building you will encounter along the way in plain sight, so as to make the player's choices more aware. As underlined, the carriage must be controlled directly and it too has its own resistance and equipment, so much so that some events you come across while traveling are precisely designed to damage it. Sometimes simple obstacles or traps must also be avoided, which risk ending our adventure prematurely. Everything works quite well, except that each game of Darkest Dungeon 2 can last several hours: an aspect which, as we will see, represents a problem in its own way. the combat system of Darkest Dungeon 2 Darkest Dungeon 2 offers many events Among the main events to be faced on the road there are of course some unfriendly encounters with more or less large creatures. The combat system has remained almost identical to that of the first chapter: party members and enemies take turns based on the initiative and use their techniques and skills in relation to the position assumed in the deployment. For example, a pistol shot can be aimed at the rear, but not against the first enemy in the row, while a slash can reach the first two creatures of the line-up, but not the third or fourth. Similarly some attacks are inhibited when the character is in the rear. There are exceptions, such as bosses that make a separate story, but in general a lot depends on the class of the hero and how he developed it. That said, the heroes who take the most hits and don't die see their stress levels rise, leading to real crises in battle and developing psychological traits that affect their overall performance. Furthermore, over time the relationships between party members also begin to change, making the concept of positioning and collaboration less trivial and increasing the factors to be taken into consideration to get out alive and get to the end of the map. Stylistically Darkest Dungeon 2 is very nice At the inn the heroes can rest, buy or sell equipment, distribute their experience points and perform all those micromanagement actionsof the party that are needed to continue, including some that alleviate stress problems. The problem here is a not so great balance and the apparent arbitrariness of some decisions. The player of his own does not have direct control of the party except in a few events in which, faced with choices, he must decide which of the proposals to support, rejecting the others. The result is that some relationships that are created within the group never feel like the result of one's own actions, but like something lowered from above by a mysterious algorithm. Longer, but tires sooner The combat system is similar to that of its predecessor During the first games the result of the expeditions is written, let's say: the heroes will all die. You are hardly able to get to the end of the road with the first selected characters, who serve more than anything else to acclimatize with the numerous game systems, fortunately explained by a rich text tutorial that can be viewed at any time. One party dies, another one arises, one might say, but in the case of Darkest Dungeon 2 we found it quite heavy, due to the duration of the individual games, longer than the average of titles of the genre. As mentioned, in the first chapter we always started from an operational base, where it was possible to hire new heroes, heal the old ones and so on. Here you lead one party at a time and lead them on adventures until all of their members are killed. However, the game structure tends to create slowdowns which, added to the characters' propensity for chatter, often useless, lengthen each journey quite a bit. Incidentally: in some cases they can last several hours and, honestly, having to start over after each defeat is a bit heavy, either because the less precariousness of the group leads you to get to know it and in a certain way to become attached to its dynamics , either because we are talking about an important time anyway, which clashes a bit with the typical agility of roguelikes, which usually offer much faster game cycles precisely to be able to focus more on the progression of the character / party. A character who is overly stressed can go insane If we add to this the fact that leading a single group at a time greatly reduces the intensity of some systems, including madness, which appear more diluted within the experience, the result is that Darkest Dungeon 2 got us tired sooner than expected, despite the greater number of contents and the greater variety of situations that can be encountered. Technically, the Red Hook Studios title does its thing, presenting itself exactly in the visual style of the first chapter, with which continuity is total, but offering more animations, multiple environments and a 3D world made in the style of the game that is very simple but nice to look at. From this point of view it is very successful and it is evident how it was built starting from the previous experience. So expect drawings with very hard and marked strokes and particularly accentuated dark nuances, tones that are also reflected in the soundtrack, richer in sounds and music than its predecessor. The variety of scenarios and the number of enemies are also good, more than in the first episode.", "date": "2023-05-08", "grade": "7.0"}
