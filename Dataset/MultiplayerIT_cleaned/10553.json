A free platform such as the App Store that can also be used by small developers could only be overwhelmed by this kind of drift and, after a long wandering, we have probably managed to find the best among the exponents of this new, old trend . Alive 4-ever emulates the input of the Valve masterpiece but changes its substance abundantly, ending up creating a series of completely new dynamics and, albeit not perfect, consistent with the platform that hosts it. Alive 4-anyone The offer is based on the thirty missions included, all obviously based on bullets and the undead but able to distinguish themselves thanks to the inclusion of different objectives, from the simple killing of a certain number of enemies to saving the poor guy on duty or recovery of the briefcase, both then to be returned to the appropriate collection point. All very simple, therefore, with some interesting choices demonstrating a reasoned approach such as that, collecting the bag to carry to safety, being able to use only the secondary weapon in one hand, having the other engaged. To give a little variety, it was then decided to insert a double growth system, linked to the acquisition of experience and money, which can be earned by eliminating opponents and completing the secondary objectives proposed during each mission; despite the points to be assigned to the four parameters of one's alter ego - health, quantity of bullets per magazine, critical damage and accuracy - and the good number of rifles and pistols available, the element of growth however remains only useful to give a sense of progression, as the choices are rather automatic and the role-playing impact is limited. In any case, irons in the fire have been put a lot and all of it can also be used by four users at the same time, albeit only locally and not via the internet, unfortunately. As also from the photos, Alive 4-ever takes advantage of a view from above, fixed on the character so as to allow the user to move on only two axes, taking advantage of the analog lever and the virtual wheel which, respectively to move and shoot, manage quite well at their job despite a certain clutter on the screen and with a little training they end up proving quite accurate. In general, the experience therefore stands out for its immediacy and frenzy, leaving little room for tactics - an element that distances it a lot from the aforementioned Left 4 Dead - however making it best dress the typical rapid use made up of many small sessions typical of a portable device , not solely game-oriented like iPhone. Technically the work done is excellent, with the backdrops precise and full of details as well as the poor survivors and the zombies themselves, with the latter present in a good amount of different types, more or less rapid, lethal and equipped with peculiar characteristics. An overall more than valid and well-studied offer, soon enriched with a Survival mode that should be released in conjunction with version 1.1. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-09-04", "grade": "8.4"}
