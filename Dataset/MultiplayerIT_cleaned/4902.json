It is probable that Microsoft wanted to go and fish out an old production with some charisma to offer to the new audience, but even looking at the old catalog of the first Xbox, perhaps the choice could have fallen on some other title. The idea, therefore, is that someone in Redmond loved the Vodoo doll in question so much that he absolutely wanted to review it in an updated form, sponsored an operation that at first sight seems to have rather bizarre contours: in fact, we are faced with a not overly well-groomed remaster of a not exactly memorable title, yet in all this a certain sense can be found in the re-proposition of a formula that now seems completely out of time. Given that the recipe for the construction of the 3D platform has always been firmly in the hands of Nintendo alone - and years later this is even more evident - between the end of the 90s and the beginning of 2000 a series of more or less successful alternatives emerged, whose best results probably came from those who distanced themselves more from the ~Mariesque~ formulas of pure platforming to go and explore border territories with adventure. Precisely in these hybrid areas, sheltered from uncomfortable comparisons with plumbers and titles of a very different caliber, it is possible to find game solutions that are still interesting, and Voodoo Vince Remastered is here to prove it. Voodoo Vince: Remastered is a concentration of (black) magic from Louisiana, between jazz and zombies A strange world It's not easy to establish why 3D platformers are now almost extinct, and on this front Voodoo Vince Remastered, as well as the new but equally nostalgic Yooka-Laylee, can provide some clues in this regard. Perhaps the continuous search for graphic spectacularization with a cinematographic taste and the need to maintain extreme coherence between animations and the development of the action has led to the disappearance of 3D games so averse to being largely scripted or ~adjusted~ to favor the graphic compactness and the needs of the screenplay. The new taste has also favored the return of 2D or in any case of the action on the two-dimensional plane, for which the platform has found its way in the classic setting, largely abandoning the third dimension, which has become less and less manageable with the required elegance nowadays. The clumsiness, but also the typical humorous and creative approach to the various game situations that were typical of the 3D platformer fully emerge in Voodoo Vince Remastered, essentially re-proposing the same game that came out in 2003. It was already a rather late title at the time, towards the end of the wave of the early 2000s and for this reason perhaps less impactful in the contemporary panorama and yet also among the most complex titles in its sub-genre, in some respects. It cannot be said that Vodoo Vince releases an irresistible charisma, yet the world in which he moves has kept intact its particular charm made of voodoo witchcraft, playing on the typical atmosphere of the Creole setting of New Orleans and its surroundings. The story is simple and sees the protagonist, accidentally animated by an accidental spreading of voodoo powder, go in search of this precious Zombie Dust and rescue his creator, Madam Charmaine, from the clutches of the evil Kosmo. The classic adventurous journey with premises perfectly in line with the platform canon, but the characterization of places and characters is always very particular and gives Voodoo Vince a very marked identity. The same probably cannot be said of the level design, intricate but little studied and rhythmic compared to other genre colleagues. Special powers and normal mechanics All game elements fall precisely within the canon of the 3D platformer, which is why at the time Voodoo Vince failed to carve out an important space for himself in the videogame landscape, although his particular atmosphere has always distinguished him from numerous colleagues. The protagonist has to jump between platforms and fight against enemies, in a variety of situations that are actually rather small, which essentially boils down to the need to find scattered objects for the levels and the conclusion of these. There is no shortage of classic collectibles that can enhance Vince's skills as well as boss fights, quite amusing moments even if the combat itself is not exactly the elementmost successful of the entire game. Being a voodoo doll, the mechanics of the clashes include a good dose of masochism given that thanks to the magic the pain perpetrated against the protagonist is reflected on the surrounding characters with rather macabre effects, albeit filtered by the ever-present black humor. We are therefore witnessing various types of self- and hetero-inflicted violence by the indestructible rag doll in large quantities, expandable and upgradeable with the collection of magic dust and other bonuses. Beyond the surprise effect given by the great variety of different spells, fighting with enemies is hardly stimulating and makes the use of evasive maneuvers almost preferable to save yourself from the clashes and concentrate rather on the platform phase and on the exploration of the levels. Voodoo Vince looks to Conker for its strong characterization and widespread humor, even if it doesn't reach the out-of-the-box absurdity of the Rare game and its liveliness in level design, yet it has several truly peculiar and enjoyable moments that are further amplified today by the almost total absence of similar contemporary titles. There are considerable ups and downs in the construction of the levels, but in some cases the puzzles to be solved are particularly well constructed and the situations in which Vince finds himself remain etched in memory. Xbox One goals 41 unlockable achievements for the usual 1000 points are the loot available to achievement hunters in Voodoo Vince Remastered. In line with the structure of the game, which is based on a progression by levels, various objectives are linked to the achievement of certain nodes within the story, which may concern bosses, scenarios, moments in the plot or particular powers of Vince. Many achievements can therefore be achieved already during a first standard run, but for the complete collection you need to resort to collectibles, of course. The magic of voodoo Vince's strange journey that takes us from the French Quarter of New Orleans to the bayou and beyond, passing through underground areas and ancient mysterious mansions, is always pleasant and full of surprises even for those who don't have the elements to appeal to nostalgia, not having tried the original. The characterization of places and characters is certainly the trump card of this Beep Games title, counterbalancing the slavish fidelity to the canons of the 3D platform with rather unconventional atmospheres, leveraging on the mysterious charm of Louisiana, with its particular culture and legends it carries with it. Black magic, voodoo, kingdom of the dead and of course jazz are constantly the backdrop to the doll's adventures, in a mix that actually has few meters of comparison in this genre and had practically none already at the time of its first release. Voodoo Vince Remastered is a reissue that leaves all the original elements of the game unchanged, therefore the work carried out by the developers was limited to a general increase in resolution to 1080p with an increase in the quality of the textures and tweaks to the polygonal models and partially to the scenarios, but the graphic system has remained practically that of 2003. The result is a game with an obviously dated appearance but which thanks to its cartoonish characterization manages to present itself quite well even after many years, although the level design remains qualitatively discontinuous as at the time . The glue of the entire journey is given by the rarefied atmosphere of the game, well underlined by the jazz notes that often emerge during Vince's adventures and on which the protagonist himself delights in some of the most memorable moments.", "date": "2017-04-29", "grade": "7.0"}
