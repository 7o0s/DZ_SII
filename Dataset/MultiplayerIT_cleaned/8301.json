Mini Basketball takes up the formula that Miniclip had already used in a fairly effective way with the previous Mini Football, however applying it in this case to basketball. In the game we will therefore be able to build our dream team, enhance its components, possibly change the scheme and engage in one-on-one, single or elimination tournament matches to bring home coins and glory. Goal achieved? We reveal it to you in the Mini Basketball review. Methods and contents Mini Basketball, the team management phase Let's start with the contents of the package, which, as mentioned, takes up the traditional structure of many freemium productions, in particular the trading card-based enhancement system that has contributed to the extraordinary success of titles such as Clash Royale. Using the unpacking mechanism and a quantity of rewards that appears rather generous and constant, we will be able to obtain new players and new customization elements to modify the team. Clearly this aspect immediately expresses a setting that appears very friendly in the first hours and not places no limit on the use of the game, but which will then inevitably apply correctors useful for monetization: the notorious paywalls, which in a free product with upgradeable units are normal, provided they are not too aggressive. The interface is designed very well and is easy to navigate, so you don't need any particular tutorials to be able to find your way around everything that this experience makes available to us. Beyond the free-to-play aspects, there are three modes accessible almost immediately: 1 Vs 1, Tournaments and Slam Dunk, with more options coming soon. The first two practically express the same values, only that they are declined in the context of quick matches, rigorously against human opponents (but in truth you can smell the smell of bots from a mile away...), or in a tournament structure with direct elimination. The variation on the theme is brought by the Slam Dunk mode, i.e. a free throw session that is managed as a special event, with access restrictions every few hours and large rewards. Gameplay Mini Basketball, a throw-in If the structure of Mini Basketball works, despite its glaring lack of originality, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the gameplay, which is immediately a bit too inconsistent. In fact, the tackles are not valued and appear slippery, while getting to the basket proves to be really trivial (even with three-pointers) and the result is monstrously unbalanced scores. As mentioned above, the speed of matchmaking and the lack of any related problems to latency or disconnections, but above all the absolute incapacity and passivity of the opponents suggests that they are mostly bots, and this being the case it is clear that it is difficult to obtain a challenge worthy of the name, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the experience . Graphics and sound Mini Basketball, a sequence of exultation However, the problems don't end there, because we found the graphics in Mini Basketball really ugly. On a purely artistic level, a good job has been done and the design of the players is nice, with that ~chibi~ style that sees them move on the field with the proportions of a child. The fact is that in movement the animations turn out to be woody and incoherent, while the celebrations are very few, also ugly. The sound doesn't take a hit, characterized by absolutely generic songs and essential effects, unable to enhance the game action.", "date": "2022-03-20", "grade": "6.0"}
