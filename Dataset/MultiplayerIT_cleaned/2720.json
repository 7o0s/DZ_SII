After the February release, Team Ninja waited several months before releasing the first of the dedicated DLCs, but then never stopped, closing just in these pre-Christmas days with ~The First Samurai~. In this review of Nioh 2: The First Samurai we will mainly talk about the new content, then leaving a general judgment on the work for the full version that will arrive on PS5 and PC in February. Further back in history As we know the Nioh2 DLCs have accustomed us to time travel. Where the basic campaign can be considered both a prequel and a sequel to the progenitor, the additional contents of the second chapter delve into the most remote past of the Japanese Middle Ages, mixing history and folklore, real characters and myths of one of the most fascinating cultures as always in the world. With ~The First Samurai~ we even go back to the eighth century, before the very birth of the concept of Samurai and the title of this DLC is no coincidence in this sense which, however, puts historicity aside and focuses on closing the vicissitudes, trying to make sense of all this historical coming and going. The First Samurai is successful in his desire to close the circle, less so in the quality of the writing, also thanks to a very short duration that places him in last place in the rankings from this point of view. The two main missions, accompanied by another dozen of secondary tasks, can be completed as usual in four or five hours, but the part dedicated to the narrative implications is once again hasty and has little impact. Relative problem for Nioh veterans, who are now aware of the more folkloric than qualitative focus of a fluctuating and far from profound narrative. The goal in this case is to close the accounts with Otakemaru, putting some of the more boss fights on the plate demanding of the game, perhaps even tending to imbalance in some respects. Despite this, we arrive at the end of The First Samurai satisfied with the journey, and also ready, why not, for the next chapter. A gameplay from ~Dream~ New DLC and therefore new difficulty level. Anyone who has had the opportunity to deepen their run on Nioh 2 sufficiently will now be able to try their luck even with what, to all intents and purposes, will remain the most difficult difficulty present in the game, barring particular surprises. Dream of the Nioh, this new addition, dramatically increases the challenge, pushing players to make the most of every available resource and, more importantly, to play really well with the creation of their own build. We are not yet able to worthily face this level of difficulty with our character, but we are certainly talking about a challenge dedicated to the most savvy players and to those who never abandon the streets of Team Ninja's Japan for too long. Dream of the Nioh, but somehow close to it, the Japanese developer has inserted something that we all expected, the return of a totally endgame mode along the lines of the Abyss of the first chapter. The Underworld, this is the definition, develops almost identically, putting players in front of more than one hundred levels of increasing difficulty and within which to recover more and more useful pieces for your build or to recover resources to be used for growth. Compared to the old curses, the Kodama come to our aid here, giving the player a series of random blessings which are then used to make their way through this hell on Earth. On closer inspection, the Underworld is the only real content that dramatically increases the hours, and which among other things has legitimized the team not to insert a new weapon available, but only a series of additional skills for each of those already present. We do not deny that this lack, although relatively minor given the already wide choice present, is felt where by now we were used to testing new movesets for each additional content, but this cannot be what overshadows all the good that is What convinced us very little about The First Samurai is the work done on the settings and level design. Nioh hardly stood out from this point of view, but both the base campaign and the previous two DLCs had been able to give a series of glimpses and some found in the rather interesting maps. This time that inspiration seems to have taken a back seat, leaving behind the best moments and giving away a couple of uninspired villages and a wood just enough. Special mention for the new Yokai, perhaps the best additions to the roster since the first chapter .Sufficiently varied in design and behavior, they flesh out a group that is not exactly exciting in terms of numbers.", "date": "2020-12-23", "grade": "8.0"}
