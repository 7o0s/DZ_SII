Last year the first episode took off slowly throughout Europe and then took off thanks to the undeniable intrinsic quality of the product, the excellent marketing campaign and the various bundles, a success probably not entirely expected which has what in Japan is a series close to the fourth chapter, with some variations on the theme and a cartoon in the works. In any case, here we are at Pandora's Box, an absolutely enjoyable title with many merits that will somehow have to deal with its predecessor, making the series practically a genre in itself, and at the same time with the above premise. Layton number 2 To want to go too far in synthesis, it is an almost academic example of ~more of the same~, in the sense that the structure is the carbon copy of the previous one and immediately demonstrates for what it is, that is something designed for serialization much faster, to be enjoyed one after the other or almost, not with the wait, the previews, the information, the hype. This does not mean that Layton act second is a title that is nothing less than highly enjoyable or advisable, only that by representing an articulated narrated version of the puzzle week it is linked to rather narrow tracks, with the return of the interface of the first, of the dialogues , movements limited to moving from one environment to another and no interaction other than the search for hotspots, useful for collecting coins for aid and puzzles not distributed along the unfolding of the plot. Although the sense of novelty regarding the atmosphere and the story is slightly lost, the narrative once again plays a leading role with Layton and little Luke engaged in the search for a mysterious vase, somehow related to the searches and death of our gentleman detective's mentor; after a few moments of initial low, the story can be said to overcome that of the first. The movies are wonderful, even better than in The Village of Mysteries, as is the variety of environments given that instead of a single large geographical coordinate it was decided to review several different places: London, trains and curious villages - still - including, with a set of characters that predictably includes old glories and many introductions, winking more than once to all those who have tried the previous one. As in the past, there is no shortage of side elements: cameras to collect and above all the difficult task of making a hamster lose weight, secondary elements accessible through the same menu as always but useful for distracting attention from the main tracks, also partially opening the doors to the usual tasty selection of additional puzzles. Luke, this reminds me of... For obvious reasons it is useless to ponder over every single puzzle: all 150 puzzles proposed by Professor Layton and Pandora's Box are enjoyable and intelligent, with some types that repeat themselves and the constant alternation of questions closely related to the plot, thematic , and others decidedly more impromptu even if presented in such a specious way as to become nice. In short, we go from numbers to the theory of dilemmas, from small graphic executions to special cases of famous games, always and in any case without requiring enormous calculations and masterfully explaining what is being asked to do and why. The new panel for writing down notes while a puzzle is being played is a small and welcome solution that allows you to have a rough time when you have to draw and in other cases to take notes. Obviously, the Picarati system and that of the aids are back, which have remained substantially unchanged compared to the previous encounter and possibly the result of competition with the other people with whom the cartridge is shared. In its equality with the past, therefore, Layton offers a high-level experience, enjoyable from start to finish, with a slightly higher longevity than in the past and a remarkable attention to detail that is transmitted by the perfect management of the nib and its interaction with the backgrounds up to the study of the menus, which give their best in the puzzles by presenting themselves in a multiplicity of different forms, always or almost up to the situation and proof of misunderstanding. We have already mentioned the films and their beauty, all the rest of the graphics are an alternation of fixed backdrops gradually superimposed on the basis of need and with the text on the screen always well positioned. An earful for the soundtrack, which in and of itself is beautiful, like the sounds, only this time too it repeats itself endlessly with really poca variety, a shame as Level 5 seems to have perfectly in mind how to select its composers.", "date": "2009-09-24", "grade": "8.8"}
