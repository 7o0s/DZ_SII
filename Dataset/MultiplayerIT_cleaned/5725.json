After years of fruitful agreements with Microsoft, or rather with Xbox 360, for the first time the temporal exclusivity of additional content passes to Sony. Consequently Awakening, the first of the DLCs that we will see during 2016, arrives a month early on PlayStation 4. The formula is the tested one: four maps, plus the usual zombie setting. Everything as per the textbook, even the price of  14.99. The first Call of Duty: Black Ops III DLC arrives... let's see how it went! Lots of highs and some lows The four maps make good use of Black Ops III's revamped movement system, but they're not all new. Skyjacked is a remake of the ~old~ and appreciated Hijacked of the second chapter of the Treyarch series, only we are no longer on a yacht in the middle of the sea, but aboard a sort of flying transport above the skies of Zurich. The design of the map is virtually the same, a central square surrounded by multi-level structures and side walkways, but there are also small additions to update it to the wall run and the exploitation of the boosted jump. It goes without saying that the tight spaces make it an extremely frenetic and ~caciarona~ map. Splash is instead the most colorful of the package: it is set inside a water park, including swimming pools, slides, tunnels, splashes and streams, all in the name of a cartoonish pirate style. The map isn't huge but has a rather intricate design, with numerous blind corners, covered paths that cut through entire areas and overlooks the hotspots of the junctions, from where you can enjoy long lines of fire free from obstacles .... but be careful who can pop out of a slide or a swimming pool! Undoubtedly the best map of the package, both for the style chosen and for the actual design, even if to be honest it doesn't do much justice to the renewed player movement system. More than the wall run and power jump, it's the underwater part that ~stands out~ in Splash. There is a glitch that some players exploit to their advantage and which needless to say could unbalance the games: Treyarch is aware of it and is working to fix it, while for our part it did not seem decisive for the purpose of evaluating the 'experience. Rise takes us to gray Zurich, but no longer in the skies, but inside a construction site: it's a decidedly ~average~ and functional map, neither ugly nor boring but you will hardly choose it between one game and another. However, it is generous in size, consequently it has long and clean lines of fire, but outside there are areas literally invaded by containers and materials from the construction site which give us the possibility of ~simulating~ close combat. There is no shortage of defiles, underwater sections and indoor parts on several levels. In short, there is everything that can be expected from a Call of Duty setting, but nothing particularly shines. Gauntlet is simplistic to call it a map, in fact they are three arenas in one, three settings enclosed within a single setting: snowy landscape, lush forest and gray city suburb. All sandwiched between the two ends of a large research facility. The green portion is rather linear, offering fast corridors with long shooting lines: the wallpaper effect of the forest makes you smile, it's a texture in all respects! The central area is reserved for perennial snow. Here we find a nice mix of Black Ops III's new abilities, which you can whip around a ravine surrounded by openings on structures, wall runs and boosted jumps. The city portion is full of blind corners and narrow spaces, all in favor of close-quarters clashes. Together with Splash, Gauntlet is the best map of the package: larger than the others, it does not suffer from its diversification into three settings which, on the contrary, are well blended with each other, thanks also to passage corridors that allow us to set ambushes and ambushes with great satisfaction. And then there's the new zombie setting. Setting aside the noir city of the base game, Shadows of Evil, it's back to the classic, WWII with the much loved undead Nazis. Der Eisendrache is the direct sequel to The Giant, the map featured in the Black Ops III Collector's Edition. The mechanics are the usual: hordes of undead are fought in and outside a gigantic Austrian castle. The level design is very classy and the setting, full of secrets, is very well built between courtyards, climbs, cable cars, huge rooms and large open spaces where you can activate electrical machinery. In short, we are from the parts of Hellboy-style occult Nazism; such a fascinating settingyou how damn fun to properly eviscerate. There is obviously everything that is expected, including Gobblegum to ~personalize~ our game even more in the name of closer and more fruitful cooperation.", "date": "2016-02-08", "grade": null}
