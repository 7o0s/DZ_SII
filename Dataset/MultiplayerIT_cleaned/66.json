Stormbreaker, subtitle ~Alex Rider~, complete with a beautifully displayed poster. Driven by curiosity, I decided to download the aforementioned game on my mobile phone and I discovered not only that it was an arcade-adventure, but that (and it never hurts) it was also fun. Stormbreaker as I mentioned is the mobile version tie-in of the children's film of the same name, halfway between Spy Kids and a James Bond film. The plot will see us take on the role of Alex Rider, a 14-year-old teenager, grandson of a famous agent of MI6 (the British secret services) who died in service under mysterious circumstances. After his uncle's departure, our Alex will be ~enlisted~ by the services of His Majesty to thwart the crazy plans of a mad criminal, who intends to threaten humanity with a deadly virus. During the game we will retrace all the salient points of the adventure seen on the big screen making extensive use of gadgets and special moves. In particular, our Alex will be able to make use of 5 ~tools~ for the perfect secret agent: among these we cannot fail to mention the multipurpose yo-yo, which we can use both as a weapon against enemies and as a very useful grappling hook to reach otherwise inaccessible points or activate doors, the zip-pack which is actually a very powerful substance with which we will be able to dissolve metal parts or other obstacles that impede our path, and of course the smoke bombs with which we will obscure the cameras and be able to go unnoticed without alerting the security systems. Along the way we will make extensive use of these tools that we will be able to choose from our inventory by simply pressing the # key. As far as interaction is concerned, our young secret agent will be able to move freely using all the buttons on the keyboard (the slide is beautiful) with the possibility of learning new actions and combat moves. The title stands on a good longevity with about 20 levels to be completed and a difficulty all in all quite well calibrated. Moving on to the purely technical side, Stormbreaker could be defined as ~average~: very accurate in some points, a little less in others, in particular in the design of some levels which, although clean and well designed, sometimes turned out to be a bit sparse. Even the audio sector is pleasant with nice sound effects and the sporadic presence of accompanying music.
