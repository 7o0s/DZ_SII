These are the terrible shadows that characterize the past of Jessica Valiant, a special agent who during the Second World War earned the nickname ~Silent Death~ in the field because of her extraordinary ability to stealthily eliminate her targets. An action she conducted together with her husband Jack, forming a lethal couple; until the Nazis won the war and the man, betrayed by a person he considered a friend, was captured and horribly killed. Taking refuge in Brazil, Jessica had decided to indulge in alcohol and impromptu relationships, now devoid of a purpose in life or any interest; until she received a letter from the Resistance with the names and photos of the three responsible for her husband's death. At that point the woman realized she had to put on her old uniform again, take up her silenced pistol, return to the United States and carry out her revenge. A purpose to be completed with a view to a mini-campaign which, similarly to The Adventures of Pistolero Joe, is made up of three different missions. In this case, however, shorter and less significant... Dear Diary The men Jessica must eliminate are Hans Stiglitz, an officer specializing in torture; Chuck Lorentz, the actor who betrayed Jack in exchange for a prominent place in the Nazi propaganda machine; and finally Gerhardt Dunkel, the instigator of the operation. In order to get his hands on them, the Silent Death Agent will be able to count on a special equipment, which renounces the loudness of the grenades in favor of a powerful silenced pistol, without however missing the effectiveness of machine guns and shotguns in case of need; but also on the ability to compress one's chest to cross narrow passages, slithering like a snake. The latter mechanic takes up one of the three special abilities seen in the campaign of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, using it for the purpose of gameplay decidedly more devoted to stealth action than the norm. In fact, if during the original campaign with B.J. Blazkowicz was yes possible to proceed silently, but you often ended up alerting the guards and finding yourself with dozens and dozens of soldiers to face, in The Diaries of Agent Silent Death you will have to pay more attention and study well the behavior of enemies in order to carry out eliminations speed and avoid head-on collisions. The latter remain possible even in the role of Jessica, but they turn out to be substantially more complicated, as the woman has limited resistance to damage: playing with her cards face up, game over is always around the corner. Trial and error If stealth isn't really in the strings of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, how can you build a mini campaign on it? In many ways the perplexities born after the test of the epilogue of The Freedom Chronicles returned when we were able to try some of the solutions put in place by the developers to avoid resorting excessively to a trial & error style approach, even though present in some phases. The first element is represented by the effectiveness of the silenced pistol, which can eliminate targets with a single shot if it is aimed at the head, or in any case with a quick burst if the aim is wrong. The second is a short bullet time that is activated when we kill an enemy who is next to another soldier, or when someone is about to discover us: a few moments which, however, are enough to place a bullet between our opponent's eyes. turn and close the file. Finally, a structure with watertight compartments for the levels: where stealth fails and you end up setting off the alarms, with the obligation therefore to take out the heavy weapons and try your hand at the engaging, traditional run & gun expertly forged by MachineGames , it will only happen for a limited time, and once all the reinforcements are killed, you will be able to enjoy cover again for the next section of the map. Four questions to MachineGames Wolfenstein II: The Diaries of Agent Silent Death will be based on stealth action. Will we end up experimenting with quite a few trial & error sections? What is your opinion on this type of approach? The Journals of Agent Silent Death was made primarily for players who enjoy stealth, silent kills, and infiltration. Stealth in Wolfenstein is not enforced in any way, although attacking head on is the samehooray in a more difficult situation to manage.When planning the DLCs, was your intention to emphasize the use of the three special abilities that Blazkowicz gains during the second part of the main campaign? Do you think it was a good decision to have users choose a single power at a time? In Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, players can obtain all three skills, but introducing them one at a time was a good way to make sure players were familiar with each skill before getting the next one. For the DLC we wanted to further explore these power-ups and try to build the level design and experience around them. The introduction of three new characters shows how much you believe in the Wolfenstein universe, trying to enrich it with new faces, scenarios and stories. Do you think it would be possible to make a new episode of the series without Blazkowicz? We believe that Wolfenstein has tremendous potential to tell fantastic stories beyond Blazkowicz's, and the introduction of an alternate timeline demonstrates that we have liberated this narrative universe from the confines of WWII, opening up a wide range of possibilities for telling the fight against the Nazis. The first DLC, The Adventures of Pistolero Joe, had a good story and great characters, but of course it couldn't compete with the amazing narrative of the main campaign. Can we expect a more nuanced storyline for Agent Silent Death? The Journals of Agent Silent Death is similar to the first DLC in terms of size, but varies in terms of approach as it features a completely different protagonist. The story will play less of a central role, but the gameplay will be as solid as that of the original campaign. A short adventure In the interview they granted us (see box), the developers of The Diaries of Agent Silent Death actually spoke of a lesser focus on storytelling than the first DLC, and unfortunately this makes itself felt, especially if we consider how much the story , the dialogues and the characterization of the characters have contributed to the success of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. It's a pity that the figure of Jessica Valiant is so little explored, except through a series of rather obvious reflections on her addiction to alcohol, and above all that the story as a whole ends up running out in a very short time. In fact, an hour and a half is enough to complete the three parts of the mini-campaign, not even that intensely lived: the obligation to proceed silently leads to avoiding the enemies that we cannot eliminate without setting off the alarms, therefore the armored ones and the mechanical beasts. and there are no bosses altogether. To this we must add a substantial recycling of many of the graphic assets already seen in Blazkowicz's adventure, with few unpublished situations and scenarios. Therefore, if we had promoted The Adventures of Pistolero Joe with reserve due to the limited duration and lack of depth of the package, we certainly cannot turn a blind eye to the inconsistency of this second DLC, which seems to us to have been created with less desire and inspiration. The hope is that the Season Pass of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus closes with a sharp ending, pending further developments for the franchise.", "date": "2018-02-01", "grade": null}
