Four hundred years ago Miguel de Cervantes wrote Don Quixote de la Mancha, a ruthless desecration of the same epic material of which he proved to be one of the masters, and it is not that we are comparing with one of the greatest writers in history Francisco Tllez de Meneses, the single programmer of UnEpic, but, mocking at every step practically all the nerd culture from the 70s to today, ours demonstrates that he possesses all the subjects he deals with in the game as and better than many acclaimed game designers. He still has to make a few steps forward in the Action genre, in fact, but his work, which has raged on many machines since 2011 on PC and which today also lands on Sony platforms, is certainly of high value. UnEpic, a huge Spanish indie hit, arrives on PlayStation 4: our un-epic review! Suddenly Dr. Zoidberg During an ordinary RPG session with friends, Daniel, who has swallowed a fair amount of beer, feels the very normal need to go and perform an important bodily function. In the bathroom, however, the light suddenly goes out. Of course, it's those funny friends who are playing a joke; but starting to orient himself by touch, Daniel realizes that something is wrong. The walls don't seem to be made of smooth ceramic, but they are damp, porous, dirty and the sound of one's footsteps has an echo almost as if one were in a sort of cave; fortunately the boy has a lighter with him, and once lit, he confirms it. That is definitely not the house where it was, it is rather a dark cave with lots of human bones scattered here and there, like adventurers who met a tragic fate. A few steps away and a menacing spirit appears in front of Daniel: with powerful and fearful words he announces to our that he will possess him to kill him, because his job is to protect that place from intruders. And here comes the first mighty laugh, because the possession actually succeeds, but Daniel, in all respects a young adult of our day, is as if he didn't have a soul, and the spirit without a name but affectionately nicknamed Zera by the protagonist, yes finds himself trapped inside a body with which he can only speak. A comic duet starts that will accompany us throughout UnEpic, and which is definitely one of the most beautiful things in the game for the intelligence and wit of the writing: Zera, mystical entity of a heroic, chivalrous, dark world, precisely epic, finds himself bickering, in an attempt to kill him to free himself, with a hedonistic, indolent and insensitive boy, who throughout the adventure in what will turn out to be the enormous Harnakon Castle, always remains convinced that he is in a hallucination that he manages with all the cynicism of those who, between films, videogames, role-playing games and so on and so forth, are by now addicted to a medieval-fantasy imaginary like Dungeons & Dragons, without ever feeling really in danger of life or invested with an important responsibility. And to think that Harnakon confronts us with many dangers and responsibilities: in another context orcs, goblins, poisonous snakes, sorcerers with immeasurable powers and enormous and dangerous bosses could be really scary, but Daniel faces everything with an irresponsibility that can't help but elicit more than a hearty laugh. Thus, between a hilarious videogame or cinematographic quote and the totally nonsense appearance of a famous television character, it is the writing - more than the plot itself, actually rather trivial - that constitutes one of the strong points of UnEpic. Playstation 4 trophies UnEpic presents the beauty of 58 Trophies, 48 of Bronze, 8 of Silver, a single Gold and the inevitable Platinum. Unlike what one might expect given the brilliant comedy of some phases, the actions to be carried out to brag about with Network friends are quite classic: level up, kill disproportionate quantities of enemies, solve quests and turn on all the lights of a area and of the entire castle. And there was light One of the strong points, but certainly not the only one. The playful structure of UnEpic is what is usually called ~Metroidvania~, that is emblematic of the beginnings of two series, Metroid and Castlevania to be precise, which, moving according to a rigid canon of 2D action/platform, however, foresee only one large environment to be explored, with numerous areas initially closed and which become accessible only after acquiring a particular power and/or tool, generally obtainable after hammering by a poor ~end-of-level~ boss who, however, precisely because of the structure adopted which does not envisage the classic starsion in levels, the end of the level is actually not. A powerful and complex RPG component is grafted onto this basis: by eliminating enemies, Daniel acquires experience points and levels up, and at each level-up he can decide how to exploit the skill points obtained. It is thus possible to create an unstoppable warrior, also choosing to specialize in only one of the seven categories of weapons present, a powerful lord of the dark arts or a character who masters physical attacks and magic without excelling in anything, taking into account however that every weapon and every magic has its pros and cons, and that some enemies are particularly resistant to one type of attack but very weak towards another. The castle is full of NPCs who sell items, weapons and spells, or who have a real quest to offer us, and in general the RPG part, although we are actually talking about a dungeon crawler and therefore not the most complex role-playing type imaginable. it is really well structured. The same cannot be said instead of the purely action part, not up to par with the models that inspire it mainly by virtue of a non-perfect control system, or better, which seems specifically designed to create those situations in which no matter how much you are skilled, you will lose some life points anyway. The experience is always at least enjoyable but it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth to discover that, more than knowing how to juggle with the pad, the difference, for example, is the ability to teleport to the point where you save and recover the 'energy and at the shop where you stock up on healing potions, and the ability to endure lots and lots of backtracking, notwithstanding the presence of as many as four different difficulty levels. In short, soon the push to move forward will come above all from enjoying some other comic curtain and from the desire to explore the manor, really huge and complex. Just the idea of exploration is accentuated by the fact that initially the rooms are very dark, but we can light the various candlesticks and lamps present, which also helps us to orient ourselves by distinguishing the areas already explored from the new ones. It is not so much the omnipresent darkness that constitutes the reason for an unpleasant feature of UnEpic's graphics, namely its poor legibility. This is due to the choice of framing the action from far, far away: even on a generously sized monitor you will have problems distinguishing enemies and smaller elements, in a context which is however well done and which reminded us , mostly for atmosphere, some great classics of the 8-bit era. The sound is more disappointing: the music is classical, nothing sensational, and given the size of the castle, it tends to get tiring, but certainly not unlistenable. The picture is closed by a localization in Italian with some smears here and there, but all in all correct and enjoyable, the warning on the presence, on consoles, of a certain degree of censorship on the texts, on PCs quite full of profanity, and the possibility of cross-play and cross-save between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.", "date": "2016-04-26", "grade": "7.5"}
