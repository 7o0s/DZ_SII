It's the only consolation you can provide yourself and your fans when you remember that the first episode of Life is Strange 2 (Roads) was released last September 2018 (eight months ago). The second episode is a little more recent, but not so much: Square Enix released it in January 2019, just to start the new year well (not so much, for the two protagonist brothers). More than another 90 interminable days have passed since then, and only in the last few hours have we been able to complete the third episode, very poetically entitled Wastelands, that is, wastelands, although then within the chapter the protagonists are never alone for more than ten minutes. Life is Strange 2: Episode 3 - Wastelands is very important, for a whole series of reasons: it unquestionably represents the central hub of the production, the transition between the first part of Sean and Daniel Diaz's adventures and the second half of their adventures, which they will then proceed to the expected conclusion. Is the third episode really the most successful of the three released so far? It is a refrain that is spreading very quickly in the world of the internet. The answer is ~yes, but with some reservations~. Or, even better: ~Yes, if for you the introspective and reflective aspect is more important than pure and simple action~. Plot: pivot point Each chapter of Life is Strange 2 has been designed as a solid link in a chain: if one is missing, the chain breaks, and everything loses its meaning. It almost seems like an obvious consideration, but on reflection it turns out that there are not many narratives today with such coherence, with a lucid plot that continues (with all the brackets open along the way) towards some very specific points in the minds of the developers. These points are the theme of the family, the story of two brothers united against fate, the desperate but essential search for a safe place where they can rest: everything else in Life is Strange 2 is just as important, poetic and interesting, but secondary ; everything revolves around these single essential points. In the third episode Wastelands some of the safe points shown in Life is Strange 2 - Rules necessarily proved to be only apparent and momentary: the player had left Sean and Daniel fleeing (for the umpteenth time) from Beaver Creek, in search of a new landing place, but always generally on the way to the paternal country, that is Mexico. From the end of the second chapter to the beginning of the third, more months of travel passed, in which Sean and Daniel met again the homeless hippies who had made such a good impression on them in their grandparents' village: Cassidy and Finn. The game does not tell these things, except in brief: however Sean's personal diary is not a simple accessory that must be forgotten, it is indeed useful to consult it as often as possible, because it provides extremely interesting, sometimes fundamental, backstory. It is precisely in Sean's diary that it is possible to read how, once again on the run, the two brothers have found a new safe place in a marijuana plantation in California: therefore, the video game once again welcomes a very uncomfortable theme, that of illegal American plantations . Usually squalid places where shady and disreputable individuals pay other shady or simply desperate individuals by the day, vagabonds who put aside some money to continue wandering without starving along the way. This is where Sean and Daniel stop in the company of their homeless friends, aware however of how their stopover is only temporary: Mexico awaits them, all they need is to find enough money as soon as possible to be able to afford the voyage. Clearly things will soon get complicated, and we won't be the ones to tell you how and why by ruining your taste for narration for its own sake: it is enough to know that, between some narrative ups and downs, the conclusion of the episode is much more powerful and distressing of the previous one. Also based on the choices that have brought you to her. Playstation 4 trophies Life is Strange 2: Episode 3 - Wastelands also presents its nice group of Trophies on PlayStation 4, which will be automatically added to those collected in the first two episodes of the series. To unlock the Platinum Trophy, however, it will be necessary to wait for the arrival of episodes four and five; however, the difficulty is at an all-time low, it is enough to complete the adventure, create all of Sean's drawings and little else. So many choices, so many ideas for reflection Life is Strangee 2 is a narrative adventure in which the player is called upon to make some important decisions for the future of the protagonists: most of the time these are ethical and moral considerations (what is right or wrong to do? What should I or shouldn't I do?), in other secondary cases it is a question of choosing the color of an accessory, a superficial answer for a character that does not interest the protagonists that much; the important thing is to always remember that almost nothing is left to chance. And never before has anything been left to chance in the third episode of Wastelands: every decision is linked to all the others, some will risk ruining relations between Sean and Daniel or between the two brothers and the remaining members of the group of vagabonds who forms their new family. All this was already present in the first two chapters of the second series by Dontnod Entertainment: the third chapter limits itself to picking up the threads of past decisions and proposing new ones, many of which will probably prove to be fundamental in the two final chapters of the story (especially the decisions at the end of the third chapter). Wastelands perhaps represents the most intense chapter among the three proposed so far in Life is Strange 2: the pace is pressing, the situations full of food for thought are many, the characters you need to relate to seem infinite and each of them boasts a charm very particular, his own peculiar way of seeing things, the world, life itself. It is the paradox of knowing how to tell stories well: everything seems to happen in just two hours of play, when in reality from the point of view of factual reality the characters involved do almost nothing. Sean and Daniel live on the plantation according to a strict routine, where nothing ever changes: they get up early, work hard, celebrate at sunset and go to sleep. Yet there is always a character to talk to, some particular aspect of the life of the protagonists to explore: the relationship between Sean and Daniel gets a lot of insight, and the player will determine how it will evolve, positively and negatively. This is equally true of Sean's relationships with the other supporting characters, and to a lesser extent Daniel's with the same people. There will be very interesting food for thought, such as the legalization of cannabis, the exploitation of homeless youth by pseudo-criminal groups, the search for oneself and one's relationship with the world: for the ~deeper~ players these moments will skipped by answering everyone a little at random, but for the others they constitute the heart of the entire production, what makes Life is Strange what it has always been: an opportunity to reflect, playing, on themes that concern the human being in its deepest intimacy. The action (as often happens) reaches its conclusion, where the tension is truly palpable: in these moments there are many choices to make, many with an apparently uncertain outcome. Some of you may be forced to replay the final moments of the episode, preferring the story to end one certain way over another.", "date": "2019-05-10", "grade": "8.2"}
