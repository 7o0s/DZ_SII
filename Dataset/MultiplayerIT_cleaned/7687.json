The protagonist finds himself on an anonymous alien planet in the role of the survivor who has to deal alone with the fruits of yet another experiment related to tissue resuscitation. Terrible creatures that have settled where once doctors and soldiers chatted amiably while sipping some B-series coffee derivative. Nothing new under the sun but the Test3 Projects title has a number of peculiarities that distinguish it from the crowd. One of these is the presence of objects that support a limited but intriguing crafting system, the great muse of modern independent gaming. This, among other things, is managed, like the selection of weapons and treatments, through a peculiar but intuitive scrolling inventory that is always present on the screen, on the left side of the hud. It follows that we are never forced to leave the game session with all the benefits for the involvement that this entails. It is a simple but apt find and this sentence adequately defines the entire Teleglitch which, one year after its launch, was released on Steam with the new Die More Edition version. Teleglitch is back in Die More Edition and it's even meaner than before A desperate situation The element that allows a simple idea to become a video game, in the case of Teleglitch, is the extremely high difficulty, with the movements of the creatures that appear in front of us that are calibrated to put us in difficulty but also to allow us to retreat towards a safe area by waving a large cutlass. What's the point of backing down? Well, it serves to survive since in the title there are many weapons but there are few bullets and often all that is left to do is wave the aforementioned knife hoping that the snout of the monsters collides with it. To remedy the dramatic shortage of ammunition, the only possibility is to explore every nook and cranny of the procedurally generated maps which often also conceal weapons that cannot be found in the following levels. This means that running towards the teleportation chamber, the objective of each mission whose resolution passes through the escape to a new area presumably ever closer to safety, is not the best option in terms of survival. Finding a shockblade, in fact, is one of those events to celebrate since even if it is a melee weapon, implicitly dangerous to use in a place full of clawed creatures, this one is extremely powerful and allows you to eliminate different types of enemy with a single slash. This operation, unfortunately, is more difficult in Die More Edition than it was in the original game. In fact, although being chased by enemies is still a valid option, the creatures are more difficult to sow and to divide and chase us by gathering in large herds that are increasingly difficult to deal with. Zero survival Among the novelties of the Die More Edition, in addition to the aforementioned increase in difficulty, we find five new levels that are not limited to lengthening the broth but change the structure of the game. In some cases, in fact, it is now possible, once you reach a teleportation chamber, to choose between two different destinations. An introduction that at first glance would seem useless, given that all the levels of the title are procedurally generated and therefore are always different, but which makes sense thanks to the settings of the new maps and thanks to the structure of the game itself, for which an area one might include a very powerful weapon and the other be filled with empty containers, tubes and pieces of chocolate. In essence, things are further complicated by the increase in random factors to which the RSG system is also added which unfortunately is currently only available to those who purchased the title before launch. The Random Starting Gear option, which translated becomes Random Initial Equipment, randomly creates the initial equipment of our survivor and to do so he also draws from the new objects introduced in the Die More Edition which include quite powerful weapons. But the result could also prove disappointing and decidedly less effective than the simple gun guaranteed in the standard game mode. In Teleglitch there is, in essence, an easy mode and to further complicate the situation, as if things weren't hard enough, the automatic save system takes care of it which allows us very few checkpoints, all very difficult to unlock at cause of the high mortality rate. The result is a potentially frustrating formula, but this danger is mitigated by the procedural generation of the maps, which keeps the exploration intriguing, and by the other great peculiarity of the title, or the aesthetic sector. This is undeniably poor, focused on a pixel graphic that has great charm. The developers managed to compensate for the shortcomings inherent in this setting through effects such as camera shakes, image phase shifts and color explosions. Thanks to these expedients, every Teleglitch pixel comes to life in a psychedelic whirlwind that supports, together with annoying and deafening noises, the excellent fantasy-horror atmosphere of the title.", "date": "2013-08-06", "grade": "8.2"}
