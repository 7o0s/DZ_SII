At the same time, however, nostalgia also hides the heavy veil of ignorance under its benevolent mask: the more we abandon ourselves to its embrace, the more difficult it becomes to evaluate critically and crystalline what is in front of us; she is an oppressive and abusive partner, who punches reason in favor of the ~good old days~ and the ephemeral warmth offered by memories. And you know, there's nothing better than blinders put on voluntarily to hide defects, so there are countless companies that have lately decided to make use of this force, which can easily be replaced by a lack of ideas and a lack of courage. Look around, it seems to be back in the 90s: people are tearing their hair out for the Super Nintendo Mini, Crash is back on Playstation, and in Hollywood they decide to remake Jumanji and bring Baywatch to the cinema. These are not totally negative operations (in many cases they represent a great opportunity to make the new generations understand the wonders of the past), but given the underlying malice it is inevitable that every now and then one decides to exhume a corpse in a very bad state. This is where Codemasters takes over, a development team that needs no introduction and that splashed around in those years, today committed to reviving a brand that accompanied the childhood of countless players, Micro Machines. If you hadn't understood it from the incipit, unfortunately we are dealing with a rather badly preserved dead body. Fast memories We don't want to be splendid, mind you. When the Micro Machines World Series was announced, our hearts too went heartbreaking. The series was a bastion of couch gaming, full of absolutely exhilarating fights to the death, and much more brutal and demanding to master than you might believe. The problem is that when the code for the game arrived and we started everything something inside us immediately cracked. World Series is in fact an extremely different title from the Original Micro Machines, capable of profoundly differing even from three-dimensional chapters such as Micro Machines V3 and V4: in reality, the basis of the game is significantly closer to another Codemasters title, Toybox Turbos, a sort of ~Micro Machines without a license~ which took the fundamentals of the series and distorted them to a large extent. Let's explain ourselves better: Until the V3, the series was mainly based on ~types~ of Micro Machines to drive, diversified from each other and sometimes even with dedicated tracks (such as motorboats, which competed in tanks and small ponds); After the V3 Codemasters decided to change direction, focusing first on the possibility of mixing vehicles in competitions, and later with Toybox exclusively on mixed races with vehicles with their own characteristics. World Series does exactly that, but where Micromachines V3 offered an exhilarating challenge even in single player - complete with advanced tournaments and a large number of tracks - it decides to focus exclusively on the multiplayer experience. No single player tournaments, just a ~Skirmish~ mode where you can compete with artificial intelligence in races that offer no prizes to those who tackle them and are therefore used to memorize the circuits (or to challenge your friends locally, of course ). Moreover, it's not that difficult to remember every corner in this case, because there are only ten tracks. Where's the rest? These ten circuits are more than taken care of, for heaven's sake: as usual we find ourselves in front of perfect tracks for toy cars, from desks covered with stationery products to tables full of food with a big dog in the background staring panting at your challenge. There is still all the charm of the predecessors in the locations where the Micro Machines fight, everything else is missing. There are twelve cars, not many more than the tracks, and not that much diversified in terms of controls, because an excessive reshuffling of the response between one vehicle and another would have unbalanced the races excessively (speed and acceleration of the vehicles are practically identical, it is the response when cornering that changes); the general speed has decreased, to make the game less frustrating (however, it is not very easy to control the vehicles on certain circuits, but try to pick up the V3 or the second chapter again and you will notice an abysmal difference); finally, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the battles, which are fun but distort the formula. The cars available knowno after all equipped with specific skills - complete with a special move chargeable - as if they were heroes of a Dota-Like. The Shimu-Nita (yes, that's her real name) can release energy streaks that slow enemies and fires a constant laser, the G.I. Joe shoots powerful and precise shots and can leave stun mines, and so on for a challenge that certainly does not lack variety. The problem, however, is the balance: certain vehicles are clearly more suitable for battles than others, both for the effectiveness of their primary weapons and for the usefulness of certain powers when compared to others. This makes an already chaotic mode a complete disaster at times, and it's a waste because fights of this type (in addition to taking place in dedicated arenas) are also refreshed by the presence of alternatives to the typical Deathmatch such as Capture the Flag or Conquest mode, where a little tactic and balance would have greatly benefited the experience. Playstation 4 trophies Micro Machines World Series boasts 44 trophies, but don't expect particularly elaborate challenges. Most of them you will get randomly during battles, others will ask you to use all the cars in the game, while for the last ones you will only have to level up. In short, this is not a fast platinum, it will take you some time (especially to reach level 40). Saved from a purge The desire to pursue more famous multiplayer titles is even perceived in the unlocking of rewards, given that by participating in online races you gain experience to level up, and at each level you get you get a chest containing coins, emotes for cars, stamps placed in field to the destruction of the opponents and audio jokes of the pilots (does this remind you of anything?). The fact is that this title does not have a solid enough foundation to support such a structure. The gameplay is simple and intuitive, not without subtleties but far from the stratification of other racing arcades or the potential of competitive games of a completely different type. The presence of special online events with modifiers is not enough to justify the price of admission, and the chaotic fun of online battles is not comparable to the competitiveness that the predecessors unleashed locally. Overall, World Series is a forgettable pastime. The Micro Machines brand deserved much more treatment, much more content. So is it all to be thrown away? Not actually, because in the game there is still a mode that saves at least part of the shack: Elimination. There is talk of racing with a modified view (the normal one follows the cars from above but is angled, in Elimination it instead approaches that of the first chapters, vertically on the vehicles), where the camera only follows the driver in the lead and gradually approaches until all challengers are eliminated. It might seem trivial, but this is actually the best element of the game, because it contains the best of the competitive spirit of the brand it belongs to and is nothing short of intoxicating in the company of friends. The fun resulting from the Elimination is the thing that in our opinion makes World Series reach full sufficiency, an extra option that completes the inevitable modes included in the package and overall it is more successful than both the battles with fixed powers described above and the classic races. Nothing particularly special to add on the graphic sector of the game, pleasant and colorful, as well as enriched by the Hasbro license (which allowed you to insert goodies such as an armored Cobra and Nerf weapons within the title) but certainly not unforgettable or particularly inspired. Some infrequent and unwarranted frame rate drops worried us, however they appeared very few times. We close with the solidity of the online, which unfortunately we have not been able to test very thoroughly (the servers were only open for a few hours before the launch). What we can tell you is that the special events we were talking about earlier will be activated every other time, and that matchmaking has struggled a bit during our experience, replacing human players with artificial intelligence after a few seconds most of the time . Not bad anyway, the foundations put in place remain the same, and regardless of everything our assessment does not change: the Micro Machines of the past are far away.", "date": "2017-06-30", "grade": "6.2"}
