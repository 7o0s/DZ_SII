{"name": "The Witcher: Enhanced Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-witcher-enhanced-edition-recensione.html", "text": "The Enhanced Edition CDProjekt immediately proved to be attentive to the needs of its consumers, promising shortly after the release of the game and their first complaints the Enhanced Edition we are talking about in this review: even if perhaps its release after a year will let some of the players migrated to other shores such as Mass Effect not re-enter the adventures of the witchers, the concern of the Polish development team is certainly to be appreciated which, unlike other software houses, has taken care to collect, catalog and implement the requests that the players of the base version of The Witcher have reported over time. Thus this revised and corrected edition of the game arrives on the market, which brings with it a series of improvements (at least on paper, according to what was promised) such as the significant reduction in loading times and the resampling of most of the dubbing in all the various languages, also a collection of music inspired by The Witcher, the official soundtrack of the game, a behind-the-scenes DVD and the D'jinni Adventure Editor with which the two additional adventures released so far were created, namely The Price of Neutrality and Side Effects. From book to game As many of you know, the origins of The Witcher don't go back to the video game released last year but to the mind of the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, author of a series of short stories and 5 novels about Geralt's adventures. The fantasy proposed in The Witcher deviates from the classics of the genre, especially in the matter of good and evil: the characters do not simply belong to one or the other but are very often ~in the middle~, a concept also taken up by CDProjekt during the game design, advertised precisely for its many possible choices during the adventure through the cause-and-effect system excellently created by the development team. The long road to perfection Skipping various analyzes on the plot and other aspects of the game already seen in the review published a year ago, we just have to see how much this Enhanced Edition actually improves The Witcher. The over 5,000 additional lines written by the developers offer mixed results, unfortunately not reaching the perfection desired by CDProjekt and the players: the loading times are reduced but still quite alienating from the game, as well as the other technical defects make their appearance in a reduced way but unfortunately not completely eliminated. The models of the non-player characters are no longer replicants of themselves but are still not very convincing due to an evident realization seasoned with a little too much haste, while even the various localizations despite having been resampled still suffer from some complexes towards of the original in Polish. The two new adventures As we said, part of the novelty of this Enhanced Edition consists of the presence of the two official adventures, the first of which was published by CDProjekt precisely on the occasion of the launch of the editor. The Price of Neutrality is set near the witcher base of Kaer Mohren, where Geralt is going when he comes across a camp where there are some characters who ask him for help to find a girl who is right in Kaer Mohren . The second adventure called Side Effects, instead sees Geralt come to the aid of the old acquaintance Dandelion, who ended up in prison due to a series of misadventures and to make matters worse with a huge debt on his shoulders. The witcher will therefore have to make sure to somehow recover the sum by saving his friend's skin. The improvements of the Enhanced Edition obviously make the first adventure more playable, while on the two we can still say in general that they are a valid support to the main story of the game: perhaps not so replayable (especially the first) but still able to show the potential of the editor to those who want to try their hand at creating new stories. even from a numerical point of view, the vote expressed remains exactly the same as a year ago Comment Those who loved the basic version of The Witcher with its strengths and weaknesses will like it even more with the additions of the Enhanced Edition, while those who didn't love the game developed by CDProjekt will hardly be able to change their minds despite the efforts made by the Polish team: in the light of this, even from a numerical point of view, the vote expressed remains exactly the same as a year ago. A large part of this type of conclusion is caused by a series of improvements that undoubtedly improve the game, but unfortunately not as much and not as convincingly as hoped, leaving that leap of qualityity expected outside the door. The extra material available in the package still makes the purchase attractive to everyone, while those who have already bought the base game can download the special patches released in recent days, which put it on a par with the Enhanced Edition even if obviously without the additional material present in the package of the latter.Pros Very interesting additional material No more sensational technical blunders Cons Not as improved as expected After 1 year it may have lost its appeal PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements OS: Windows XP SP2 / Vista CPU: Intel Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 +2800 RAM: 1GB for Windows XP, 1.5GB for Windows Vista Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or ATI Radeon 9800 Disk Space: 8.5GB Recommended Requirements CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7900 or ATI equivalent Test Configuration CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 +3800@+4200 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 7900GT", "date": "2008-10-06", "grade": null}
