{"name": "Dracula: Origin - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dracula-origin-recensione.html", "text": "The Count at the showdown Immediately, from the first frame, Dracula: Origin enchants the eye and delights the ear. The atmosphere is of great caliber, with two-dimensional backdrops rich in decorations, well-placed details and a first-rate visual polish. Fortunately on this aspect, the title signed by Frogwares starts with lustres and laces to remain at the same level until the end. Animations included, for once. Above all, it is the coherence of the sets that made us love both London and Vienna, not to mention Cairo and humid Transylvania. A note that could be moved instead concerns a small ingenuity in representing some transitions without any intermission footage. Not that the pre-rendered sequences are missing, but in some cases they would have been useful to keep the sense of immersion high, for example showing the crossing in the Van Helsing desert, from the center of Cairo to the mysterious Egyptian tomb. Seeing it disappear and reappear at a distance that we imagine conspicuous, is somewhat reminiscent of the old adventures of the past decades. Finesse if you will, or perhaps personal tastes, even if once you have tasted what sensations the music of Dracula: Orgins can evoke, it is a pity to see him get lost in these details. Dracula: Origin bewitches the eye and delights the ear The Count at the showdown Speaking of old point and click adventures, let's say right away that we are faced with a great simplification. With one mouse button you interact with sensitive areas, while with the other you access what happens behind the scenes: log of dialogues, documents, travel notes and inventory. It may seem trivial to the more experienced, but Van Helsing's lucubrative enthusiasm is already there to hold the court. Listening to him there is not even a gram of guano that cannot prove suspicious, treacherous or simply worthy of further study. Therefore equip yourself with the comparative and didactic spirit of an entomologist, since there will be a mine of objects to be discovered first, and to be collected later. Too many to tell the truth, and in some cases cleverly hidden, even if it will be enough to press the space bar to immediately report all the sensitive points. Yeah, we talk about it every time; it is a temptation to which sooner or later you give in, and although for some screens the search can become tedious, it is still true that for a classic point and click it represents a consistent portion of game and challenge. Well, then there would be the puzzles, but for those you'll have to read on. If the Count wants to impale, you have to count So here we are at the puzzles. Let's immediately break a spear in favor of the continuity that binds the settings, the puzzles and the narration. There will therefore be no nonsense nonsense, except on a couple of occasions that are in any case negligible in the total count of puzzles. There are also all kinds and sorts of these, from bas-reliefs weeping blood to the recomposition of papyri, even if it is the more complex ones that are also the most original. Many will test you by making you interact with different objects, breaking the typical static nature of a point and click adventure, as in the case in which you will have to make a key, measuring the wooden rods and cutting them to the right dimensions to be able to nail them together. Consider that Van Helsing at the university had to take only the highest grades, and also be a formidable opponent in the evenings of Trivial Pursuit, so expect hieroglyphics to be translated and chemical formulas to be identified. Considering the type of protagonist then, these trials all benefit consistency, although sadly, on a handful of occasions, solving a puzzle can become a tough contest. In some cases, the game suddenly becomes information park, leaving you stuck in a location with the solitude of your reasoning. Nothing dramatic however, it will be enough to call even the reservist brain cells to arms, but less experienced players run the risk of crashing. It must also be said that the gameplay tends to ~armor you~ in one or more locations connected to a single relevant puzzle, so that you do not worry about unsuccessful searches in areas far from each other. the splendid soundtracks feed the restlessness If the Count wants to impale, you have to count Getting lost is impossible in Dracula: Origin. There is a solid and thriving story of events to follow, which unfolds by sipping the revelations, always leaving you shrouded in mystery. Frogwares proves to have enough talent and experience to create a compelling script, also thanks to the choice to have derived this game from a great modern novel. Unfortunately there are some flaws, because Dracula: Origin suffers from sporadicvoltage drops, also called moments of boredom. It's a real shame, because the splendid soundtracks feed the restlessness, and we would like to continue like this until the end, but some area of tedium invariably awaits us. Patience then for the dubbing, which remains in English, however making use of quality Italian subtitles. In any case, vampires and the romantic, gothic and decadent atmosphere that surrounds them are always a captivating attraction for those who love mysteries and possess the gaze of the aesthete. In other words, seriously consider this elegant, dark adventure poised between love and hate, life and death, salvation and damnation. Comment Dracula: Origin is an intriguing adventure, from the first minute to the last. It is the artistic direction that shines for coherence and continuity between narration, scenarios and puzzles. There are no elements out of place or forcing and the plot unfolds fluidly, revealing itself little by little without haste. If it weren't for some boring passages, which expire with respect to the other tense moments, punctuated by orchestral music, Dracula: Origin would have been a real horror. Frogwares knows what it's doing and only sins for the presence of puzzles that are poorly calibrated in the relationship between difficulty and information. They are however not enough flaws to put off the avid adventurer, or just anyone who enjoys a good story told well. nothing groundbreaking like that PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Intel Pentium 4 1.5GHz/AMD Athlon XP 1500 + RAM: 512 MB RAM Video Card: DirectX 9 compatible 64 MB video card Operating System: Windows XP/Vista Hard Disk: 2.5 GB Processor Test Configuration : Intel Core 2 Duo 2.40 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GTS with 320 MB of memory Operating System: Windows XP", "date": "2008-07-23", "grade": null}
