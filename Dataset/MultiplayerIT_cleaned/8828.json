Now it's the turn of the present Cave Story 3D, developed exclusively for the Nintendo portable and bearer of an unprecedented polygonal graphic design enriched by the three-dimensional potential of the console: it will be enough to make it superior to all the other incarnations in digital delivery available at a price significantly lower? Different but the same In this incarnation for 3DS, Cave Story 3D features the same mysterious narrative component of the original, and which therefore sees our hero awaken without memory in a cavernous scenario inhabited by the Mimiga, docile bunnies threatened by an unscrupulous villain. A setting that forms the backdrop to a game action clearly inspired by a classic like Metroid, both as regards the existence of a single mega-level to explore, and as regards the emphasis placed on the use of different weapons based on their effect on enemies. Anyone who is familiar with and has an appreciation for the genre is therefore a potential admirer of Cave Story 3D, although there are some caveats for use: first of all a level of difficulty that is far from affordable, emphasized by a relative scarcity of save points, however, rather distant from each other. The indie character of Daisuke Amaya's work comes out at its best when we consider elements such as the scarcity of resources bestowed on the protagonist, the quantity and wickedness of the enemies present in the scenario (who benefit from a constant respawn every time you return on one's steps) and the frequent presence of millimeter jumps whose failure leads to a merciless game over. In short, Cave Story 3D is not an action game that is tackled lightly, in stark contrast with most of the 3DS games on offer: and this, depending on everyone's personal tastes, can be a great advantage or an insurmountable flaw. Developing on a two-dimensional plane, Cave Story 3D doesn't exactly enhance the sensation of depth offered by the Nintendo console, but the final result is still pleasant: even with the slider at maximum, you only get a more marked detachment between the seabed and the real game, but at least you don't have the annoying sensation of seeing double as it happens with other 3DS products. Indie-cations for use In the face of the elements just mentioned that could discourage less hardcore players, there are aspects that on the contrary will exalt those belonging to the category. The story that is revealed little by little, the level design studied down to the smallest detail, the variety of weapons and their ultra-dynamic enhancement system are all the components that have decreed the success of Cave Story 3D over the years and which are been faithfully reproduced here without any softening. In fact, only the technical sector has been the subject of a facelift such as to substantially diversify it from the other versions. Having abandoned the minimal-2D graphic design, the title is presented here with a completely polygonal cosmetics which certainly cannot be defined as exciting, but which performs its task well, managing to keep the stylistic ties intact with the original: the use of colors and however, the lighting is not impeccable, and it happens that you are unable to see platforms because they are too blended with the seabed. Even the much appreciated music has been slightly remixed, but without being distorted, for the sake of purists. A mention is necessary on the control system, given the millimeter precision that Cave Story 3D often and willingly demands from the player: although the circle pad works just fine, using the directional cross you have a better feeling with the movements of the protagonist, while the front keys are sufficient to cover all the executable actions. The lower touchscreen of the console was instead used to house the inventory and the map, an optimal solution for having two elements like these immediately at hand, which are of fundamental importance in the game economy.", "date": "2012-01-04", "grade": "7.5"}
