{"name": "Assassins Creed Odyssey: LEredit Della Prima Lama", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed-odyssey-leredita-della-prima-lama-recensione-primo-episodio.html", "text": "The arrival of Origins and Odyssey has broken the Assassin's Creed fanbase: on the one hand the purists, who consider Ubisoft's change of direction a heresy and wish for a return to the old formula, and on the other those who favorably the transformation of the series and consider hybridization with other genres a great way to continue to evolve it. Whatever your position, however, both Odyssey and Origins have managed to convince a large portion of audiences and critics, greatly expanding the vision of the series and allowing it to apply various unexpected (but not unexplored, given that the fusion of mechanics remains somewhat derivative). Odyssey in particular seems to be the better of the two, due to its propensity for excess and its willingness to push the possibilities linked to the background created by the French giant to the limit. With this chapter, however, a new problem has arisen: his willingness to deviate from the original vision to give life to new experiments has led to some narrative upheavals - which we have no intention of spoiling you, don't be afraid - and to a departure from the underlying mythology of the brand, whereas Origins instead tried to stick mostly to that script. Ubisoft has therefore seen fit to exploit the DLCs to make a significant detour, and reinsert elements directly related to the assassins into the world of Odyssey. This first narrative expansion is called The Legacy of the First Blade and we went to the Italian offices of the house to review its very first chapter. He loves me or he doesn't love me. Blade or no blade. The fulcrum of this partial ~return to origins~ is Dario, assassin of the well-known Persian king Xerxes and first to use the iconic hidden blade, then retroactively included in the brotherhood (also because at the time of Odyssey the Templar / assassin conflict did not exist). This is undoubtedly a clever detour, which in the timeline of Alexios and Cassandra makes perfect sense from a chronological point of view; however, we cannot say the same for its application, because everything seems to have been selected more for show than for an effective contribution to the underlying narrative, and considering the atypical nature of the Odyssey plot it does not add anything interesting to the events. Sure, it's only the first episode, and we're fully aware of it, but as a start it's undoubtedly dull, it has a rather short main questline, and apart from a couple of choices that could have interesting future repercussions, it involved us very little. The writers at Ubisoft have to do better than this to hook us, in the next chapters. In ~Prey~, this is the name of the first part of the adventure, if nothing else the developers have tried to offer a rather varied package in terms of the quests addressed. The main missions stick to the basics with a typical series of encounters alternating with investigation phases, where the high points are a couple of moderately successful boss encounters; the secondary ones, on the other hand, are a good quantity and cover numerous archetypes seen in the main campaign, also including naval battles. Of course, more could have been done, and if you are looking for ~new~ experiences you will not find them here - the boss fights themselves have the flavor of enhanced versions of the clashes against bounty hunters - but if nothing else, the responsible software house has committed so as not to completely direct the first phase of Dario's story towards a single type of task. Old, unpleasant, acquaintances The most serious problems, indeed, are congenital rather than related to the package itself. These are certainly not factors capable of completely ruining such massive experiences, we would like to clarify it, yet they continue to annoy, especially within missions clearly outlined in the game map. Let's take a more concrete example: do you remember the annoying tendency of bounty hunters to camp out in the places of the most difficult battles, magically making them almost insurmountable obstacles? Well, here it happened several times to have one of these funny guys around, since the members of the cult hunting for Dario and his son have a value similar to that of the order (they appear in a similar table, as targets that can be tackled) and attacking them in the vicinity of a hunter automatically triggers a bounty. Paying them in advance can limit the problem, but it can happen with a fair probability of seeing them help the bosses, creating really unpleasant situations (a colleague of ours even caught three at the same time, which is saying something). That a similar problem has not yet been solved by a simple ~deviation~ of the patterns of the intartificial intelligence of hunters during certain specific events leaves us perplexed, and we would certainly have liked a lot of filings of this type in the patch parallel to the arrival of the first DLC, considering that it already brings more than one valid change to the game. The opportunity to make other due changes, however, has not been exploited, and the first chapter of the Legacy of the First Blade therefore represents only a weak content extra, which will need a serious qualitative surge from every point of view - from the narrative to the additions in terms of gameplay and structure - to be able to convince us. Let's hope that Ubisoft repents with the next episodes: the possibilities are certainly there.", "date": "2018-12-03", "grade": null}
