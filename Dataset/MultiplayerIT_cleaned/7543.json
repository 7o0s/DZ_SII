For this fact alone Agarest: Generations of War should at least intrigue you. If we then tell you that the bizarre title of Compile Heart not only proposes itself as an exponent of the sub-category of tactical RPGs, but also includes a conspicuous appointment simulator component, you should prick up your ears. Or if you're sane you'll have already run away. Throw us into the cauldron a good dose of fan service in the form of scantily dressed damsels always ready to do their utmost in contortionist poses from the worst Sunday circus and you will have a vague idea of what we are talking about. Still interested? Then read on. Let's discover a strategic jRPG full of beautiful undressed damsels! Divide, conquer and mate The world is in crisis. You are a bold hero, and you will have to make important decisions to save him. Several times, and in different generations. In the meantime you should also find the time to choose a pretty girl, seduce her and procreate with her. We're not kidding, if you don't do this, you won't secure a progeny and the game cannot continue. In fact, with generations we mean your children who, grown up, will become the new protagonists of the story. Hence the reason for the subtitle Generations of War. The war continues and will continue for years and years and from heir to heir it will be up to you to find the key to the matter and end the conflict between the two warring nations. Your choices regarding Latin lovers will not be ends in themselves, since the characteristics of the partner you choose will influence those of the unborn child. Agarest: Generations of War has it all: blondes, brunettes, redheads, elves, sorceresses, there's something for all tastes. As you may have guessed, the ~dating sim~ component, i.e. seduction and coupling with a graceful girl, is well developed and inserted in a less trivial way than expected. Of course, this represents the perfect excuse to give us some hard and pure fan service, and also clashes a bit with the urgency of a conflict between nations that perhaps should be concluded. On the other hand it is a useful expedient to carry on the plot, which frankly struggles due to a certain abuse of clichs of the genre and due to a sometimes exhausting slowness, further weighed down by the verbosity of certain sequences, all strictly textual. It should also be noted that the choices made and the relative consequences all too often appear as practically random, heavily diluting the depth of the relational component. Square strategy If all the urban and narrative part is resolved through two-dimensional dialogue sequences, the rest of the game offers 3D maps with the two-dimensional characters above them. We have a clear division between the exploration of the global map, where you will have to move from one point of interest to another, and finally the real heart of the experience, or the fighting. These are turn-based, with a first moment in which we will have to take advantage of the action points available to move on the grid and the second where, drawing on the same AP, it will be possible to select which actions to perform, whether they are attack, defense, special, magical and etc. In short, if you are familiar with the genre, you will not find any surprises in Agarest: Generations of War. A nice detail is represented by the possibility of making more characters cooperate in order to carry out more powerful attacks, complete with pyrotechnic effects, in pure Japanese style. This system is quite versatile and guarantees Arts (this is the name of the most powerful skills) to accelerate otherwise slow characters or reach enemies that are too far away. Furthermore, it will be possible to create real combos, whether they are of different skills or as simple as powerful repetitions of the same blow. By deepening your knowledge with the game, you discover a deep and fun battle system, unfortunately bored by a poorly optimized interface (for example, it is not possible to skip the moving phase even when you want to stay in the same place) and by a repetitiveness of the environments that is embarrassing. The theater maps of the clashes will all be practically identical, without environmental elements to introduce a minimum of variety. No gradients or obstacles, for example. If we add to this the similarities also in aesthetic terms, you will understand our disappointment. The glory of sprites If the gameplay holds no surprises, the same is at least partly true for the aesthetic sector. In fact, the chosen style superimposes three-dimensional backdrops on the sprites of characters and monsters. The character design is certainly spot on and the drawings used to illustrate thestory are always enjoyable. As already mentioned, the winks are wasted, even if one always remains below the guard threshold. We take the liberty of saying that in the end it is almost a shame not to have dared to be more daring. Once you have chosen the path of fan services, you might as well abound, and set aside common sense. Instead, the result is a middle ground that is hardly justifiable and that does not excite in any situation. Otherwise it could have turned out to be an atypical and amusing work, so it is only a little courageous in its desire to be a bit of everything without being completely nothing. The sound sector is good, from which genre music still apt and pleasant, but certainly not memorable, stand out. The PC conversion of the console original has made practically no changes, with an indistinguishable aesthetic save for the graphic resolution, which however cannot touch the character sprites of course. However, the mouse support is pleased, which with lots of changes to the game menus, allows complete control of the title almost exclusively with one hand.", "date": "2013-10-24", "grade": "S.V."}
