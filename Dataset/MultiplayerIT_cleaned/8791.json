Solid. So after Prince of Persia, God Of War and Ico, just to name a few, it's the turn of the series with which the brilliant Hideo Kojima has invented a new genre that has led him to stand out from the crowd, the modern adventure in big colors narrative with stealth elements, adapted by the hand of Bluepoint Games for current consoles. Metal Gear Solid HD Collection consists of three titles, all collected in one package: we have Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, which was an exclusive chapter for PSP, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater , present here in their special versions, respectively Substance, released on Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC between 2002 and 2003, and Subsistence, released instead in 2005 only on PlayStation 2. The two games in question differ from the normal editions for some content additions and extras, although not all of the items in question have been integrated into this collection. In detail, MGS 2 lacks among others the skate game and The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2, while in the third episode the mini-game in which Snake has to capture the monkeys of Ape Escape or the online functions are absent. Present, however, the first two original Metal Gear released on MSX, included as a bonus. Unfortunately, the first Metal Gear Solid is missing, the one that consecrated the series to success at the time of the first Playstation. The reasons for this defection are not known, some hypothesize that the main cause is to be found in the difficulties and costs that Bluepoint Games would have had to bear in adapting the game's ancient graphics engine to current production. However, this explanation, at least if taken individually, seems unlikely: after all, to solve the problem it would have been enough to choose its remake, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, made for the GameCube by Silicon Knights under the Konami label, which featured graphics and elements of gameplay taken from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, among which the first person aiming view and the suspension functionality stood out. But anyhow, in the end the publisher and the developers decided so, and we just have to focus on this collection and on the excellent titles it contains. What's new In productions such as this collection it is inevitably that the aesthetic part is the one that first undergoes the major retouching works. From this point of view, all titles have been brought to 720p and have a framerate firmly anchored at 60fps. From this therefore derives a visual rendering that is all in all well made depending on the game, with the high definition perhaps becoming particularly appreciable in some areas of Metal Gear Solid 3, especially in those outdoors, rather, for example, than in Peace Walker. The predominant setting of the game is in fact represented by the forest and the attention to detail placed in it by the graphics to represent each single element was already something splendid at the time of Sony's Monolith: falling leaves, flying butterflies, scrub and the grass that move driven by the wind. A show. Of course, in each of the three titles you shouldn't expect miracles: after all, the textures are always the same as the PlayStation 2 or PlayStation Portable editions, and in a couple of situations even some of the defects found on these consoles remain, such as occasional bad clipping. Then there is the addition of support for objectives and trophies, a feature that will make many happy, also representing a good excuse to relive authentic pieces of history. The PlayStation 3 version even has a feature called ~Transfarring~, which allows those who already own the original PlayStation Portable copy of Peace Walker to import their saves onto their home console to resume the adventure or test out the game. influence of the dual analog stick. In the future this should also be possible for Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 when Metal Gear Solid HD Collection arrives on PlayStation Vita. For the rest, everything as always, with excellent narrative compartments that boast compelling plots (based on the title played, there is the most intriguing one and the one that is less intriguing obviously) with a disproportionate amount of dialogues, fortunately more than enjoyable thanks to Italian subtitles (the voices remain unfortunately, or fortunately, in English). Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance The first of the titles in the collection that we analyze is Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, a special version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty. For some fans it is the least successful of the series and the reason for these criticisms would in their own way be mainly due to the presence of too long interlude films and a plot that is a bit extravagant in some points and seasoned with grotesque situations. Yet, whatever one's personal opinion on the matter, Kojima's creature played thoroughly cannot fail to please, with its cinematic style and that balance between action and reflection that keeps the player always on the alert. In fact, the gameplay always places the emphasis on strategy and on those stealth elements that have made the history of the saga. The player cannot and must not throw himself weapons in hand against the enemies like crazy, but must act rationally, plan every move and move in the shadows, silently, finding a way to evade the surveillance of the soldiers or to eliminate them without giving into the shadows. 'eye. The variants in each area, in this sense, are usually more than one, and it is therefore possible to move with a certain decision-making freedom by evaluating from time to time what is the best way to act against the enemies. The latter show a behavioral routine that is certainly not evolved like the one present in some current titles, but on the same one capable of creating problems, offering the user a good level of challenge (they are able to identify shadows, bloodstains, objects out of place, hearing noises and calling for reinforcements), on the other, granting him, as mentioned above, a fair range of options for the actions he can perform. For example, are there two guards taking turns down a corridor that you have to go through? Well, one can attract one by causing a noise and then knock it down before the other returns, or put it to sleep at a distance, subsequently attacking the second one which bends over its partner to understand what happened to it. All this is enhanced by the good interactivity with the game environment which allows for example the character to enter the lockers, hide inside and from there observe what happens outside through the cracks, hit and destroy an infinite number of objects in the rooms, etc, and by spectacular boss fights, which constitute one of the crucial moments of Snake's adventure. Playstation 3 trophies Metal Gear Solid HD Collection offers players multiple Trophies for each of the three games in the collection. In detail we have forty-six for Metal Gear Solid 2, as many for Metal Gear Solid 3 and as many as fifty, including some special prizes, for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker. To obtain them you must fully satisfy the requests of the various titles during the respective main adventures. Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence Subsistence is the special version of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This third episode is a big step forward compared to its direct predecessor, and in our opinion it is overall the most beautiful in this collection. Metal Gear Solid 3 is in fact an experience to be lived absolutely, both from a purely playful point of view and from a scenic one, thanks to a gameplay that takes up the typical structure of the series and expands it in various aspects, to a ~coherent~ narrative structure and full of twists. We are in the 60s, in the middle of the Cold War, where world peace and balance are played out on a thin line of agreements between the various superpowers, and on the movements and dealings between the agents of the dense espionage networks of the various countries involved . One of the key elements of this military-political confrontation seems to be represented by Professor Sokolov, who thanks to his enormous capabilities designed the Shagohod, a veritable nuclear war machine, with a range capable of hitting America from anywhere in the Union Soviet. In the role of one of the components of the FOX that we can define as the progenitor of the Foxhound, codenamed Naked Snake, the player must initially infiltrate the base where the well-known professor is ~hosted~, kidnap him and bring him back to America. The fact of setting the story in 1964 and therefore in a historical period in which the radar had not yet been invented, as well as the loved/hated CODEC, allowed Konami to make numerous changes to the gameplay, translating it towards a more stealth and focused on the survival of the main character. Precisely this last concept is here amplified beyond belief with the introduction, inter alia, of elements such as the protagonist's need to feed, rest, heal his wounds and managehis own body, on pain of death. With the possibility for Naked Snake to fall ill perhaps due to the ingestion of indigestible or poisonous food, or to suffer external injuries due to an accidental fall or some bullet, and with the consequential risk that his stamina drops quickly is therefore added further pathos to the classic gameplay of the series. Added to this is the lack of radar which forces the player to act in a much more cautious and reasoned manner during the mission, mainly using his senses and visual abilities to identify the position of the enemies. For all this the new free camera implemented also comes in handy, to identify the position of the enemies, smarter and more intelligent than in MGS 2, perhaps with the acoustic position detector or with the movement graph, with the traces left on the ground, with the direct view. What has been described translates into realism and above all into a greater feeling of identification on the part of the player in the narrative and playful context in which he is involved. Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker The last title of the collection that we analyze is Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, a game as mentioned at the beginning originally conceived for the PlayStation Portable, which is in fact the fifth episode of the series. At the plot level it is essentially the continuation of the vicissitudes of Big Boss, or Naked Snake, along a series of events that will lead him to form the fearsome group of Militaires Sans Frontieres. In terms of gameplay and structure, the innovations brought by the product to the saga already guaranteed a current and very thick experience at its original release, although obviously in no way being able to replicate the majesty of what can be expressed on home consoles, thanks to the management of the missions of team and the implementation of a multiplayer mode for up to six players. Peace Walker is a chapter that oozes freshness from every pore, presenting solutions much more similar to today's titles, such as the possibility of shooting with the back triggers and the abandonment of the controversial bird's eye view. And from the point of view of the gameplay it can be safely said that the title takes advantage of the conversion for PlayStation 3 of enormous improvements in terms of controls, capable of making the action much faster and more engaging, especially when there is a fight . The game goes surprisingly well with the pad controls, indeed leaving a rather bitter aftertaste of how it could have expressed itself at its best on a home console if only it had been conceived for it in its time. On the other hand, this is the episode where the technological detachment weighs the most. In fact, the increase in resolution amplifies the defects of the graphics engine, with objects appearing on the screen at the last moment (the notorious pop-up phenomenon), the polygonal inconsistency and the contours disfigured by the presence of ladders. Apart from this, however, it is a title that deserves and has what it takes to become in some ways the most attractive piece of the package.", "date": "2012-01-31", "grade": "9.0"}
