This Shadow Guardian is absolutely no exception to the rule, putting on the plate a whole series of elements already made famous by famous series: let's therefore find out if it is a pale imitation or a title with its own videogame dignity. Three in one Although Shadow Guardian is undoubtedly indebted to Uncharted as regards the setting, the style of play and even the features of the protagonist Jason Call, there are more or less veiled references to two other successful franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Tomb Raider: from first, the Gameloft product ~borrows~ the idea of the Animus, given that here too the actual game sections are made up of the memories of the hero, forced into a sophisticated machine by the mysterious Novik; to the second we can refer the emphasis placed on the exploration of tombs and archaeological sites and the presence of a co-star incredibly similar to Lara Croft. Malice aside, however, Shadow Guardian cannot be denied a whole series of qualities that make it an interesting third-person action game within the iPhone landscape, even if it is not entirely without flaws. As per Gameloft tradition, the game excels from a purely graphic point of view, offering wide and detailed scenarios managed by an engine that shows no signs of letting up, not even the screen is filled with enemies and light effects. However, a special mention goes to the polygonal model of Jason, extremely well-finished but above all equipped with a set of animations at the top of the range for variety and fluidity: an opulence in front of which one willingly turns a blind eye to the banality of the design of settings and characters , who go fishing with both hands from the great cauldron of the videogame ~already seen~. Less exciting, but still positive, the situation on the sound front, with music and effects up to par unfortunately accompanied by an amateurish English dubbing which certainly does not facilitate the involvement in a story that is already rather devoid of bite, described by cutscenes that often and willingly one is tempted to skip at the same time. It is certainly nothing new that Gameloft products lack personality, but in the case of Shadow Guardian the regret is increased by the validity of a playful structure that struggles a bit to emerge in all its fullness as it is not supported by equally well-finished contour elements . Call me Jason In terms of gameplay, Shadow Guardian offers that mix of platform and shooter elements made famous by Uncharted, indeed with a clear prevalence of the first aspect. Most of the approximately 5-6 hours needed to complete the game are therefore spent moving Jason within the various settings, climbing walls, jumping from platform to platform and solving even simple environmental puzzles. In this sense, the control system performs a more than discreet job, allowing the user to perform a good variety of moves simply by using the virtual stick and a single key assigned to perform a whole series of context sensitive actions: the obvious backhand the medal is represented by an extreme linearity, reinforced by the on-screen messages that constantly provide clues on how to continue. An aspect that could induce a bit of boredom in more experienced players, but which undoubtedly allows the adventure to flow away in the most fluid way possible. Conversely, the action part is probably more compelling, but also more subject to the limitations of the device in terms of controls. Jason Call will find a whole series of firearms on his path (pistols, machine guns, rifles but also rocket launchers), which the user can extract by pressing the appropriate on-screen button: in doing so, the camera is positioned on the right shoulder of the protagonist, allowing you to aim through a reticle made more performing by a valid automatic pointing system. Inspired by Uncharted, Shadow Guardian could not fail to show off an adequate cover system, which actually works very well and which even allows you to move from one shelter to another or to shoot blindly. Finally, always mindful of Nathan Drake's deeds, even the good Jason can knock down his opponents with devastating melee combos which, if nothing else, prove to be really choreographedchips. A complete package that, however, is not always able to be managed properly through the virtual commands on the screen, cross and delight of many iPhone titles. The level of challenge is never too high however, and Jason's remarkable ability to take damage before going down makes this shortcoming tolerable.
