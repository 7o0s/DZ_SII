{"name": "Battle for the White House", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-for-the-white-house.html", "text": "Battle for the White House is a title that makes humor the basis on which to build everything else; this is immediately evident from the particularly successful and amusing caricature, colorful and cartoonish graphic style. An irreverent but intelligent and nice choice, which makes fun of the seriousness and the red-hot political climate especially during the electoral campaign. And even if the protagonists of Battle for the White House are part of a context several kilometers away from our home, the echo of the ~global village~ has in fact brought Hillary, Obama and their companions into the homes of anyone with the slightest interest in the foreign news. But in reality, being aware of who the protagonists of the Gameloft effort are is of marginal importance, since the game mechanics are the most universal and immediately usable there is. The product in question is in fact nothing more than a collection of mini-games, 8 to be precise, lasting a few minutes each and characterized by a particular simplicity. Therefore hit-and-run experiences, certainly already seen in the past, but which find a sure point in favor in the humor and irony of the graphic style. The protagonists are the six candidates, 3 Democrats and 3 Republicans, who have most attracted popular attention and interest: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. No trace instead John McCain and Mike Huckabee, but evidently the development of the game began when things were not yet very defined in this sense. In any case, this ~imprecision~, if we want to call it that, will hardly compromise the playful experience. As we said, the latter is articulated around 8 minigames; among them, ~Sabotage~ requires you to flee from your rival's bodyguards after having sabotaged a rally, trying to avoid obstacles along the way and at the same time signing the autographs of your supporters. In Ballot Ball, on the other hand, you have to collect votes by literally rolling over the citizens, being careful not to end up against trees or other unexpected events. Sneak-in is instead a pac-man clone, where instead of balls there are votes to collect and instead of ghosts there are security guards in front of the White House. Touch the Sky requires you to reach a certain distance by being propelled by planes, satellites, birds, balloons and so on. There is also a kind of Punch-out where you can beat up your challenger in the ring and even a rhyth'm game where you can make your aspiring president dance. At this point, the atmosphere and spirit that permeates Gameloft production should therefore be clear. Furthermore, practically all the mini-games can be played simply by pressing a key or using the arrow keys, making the title ideal for short games during breaks.
