An extremely transversal and versatile talent: on the one hand they have created Flight Control, one of the most casual and immediate games to appear on the iPhone, on the other hand they have given life to what is very probably the most harcore and realistic experience available so far on the Cupertino cell phone. We're talking about Real Racing, a game that no car enthusiast should miss out on. First to the finish line What pushed Real Racing into the limelight right from the first screenshots and videos, published during the initial stages of development, was undoubtedly the graphic aspect, particularly realistic and detailed to the point that many wanted to bother a laptop like Psp with a comparison that underlined the technical qualities of the iPhone. And although on balance in the challenge between hardware in all likelihood the Sony handheld can count on higher quality, it is in any case incredible what Firemint has managed to get from the iPhone, all the more so considering that the new revision, the 3GS, is found to be about 4 times more powerful than its predecessor. Real Racing is therefore aesthetically truly surprising, both in the construction of the dozen tracks and in the 36 cars available. The latter actually appear a bit too similar to each other within the division by categories, but all in all it is a venial defect that accompanies the lack of official licenses. Having said that, seeing detailed 3D routes, populated by 6 cars, all with a more than decent frame rate, flow from inside your car complete with dashboard in full view, is something that frankly only a few months ago seemed completely utopian on even a high-end mobile. The technical discourse is brilliantly closed by a soundtrack composed of 10 catchy and spot on indie songs. However, all this would be useless if not supported by a control system worthy of the name, and the lack of physical keys on Apple hardware had actually raised more than one doubt about it. In reality, also in this case we have had the confirmation that the ability of a talented team can make up for any limitation; In fact, Firemint has made available 4 different solutions which, together with settings for steering sensitivity and brake assistance, allow practically every player to find the combination that suits their tastes. For our part we find that methods A and B are decidedly the best, in which the steering is delegated to the inclination of the iPhone to the right or left thus simulating the rotation of the steering wheel; the result is a natural gameplay in which precise trajectories and brushstroke curves can be created after a short time. The mechanics have been well calibrated on a compromise between arcade and simulation: bumps rarely cause serious consequences and there is no damage to the cars, but in the same way you need to know how to dose the brake and accelerator well to avoid loss of grip or excursions on the lawn. As for the game modes, the main career offers a series of 57 events of increasing difficulty, in which you will rarely be able to relax driving on velvet; the opponents' AI was set at pretty competitive levels right from the start. There is also a local multiplayer and an online option in which to challenge other opponents on the best time. Finally, a note on the price, 7.99; a fairly high figure considering the standards of the App Store, but which represents the right value of a superior quality product. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-06-29", "grade": "9.4"}
