{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday There is an ~unwritten~ rule among Zelda players and enthusiasts, a sort of self-imposed taboo that anyone who is not on the margins of a gaming community tends to respect: the refusal, in any game of the series, to rename Link and impose on the hero his own name, that of the player. An emblematic affair above all because Link is, as his name declares, nothing but a ~connection~, an actant before being a videogame actor, a means for lowering the player into the game world. Upon its release, A Link to the Past magnificently enhances the mission inscribed in the same name of the genre (~role-playing game~) by presenting itself with a minimal, stylized but at the same time evocative, fairy-tale and naively surreal graphic design. Stretched between a world of Light and one of Darkness, which constitute opposite but complementary faces of the reality to be traversed, A Link to the Past starts from the real-time action formula of the first chapter of the series to bring to the peak a playful concept that builds a entire world around the player. The game world is a vast territory full of passages, connections, interrelationships, which it is up to the player to reveal step by step, not so much in parallel with the construction of one's own power, as with the knowledge of the world itself and the possession of its magical objects. Object by object, skill by skill, dungeon after dungeon, side quest after side quest, thus, a simple straight line is not solved, but the very fabric of a playable world is revealed to the player, admirably led to suspend any principle of verisimilitude , appears almost endowed with a veritable series of causal links, agents and motives. Link, the player, embodies the engine that keeps this world spinning again. What is it today Today more than ever A Link to the Past is a return to the past, a connection to something that remains, not canceled by the linear progress of time. The aesthetic presentation, already at the time refractory to the temptation to present itself in the avant-garde, still holds up today for cleanliness and style, placing itself halfway between the total stylization of the progenitor for NES and a fantasy graphic style that is never baroque, essential, not excessive but at the same time not without sophisticated visual surprises. Not to mention the sound sector, with sober but monumental versions of the already existing Zeldian refrains and the parallel consecration of new motifs and jingles today well known to all fans. Everything in the Zelda series really starts from this episode. The masterful, monumental conception and solidity of the game world are expressed not only in the quantity of objects, characters and situations, and in the many challenging dungeons (some of which are among the most difficult of the entire series), but also in the multiplicity of links between the various areas of the game world, which appears as a single and enormous gear. What is it today Link, yes, progresses, but the hero dominates above all with knowledge. There are no random wandering monsters, turn-based combat unrelated to action, endless re-spawning sessions to build experience or long, snooty dialogues: there are only the vast plains, deserts, rocky mountains, waters of Link's world , the medallions that will recognize us as chosen, the Master Sword, the pieces of the Triforce and a dark world that, nemesis and bad destiny of the events, it is necessary to cross and know in its specularity with that of light. The precision of the control, the very subtle and invisible direction, the involvement that derives from the action in real time and the feeling of lost solitude in a world-field of possible Links to be activated personally. All this makes A Link to the Past the best two-dimensional episode of the saga and one of the best RPGs of all time, whether in bitmap or polygonal graphics, old or new, with bump mapping at 1080 resolution or at a maximum of 256 colors on screen. The re-released version for the GameBoy Advance may have the advantage of portability, but it's not a faithful conversion like this one: overloaded with sound effects and link cries ~lifted~, for no real reason, from later chapters of the saga, it looks less like to a loyal ~return to the past~. In the videogame field, the expression ~timeless~ could hardly be used more sensibly than to describe the third chapter of the Zelda series. Presenting itself at its release as the culmination of Nintendo's action-RPG research and as a technical peak of game design, A Link to the Past (born in 1991) has established itself as an unmissable experience for every gamer, as an essential reference for the sixteen-bit era and as one of the greatest examples of solidity, seduction and poetry of a playable world. And if it is just as difficult che investment of 1000 Wii Points on this masterpiece of the past may not prove to be a highly desirable choice, narrowing down the entire variety and richness of the gaming experience in a simple review would be an unlikely undertaking.", "date": "2007-04-24", "grade": null}
