{"name": "Chromehounds - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chromehounds-recensione.html", "text": "A bit of history The Balkan area is historically considered the ~powder keg of Europe~, and evidently based on this definition From Software has decided to place the historical background of Chromehounds right there. The plot is chronologically divided into two sections: the Story Mode, which can be tackled in single player mode, narrates the socio-political issues that will lead to the Neroimus War, the scenario of online battles. In Single Player we will therefore find ourselves enrolled in the Rafzakael mercenary team, a true legend in combat, due to the great ability demonstrated by its components, the curriculum of its commanders and above all for having first refined the art of war in board of new and revolutionary armored vehicles: the hounds. A bit of history Being mercenaries, we will find ourselves fighting indiscriminately on one side or the other of the factions in play, following the job offers and consequently getting a general idea of all the issues that will lead to the real outbreak of war in the territory. The Neroimus War will then break out between the three nations involved in the riots in the area, namely Sal Kar, Tarakia, and Morskoj, who will compete for domination of the whole territory in the online campaign. During the offline game, the plot unfolds rigorously, narrated through the ~voiceover~ that introduces the various phases, the captains and battlemates who will guide and accompany us during the combat phases. As for the online war, however, being based on a persistent structure, the events will take place as a result of the progress of the battles between the online teams, belonging to the selected factions and each aimed at conquering sections of the map. In this phase the chronological trend and historical events are narrated through a sort of news bulletin, which informs on the global trend of the Neroimus War. Half complex, simple controls We were saying that the complexity of the Hound's assembly phase is matched by a relative simplicity in the controls, this is matched both in the mastery of the movements of the vehicle and in the information to be kept under control on the screen. A small radar signals short-range movements in the lower right corner of the screen, in the upper right we find a window with the view from the weapon, to better frame the target, while a few other information, such as the time since the end of the match, ammo quantity and energy are the other essential information provided. As far as the controls are concerned, they are based on a well-established structure: with the left analog stick we move the Hound, while with the right one the view. The classic right trigger is the fire button, while the lats allow you to switch weapons. Pressing the right stick activates the very useful weapon view (normally relegated to the upper right corner of the screen), i.e. a full screen viewfinder equipped with a more or less powerful zoom depending on the type of weapon with which it is associated. Life as a mercenary pilot The whole game revolves around the cornerstone element represented by the hounds. These armored vehicles of different types can be built starting from scratch and subsequently continuously expanded with new additions ranging from the basic structure of the mech (lower mobile unit, cockpit, generator and various sensors) to the paraphernalia and more or less particular instruments such as additional radars, armor and various detection systems up to the decals to be applied on the armor. The obsessive care placed in the vehicle customization phase is reflected in an infinite number of different combinations to assemble your own destructive hound, always within the limit of particular parameters to be followed such as balance, energy consumption and the overall weight of the vehicle. Every single component applicable on the exoskeleton carries with it an enormous amount of data concerning consumption, dimensions, weight, maintenance price, durability, heat generated and possible attack power, both for heavy weapons and for single ammunition ( all selectable from a rich list) to apply. In this regard, it should also be mentioned the intention of Sega and From Software to provide free new accessories and components via Xbox Live, the first delivery of which has also been available for a few days on the Marketplace, which should help keep interest high over time for this game. This accuracy in the assembly phase, and the relative different behavior of each mech on the basis of it, represents the most purely simulation component present in the game, which is matched by a surprisingly playful sectionsimple and intuitive as regards the controls and the strategic management of the matches. The hounds are divided into 6 different types, called Role Types (RT) each with its own roles and characteristics: the Scout in charge of reconnaissance, the Defender suitable for defending the base, the Soldier, a balanced fighter for short-range battles, the Heavy Gunner specialized in heavy weaponry, the Commander responsible for communications within the team and for managing the map and tactical arrangements and the ever-present Sniper, the sniper in charge of long-range combat. The story mode allows you to try out all the various types of hounds, and the missions employed in one or another role influence our fighter profile, but it is in the online mode that we can best characterize ourselves and specialize on a RT at our choice, especially based on the structure of our team. Life as a mercenary pilot The general game structure is basically based on a few rules: the objective is the destruction of the opponents or the enemy headquarters, and to do this it is necessary to ensure control of the map through the conquest of particular radio stations, called Combas, which by expanding the range of radars and communications provide a great strategic advantage during battles. The story mode obviously offers different variations and objectives, but the core of the game remains the same: protection of your base and destruction of enemies. The battles take place just as it is legitimate to expect from a mech simulation: furious firefights from different distances (depending on the characteristic role of the vehicles involved) in which it is the choice of weapons used, the timing and teamwork that decree for mostly the winner, plus obviously the ability to create a Hound as powerful and resistant as possible. Clearly, we find ourselves driving colossal and very heavy vehicles, not exactly in an FPS, and from this derives the relative awkwardness in movements and maneuvers, which at first could displace. The persistent war It seems clear that the single-player game mode is a sort of huge tutorial, a preparatory phase to prepare the player for online battles, the real fulcrum of the game. Once we enter the online section we find ourselves in front of the map representing the entire area involved in the Neroimus War, with all the hot areas, engaged in battles, potentially attackable or at risk of capture well marked by flags. We are asked to choose which of the three nations (Sal Kar, Tarakia, and Morskoj) to side with (choice that can be changed later), and to join an existing squadron or create a new one. After that we will be free to enter battle or calmly work out our hound. It seems clear that the single-player game mode is a sort of huge tutorial, a preparatory phase to prepare the player for online battles, the true fulcrum of the game The persistent war The peculiar feature that distinguishes the online mode is the fact that it provides a persistent scenario to the players: that is, the Neroimus War is a global war, which involves all the players connected to the Chromehounds server, and as in an MMORPG, this continues and it evolves regardless of whether you are connected to the game or not. Every time we connect we are updated on the progress of the war, we learn about the results of the many battles, we are informed about particular socio-political events that have occurred and, depending on the nation with which we sided, we are given instructions on the most critical areas of the war and strategic information on where the contribution of troops is most needed. It is obviously also possible to create online games detached from the context of the Neroimus War (present the inevitable deathmatches and various derivatives from ~capture the flag~), but the prospect of being placed within a global context is undoubtedly more attractive. A minimum of two players is enough to form a team and it is not necessary to have covered all six different roles foreseen for the fighters. However, it is necessary for a member to assume the role of commander, but it is the only restriction imposed, even if in teams with more than three companions it becomes advisable to distribute the forces in the field in different roles (RT). Communication via microphone during online play occurs only between squad members, even in the pre-match lobby, and continues throughout the combat phase, where COMBAS coverage permits, which tends to increase teammates' unity and creates a certain detachment in copponent's faces. At the end of the battle, our result is added in real time to that of the other clashes in progress, and helps to determine the global trend of the war, increasing our nation's penetration into the territory or vice versa, giving ground (and personal experience points , by the way) to opponents. When one of the three nations reaches 100% of the conquered territory, it wins and the Neroimus War ends: war booty and medals are distributed to teams allied with that nation and at that point a game phase ends. The server is then restarted and the war starts all over again, with a cyclical, perennial (and even a little disturbing to tell the truth) revival of the global conflict. The amount of data collected in the game is large, with the possibility of viewing global or non-global rankings regarding the performance of each individual player or team, as well as the medals and achievements of each one. It must be said that the online game is not exactly free from management and connection problems, which indeed arise quite often preventing the correct connection to the games and often forcing repeated attempts before being able to access a battle. These are problems that, we hope, will be resolved as soon as possible with a server upgrade, even if managing a persistent online gaming environment without an additional subscription could actually be difficult. Shimmering metal Technically Chromehounds is quite convincing, at least in the care taken in the construction of the vehicles, which is evident from the first glance inside the personal garage. The design of the hounds is beautiful and realistic, with the technological differences that characterize the three warring nations which are reflected in a different style of the components packaged by them. It is impressive to note, in the construction of the vehicle, how all the elements fit together perfectly (where the geometric configuration allows it, of course), giving the possibility to create an infinite number of different hounds, which can be customized as desired. It's not difficult to get caught up in the modeling frenzy, and it's extremely easy to end up spending half of the time spent in the game inside the garage. The textures used are extremely realistic and fully convey the sensation of the various materials of which the armored exoskeletons are made, in particular with the effects of reflections and light on the metal parts among the most convincing seen in the latest Xbox 360 titles, and the animations also contribute to give a great physicality to the hounds, with their believably heavy gait and the moving details of each joint. On the other hand, the scenarios appear rather minimalistic. Large clearings, deserts or snowy expanses, if on the one hand they allow you to maintain good fluidity and an almost constant frame rate even online, on the other they don't exactly make you cry out for a miracle, with very few polygons on the screen and very little attention to detail, even if the light effects and reflections of the sun and explosions are very pleasant. It is also true that given the game structure, having a broad horizon and a great depth of vision helps to see enemies even from afar, and can therefore prove to be a strategic advantage, just as, vice versa, however, it offers few elements with which to hide and carry out ambushes. Only the levels set in big cities actually deviate from the rule, offering a battlefield characterized by streets and huge buildings (all clearly available to be destroyed) to somewhat cover the progress of the various fighters on the map. In general, flashes of next gen appear in the light effects and in the rendering of the materials exclusively as regards the hounds, while the rest appears somewhat subdued. The sound is standard, with standard effects for explosions, shots and mechanical movements and music that alternates pleasant songs (such as the theme that accompanies the presentation and the initial screen) with others that are absolutely anonymous or bordering on annoying, such as during the of preparation in the online mode or that sort of midi-style tune that appears at the end of a Neroimus War. Comment Chromehounds is clearly a game designed to be played online. Anyone who doesn't have an Xbox Live subscription, therefore, is probably not able to savor its true potential. In fact, the single-player game appears slow, monotonous and boring, when compared to the online experience, which also enjoys the particular charm given by being set in a persistent world. Of course, the various server connection problems that often occur can undermine the esper", "date": "2006-07-21", "grade": null}
