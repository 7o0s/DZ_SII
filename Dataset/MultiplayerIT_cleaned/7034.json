{"name": "Capcom Fighting Collection: la recensione della nuova raccolta di capolavori del passato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/capcom-fighting-collection-recensione.html", "text": "Once upon a time there was the golden Capcom, that of the 90s, a period in which any fan of fighting games had almost exclusively the phantasmagorical house in Osaka in his imagination. Those were the years of Street fighter II or Darkstalkers, flagships of the studio's videogame park. It is precisely these 2 titles together with other little goodies that embellish this new collection of masterpieces from the past. Let's see together in the Capcom Fighting Collection review how much nostalgia there is and how much a valid collection really can be. Condiments for all tastes Red Earth: Leo in action Before considering each video game in the collection, it is necessary to make a premise: all the titles included are the arcade versions of the time with different features created specifically for this re-edition. This means, therefore, that unfortunately some characters of some games, present only in the respective console versions, will not be present. However, the general experience is absolutely not affected by this, on the contrary, thanks to the support for 4 different resolutions, a finely crafted opening video and the possibility of jumping into online multiplayer directly from the colorful main menu. Add to this the option to remap the keys of every single game, change the difficulty and be able to train to excel in every single title and you understand how this collection is simply what every fighting game enthusiast can ask for. To enrich it even more the offer takes care of some really well-made retro filters that manage to give everything that extra pinch of nostalgia that never hurts in operations like this. The icing on the cake is a museum mode in which to admire drawings, concept art and music, all of excellent workmanship. Street Fighter and co. Capcom Fighting Collection: Street Fighter 2 Capcom Fighting Collection has 3 distinct souls. The first is clearly the one belonging to Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition which contains everything a true lover of the most iconic fighting game ever released could ever want. Another is the one dedicated to the Darkstalkers saga, present here in all its iterations, even those that pretend to be such, but in fact they are only ~DLC~ of the same title. And then there is the more romantic, niche one, the one to which the remaining games belong, those perhaps forgotten by most, but which, if analyzed and contextualized, offer a truly exciting and satisfying experience with a vintage touch. Let's see in detail the offer of each of the titles in the Capcom Fighting Collection. Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition Dating back to the early 2000s, Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition is the newest game in the collection. Anyone who knows Street Fighter II is certainly aware of all its future iterations, from Super to Hyper and this game is the summation of all knowledge released with the Street Fighter II hat. This means that it is possible, for example, to fight with Chun-Li Hyper against a Classic Honda, and all this online with really well done netcode rollback. The controls are responsive and that can only be a positive. Small note of merit to the really high Arcade-style difficulty, which does not save already from the first levels. Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo The only collection game in which you don't beat your hands. At least not directly. This colorful spin-off of Capcom's most famous fighting game series is a kind of Tetris with indicators of combos and special moves. Every time you score points, the characters in the background give each other a good fight. Here too we are in the territory of perfect optimization and in our test we did not encounter any frame rate or slowdown problems. Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix Here we are from the parts of the fan service. Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix is a super cute, super cute and super colorful fighting game featuring Street Fighter and Darkstalkers characters in chibi form. Not only. It is permeated by a very pleasant comic aura that can be found throughout the outline. Note the iconic Mr. Bison on the sled in the background of one of the stages. Darkstalkers and co. Capcom Fighting Collection, Darkstalkers Darkstalkers collection We don't want to distinguish too much the titles dedicated to the dark saga since of five games, 2 are updates of one of them. The Night Warriors, Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge, Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire, Vampire Hunter 2: Darkstalkers' Revenge and Vampire Savior 2, as you can already see from the titles, the similarity is clear. Apart from this small note of demerit possiI love to say with absolute tranquility that the Darkstalkers saga is the funniest, craziest and most heterogeneous ever conceived during those years. Over the top characters, devastating special moves, truly unforgettable soundtrack and fan service everywhere (someone said Morrigan?). Also for this saga the previous speeches apply, excellent optimization and zero frame rate drop, with the help of the netcode rollback that never hurts. Red Earth Red Earth We come to the real gem of the collection. We don't know how many of you have ever played this game, but we're willing to bet that it will be very few. Now you all have the opportunity to play this gem of Capcom in its best version. Red Earth is essentially a fighting game, but with some peculiar characteristics. First of all, you will be able to choose only 4 characters, among which Leo, the lion that stands out on the cover of the game, certainly stands out. During the fights with the various bosses, all contextualized and much more story driven than the other fighting games of the 90s, you will accumulate experience that will make you level up and learn new skills. Red Earth is therefore a sort of role-playing fighting game version and at the end of the games you will have the possibility to write down passwords to be able to choose your character even in online challenges, making everything much more customizable and unpredictable than simple online matches. To embellish everything, also add extremely fluid animations and a really cool ~fatality~ system. Cyberbots Last but not least, Cyberbots is another one of those hard-to-find goodies. The main feature is clearly the fact of being able to fight aboard mechs, diversified by type and characteristics. The story mode in fact includes 6 playable characters each with its own personal story. After having selected one we will have the possibility to choose between 4 different types of mechs with each of which 3 predefined builds dedicated to different characteristics with the possibility of performing particular special moves. Animations and soundtrack embellish this hidden gem making it shine again in the eyes of new players.", "date": "2022-06-29", "grade": "8.5"}
