Mario and Sonic are accompanied, as usual, by their entire entourage and in this edition the 40 available characters (between the initial ones and the unlockable ones) stand out immediately compared to the 21 of the 2014 Sochi winter edition. Confirming, therefore, a mechanism already tested in previous editions, Nintendo offers a new collection of minigames inspired by the Olympic disciplines, trying to exploit all the characteristics of the portable console with sometimes very spot on, sometimes less functional mechanics. As had already happened for Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, the portable console version is enriched by a nice story mode, the Road to Rio (Towards Rio, in Italian), which has your Mii as the protagonist for the which you will choose the nationality and the gym to affiliate with between that of the Italian plumber or the blue hedgehog. Will Mario and Sonic be able to win the gold medal for the best game of Olympic disciplines? Or will we find ourselves faced with yet another party game? Let's find out to the rhythm of samba! Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is a lot of fun but offers very little novelty The marathon in your pocket Among the initial choice options, compared to previous editions, there is an amusing novelty that will especially interest those who always carry the console with them: Marathon in their pocket! In practice, this mode activates a pedometer which will signal the moment in which you have completed the fateful 42 kilometers and 195 metres: in addition to seeing how long it will take you to cover this distance in everyday life, you will unlock bonuses (which do not hurt never) offering you one more reason to undertake further ~pocket marathons~. In addition to the story mode and the marathon, there is also the classic Quick Match option that allows you to try to win one of the medals up for grabs or break a record in any of the 14 available trials. Each of these Olympic disciplines has its own Plus counterpart which, by adding various thematic elements taken from the worlds of Mario or Sonic, enriches them making them more varied and fun (sometimes even bordering on the absurd), some examples? In boxing, you can take advantage of random bonus cubes a la Mario Kart, or in golf, ramps and obstacles will be added. With the Versus mode you can challenge up to 4 friends who don't necessarily have to own the game, just have a single copy and take advantage of the download feature of the Nintendo 3DS. Unfortunately, once again the Mario and Sonic Olympic Games don't give the possibility to play online against other players, making this title much less attractive for those who love multiplayer challenges but don't have friends with the console at hand; in fact, the console's only reason for accessing the internet is to let you download records from around the world so that you can compare yourself with them. The Changing Rooms are a virtual room to change the clothing and equipment that make up the bonuses you will get, not only with the Marathon in your pocket, but also and above all as you progress through the objectives of the story mode by leveling up your Mii, or simply buying them with fruit obtained in training minigames; in the locker room it is also possible to interact with amiibo in order to give the golden color to your Mii's clothing and boost its statistics for 24 hours after using it: the compatible amiibo are that of Sonic and any of those of Mario. In the hole with... stylus! While none of the 14 disciplines that make up the game's backbone has the depth of existing single-sport games like Mario Golf or Mario Striker, the challenge remains quite rewarding especially when trying to break Olympic and world records. The gameplay, in some disciplines, is very spot on but in others less, so much so that it is even uncomfortable: some mechanics return from previous editions, for example, the quick pressing of the A button to run the 100 flat meters and the 110 obstacles. The long jump, this time, involves pressing the B button to jump and not the uncomfortable lifting up of the entire console of the London 2012 edition! Rhythmic gymnastics keeps intact the structure of the rhythm game in which it is necessary to press the right p in timethrobbing. Particularly successful, even if already known in the previous edition of the games, is the archery which uses the gyroscope of the Nintendo 3DS and which will put you in difficulty with the miserable 5 seconds you will have to adjust the angle, making the right consideration of the wind. Golf, a novelty both for the real Rio Olympics and for this playful video transposition, takes advantage of the Nintendo 3DS stylus by emulating the clubs to give the classic ~swing~ and, therefore, impart the right speed and strength: a really fun simulation which is even more so, as mentioned above, in the Plus mode. The nib will also ~transform~ into a javelin and, in this case, its use is particularly effective in trying to give the right shooting angle; however, the device of quickly swiping the stylus back and forth across the touch screen to increase the athlete's speed didn't seem quite up to a button press. The third test that involves the use of the stylus is freestyle swimming where the stylus is used to simulate the whirlpool movement created by strokes. In boxing, another new entry in the game, each character will have his own characteristics of power, speed, skill and resistance, but the fight is reduced to a two-dimensional fistfight where each key is assigned to a type of punch and you can choose to use manual or automatic watch. In horse riding you will have to complete an obstacle course keeping the horse on the right path while in BMX you will be in competition with other cyclists; in the first case the stroke is obtained by pressing the pad or analog stick upwards, in the second case you will have to repeatedly press the A key and we assure you that it is not comfortable when you are simultaneously trying to turn correctly or jump in proximity of the bumps. Neither football nor beach volleyball shine in terms of quality, offering very little to do except pass, shoot, tackle and special shot in the first case and serve, dunk and block in the other: in both cases forget tactics of any kind , you won't spend much time on it. Table tennis is perhaps the most disappointing discipline (slightly more satisfying in plus mode), you only need timing with the A key while the B key should be used to simulate a cut ball but in terms of the game almost nothing changes. 3D effect The 3D effect is pleasant and in some cases even above average (especially on the large screen of the Nintendo 3DS XL) with a depth rendered really well, however, the problem remains, already seen in London 2012, of the tests in which you will have to move the console and your eyes will not be aligned with the screen. We experienced no drop in frame rate. Training with other sports What happened to the over 50 sports of London 2012? Nintendo this time has chosen to include the other tests within the story mode in the form of training. They can also be chosen individually but not before having unlocked them in the ~week~ that your Mii takes to travel to Rio. Also available are pole vaulting, track cycling, swimming backstroke or breaststroke (in this style you will have to blow on the time console), field hockey, badminton (singles or doubles), triple jump, synchronized swimming in teams and in pairs, trampoline, canoeing also in slalom version, relay race, water polo, handball, clay pigeon shooting, rings, fencing, diving from the trampoline, sailing, target shooting, hammer throwing, free throws and 3,000m steeplechase. However, many of these sports added to training are even less faithful reductions of the 14 main disciplines; honestly, we would have preferred to have a few less but more cared for, some of them are embarrassing and seem to have been placed only to make up the number. From a graphic point of view, the leap is quite clear compared to the London 2012 version with greater attention to detail and with much more vivid colors, while the sound sector and the music do their duty even if after a while you will begin to dislike plus the samba-style main tune. We tested the game on New Nintendo 3DS XL and not only did we not experience any slowdowns but also the loads are really negligible (at least you won't have to wait so long between one test and another). We would have liked to be able to say that much progress has been made compared to the London 2012 version but unfortunately this is not the case, probably the sales figures of this series are sufficient for Nintendo not to upset the cards on the table since very little has been done more.", "date": "2016-04-06", "grade": "7.5"}
