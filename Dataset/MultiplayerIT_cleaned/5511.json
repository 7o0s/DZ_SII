{"name": "The Last Oricru", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-last-oricru-recensione.html", "text": "On paper, The Last Oricru is nothing more than the perfect balance between various art and level design trends which in the last fifteen years have influenced the design, development and creation of a good portion of the productions that have entered the market, loaded with a certain kind of ambitions. Broadly speaking, in fact, the first work of the Czech team GoldKnights can be defined as the ideal meeting point between Mass Effect and Dark Souls, a recognizable interpenetration, first of all, in the artistic direction where sci-fi elements, such as gadgets with a futuristic look, they are immersed in a rather classic fantasy context, including castles, swords, shields and spells. On the other hand, the gameplay adopts the lesson imparted by FromSoftware productions, with potentially deadly clashes, decided by reasoned attacks and punctual dodges, a scheme now quite known to lovers of the genre, which however in this case is declined within a fictitious world that is anything but cryptic, but rather eager to tell and show itself in the movies, in the dialogues with the NPCs, in the multiple choices, and changes of sides, which will heavily influence the course of history, leading to situations and consequently extremely different endings between them, intimately connected to the decisions made by the gamer during the game. Dark Souls meets Mass Effect precisely. An action-RPG in which to decide which side to take and how to complete your mission. It couldn't get better than this, right? Wrong. Because the review of The Last Oricru speaks of a failure from any point of view you look at it, a disaster of such dimensions as to give, for the wrong reasons of course, more than an uncontrolled laugh. Don't take yourself seriously The Last Oricru, Silver watches the battle from a safe distance Silver, an unlikely protagonist already by appearance, is the foul-mouthed and irreverent forgetful of this story. Having awakened from a cryogenic sleep on an alien planet, together with the other few humans present on the surface of Wardenia, thanks to the futuristic belt that surrounds his life, he is basically immortal. He can fall under the blows of the opposing swords, of course, but he will always come back to life near some shiny contraptions, neither more nor less the bonfires of The Last Oricru, where you can recharge the vials for life recovery and level up, allowing him to try endlessly to get the better of those who try to counter it. The enemies, as in any episode of Game of Thrones, often change their face, given that, as anticipated, you will decide who to side with and which side to support, with significant changes to the progression itself, since some areas can consequently turn out to be chock full of enemies or allies, and you may find yourself forced to cross swords with who, just a moment before, you considered a precious companion. This feature, despite running into some paradox from time to time, works on paper and in practice, so much so that, by itself, it manages to make bearable a story that is in itself uninteresting, at times obvious, animated by a cast in which very few figures stand out from the others. The Last Oricru, one of the few evocative scenarios you will pass through Limiting ourselves to analyzing the narrative sector, the problems can in fact be seen on any level. The power games for control of the planet between Naboru and Broken Army, against which the violent revolt of the Ratkins stands out, anthropomorphic rats who have always been in slavery, do not offer who knows what twists, nor do they open to particular thematic insights worthy of note . Everything, if anything, is sucked up by Silver's not always brilliant irony, who never misses an opportunity to reply piquedly to his interlocutors, strengthened by the immortality guaranteed by his belt. Every now and then we laugh heartily at our cheek, but more often than not we are astonished in the face of a script that is sometimes childish and creepy films, between incomprehensible directorial choices and glitches that ruin even the few dramatic moments that the plot would like to dispense to the viewer. It happens, for example, to witness a total mismatch between image and sound, not to mention the frequent asynchrony between the characters' facial expressions and the dubbing. Some glimpses of The Last Oricru aren't evil The feeling of being faced with an amateur product, made with scarce funds and novice personnel available, is further exacerbated, and we are talking about it now to remove the tooth, from an absolutely inadequate graphics sector. The Last Oricru not only doesn't look like a game for the current console generation, but it would have risked being worn out.gure even on PlayStation 3. Although there are some evocative panoramas, for the most part you will find yourself wandering through settings lacking in details, between low-definition textures and comically animated polygonal models, endowed with such ridiculous and slow movements as to make you wonder if all this is not a desired effect. Between bugs, interpenetrations between polygons and an absolutely dancer frame rate, just so as not to miss anything, everything is so badly done as to heavily affect the gameplay. A Dark Souls in slow motion The Last Oricru, based on your choices some parts of the game world will change their conformation Yes, the gameplay, another aspect in which The Last Oricru does not particularly shine, to put it mildly. Broadly speaking, as mentioned, it is about exploring various settings, eliminating enemies, possibly completing side quests, leveling up, talking to characters willing to do so, being ready for a possible multiple choice. Nothing more, nothing less. The management of the character, needless to say, almost perfectly follows that of Dark Souls. Practically every object involves bonuses and maluses in the various statistics, a characteristic that requires an extra moment of application to be able to equip yourself worthily, without negatively influencing parameters even if necessary to use weapons and armor correctly, but with the exception of this content and partial impulse of originality , the rest continues on known paths. The story of The Last Oricru would like to be epic Returning to the aforementioned respawn points, you can level up, deepen the lore through recorded messages, activate specific skills. There is a weight limit to be respected for the equipment worn, it is essential to model Silver with a build in mind to make it as efficient as possible, almost all weapons have special attacks that require mana to be unsheathed. From this point of view, if there are no substantial innovations, at least GoldKnights can be recognized as having done his homework well, thanks also to the very high amount of loot recoverable on the battlefield which makes it interesting to look for the best combination of all. It is a pity that the efforts made are largely wasted. Yes, because The Last Oricru is very little fun to play. Commenting on the technical sector of the game, we have already raised the main defects of the production, but there is even worse. Very slow animations make it extremely easy to avoid enemy shots, despite the control system occasionally missing a few shots and being very wooden. Between instant saves that literally block the game for a precious handful of moments and the dodge that sometimes simply does not activate, we have remedied some game overs certainly not for our shortcomings. The Last Oricru, the co-op puts a small patch on the many flaws Also, the game tends to be unnecessarily distracting. With the accomplice of repeating settings and the absence of any map or compass, it can happen that you wander around the scenario on duty for tens of minutes, simply because sufficient and precise indications on the next stage to reach are not provided. If nothing else, the choice system actually works. Although in some cases paradoxical situations are reached, with too sudden and drastic changes of sides, the plot really takes significantly different directions based on the decisions made and the success, or failure, of specific missions. , co-op also competes, online and locally. The gameplay does not magically repair itself, nor does the graphics undergo improvements of any kind, on the contrary, but with a friend at least the progression is made more pleasant, also thanks to some moves that can be activated exclusively with the collaboration of both players.", "date": "2022-10-16", "grade": "5.0"}
