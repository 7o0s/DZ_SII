This fourth installment of the Trails of Cold Steel series is the conclusion of a work that started many years ago and on which Nihom Falcom is betting everything he has. A really well written story and a combat and progression system which, as we will see, is complex and articulated enough, are the cornerstones of the production. With the premises of the excellent previous chapters and skyrocketing expectations, we approached this title with the hopes of a child who goes to see his favorite team at the stadium for the first time. Will he have satisfied us? Find out in the review of The legend of Heroes: Trails of cold steel 4. History Giliath Osborne immediately after the final battle of the third chapter, suddenly kidnapped Rean, his son and one of the instructors of the new class VII. This shocking revelation is the incipit of the bombastic story that accompanies Juna, Kurt, Altina and all the members of the old and new infamous school class towards full circle. Exactly 2 weeks after the clash with Osborne, at the end of a dream in which they live in alternative realities, our 3 heroes find themselves catapulted into the world at the dawn of the ~Great Twilight~, a calamity that is destined to destroy the world as well as they know him. All the regions have set up recruiting stations for the imminent and inevitable great war and it seems that a sort of ~dark wind~ is convincing everyone to enlist, even those who up until then had no intention of doing so. The entire first chapter, which lasts more or less a full quarter of the game, will lead us to seek and purify some singularities created by cursed flowers around the world, so as to cancel this strange wind and trace the position of Rean, gone mad after activating the curse on him, and save him. From here on, a plot unfolds which, without spoilers, will accompany us in the discovery of new cities and old acquaintances, new friends and hidden powers with which to defeat the tons of creatures scattered across the immense game map. For those who already know the series, it will be possible to visit the nations of Crossbell and Erebonia, even if still, inconceivably as in the second chapter, it will not be possible to visit the capital of the empire, Heimdall. There are two endings to be able to see, one of which, of course, can be reached by achieving certain objectives in the game. The ~True Ending~ is what all fans of the series have been dreaming of seeing for almost 2 decades, as the story of this Trails of Cold Steel IV is the conclusion of a storyline that has been growing and continuing from the chapters Zero no Kiseki and Ao no Kiseki, originally released for PSP and then ported to Vita. Gameplay The fourth chapter does not differ so much from the already excellent progression, exploration and combat system of the previous game. Let's start with exploration. From the end of the first chapter you will have an airship to travel freely between the regions explored to try to upgrade your characters and look for specific equipment and skills. Already from the first chapter, however, simply from the game map, we will be able to move freely even with a sort of teleportation, thus allowing us to be able to explore certain areas and perhaps talk to that NPC with whom we had forgotten to interact previously. We move with the left analog, while with the right we can move the view freely both during exploration and during fights. On the ground every now and then, apart from the normal chests containing objects and skills, we will be able to find, new for the series, ~trial~ chests. These special chests will be inhabited by some enemies, normally of a slightly higher level than ours which, once defeated, will allow us to enhance the infamous Orders to be given to our team and which we will talk about later. It is also possible to fish if you have fishing rods and lures, with the various fish obtained exchangeable for items and equipment through shops. Another secondary activity is that of the Blade, a collectible card game in which we will be able to challenge various characters during our raids. It will also be possible to cook the recipes stored in the shops with the ingredients that can be recovered in the game. Do you think minigames are enough? Well know that you are wrong because we will also have the opportunity to take pictures via our mobile phone of particular landscapes to send them to our trusted photographer so as to obtain rewards, as well as sending data ofbattle and places visited to get more. Last but not least the Black Jack of the various city casinos, this game needs little explanation. In short, there are really all kinds of things to do and for all tastes. Speaking of battles we get to the heart of the matter. To activate one, just collide with the enemies on the screen and the battle will begin automatically, transporting us to the battlefield. The initiative depends on several factors and can be different depending on how we approach the enemy in question. In fact, with the action key we will be able to attack the beasts before engaging in combat to stun them and receive an advantage round. If, in addition to stunning them, we also attack them from behind instead, we will get 3. If, on the other hand, we are noticed first, we will suffer a preventive attack from the enemy. The combat has remained almost unchanged from the third chapter. These are locked turn-based fights, i.e. with a sequence of actions to be given to the characters one at a time, each with a different delay, depending on the type of action chosen. For example, if we simply decide to attack, we will have a smaller delay for the next action of the same character compared to a more powerful action, such as an S-Craft for example, which is the most powerful move available. ability to attack, move, use items, arts, craft, escape or issue orders. The attack is simply an action performed with the equipped weapon and naturally depends on the physical or magical attack stat, depending on the equipment. Moving within the combat area, on the other hand, is essential to have the enemies ~within range~. Yes, because every action, even the simple attack or use of objects, has a range. It is basically a circle within which that action takes effect and if a given character and/or enemy is outside that range they will not be affected by the consequences of using the action. Using an object instead is the action that causes the least delay to suffer to the character who uses it and we will be able to choose from many objects with the most varied consequences. The Arts and Crafts, on the other hand, are the skills that we will be able to use. The former are linked to the equipment of orbs, colored spheres inserted into the various cell phones of each individual character. Their color also indicates their type, such as the red ones of fire element or the blue ones with positive effects such as Thelos which resurrects a companion. These spheres can also be upgraded to amplify the power of the skill, but must go hand in hand with the slots in which they are equipped, also upgradeable, which must have the same rank and elemental affinity as the skill inserted. In order to be used, the Arts consume special points called EPs which can be recovered through the use of specific objects or skills. Then scattered throughout the game, protected by specific missions, we will find some special abilities, a sort of ~Limit Break~, the Lost Arts. These very powerful skills can change the course of battles and can only be used once per fight, wasting all EP points. Crafts, on the other hand, are personal skills belonging to each individual character, which can also be activated with the use of special points, in this case Combat points or CPs. They are actions that cannot be replicated by anyone else and are divided into normal Craft and S-Craft. The latter is the move that is the most powerful of the craft and consumes all the CP. However, the CPs can also be consumed to perform a sort of summoning, calling into battle for a single and very powerful attack, the Divine knights or the panzer Soldat, or the available models of mechs led by our heroes. Precisely these ~robots~ will be the protagonists every now and then during the adventure of fights dedicated to them, usually in crucial points of the story, with ad hoc battle mechanics designed to diversify the experience even more. In fact, we will be able to heal or defend ourselves, as well as use the skills of the various pilots to avoid succumbing. Another peculiar feature of the combat system is the possibility of inflicting a sort of stun on our enemy. By attacking enemies, as well as decreasing their vital energy, we will also affect the Break bar which, brought to zero, will allow us to activate ad hoc mechanics. By attacking an enemy in this phase we will have the possibility of using 3 other actions: connect a second attack with the character linked to the one we are controlling, perform a Rush, i.e. a combo with the same linked character, or a combined attackwith the whole party, called Burst. This dynamic connects directly to other special points, the Battle Points, which can be accumulated precisely with the combined attack during the break. These points can be used to launch a rush or burst or to issue Special Orders to the team. This action in particular is extremely tactical with the most demanding fights, as it offers very powerful temporary buffs to the whole team. Each character has his own personal order so this element can also be discriminating for the choice of the party. Finally, since we have only mentioned them, there are the links. It is an automatic help system in a nutshell, a dynamic that allows you to unite, link precisely, 2 characters between them, thus allowing them to help each other at certain times. This skill also has its points and levels, with increasingly strong link skills unlockable as you level up. Perhaps the downside of this whole system is its fairly steep learning curve, not helped by the fact that it's not located Italian. If you are not a veteran of the series, being able to get into the perspective of the complex customization and upgrade tree, with all the points to administer and the myriad of linkable skills, could be confusing and complicated at first. To enrich the offer even more, there is a general ranking progress system, a sort of adventurer rank, which increases according to the activities carried out within a single chapter. Increasing this rank will allow you to enhance various skills and obtain some characteristic perks. Technique From the point of view of the graphics sector, Trials of Cold Steel IV does not deviate too much from its predecessor while keeping animations, polygonal counts and textures practically unchanged, thus not reaching qualitative excellence but overall returning a pleasant and clean glance. The exquisitely Japanese style and the obsessive characterization of each individual character are certainly the flagship of the production. The illustrations and the (few in fact) traditional animation films are of excellent workmanship, as is the audio sector. There are some truly powerful tracks and theme callbacks from previous chapters that will delight longtime fans. Finally, the effects of all the animations and shots are rendered really well, with particles and plays of light cleverly managed compared to the overall quality. However, note some drop in frame rate during fights in automatic mode and with high speed active which forced us more than a few times to have to switch to manual mode even in the simplest battles. Speaking of simple battles: if by chance during exploration the enemy hit by the initiative attack is much lower than you in terms of level, instead of fighting him you will kill him directly, a useful solution so as not to break the rhythm and try to complete the dungeons more quickly, especially in the part immediately preceding the end game. Game ending that comes after at least a good 55-60 hours, obviously reading everything and not skipping any dialogue.", "date": "2020-10-23", "grade": "8.7"}
