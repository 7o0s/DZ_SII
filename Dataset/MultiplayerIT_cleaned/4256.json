Just like in a real ~dogfight~ between a MIG and an F-18, their rivalry is characterized by the fact that any mistake can prove fatal, since the judge of the dispute is composed of a large audience of demanding experts for the which even the most imperceptible imperfection has an enormous weight in purchasing decisions. Both products, release after release, have always been particularly skilled in responding to the adversary, absorbing all the technical innovations that the other, in the meantime, had made it a standard for the genre. Absent from the shelves with an official publication since 2017, X-Plane now has to deal with the new Microsoft Flight Simulator, a software that in 2020 was able to impose a profound systemic revolution with brazen arrogance that only the boundless technical capabilities of the Redmond company have made possible. Faced with a planet reproduced on a 1:1 scale thanks to data from the Azure cloud, does the new version of Laminar Research's historic simulator have any chance of emerging? Let's find out, in our review of X-Plane 12. Historical regression X-Plane 12's airfields are replicated with unexpected care For heaven's sake, we have no intention of transforming this analysis into a comparison with the latest Flight Simulator, but it is under the light of day that the arrival of the new Microsoft video game in 2020 has led to a radical paradigm shift from which it is very difficult come back. X-Plane 12 has to deal with the new standards imposed by the competitor, which at the moment, also thanks to the diffusion through Game Pass, is the real reference point of the market. The red pill, for the ~simmers~, was being faced in Flight Simulator with the entire planet Earth accurately reproduced thanks to photogrammetry, building by building, an achievement made possible only by the integration of Bing maps and downloaded cloud data dynamically from the Internet while flying. Before going into more technical questions, it is necessary to underline immediately that the degree of fidelity of the world of X-Plane 12 is light years away from that proposed by the competitor, to the point that in the most important cities all the most evocative places of interest. Flying over Rome is equivalent to not seeing the shadow of the Colosseum, the dome of St. Peter's or Castel Sant'Angelo, but even in much larger metropolises, the real buildings can be counted on the fingers of one hand. New York, for example, has just three, the Empire State Building, the 9/11 Memorial and the Statue of Liberty. The polygonal elements of all the other buildings are randomly generated, and while this also happened in Microsoft's simulator for areas without photogrammetry, there each building was erected based on an AI's interpretation of the Bing maps, and the discrepancies were very few. In X-Plane 12, Laminar Research must have relied on software such as OpenStreetMap since the streets are actually faithful to the originals, but the system must have had huge gaps, since entire neighborhoods, such as the whole Vatican, are covered from laughing forests. Some veteran pilots might consider the realism of the setting as a mere tinsel, especially if the simulator is used for training purposes, but this also directly affects the gameplay: the cities and landscapes are so unrecognizable that the VFR flight, that defined as ~at sight~ and which uses geographical references for navigation, it is simply impossible. This abysmal distance from the standards of Microsoft Flight Simulator is naturally due to the absence of cloud data and we are aware that to achieve the same degree of quality, without streaming, the game would have come to occupy several hard drives. However, the studio had all the tools at its disposal to mitigate this gap, since OSM itself offers solutions capable of replicating the correct arrangement of structures and buildings. Paradoxically, something like this must have happened to over 17,000 airports scattered around the world, which have been reproduced within the game with reasonable fidelity. Even those in the suburbs, far from the big cities, have a very accurate arrangement of runways and hangars. Differences of approach and philosophy The simplicity of X-Plane 12's menus underlines how the game doesn't want to pay attention to frills Indeed, we have the sfeeling that at the basis of this apparent superficiality, however, there are profound ideological reasons. In fact, the X-Plane series has always been aimed at a very narrow niche of experts and can also be used professionally, as a training tool certified by the American FAA. From this point of view, it is not surprising that during the very first minutes grappling with the Laminar simulator the first thing one notices is how rough and bare the game menus are, after all any useless frills are superfluous when you have thousands of of flight hours. X-Plane 12, in the interface that welcomes the player after starting, does not care in any way to decorate the user experience and spreads the few contents included in this version on the front page, i.e. a free flight mode flanked by a rudimentary tutorial. In the first, you can choose in a few simple clicks the departure airport, the weather and the time of day (which can be dynamic), then just select one of the 23 aircraft in the game and you are immediately ready to take flight. The list of usable vehicles, since launch, includes three airliners and several simpler airplanes, as well as the beauty of three helicopters, a glider and two fighter jets. Flight Simulator has enriched itself with this type of alternative aircraft only years after its release, and X-Plane takes a small revenge here against the opponent. The tutorial, on the other hand, includes just 8 missions that offer aspiring pilots a very quick smattering on the rudiments of flying, while ignoring more complex aspects such as the instrumentation linked to the autopilot or the air traffic contact procedures. Flying X-Plane 12 is a marginally better experience than others When you are finally at a few thousand feet of altitude, you can better understand what the true soul of X-Plane 12 is, a hostile and brutal product, whose only priority is to simulate as accurately as possible every microscopic effect that even the slightest turbulence may apply to aircraft components. After a few hours spent floating in the clouds, it becomes apparent that Laminar Research's simulator is marginally better, in terms of pure simulation, than Microsoft's. Turbulence applies more decisive effects on the stick, it is generally more difficult to maintain a certain direction without intervening with corrections each time, and the extreme weather will really put you to the test during a flight. These differences are the result of a different approach that Laminar Research adopts in replicating aircraft physics. The study is known for using a technology that divides each aircraft into many small components, each independently influenced by the various forces that are applied during the flight. This gives a slightly more convincing feeling while behind the control stick, even if part of the community speaks of artificial difficulty. To fully understand the differences between the two products it would probably take hundreds of flight hours, but what is certain is that X-Plane 12 is a demanding and punishing simulator, which can only be tamed by the most experienced pilots. Don't be intimidated, just like in Flight Simulator, here too it is always possible to enjoy a flight in complete tranquility by steering the plane with an Xbox controller. What's new in the new edition Volumetric clouds in 3D are perhaps the most relevant novelty of X-Plane 12 The flight model does not offer particular novelties since it draws its origins from the legacy sculpted by previous editions, but there are however several other improvements that bring X-Plane 12 closer to the standards reached by other simulators in circulation in recent years. The first is linked to the introduction of volumetric clouds in 3D, not always characterized by a perfect structure, but essential for identifying yourself adequately during a session. Another important novelty is represented by the presence of the seasons, which characterize the game environment so that it is appropriate to the time of year. Then there's a new photometric lighting system, a new air traffic management (which can be accessed in-flight from a comfortable interface) and 3D water and forests, nothing too shocking when viewed from a distance. close. Edition number 12, therefore, does not include noteworthy revolutions, but brings with it the right technological innovations useful for modernizing the simulator compared to previous versions. We have already said that much more could (and perhaps should have) been done in the technical field in terms of panorama fidelity, but aware of the target X-Plane is approaching12, we are convinced that the fans of the first hour will welcome all these new features. A technical sector that disappoints X-Plane 12 is certainly not the best-looking flight simulator ever made We played X-Plane 12 on a high-end PC, in 4K and with maximum details, but despite all precautions we must admit that we expected something more from Laminar Research, in the graphics sector of its simulator. The frames per second struggle to reach 60 even by lowering the settings, a symptom of how this version is still poorly optimized after several weeks of beta and, although we were ready to accept some compromises on FPS (simulators are always bricks, we know) , what has disappointed us is the general graphic impact offered by the experience. The models of the aircraft are excellent and even inside the cockpit everything is close to perfection, however the surroundings of the plane seem two generations old and it is really difficult to appreciate the view while flying. X-Plane 12 and photorealism are on two parallel tracks, so we don't feel like penalizing the developers' work too much if they have given priority to the realism of the physics of the airplanes, yet the defects are numerous and also concern some of the innovations proposed by this edition, such as the system of lighting that produces poor reflections on aircraft models. True, the more experienced will be able to resort to a bevy of third-party content that has the potential to transform the game developed by Laminar, but in a vanilla version the simulator will be able to leave you completely tepid and it is a pity, given the purely technical nature of these products.", "date": "2022-12-23", "grade": "7.5"}
