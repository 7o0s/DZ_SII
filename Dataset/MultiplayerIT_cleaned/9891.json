After the records shattered by the media success Modern Warfare 2 - and in conjunction with the growth of Apple portable devices also as mere gaming platforms - the brand made its debut on the iPhone and iPod Touch with some small changes, as also found in the review of the original chapter published by Multiplayer.it always on these pages. Now it's the turn of the second chapter of this porting: it's Call of Duty World at War: Zombies II, a direct sequel to the original also as a basic concept, taken directly from a sort of mini-game included in the Call of Duty World at War War aimed at next generation platforms. What had distinguished the side of the first Zombies from the other Call of Duty released up to that moment had been precisely the basic idea, developed in a different perspective from the classic single-player ~advance and pass the level~ shown by all previous chapters. Slaughter, reload and take cover Even Call of Duty World at War: Zombies II does not deviate from the above idea, thus proposing a natural continuum towards this type of gameplay: in fact, the game phases are divided into small closed-circuit maps, within the which the protagonist must necessarily barricade himself from the slow but fearsome hordes of zombies coming from the open alleys, through a desperate resistance. The fulcrum of the action consists in arming yourself within the delimited area, trying to close the windows and doors from which the zombies come and massacre them until the score necessary to pass the level is reached. To a graphic sector stationed on more than discrete levels, slightly more performing than the original even if still quite clearly below the standards imposed by Gameloft especially with the splendid NOVA. (still a true point of reference for iPhone / iPod Touch), Call of Duty World at War: Zombies II supports a control system anchored to limitations that had already produced some criticisms in the past. The management of the protagonist, obviously based on completely touch controls thanks to the classic virtual keys positioned on the sides of the screen, maintains a certain rigidity especially in the management of the camera. In essence, it is a question of calibrating the lateral movements of the view with small oscillations of 90 degrees, which can only be adjusted horizontally with a light touch of the finger. On the one hand, all this is attributable to the connotation in which you are playing, against slow and cumbersome zombies Master Chief would have had far too few problems. What is certain is that with the current possibilities of the device, maintaining this type of approach only in order to preserve and once again cultivate the servival-horror aspect does not seem exactly the best expedient, although then, on balance, the game dynamics are at least effective and still fun. In addition to the campaign, as mentioned built in the same way as the one present in the debut chapter, Call of Duty World at War: Zombies II also features a cooperative online multiplayer sector, which can be tackled by means of a Wi-Fi connection up to four players and up to two players with regards to the bluetooth connection. Finally, an interesting opportunity is offered to those who have already purchased the first episode of the series, who will be able to switch to Call of Duty World at War: Zombies II with a simple update at a discounted purchase price compared to the 5.99 euros at which the title is normally sold to the public on the App Store.
