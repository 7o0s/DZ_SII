{"name": "Haegemonia - Day Two", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/haegemonia-day-two.html", "text": "HISTORY OF A WORLD IN ROLLS What would a world without conflict be like? A great world, but not in an RTS perhaps. From this point of view, there is no shortage of foundations, given that the interplanetary tension is palpable. As we got to see in the preview, Mother Earth and the Mars colony are at loggerheads, spitting in one's eye, sneering at each other, showing stadium banners to each other. The assassin of an ambassador from the red planet is the straw that breaks the camel and the conflict begins. But as we will see from the opening video, it is a mysterious third force that seems to have committed the heinous crime, perhaps to somehow pilot the events of the human race. To study it? To play it like cat and mouse? We are not given to know, unless we delve into the depths of the cosmos of Haegemonia. Historically speaking, the events are placed in the year 2104, so we have to imagine a technology far superior to the modern one, also seen and considered the curve of the evolution of humanity's progress. Huge flying bases furrow the silent open spaces of the sea of stars (Captain Harlock docet) surrounded by flocks of support spaceships fully armed to eliminate any threat. Meanwhile slow colonies of millions roam the cosmos looking for a new world to live in. This is the scenario in which we will immerse ourselves playing Haegemonia, a place of reverent silence broken by the roar and flashes of explosions, a hotbed of passionate events that have man as protagonist and his greatest challenge: to go where no one has never come before (Picard, grant me) MOM I WANT A LASER BEAM Come on kids, Christmas is near and if you go to your nearest toy store you can get a wonderful laser gift with which to incinerate your neighborhood! Seriously, eyes sparkle and tears flow in front of the sublime rendering of the Haegemonia graphics engine. The lights in the cosmos stand out as the trails of the reactors leave their mark. The explosions follow one another at a rapid pace during the clashes, and I can't help but bend over in amazement towards the screen to admire the abundance of details of each single outbreak on the hulls of the mother ships, while the climax of the bang approaches inexorably. A truly masterful work, capable of giving you no small satisfaction. Just think that I run it quietly in 1600x1200 at 24 bit color (fixed at this depth) at full capacity, and I haven't encountered any uncertainties of any kind. During the most agitated phases of the game you will see gatherings of various types and above all of different sizes at work. The images speak for themselves however, the work from this point of view is excellent. Ok, one could say that there aren't exactly realistic proportions between ships and planets, but I assure you that in the overall joy these little things are not noticed at all. Great care has been taken in the creation of the spaceship models, which are credible, obviously science-fiction speaking, and endowed with different reactions according to the situations. I would like to mention the interface, worthy of making the game as dynamic as possible, thanks to the precise positioning of all the most useful functions. Very convenient is the possibility of immediately reaching a squadron by recalling it from the disappearing menu at the bottom left, as well as to reach a planet in one leap (and even jump between different systems of planets) we will have to pass the trusty mouse pointer at the top left . We will also be able to issue precise commands to the shuttles with a right-click popup menu, while at the same time with keyboard shortcuts we can go in a flash to see the research and development screens, or the status of the population of a celestial body of our choice . SOUNDS FOR THE COSMOS The air fills with pompous magnificence, and here we are lifted into the void all around us. If we try to close our eyes we can imagine distant worlds and our body breaks down, traveling through the boundless galaxies in search of the end of the universe. Aside from making a note in my notebook to smoke less oregano early in the morning, I can't help but praise Haegemonia's fantastic soundtrack. You will too when you deal with the spatial symphonies, the sounds of the void and the immense that will surround you. Just to tell you a gem, the songs are readable files with the very popular Winamp, and it will take a moment to compose your stellar soundtrack! Immersion at the right point and relaxed concentration. This is what it feels like in moments of approach toplay and the idea of a world totally in your hands will form in your mind. Immediately afterwards, the tension of the battle that gives no respite is around the corner (to find one in the cosmos) and the pace becomes frenetic and urgent, while preparations are in full swing for the final assault on the mothership, and a tangle of laser shots swarm at point blank range among the swarms of spacecraft. On the sound effects front, we were served just as well imagine what sound one of the explosions you see in the images could produce. It's that. Hearing the destruction of a huge craft is an oozing of real suffering for the crew inside. While a nova is released from the remains of the battleship, the gaze remains magnetized, because even the ear is strained to listen. I will never get tired of saying how important the auditory part of a gaming experience is FOR TODAY WE ARE QUIET AT THE BASE Perfect. We discussed everything that Haegemonia has to offer, both in terms of story and technical aspects. Tomorrow I will try to convey my feelings about the gameplay, if really Haegemonia is a flawless masterpiece and seriously deserves a space in your personal collection. See you tomorrow! WHERE SATELLITES DARE My dears, the game we are going to examine rightfully enters the circle of luxury outsiders, those games that in the jargon of gamers are defined as ~not very pumped up~. Behind this apparently ironic definition there is a well-known reality these days, namely the hype syndrome that often afflicts many titles of a certain fame. You wait, tremble in front of a new image, you make flights of fancy dreaming of the revolution, something that erases the mistakes of the past and marks the turning point in your playful past, only to be disappointed in most cases. You know, man is fickle in all fields... and we must also understand those who invest money for a pharaonic project. But I won't deny that the best pleasures can be given by titles that remain in the half-light, and then come out into the sunlight to let all their magnificence shine. And if these pearls are the daughters of smaller budgets and the result of the titanic efforts of a few, then we understand how vital it is to recover genuine quality in a game. And here we are.", "date": "2002-11-19", "grade": null}
