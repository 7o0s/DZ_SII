{"name": "Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neptunia-x-senran-kagura-ninja-wars-recensione.html", "text": "Today we often use the term ~fanservice~ because this custom of stuffing video games, films, anime and anything else with references to other products or media that please fans above all has spread like wildfire. Its origins, however, date back to the Rising Sun, and to a wider meaning, so to speak, which also embraced eroticism and the desire to please users in another sense as well. This explains the prosperous forms of the protagonists of series such as Senran Kagura and Hyperdimension Neptunia, who have carved out a hard core in our country as well: the first thanks to a couple of very well packaged action games for Nintendo 3DS, the second with some JRPGs particularly successful parodies. Putting together the buxom ninjas and personified consoles in a single action game might have seemed senseless, but Tamsoft and Compile Heart tried anyway and this review of Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars will explain why they failed. Dialogues upon dialogues Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars, we've seen more risqu fanservice The idea of winking at the fanbase with a hybrid title that was partly visual novel and partly action could also make sense, if only we hadn't gone too far in the first direction. We have nothing against visual novels and it's not written anywhere that these heroines have to fight each other continuously, but half an hour of dialogue before really starting to play isn't exactly sustainable. That the plot was not Shakespearean was to be expected: beyond this unlikely meeting of franchises, we have a shuriken-shaped island called Gamninjustri (sic!) under siege by the Steeme Legion, just as the two factions that they protect her are engaged in war. On the one hand we have the four heroines of the Neptunia series and on the other there are the most famous kunoichi of the Senran Kagura series: faced with the threat, they will necessarily have to fight together. Keep in mind that Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars is a spin-off and you don't need to know the original franchises to understand the story. The characters are all reproposed as if it were an alternative reality in which they play different roles, while maintaining the same personalities, and already at this point there are several inconsistencies that suggest a superficial processing: Neptune, Vert, Blanc and Noire have been completely redesigned for the occasion, while Asuka, Homura, Yumi and Miyabi are almost identical to their classic counterparts. In fact, it is the whole game that is tilted in the direction of Neptunia, so much so that at a certain point one realizes that if instead of Senran Kagura's kunoichi they had put four completely different characters, nothing would have changed either for the purposes of the narrative, nor in terms of gameplay. Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars, Neptune transforms into Purple Heart It's really a shame, perhaps due to the fact that the creators of Senran Kagura have practically abandoned the series due to ever-tightening censorships. In the end, Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars doesn't have even a shred of that soft eroticism that made Senran Kagura fans laugh so much, and is based only on verbose dialogues that fortunately elicit more than a few smiles, continuing on the lucky road of parody undertaken by Tamsoft with the Neptunia series. Considering that the game is completed in less than ten hours and that most of the time is spent reading the ravings of these waifus, let's say that the narrative part is perhaps the most successful, which is a problem when talking about an action game. Corridors upon corridors Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars, the narrative part is practically a visual novel The combat system is in fact the one that convinced us the least, especially if we consider one of the series that gives the game its name. The problem is that once you get past the massive amount of dialogue - you might as well skip it, but what's the point? - and set foot on the battlefield, one realizes the paucity of gameplay compared to the Senran Kagura played almost ten years ago on Nintendo 3DS. The player can form a team of two heroines and swap them on the fly, even in the middle of a combo, by pressing a button. Normal attacks, jump, guard and shuriken are associated with the front keys, while the combinations of backbones and d-pad allow you to dodge and consume healing items. Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars, the balancing minigame The first disappointment comes when one realizes that the combat system is extremely basic and does not grant the same freedom and spectacularity as the old Senran Kagura, which were not alreadyBayonetta or Devil May Cry, but at least they had dignity. Here, however, the articulated combos are missing, and the characters all look a bit alike, as well as being very few: only eight, from the series involved in the Tamsoft crossover, to which are added a couple created for the occasion. However, none stands out in a particular way, and it's not that much is needed since the enemies are anything but aggressive: at the default difficulty level, Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars practically plays itself and the challenge remains contained even in the final missions. The maps are made up of corridors interspersed with clearings where hordes of enemies or large bosses manifest themselves who telegraph their attacks with as much time as it takes to dodge them. Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars, the Spirit Gems allow you to improve the fighters The action is extremely bland and repetitive, whether you play through the main campaign or return to the stages to complete side tasks. A series of accessory functions articulates the combat system a little more with conflicting results. Learned Ninja Arts are equipped four at a time and are recalled by pressing a button: at that point the action slows down just enough to choose the Art to use and to break the rhythm of the fight, which was already not particularly engaging by itself . Then we have the Fuurinkazan Drive, which enhances our heroine on duty for a certain amount of time, and the Shinobi Extreme, an extremely spectacular super attack that works like a smart bomb and destroys all enemies within its range. Unfortunately none of these features can save the combat system from its banality. Where is the fanservice? Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars, the enemies are often very funny The paradox lies in the fact that in Senran Kagura they also played for the fanservice and the hilarious fights in which the protagonist girls progressively lost their clothes, while here there is nothing of the kind. Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars is a game that is too chaste, and it is not clear what type of target it aims at. Not even the minigames and the bland RPG elements - in particular, the assignment of Spirit Gems that improve combat performance - improve this part of the experience, but it must be said that if we narrow the field to a less savvy audience, who seeks a simple and colorful pastime, the Tamsoft title is not completely to be thrown away. The control system is intuitive and responds well to inputs, also because we have not encountered major slowdowns or uncertainties: on the technical front, a good job has been done, and even if a little definition has been lost compared to the PlayStation 4 and PC counterpart on the market for a few months already, graphically we are faced with a successful product also in terms of portability.", "date": "2022-04-22", "grade": "5.7"}
