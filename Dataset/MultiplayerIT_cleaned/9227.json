Be it a kitten, a dog or maybe a canary (with a pindaric flight of fancy, typically childish even a unicorn to tell the truth), having a tender pet as a playmate or at least a homemate is a great joy for them. But often this desire collides with the needs of families or with the rules of civil life and therefore of condominiums and neighborhoods, making sure that everything remains just a dream. Luckily, there are video games to partially remedy the problem, in this case paired with Kinect, the new, revolutionary peripheral from Microsoft. It is obviously not the same thing as having a real animal to cuddle and hug, to take care of and love, but if you think about it, how many can boast of having a baby dragon or a unicorn at home? Fantastic Friends belongs precisely to that category of games that offers children and parents an alternative to having a real pet. The THQ title is clearly inspired by two other famous products in the sector, namely EyePet, available for PlayStation 3, and Kinectimals, an Xbox 360 exclusive. From the first game it takes the idea of the so-called ~augmented reality~, from the other the sections played with first person view. Augmented reality is a technique that allows players to see themselves in real time on the TV screen, inside the room where they really are at that precise moment, or in fake scenarios, with the puppy they created themselves. Basically, the room where the user is is scanned by Kinect which recognizes everything therein, from furniture to people, and then integrates them into the game world. In this way the virtual puppy will be as if it were at the gamer's house since it will wander around the room hiding behind its furniture or objects in the location. Animals for all tastes The puppy responds to the user's gestural or vocal commands, as if he were really interacting with him inside the house. But let's see how it all works. After introducing the DVD and witnessing the opening credits of Fantastic Friends, the player, positioned in front of the television, must make gestures towards the Kinect in order to be recognized by the game and virtually introduced to a shop/laboratory full of animals. According to the ~plot~ of the product (yes, there is a small introduction story) the user is the nephew of a man named Doctor Serraglio, who, having to leave on an urgent expedition, needs to leave it to a trusted relative a pet to take care of. Moving his hands in front of the Kinect, therefore, which on video are represented by the image of two small fluorescent spheres, the player moves inside the shop/laboratory and chooses the puppy to collect. There are four types of animals to select, namely dog, cat, horse and lizard. But all of them can be modified at will in terms of look and characteristics, perhaps combining them with each other, and turn into imaginary creatures, from unicorns to dragons. Once you create your own imaginary companions, you enter a world where you can play with them through a variety of mini-games ranging from everyday cuddles, grooming, feeding, acting and many more. The interface is simple and easy to use, with the player figure placed in the center of the screen while through the simple movements of the arms and hands it is possible to reach the game box with the recreational activities, the telephone, the Talent Show, the camera and all. Puppies to love There is even the possibility of playing as a couple with a relative or friend in the various games and in augmented reality. Some games require a certain physical movement from the user (throwing a virtual ball, jumping and running with the puppy, making him go through obstacle courses), others that only require you to interact with the animal (strokes, bath, baby food) with a first person view. However, the mode called Talent Show is certainly the most interesting of all: it is only available once a day, and inside it a random selection of the activities available in the other modes is proposed, plus a final exhibition where you have to run and jump the critter created as far away as possible. At the end of all this, a final score is attributed which wins gems. These can then in turn be spent by the gamer to unlock other mini-games, gadgets and new features for the animals. All thanks to the usual doctor Serraglio. From an aesthetic point of view Fantastic Friends ppresents very colorful graphics for environments and animals. Particular attention was paid by the development team to the puppies, and it could not be otherwise: the animals are well represented even in their most imaginative forms. The title also features a nice dubbing in Italian with several ad hoc sampled phrases that are used by the game to help, direct, accompany the gamer at practically every step. Even ~uncle~ Serraglio intervenes in certain ways to give suggestions and advise users on how to behave with the puppy or in that particular phase of the game. All seasoned with catchy background music and the typical sounds emitted by the animals. In summary, this game, obviously suitable for children, is a nice alternative to products of the caliber of the aforementioned Kinectimals or EyePet.", "date": "2011-06-20", "grade": null}
