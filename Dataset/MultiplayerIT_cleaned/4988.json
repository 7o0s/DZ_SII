The guys at Dire Wolf Digital have also announced the arrival of the iPad version from March 23rd, for Android Tablet in April and for Mac OS in May; at the moment, the game is only available for PC complete with a client that must be downloaded and installed and from which you can also start other Bethesda titles. That's not all, the latest news arrived in conjunction with the release of the game and concerns the first big update for the Legends campaign which is scheduled for April 5th and will be called The Fall of the Dark Brotherhood: it will include a new story that will add 40 new cards and offer new PvE content with over 20 missions. In addition, for those who purchase the expansion there will be a free mount Doom Wolf (Wolf of Destiny) for The Elder Scrolls Online. As you can see, although the world is the one we have known for years now and which we will return to talk about when The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim makes its appearance on the new Nintendo console, The Elder Scrolls: Legends is inextricably linked with The Elder Scrolls Online. We are in a particularly flourishing period for collectible card games therefore, in addition to having to deal with the usual Hearthstone, now used as a term of comparison a bit like World of Warcraft with MMOs, the Bethesda title will have to make its way through a long list of opponents, however we believe that he may have good hopes given the imprint that, with a wink to eSport, the development team intends to give him with the inclusion in the imminent future of the spectator mode, of the integration with Twitch and, above all, a new Challenge mode. Let's spend a few words on the latter mode: it has been explained that these are limited-time tournaments in which you assemble a deck with cards from your collection and challenge opponents to reach the top of the dedicated ranking. In a sense, these tournaments are what Hearthstone players have been clamoring for years without ever being heard even if, to be honest, the Blizzard game is supported by many tournaments organized by external associations and the Irvine house does not has never hidden the fact that he prefers creating Fireside Gathering events to in-game tournaments. Bethesda also officially debuts in trading card games with The Elder Scrolls: Legends Let's refresh your memory For those unfamiliar with the mechanics of The Elder Scrolls: Legends, we can say that the structure is typical of collectible card games, with creatures that belong to different types (animals, orcs, elves, and so on) that have a launch cost , strength, constitution and various abilities: Breakthrough, Drain and Deathtouch, which correspond to Trample, Lifelink and Deathtouch of Magic The Gathering, while Charge Last Breath and Guard are instead analogous to Charge, Deathrattle and Taunt of Hearthstone. Then there are the actions that are the equivalent of spells, the objects that are equipped by creatures providing various benefits and the supports that are a type of card that remains on the field and constantly maintains its effect or is activated when an action occurs. game. The Elder Scrolls: Legends does not have a subdivision into classes and the trick used to divide the cards into categories of belonging depend on their attributes: Strength, Willpower, Agility, Endurance and Intelligence, however, a pair of attributes combined together identify a character, so the Monk has Will and Agility, the Battle Mage has Intelligence and Strength, etc. Obviously there are some cards that don't belong to any of these attributes and, therefore, are considered neutral and usable in any deck. The decks, with 50 basic cards and 30 in Arena mode, can be built freely but drawing as much as possible from those coming from two different attributes without limitations for neutral cards. There are also multi-attribute cards that can only be used in decks that have the required attributes. There are distinctive mechanics of The Elder Scrolls: Legends that make it unique and profoundly different from the others: that of the prophecy and, above all, that relating to the playing field divided into two zones. To explain the first of these two fundamental mechanics, let's start by telling you that our character starts the game with 30 life points and 5 runes around him that break every time he drops to 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 points respectively life and that to each of these runesdestroyed automatically corresponds to the draw of a card; if the one we draw has the Prophecy ability, it can be put into the field or used without paying the casting cost. If this is an aspect that certainly has to do with the ~C~ factor due to the obvious randomness of a lucky draw, it is also true that we regulate when the opponent will draw and therefore we could, for example, decide to stop our attack strategically so as not to break a rune or, when we are faced with the last rune (the one that breaks at 5 life points) of the opponent, we will try to do a number of damages such as not to activate it by defeating the opponent directly. Two distinct areas The second and even more particular mechanic of The Elder Scrolls: Legends is represented by the game area. When a creature is summoned we can choose to place it on the left or right side of the playing area: in the first case, it will fight immediately (not on the turn it enters) while in the second case it will receive the cover ability and it will not be possible to attack it but only interact with it through actions, except having Protection which makes the cover ineffective. Compared to what we saw the last time we took hold of the title, the elixir that allowed whoever started second to use an extra mana three times (which seemed too strong to us) has been graphically replaced by a ring, but in fact this apparent advantage remained. It must be said that, during the months of the beta, there were many revisions to cards that were too strong or were being used more than others and these modifications were mainly done by listening to the community, considered a primary resource by the Dire Wolf Digital team. The economic model has not undergone changes except for some relating to special offers, so the game is always free and it is possible to buy sachets both with the gold you earn in the game, by completing daily missions and objectives (there are so many), and with real money; the cost of a single envelope is 100 coins, while two envelopes (it is not possible to buy only one for real money) is 2.99 euros and, by buying a greater number of envelopes, the cost is proportionally reduced as well as being added to the offer one or more random legendary cards. Just to give an example, the best offer in terms of costs is 69.99 euros for 60 envelopes (about 1.16 per envelope) receiving 3 legendary cards as a gift, 2 of which are premium (corresponding to Hearthstone gold). That's not all: still talking about real money, Bethesda offers special offers such as the ~Introductory Package~ which allows you to take home, for 4.99 euros, as many as 10 envelopes, a title for your avatar, some alternative artwork for cards and a legendary card. To finish the discussion of costs, that of entrance tickets to the Arenas, which we will tell you about shortly, is 150 gold or 1.99 euros for a single entrance and 9.99 euros for 6 entrances. Always a little more, arena gives you The arena of The Elder Scrolls: Legends works in a similar way to that of Hearthstone, so we will choose a character (combination of two attributes) among the three available and then we will have 30 choices to make to compose our deck. However, there are also differences: there is the usual possibility of playing competitive arenas against other players in which the greater the number of victories obtained the greater the final prize, or there is a solitary arena in which you face the artificial intelligence in fights of ever increasing difficulty and, in both, you cannot lose more than three times, otherwise you will be eliminated. Furthermore, during some periods, you can face the Chaos arena in which your opponents are real players but the left lane, instead of being the one in which there are no particular changes, undergoes various transformations: for example, with ~Tower of Ballistae~ becomes a zone in which whoever controls the most creatures deals 2 damage to the opponent at the start of their turn, with ~Library~ if you control a creature in that zone, actions cost one mana less, and so on. This particular arena is oriented towards fun and randomness even if, in general, the gameplay of The Elder Scrolls: Legends is very strategic with a very limited random component especially when compared to that present in Blizzard's great opponent. The artwork of the cards are well done and bring characters, races, animals and many elements from the world of The Elder Scrolls to the game table, moreover, the rarity of the cards is very easy to understand thanks to the colored rhombus, white for the commons, blue for rares, purple for epics, yellow for legendaryand with a gem for unique legendaries. The game is completely dubbed in Italian with a truly remarkable quality and, in particular, a praise goes to the voice actor of the narrator who comments on the situations in the arena and who will make you laugh more than once; the music is never too repetitive, with epic and evocative themes. We'll see in the coming months if all the news announced and the new adventure will be enough to undermine the throne of Hearthstone.", "date": "2017-03-21", "grade": "8.0"}
