It's not the first time that the characters from the Bandai Namco fighting game have made their appearance on mobile devices, even if Street Fighter X Tekken didn't drive us crazy. Probably the fault of the Capcom developers' claim to transport the iconic control system of their title to the touch screen, thus giving life to mechanisms that are too complicated and often subject to frustrating inaccuracies; but also to skimpy numbers, which saw a roster made up of just eight characters, placed within a relatively poor structure. Mistakes that have not been made this time, given that Tekken Mobile not only boasts over twenty unlockable fighters and various modes, but also and above all a gestural fighting game-style approach, with very immediate controls that shift the focus from execution form to timing, along the lines of the most recent exponents of the genre. After the introductory sequence, the game tutorial teaches us that a press on the right side of the screen is enough to start the default combo, while an invisible virtual stick on the left side allows you to move the character back and forth, as well as activate the parry (press and hold). In the lower right part of the display there are instead the battle cards, an element that follows the tradition of many freemium titles and allows you to have a set of special moves that alternate randomly, based on a deck that we can assign to each of our warriors. Thickness or banality? There is no doubt that the ~gestural~ approach adopted by Bandai Namco for the mobile version of Tekken changes the cards on the table, making the fighting game lose its proverbial depth, also in combination with the fact that in this case the combat is strictly takes place within the two dimensions, without lateral deviations. However, the sensations that the experience conveys are typical of the series, which means that the authors have been very good at making substantial changes to the formula without losing sight of the original spirit, that distinctive trait that made the franchise successful since its debut in 1994. The full-bodied story mode of the game is composed of a sequence of fights in which we can take part after having composed a team of three characters, but with the possibility of also drawing on other fighters unlocked up to that moment, actually without too much effort despite the freemium setting: after a couple of hours of play we could already count on a team made up of Kazuya, Nina, Feng, Xiaoyu and Dragunov, with additional warriors obtainable (and upgradeable) thanks to the collection of specific ~fragments~. The formula is simple: you select the character you want to use and you collide with a single opponent and then proceed on the ~board~ up to the boss on duty, in the context of a progression that gradually becomes longer and more complex, and which unlocks higher difficulty levels. In case you are defeated, it is possible to use another fighter and restart the match with the enemy already tested by the previous fight, but in the same way we will not be able to recover health between one duel and another except by resorting to medical kits which, however, are give with great abundance. There are also no time restrictions or action energy indicators, meaning you can play as long as you like without having to wait for anything other than the time it takes to revive a defeated warrior. In addition to the story mode there are some special events, with a very high degree of challenge, and an online multiplayer mode which is based on the challenge at the dojo, and in which the team connotation takes on a different meaning: the warriors clash in the best of three round respecting the order of placement in the team. In short, everything seems to work great, and also from a technical point of view a great job has been done: the scenarios are well differentiated, full of details and with some interactable elements, and in the same way the characters boast very well made polygonal models, with excellent accompanying effects and a convincing set of animations. Also taken care of the audio sector, both in terms of effects and music.", "date": "2018-02-19", "grade": "8.5"}
