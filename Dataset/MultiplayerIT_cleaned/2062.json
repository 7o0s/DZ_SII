{"name": "Spider-man: the movie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spider-man-the-movie-2.html", "text": "Peter: Such a quiet guy. The plot of the game is only partially suited to that of the film of the same name. In fact, only a few relevant facts were taken into consideration by the programmers. Necessary choice in order to better adapt everything to the tastes of videogamers. The presentation immediately explains the cause of the genetic mutation of the protagonist, the student Peter Parker, who slowly realizes what has happened to him. The FMV footage (of mediocre quality) also shows us the death of Spidey's uncle due to a criminal. It is from this point that the adventures of our young hero begin, who feels the need for redemption for the loss of his loved one. In short, we will see the journey and the rise of Peter Parker, aka Spider man, from a new wrestler to a popular hero of society. And the best thing is the fact that it will be you who will guide him in all this, thanks to your placid hands. The game ~Spider man~ is an action game that directly takes up the structure of the old episodes that landed on the Psone some time ago but enriches them in terms of depth and game mechanics. In fact, now the freedom of action is almost total, thanks to the innumerable abilities of the protagonist. It is a pleasure to walk around comfortably between skyscrapers and urban traffic thanks to the resistance and elasticity of the spider web. Even climbing walls is satisfying and very useful at the same time now to take enemies by surprise, now to reach particular areas. Furthermore, without having to climb kilometers to get to the top of some building, it is possible to help oneself by being carried away by the ~draught~ of one's canvas which, launched from a distance, is then reached in the blink of an eye with a feline leap. The repertoire of moves and combos available has also increased compared to the old chapters. It is true that there are only two keys dedicated to combat, but the possibility of collecting new blasting combinations is also true thanks to special ~golden spiders~ scattered throughout the stages. So don't feel helpless towards the enemies in the first few shots as after a short time you will be able to launch deadly attacks from every direction... A little uncomfortable, but very useful, the subjective mode which is activated when you want to paralyze the enemies through the canvas, after pressing the dedicated key. The playability of the Activision product therefore stands at fairly high levels. Not only is the response to the commands given on the pad immediate but also the amount of fun offered to the gamer is massive. Walking, running, jumping, climbing, simulating Tarzan hanging from the vines, beating up the bad guys on duty and seeing some small ~comic-style~ touches of class is a pleasure. In practice, the game can be played very simply and fully convinces in terms of fun. The missions to be completed are divided into stages, each with a different scenario (in the slums of the city, inside buildings, among skyscrapers, etc.) and with ever-increasing difficulty. The thing that could make your nose turn up a little could be the save system that allows you to transfer progress to a memory card only after completing an entire level (and all of them are long enough). However, this should not discourage but rather be taken positively as it adds a few points in favor of the longevity of the title programmed by Treyarch. Also interesting is the fact of interacting with some elements of the setting such as bins, car tires, shelves that can be thrown at bullies looking for trouble. Although it would not have hurt to explore this possibility and apply it to other surrounding elements as well. Until next time. Green Goblin! You are mine! In the game you will have to face several end-of-level bosses. In this sense, villains of the moment have been added that do not exist in the cinematic counterpart. This is to enhance the enjoyment and challenge of the playful product, of course. You will therefore find yourself dealing with a lot of scum such as Scorpion, the Vulture, Shocker, etc. To then arrive at the final battle with the green goblin, or Doctor Oscorp. All the clashes with the aforementioned monsters are quite spectacular both for the background scenario and for the complexity and commitment required of the user. Many of them, in fact, manage to dodge combos very well, forcing the geek on duty to find the appropriate strategy to make them perish, with consequent inner satisfactionAnd. Spider man: the movie can be played in three difficulty levels (easy, normal and hard). If in the first you manage to complete the game in about six hours, already in the second you will find many obstacles to solve it in less than eleven hours. Depending on the skill of the player who finishes all the levels, the points necessary to activate some bonuses scattered on the DVD are assigned. First of all it is possible to repeat the virtual experience but this time in the role of the evil Green Goblin (actually a little frustrating and quite difficult), then there is a sub-game that awaits you, or rather a sort of Bowling where Spider-Man he makes the ball (!) which he has to knock down a bunch of tied men. Bah! Weird and limited in time. Other bonuses are some photos taken directly from the film, basically fan stuff. It must be admitted. This is the most beautiful episode in circulation on the adventures of Spider man above all because it manages to amuse both those who are ardent lovers of the hero straight out of the Stan Lee comic book and all the other gamers. The only flaw found in the game structure seems to be the monotony of some passages necessary for the continuation in the various stages (such as ~find the lever and open the passage~), but otherwise this title fully satisfies those who wanted a good game on Peter Parker both in terms of atmosphere and in terms of correspondence to the comic. Hey! But that's Spider-Man up there! Playing Spider man: the movie is quite a fulfilling pleasure. But what does Jotaro tell us about the technical sector? Here you are satisfied. What the product offers visually is undoubtedly of good quality. The polygonal models are well defined, very detailed and well animated. Another positive note is dedicated to the theater of the clashes, or rather to the settings. It's nice to admire the surfaces of the glass skyscrapers, with beautiful light refraction effects (a fake but well done bump mapping, to be clear). The edges of Spidey's suit also give the same effect. The structuring and characterization of the surrounding city is also beautiful, with the traffic going crazy, the pedestrians going about their business and all the rest (even if we are not at the levels of GTA3 at all). Some atmospheric agents are as remarkable as they are suggestive, such as that of the rain and the storm that unleashes its anger during the air battle with the Vulture. Everything seems perfect but that is hardly the case, in fact the notes and negatives come now. First of all, all polygonal surfaces suffer from some jaggies that annoy a lot. Then it must be pointed out that the graphics engine too often suffers from slowdowns that seem to be due to a problem related to the software (and not to the black box). Even the shot system sometimes leaves something to be desired and forces the gamer to sudden and opposite changes of direction. Another small note of demerit should be spent on uploads that are too long. We are in the year 2002 and we still have to wait all these seconds to play? But daaai. The audio sector stands at medium levels with background rocker music and with mediocre sound effects that modestly carry out their job without exaggerating. I would have preferred something more ~pumped up~ and adrenaline but, you know, can't you have everything from video games, or from life? I don't know! For the dubbing, the original actors of the film were used with a not too exciting result. In the end this episode dedicated to spider man manages to fully satisfy all the requests of fans around the world who will have bread for their teeth, while it turns out to be a good game and nothing more for everyone else. Well made, very playable and quite long-lived, this title convinces expectations and removes the stench of a commercial operation that usually hovers in this type of production inspired by large franchises. Although not a masterpiece and having some small flaws, ~Spider man: the movie~ is a lot of fun and represents a very enjoyable product. Spider-man fans! Take your villa! Pros: Well done. Very playable. It's Spider-Man! A must for fans. Cons: Boring in some passages. Anti-aliasing, where are you? Sometimes it slows down. Cinema box office record From 7 June ~Spider man: the movie~ has hit the box offices of all Italian cinemas, attracting the attention of young and old, aficionados and others, etc. But who could miss the latest film inspired by the legendary skilled photographer who goes around dressed in tights? Nobody. And in fact everyone at the cinema to see a really well made film, that is the film of thespider-man that anyone would want to see. After all this (even if spider-mania still rages on the streets) it seemed more than reasonable to expect a good game dedicated to our Marvel super-hero. Therefore, all the latest generation consoles have received their gaming counterpart of ~Spider man: the movie~. This is the turn of the Playstation 2. Grab the black joypad and remember you never forget the first canvas.", "date": "2002-07-05", "grade": null}
