{"name": "MySims Agents", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71003-mysims-agents-il-mio-nome-e-sims-mysims.html", "text": "Born as a more childish version of Will Wright's infamous Sims, the MySims brand, exclusive to Nintendo as regards consoles, has established itself over the years as one of the most representative of the Wii and DS lineups, so much so that We have now reached the fifth episode of the series. The merits have always been there, even if none of the predecessors managed to remain truly memorable for players who have seen it all; for the new episode EA decides to put aside for a moment the whole customization phase that has heavily characterized the brand so far and to create a much more traditional Action Adventure: a good move? Special Agent Wright MySims Agents starts as all those that preceded it started, ie with the creation of the avatar, always fast and immediate given the graphically very simple nature of the men in question and the consequent not very large number of possible options. The choices are not many at the beginning also because during the game it is possible to unlock a decidedly considerable number of clothes and accessories to give life to the perfect secret agent, but we will talk about this later. Immediately after the creation of the avatar we realize perfectly that we are dealing with a MySims different from the others: the city where you will live your deeds is already ready, there is no need to build anything and your character it has a very specific history and its own characteristics. In fact, we are dealing with a youngster (or youngster) aspiring investigator, with a lot of talent and little money, who is satisfied with solving small mysteries around the neighborhood waiting to take the plunge, together with his friend and ~personal artist~ Buddy: the small and informal investigative agency has its ~headquarters~ in Gino's pizzeria, permanent presence of all MySims. However, during the first case, which seems no different from the usual ones (proving that the Dogwood dog actually belongs to your friend Poppy), our hero/heroine gets to know Morcubus, a disturbing, powerful and mysterious character: the fact of being managed to stand up to him attracts the attention of none other than the Secret Service, which entrusts your avatar with the management of the city agency. From here on, a plot that mimics the classic ones of films, comics and espionage games starts, centered on the diabolical machinations of Morcubus and his Morcucorp. Who is he really? What are its goals? And above all, why does Gino's vanilla pizza seem to please your unwary fellow citizens so much? You and you, with me! Practically solving the cases that are placed in front of us means facing an Action Adventure with all the trappings, set in your beautiful town and surrounding areas, obviously not all available from the beginning. The camera is fixed and very well directed, and this together with the more precise controls compared to its predecessors makes exploration very pleasant, even in those platform phases where a certain skill is required. Basically, the activity of an agent consists of exploring the city in search of clues, questioning witnesses and carrying out analyzes, repairs and so on, the latter actions giving rise to four different mini-games all of which are very well thought out and fun. At the beginning you will be equipped with a magnifying glass to find suspicious prints, a crowbar to convince doors and boxes to cooperate and a wrench for the aforementioned repairs, but you will come into possession later on of other means as well as upgrades for the old ones. Everything is quite guided, in the sense that between notes, notebooks and suggestions it will be really difficult to get stuck, and this denounces the nature of the game certainly aimed at an unsvezzated public; however, it does not mean that the experience is not often and willingly fun: in the minigames, then, considerable peaks of complexity are reached, which in some cases will put even the most experienced among you to the test. Furthermore, your qualification as Head of the Agency also means that you have subordinates, to be recruited during the game, to be divided into teams and to be sent to solve cases not related to the main plot, not essential but very useful for unlocking various material. This whole phase gives a ~managerial~ touch to Agents, as each agent has certain characteristics and you will have to build and unpack teams in such a way as to have the best chance of success for each case. That's not all: managing an HQ means having to decorate and furnish it with the gadgets you'll find, hidden or as a reward after solving a case, during the game. This is the only concession Agents makes to the nature of its predecessorssori, but it also serves the gameplay as a well-managed HQ makes your agents much more efficient at work! Black humor? All this is articulated in a fair number of hours of play, with numerous missions that are always a little longer and more complicated than the previous one. The structure is slightly repetitive in the long run, but the desire to go to the end does not fade, thanks to a nice plot that mimics the series productions of the genre, to characters characterized in a superficial but very effective way and to a whole series of comic situations, jokes and sketches that are not always hilarious (always remember the target of this title), but in some cases very welcome, just mention the parody of agents Mulder and Scully of The X-Files that will thrill even the most seasoned gamer. Virtually absent any form of multiplayer, replayability therefore tends to zero as in any self-respecting adventure. The graphics engine that we are facing is the same that has characterized the series since its inception, with all its merits (fair number of polygons, colorful and vibrant textures, some notable special effects) and the usual defect of the framerate which begins to give in a bit when there are many elements on the screen, but in this case from the beginning since the game environment is already complete and you don't have to build it yourself from scratch. As for the sound aspect, nothing new under the sun: the Simlish that the characters speak can be as appreciable as it is unbearable, the effects do their duty and the music is in tune with the light and parodic atmosphere. The support for progressive scanning and the translation into Italian which in fluency exceeds the level of decency complete a ultimately good technical picture.", "date": "2009-10-08", "grade": "7.7"}
