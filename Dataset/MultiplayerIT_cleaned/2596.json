{"name": "Deep Fighter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deep-fighter_a.html", "text": "Little guys at the bottom of the sea Do you think that fish and crustaceans are the only inhabitants of the seabed? And if I told you that you were very wrong, how would you take it? You must know that the sea is teeming with many creatures, including small humanoid beings. At this point I bet that many of you have already guessed who we play in this video game. So we find ourselves in miniature and at the bottom of the sea. Power of video games. We lead our peaceful underwater life when a sudden threat of tectonic origin threatens our peaceful colony and the only hope for us and our fellow creatures remains to evacuate our native seabed in a hurry. The plot is more or less this, and time is marked by the construction of the mother ship, our only concrete hope of survival. Let's face it right away: Deep Fighter is an arcade with a classic cut, seasoned with very simple (albeit well-matched) missions and furious clashes with the ever-present enemy forces known as the Shadowkin; also noteworthy is the presence of organic forms that are not exactly friendly, such as jellyfish, crabs and other amenities. On the other hand, this product is multi-platform, and is available, in addition to the PC version, also for the most popular consoles on the market, and this is an indication that the product is ~easy~ and edible for everyone. Technical aspects and other demons There's little to say, it's a deja-vu of titles from a few years ago with discrete graphics and barely decent sound. Certainly the game looks good graphically, but the polygons on the screen are very few. Effects are also a bit disappointing, especially considering what the competition has to offer these days. In any case, the sensation of being inside a small submarine is there. The sound effects are only fair, and the music is reduced to the bone, while the interlude films are decidedly bad, made by unconvincing and crudely directed actors. The control of our vehicle is clearly affected by the needs of a console title that requires simple and immediate controls. The interface is also sparse, but functional. Our mini-sub is equipped with various accessories that allow it to carry out very useful and diverse operations, such as docking and towing objects or capturing biological forms. Going forward with the missions we will increase our rank and consequently our equipment, including the submarine, will undergo significant improvements. Conclusions As you may have already understood, Deep Fighter is a game that was already born old, and more suitable for a console audience (it's not a defect, it's just a question of target). So if you want to spend hours with an undemanding but nice video game you have your title. If, on the other hand, you are an inveterate and demanding gamer, you probably haven't been reading these lines for a while. Introduction This is a period of sequels and therefore those of not really famous titles could not be missing. Do you remember Sub Cultures? Well this Deep Fighter is the ideal sequel; but let's go in order and proceed to analyze the salient aspects.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
