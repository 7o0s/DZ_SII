Handsome and damned In Full HD it is a real feast for the eyes, certainly the Live Arcade game with the most satisfying graphic impact. Some enemies are very evocative and bring to mind Panzer Dragoon, as far as organic beings are concerned, but also Radiant Silvergun for some spaceships and bosses. The sound sector definitely takes a back seat: while not being annoying, the music of Omega Five does not enter the ear and is not remembered for particular melodies or inventions. The style is techno-digital which has been so much appreciated in similar productions such as Thunderforce, for example, but it does not inherit the musical power nor the uniqueness of the compositions. A particularly painful note: cooperative multiplayer via Xbox Live has not been included, a bizarre choice given that practically all Live Arcade games support this feature. Luckily the classic ~double~ is still present in the club, as was once done in the arcade by inserting two tokens. Xbox 360 - Goals The 200 points of Omega Five are decidedly difficult to complete in their entirety. After the first two or three relatively simple and unlocked almost immediately, there will be a bit of sweat, especially as regards the objectives that we will only get once the game is completed without ever using a ~continue~. Comment Omega Five is a breath of fresh air in the Live Arcade of old games and improved remakes; is a new horizontal scrolling shooter, which while beautifully representing a genre from a few years ago, turns out to be a tremendously new and captivating game in today's video game scene. Great graphics and a tough challenge to improve high scores are the main ingredients of this shooter created by the Japanese Natsume. Too bad, however, for the lack of online multiplayer. Pros A classic yet modern shooter A challenge that guarantees longevity Technical realization Cons Undifferentiated weapons Lack of online multiplayer mode Not very long-lived Omega Five is available for download on the Xbox 360 Marketplace. The shooter genre seemed to have faded with the advent of next-generation consoles; two-dimensional graphics, scrolling and shoot'em up were becoming words of a dead language, archaic terms almost forgotten and remembered only by some old-time gamer a little advanced in age. The genre, which flourished in the 90s, was able to renew itself much less than others and soon turned out to be ~old~ and unattractive in the eyes of the large mass public born at the end of that era. Nowadays, however, scrolling shooters have not definitively faded and disappeared forever, and while not experiencing a ~second youth~, they still find a large group of nostalgics and enthusiasts always ready to reward the software houses that invest in these projects . Microsoft's Live Arcade represents the ideal platform for the rebirth: arcade games, fun hit and run, low prices and new life thanks to online, achievements to unlock and cooperative modes. The Japanese Natsume, former developer of the popular Harvest Moon and Legend of the River King, has seen long and has produced and programmed a new horizontal scrolling game called Omega Five. Weapons and Final Bosses Omega Five has the gameplay of all the classics of its genre in its blood, it does not bring with it innovations or upheavals on the theme, and represents for all long-time players a pleasant and exciting title to play, with which everyone will surely find a certain familiarity both in the game system and in the concept. Apart from Aegis Wing, available on the US Marketplace, a horizontal scrolling shooter was certainly missing from the large list of downloadable games from Microsoft's online service (although Metal Slug 3 is currently being published). There is little to explain for those accustomed to shooters; You can initially choose two characters (two more are unlockable) and you start with frenetic action from the very first seconds. Omega Five mixes elements of Thunderforce, the cornerstone of horizontal scrolling, and Geometry Wars, from which it inherits the fire system using the analog button. You then shoot and aim with the same stick, so that the other keys are left free for other functions. The left trigger is the smart-bomb, with enormous power and to be used only in cases of extreme necessity, while the back buttons perform a sort of dodge, for the most agitated moments of battle. Weapons are extremely budgetaryates, not very different from each other in terms of destructive power, but enormously spectacular and well made, full of effects, transparencies, plays of light and refractions. Too bad for the lack of differentiation they have, it is mostly missiles, laser beams or similar. Classics like Thunderforce or some Treasure masterpieces taught how having so many well-differentiated weapons could be an important element of tactics and gameplay in this genre. The right trigger, however, activates a secondary weapon: for the female character, Ruby, it is used to launch a sort of jointed mechanical arm which has the dual function of attacking and absorbing enemy blows, while for the male character, it is used to avoid the attacks of ships and monsters. The end-of-level bosses are big and bad, made with a lot of imagination and to be faced in a technical and mnemonic way. Memorizing every move and every movement is essential in Omega Five. Handsome and damned Omega Five only lasts four games, but the price to pay to download it is proportionate to the quality of the title. Natsume's game is an old-fashioned shooter, the kind that make you sweat, curse and damn your soul just to be finished with a decent score. Omega Five is also a bad game: with each death the count resets to zero, making us lose everything. To set a record that satisfies us, it will therefore be necessary to use only one life, and to do it in the best possible way. This apparently cynical choice actually serves to give the game an otherwise impossible longevity. It is sure that you will spend hours and hours memorizing every enemy movement, every laser and every end-of-level boss in order to try not to die and achieve an ever higher score. But Omega Five is not only beautiful to play, but it is also a spectacle for our eyes now all too accustomed to the ~next-gen~. While maintaining a two-dimensional concept, it was made entirely in 3D. Each stage, all beautiful and well characterized, is created with infinite details, many elements on the screen, light effects, shadows, fire, snow, rain, transparencies and refractions.", "date": "2008-01-15", "grade": null}
