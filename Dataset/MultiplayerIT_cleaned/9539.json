Hordes of dangerous super-villains are in fact invading the streets with the aim of wreaking havoc, get rich and dominate every city. To oppose them there is a league made up of twelve powerful superheroes, coordinated by the courageous Captain Midnite, who in the face of the overwhelming numerical superiority of the forces of evil decide to recruit young recruits in order to train them and make them infallible avengers. Our alter ego in Hero Project is precisely a novice superhero, who goes to the headquarters of the Parliament of Heroes (which, needless to say, is not Montecitorio) to begin his training, acquire new powers and defend the planet from attack of the ~bad guys~. The new title developed by Glu for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which can be downloaded for free from the App Store, is presented as a sort of RPG with action elements, whose gameplay is based almost exclusively on the ~level up~ of the character that proceeds between (few) ~active~ missions and (many) ~passive~ missions. With great power comes great annoyance The control system adopted by the Hero Project developers is quite intuitive, in fact it is based on the simple touch of the area towards which we want our superhero to move. Similarly, just touch an interactive element present on the scenario (an electronic device or another character, for example) to access a contextual menu, which differs depending on the case. But forget about using these maneuvers from an exploration point of view, since in the game we will do nothing but move around the operational base of the Parliament of Heroes with the aim of accessing the various missions available, earning experience points, upgrading and/or or customize our superhero and finally level up. Which will unlock new missions, new upgrades and new customizations, in an almost infinite path that however shows the side to a considerable limit: time. The missions to which we can dedicate ourselves are in fact divided into two types: the first based on action, in which we can carry out attacks of various types against one or more enemies who in turn can respond and defend themselves, all until one side prevails on the other; the second based exclusively on time, in which depending on the complexity of the objective you have to wait a certain number of minutes. Now, while the ~active~ missions, despite their extreme simplicity, turn out to be quite fun and acquire greater depth as we gain new powers and the opponents become cunning, the same absolutely cannot be said of the ~passive~ missions. who see no involvement on our part and instead force us to slide the clock to access the reward. You can start a mission of this type, reduce the background application and do other things, but the obligation to log into Game Center (for real-time synchronization of results) as well as to maintain an active connection (whether 3G or wi-fi) results in very rapid battery consumption. The solution to the long waits, needless to say, lies in the purchase of credits useful for instantly completing the passive missions, which can be bought through an in-game system and start from 79 cents (five credits) to reach 15.99 euros ( over forty thousand credits). In short, although it is possible to play without spending a cent, it becomes very inconvenient to manage waiting even for an hour to complete a mission. The problem is solved by purchasing a voucher of 10 or more euros to obtain an almost infinite amount of credits, but the point is: is it really worth it? To conclude, the technical realization is of a discreet level: the design of the characters and scenarios is excellent and full of details, although the animations are reduced to the bone, while the music offers a questionable reinterpretation of the classic Superman theme.
