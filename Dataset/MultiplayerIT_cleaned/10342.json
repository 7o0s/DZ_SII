In driving games, in particular, relying on the inclination of the device to tackle curves not only makes the experience much less ~relaxing~ than touch screen control, but often does not even return the precision necessary to maintain the trajectory without getting smeared over obstacles and guardrails. From this point of view, Rally Master Pro 3D is the proverbial exception that proves the rule: carrying your car in constant oversteer, skidding through all the bends, has never been easier even if you have to grip the iPhone like a steering wheel. The car responds punctually to our requests, even lending itself to very precise driving to avoid any collision. Indeed, to be honest, the game also has a mode specially designed for ~steering wheel artists~, which requires you to finish each race with the bodywork still immaculate. It matters little if the goodness of the accelerometer control is opposed to a bad implementation of the alternatives via touch screen, practically unplayable. Up in the mountains with Annette Rally Master Pro 3D not only offers an engaging and fun gaming experience, but also a technical achievement of absolute excellence. While suffering from a pop-up effect that afflicts the rendering of the scenarios, in fact, the visual component of the Fishlabs product is extraordinary in terms of design and fluidity. The three cars available to us (one for each level of difficulty, to be unlocked gradually, distinguished by different values as regards speed, recovery and grip) are well designed, boast excellent textures and a good visual rendering of the damage: the body dings in different places, bonnet blows off, etc. Driving like a drunk doesn't just affect the outward appearance of our car, but also its performance. For this reason, between one phase of the tender and the next, it is possible to access three nice minigames that allow us to contribute to the repairs, making them faster and more effective. On the one hand, the locations are quite numerous, on the other, they are truly beautiful to look at: you run within suggestive scenarios, distinguished by a masterful use of colours, with perfectly rendered trees and buildings that embellish our journey towards the finish line. The exaggerated quantity of objects of some urban racers is not noticed, let's say that more work has been done on the design than on ~brute force~, but the results in terms of frame rate are exceptional: the game moves at thirty frames per second, with few uncertainties. The sound sector does everything possible to keep up with the graphics, but music and effects are only discreet. The art of drifting The picture painted so far illustrates what a fun racing game with great visual impact. Is such grace accompanied by adequate numbers? Unfortunately not. Let's be clear: Rally Master Pro 3D is certainly not a game that ends in one game or that lacks alternative modes, but in comparison with ~quantity champions~ like Asphalt 5 it has to admit its limits. The Fishlabs product does not have online multiplayer, in the first place, and offers only three basic cars for as many difficulty levels in the ~career~ mode. The addition of the interesting ~adrenaline~ mode (in which you have to push your precision to the limit in order to avoid any collision) and the classic ~timed race~ certainly guarantees a good overall duration, but it still remains average for the gender on iPhone.
