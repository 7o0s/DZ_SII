Definitely not, given the success that the Sony portable console is still capable of collecting in Japan, the land that gave birth to the Leaf Ninja and that clearly will not stop exploiting its popularity out of the blue, even if the release of NGP occurred within the year. Closing this necessary parenthesis for all fans of the character born from the pencil of Masashi Kishimoto, let's try to understand what exactly Naruto Shippuden: Kizuna Drive offers. It is an action game belonging to the genre inaugurated on PlayStation 2 by Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles in 2007 and resumed on PSP two years later with Naruto Shippuden Legends: Akatsuki Rising, therefore one of the many video game incarnations of the series, albeit probably the least brilliant. The plot, created specifically for the game, sees a false Naruto go to the Dream Village, free the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Times and make a massacre. The survivors of the attack decide to declare war on the Leaf Village to take revenge, and so numerous ninjas are sent on missions for this purpose. Unfortunately, only a tough confrontation will allow Naruto to prove his innocence and find out who is behind such a cowardly act. All for one... The game has two modes: one based on the story and one freely accessible, both with the same mission structure. As Naruto, we will therefore find ourselves coordinating a team made up of three other characters within different scenarios, divided into zones and full of more or less cunning enemies to defeat. The variables of the case may be constituted by the presence of obstacles, traps or chasms, but in principle the action always takes place in the same way: you eliminate a certain number of opponents, proceed to the next area and there are more fights to be deal with, so until the shipment is finished. Once you win, you are rewarded with rolls (chosen practically at random) which, once equipped, can increase the attack capacity, health, chakra of the ninja concerned or make him immune to poison, fatigue and other ~blocking~ techniques. ~. The upgrading of the characters becomes fundamental from a certain point in the story onwards, because the enemies become more resistant and therefore it is necessary to hit them many more times to knock them down. The secondary mode comes to our rescue, the one with ~free~ missions, which we can complete in order to obtain new rolls and equipment. Naruto Shippuden: Kizuna Drive therefore turns out to be a very simple product with highly repetitive dynamics, which however is able to exert a certain charm on fans of the series, in particular thanks to the numerous well-made animated cutscenes and an all in all engaging plot. Unfortunately, the thickness of the experience is missing, in the sense that it would have been appropriate to equip the characters with more multifaceted offensive capabilities to buffer the continuous repetition of the same situations. In fact, Naruto and his friends have a fairly short basic combo (circle button), which can be made more effective by combining it with a chakra-based attack (triangle button) and converted into a choral maneuver when the opponent remains dazed. At this juncture, therefore, a minigame starts which sees us press the PSP buttons as indicated on the screen to total the most devastating combination possible, which culminates with a special attack. The latter can also be performed as part of the repertoire available to our character, but only when the spiritual energy bar is full, and in any case without leaving particularly impressed either by the speed of the maneuver or by the results in terms of damage. Finally, by pressing the square button you can request the direct help of a companion, who will perform his own special move against the enemy closest to us. ...one for all The combat system works discreetly, especially thanks to the ability to move the camera using the back L and R keys instead of the d-pad (it's nice that sometimes PSP video game developers realize that players don't have the left two thumbs). A lock-on on the opponent is missing, but one is almost not missed: the combos hit without problems, the special moves a little less but for different problems (they start too slowly) and generally the sensation of returned impact is good. Clearly teamwork becomes more significant when we can access it together with three friends, taking advantage of the cooperative multiplayer mode which, however, is limited to the functionlocal ion. So three other people are needed, as many PSPs and copies of the game to be able to make it, which is certainly not a very common thing. Too bad: making an extra effort and implementing an online multiplayer would have definitely enriched the offer of the Namco Bandai title. Technically the game is very good, and beyond the aforementioned cutscenes, the graphics appear very well done, with detailed polygonal models that move within perhaps not very varied and sometimes bare locations, but with a more than discreet realization. As far as the sound is concerned, however, the judgment is neutral: unfortunately Naruto's American voice cannot be heard and in this case it is not possible to switch to Japanese dubbing, while music and effects accompany the action without infamy or praise.", "date": "2011-05-30", "grade": "6.8"}
