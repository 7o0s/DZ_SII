A kid, perhaps a little nerd, who in the mid-80s discovered electronic entertainment thanks to the NES and the adventures of Link, could now share the latest chapter in the series with his son. Skyward Sword is at the same time a celebration, an arrival point, a departure point and a moment of reflection both for the Kyoto house and for all the fans who have Zelda in their hearts. As the new era of Wii U dawns, and the Wii era concludes, the Triforce must shine brighter than ever. Between earth and sky No princess and castles; In fact, Skyward Sword starts from Oltrenuvola, an island suspended in the void above the clouds and populated by a peaceful community of human beings. Among these are Link and Zelda, friends since childhood and now teenagers grappling with a feeling that seems to be able to change and become something more. However, the extraordinary event destined to change their destinies and their dreams takes place on the day that should be the happiest for Link, called to face and successfully pass the final test as a student of the school of weapons; during a romantic walk on the back of Solcanubi, the large birds used as a means of transport, Zelda is in fact kidnapped by a mysterious vortex that tears her from her friend's arms. From here begins the journey of the protagonist, with a path that will prove to be much more than a simple search for the missing partner. An exciting incipit, that of Skyward Sword, which immediately puts the main arguments in charge of supporting the entire adventure on the plate; among these the concept of flight which, through the aforementioned Solcanubi, acts as a fundamental element of union of the various environments that can be visited by Link. In reality, the world above the clouds soon reveals itself to be extraordinarily empty, since beyond the central city there are only a handful of other floating islands relevant in terms of content, however always characterized by absolutely limited surface dimensions; for the rest, little more than rocks or fragments scattered here and there, good at best for collecting a few pieces of heart or secondary object. The impression that something more could have been done to give greater vitality and panache to the world above the clouds is a conviction destined to remain present throughout the adventure, especially by smelling the untapped potential in this sense. On the contrary, the sky is therefore in most cases, with some exceptions, only a point of connection between the three macro zones that represent the main theater of Link's epic: the forest, the volcano and the desert. And, by the way, the number three is a kind of leitmotif within Skyward Sword which is found continuously, even without having to bother with the Triforce, within the quests and assigned tasks. Returning to the settings, as those who have dealt with the series in the past will have immediately noticed, it is nothing that the previous chapters have not already shown; indeed, on the contrary, they now appear as practically an obligation, a certainty, as important and fundamental as the Link itself. Yet, where Skyward Sword does not renew at all in the type of location offered to the player, it changes a lot in the form in which these are presented; there had already been talk of a greater linearity of exploration, yet only by playing can one realize the radical choice made by the Aonuma team. The level design is in fact absolutely compact, cohesive and dense, to the point of significantly reducing the difference between ~inside~ and ~outside~ the in any case inevitable dungeon. Never in a Zelda have there been so many puzzles present ~in the open~, and thanks to this the feeling of simply being in little more than a filler between a dungeon or a city and the following ones is greatly attenuated. Overall there is less time lost therefore also because - as per tradition - there are a series of contingent secondary activities that fill most of the moments of the game; above all, the collection of insects and treasures through which to enhance objects and potions in one of the shops in the Oltrenuvola bazaar. Although the validity of the level design choice made by Nintendo is perfectly perceivable, in all probability the user will find himself split between those who appreciate the new course, and those who insteadhe will miss the expansiveness and sense of discovery offered by previous episodes. In Skyward Sword it is impossible to get lost, just as it is not allowed to spend time simply wandering aimlessly, perhaps looking for some glimpse or lost corner in which to breathe the air of the Nintendo fairy tale. Here and there The most talked about aspect of the new Zelda was, from the outset, the control system; the element of break with the past has a name and a surname: it's called Motion Plus, and Skyward Sword is a good opportunity to try to give a strong relaunch to a peripheral that evidently hasn't garnered the success expected in Kyoto. The accessory, connected to the Wiimote or integrated directly into the new version of the remote control, basically allows you to significantly increase the precision in detecting movements. This factor translates into what has always been the wet dream of fans of the series, namely the 1:1 management of the sword held by Link; a solution that is applied in numerous aspects of the gameplay, with obviously the focus focused on the combat system. Anyone who has played Wii Sports Resort, more specifically the discipline of Chanbara, can have an idea of the final result, even if in Zelda it is obviously raised to the nth degree. Being able to handle the sword in such a refined way has made it possible to give life to a whole series of enemies who, with their attack patterns, stimulate the player to explore the variety of blows that can be inflicted. The most trivial and simple example can be a Boblin, which protects itself by covering itself behind its own weapon, consequently asking to attack it in the exposed and defenseless part of the body; but there are so many applications, and it is evident how the Aonuma team has kept this factor in mind, trying to guarantee ever new solutions and challenges. But the Motion Plus also finds form and application in the management of the accessories, which are also the trademark of the series, which exploit the possibilities offered by the peripheral in a more or less marked way, also indulging in a few quotations, such as for example the Magic Jar which recalls Mario Sunshine. The end result can certainly be defined as very good, even if perfection is quite far away; probably the technology, while valid, however has its limits and the commands given are not always understood and translated correctly. On the other hand, the management of the pointer is more problematic, when it is required precisely to use this element, perhaps to shoot an arrow or a whiplash; the calibration is frequently lost, and although it can be easily restored by simply pressing the down button on the d-pad, it is clear that there are limits that evidently it was not possible to get around. We also find the limitations in the hardware of the Nintendo console, already ~old~ from a purely technical point of view since its release on the market; yet the effort of the programmers is so evident as to appear almost moving, and to think that Skyward Sword runs on what in the end is little more than a GameCube gives the perception of the capabilities of Nintendo developers. We have already said and said about the graphic style, with a splendid watercolor effect and a sublime use of colors that goes perfectly with the drawing stroke that outlines the characters. A final effect not as peculiar as that of Wind Waker, which in fact split the users, but absolutely excellent in terms of quality and characterization; precisely for this reason it is almost unnerving to perceive where the team had to give up in the face of technical limits, perhaps by observing some particularly washed-out textures, a frame rate that is not always perfect or an image definition that is now difficult to digest. Nonetheless, Skyward Sword is simply as stunning to look at as it is to listen to; finally abandoned the MIDI, the orchestrated musical accompaniment can literally explode overcoming the limits that until now had, albeit only partially, reduced its power. If the soundtrack is fabulous, the work on the effects is more conventional, while still absent is any type of dialogue dubbing. Heroes are born We could escape the final question, but it would only be a way to avoid the uncomfortable role of the video game critic. And so let's go ahead: is Skyward Sword a great game? Yes, without a doubt. Is Skyward Sword a masterpiece? Unfortunately not. As often happens in the case of such beloved and popular series, the ~problem~ of a new Zelda chapter is always that of relating to its past; and in this sense, Link's new adventure lacks that something capable of transporting him to the Olympus of video games, next to that Gooserina of Time which in fact constitutes the pinnacle of the brand. The main problem is, unfortunately, the inability to accompany the playful component with a narrative element that is not only good, but brilliant and exciting. On the contrary, the plot of Skyward Sword struggles to mesh, to introduce the elements necessary to transform the search for a missing girl into something bigger, more exciting, more important and more powerful; the switch clicks a little too far in the adventure, and up to that point the events appear to be sustained in a slightly superficial way and with not so incisive events. The fault, in all this, is also attributable to a ~villain~ who does not have an iota of Ganondorf's charisma; Ghiraim, on paper patriarch of wizards, but in reality a pale effeminate emo in tights who until the final scene does little or nothing to leave his mark. And it is also a pity that the Lira, the musical instrument adopted in this episode, has no practical application other than to continue the game if used in the precise points foreseen, and to unlock some treasure. Finally, if the familiarity of the gameplay and most of the puzzles is an element that could only annoy those who for some reason had been looking for an episode that breaks with the roots of the series, we feel we are less compliant with some choices made in the development quests which, especially in the second half of the adventure, rely too much on backtracking that is not always logical or fun, and on the recycling of certain elements which appears more dictated by convenience factors than by real needs or playful logic. In the group in question we also insert a couple of bosses who repeat themselves two (or even three) times; although the clashes with these, and more generally with all the enemies are always rewarding and exciting, it is something that at least makes you think in terms of overall longevity which stands at about 35 hours limited to the main quest alone. Finally, the camera can be reviewed which requires continuous micro realignments during practically every phase of the game.", "date": "2011-11-18", "grade": "9.2"}
