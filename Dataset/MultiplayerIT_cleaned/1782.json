{"name": "Doremix (Magix)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/doremix-magix.html", "text": "The virtual tools By now the use of virtual instruments has become common in all recording studios, from the smallest to the largest, from those of hobbyists to those of great professionals. Magix has included five virtual instruments in Doremix, each with a different purpose: The BeatBox 3.0 which reproduces a specific rhythm in a style of your choice, the Copper Synth which is a step sequencer born for hook lines and bass grooves, the Silver Synth Pro which offers other particular sounds and is the ideal complement to the Copper Synth, the Sampler with a good number of presets but can also read any .wav file and finally the Vocoder to modify the vocal parts by adding those effects that are so fashionable now in house and commercial. Midi and Audio Midi is a musical interface: Musical Instrument Digital Interface. This interface was born about 15 years ago to allow a ~common language~ of data exchange to all electronic instruments (that had implemented it). Today, various devices can be interfaced with the personal computer via Midi. Furthermore, thanks to digital audio recording we can encode an analog sound into a digital file, so that we can process it, adding effects, mixing it with other sounds and modifying it thousands of times without losing an iota of the original quality. Doremix uses Midi technology and is also a digital audio editing software capable of managing multiple audio tracks simultaneously which can then be edited and mixed. And after the mix... After having created your own mix (and it is really easy to do in a few minutes, we are also facilitated by the automatic counting of the BPM and the separation of the song into measures and we also have the mixer, equalizer and various effects available) we can request to have it published on the Magix Web Publishing Area. It should be remembered that although the software can be used to create something totally new, Doremix was born above all for the creation of a remix, or rather a re-proposition of an edited song where something already existing (the original song) is added to something personal in order to obtain a different style and sound, but keeping the original feeling. The remix created with Doremix can be sent to Radio Deejay and listened to during the Sala Giockey broadcast with Paoletta and Molella. Conclusions This is a great entry level product for learning how music production software works. The musical samples are well done and a mix is created in no time, having fun and making the first steps with Midi and audio processing. Pros Ease of use and immediacy Virtual instruments Audio and Midi together Cons Too simple for insiders Doremix, do the mix! Magix is renowned for its fun music software, simple to use and capable of introducing kids to the world of audio productions (multimedia and otherwise) in an effective and immediate way. Doremix does not deviate from this philosophy and with a good number of quality samples (by Molella, Gala and Soundlovers) and a work environment inspired by the much more expensive professional applications used in the studio, it can keep you glued to the monitor for hours and hours, allowing you to modify the projects included as demos, create something new and make use of the five virtual instruments, Midi technology and mixing of audio tracks (for a total of 64 tracks between audio and Midi). There is a lot of meat on the fire and although it is a rather simple software to use for insiders, it proves to be a winner especially for those who want to approach this splendid world of remixes but find themselves with a minimum budget in hand to invest in software.", "date": "2003-01-31", "grade": null}
