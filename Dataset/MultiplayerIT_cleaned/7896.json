Since then the sun has revolved more than once around the earth (or was it the other way around? We never remember) and the world has always been reduced to rubble. Indeed, let's say better, in a large swamp. The oceans have not retreated and the earthlings have had to adapt to the catastrophe by studying valid technologies to allow the species to survive. So, they learned to colonize the few remaining land masses, even the harshest and most inhospitable ones, and they learned how to create settlements on the seabed, creating modern Rapture, highly organized and economically functional, as well as with far fewer psychopaths around (which not a trivial detail). Unfortunately, human beings have been able to adapt to everything, even global warming, and are now once again ready to cause damage on a planetary scale. Not even the stop of the championship for more than a few decades (occasionally they tried to resume it, but the ball didn't want to know about bouncing on the water) has served to make the population aware of how the excessive exploitation of resources can lead to irreparable damage. The three factions: namely the Global Trust, linked to the old ultra-capitalist model which sees ecology as a limit and pollution as a necessary evil; the Eden Initiative, the classic hippies who live by smoking weed and building eco-compatible buildings; and the S.A.A.T. (Scientific Academy for Advanced Technology), the pundits of the situation who believe only in science; they're back in the fray, and they have more maps than before. How to deny him the possibility of sending everything back to ramengo? More flab for everyone Anno 2070 Complete Edition is nothing more than the all-inclusive edition of the title of Related Design and Blue Byte, which boasts well over a million copies sold worldwide. By purchasing it, you take home the base game, the Cobalt Abyss expansion and lots of downloadable content, for dozens of hours of longevity that never hurts these days. This alone should convince you of the value of the package, which also comes with an updated technological map and the complete soundtrack, divided into three discs, one for each of the main factions. From its debut to today, the value of the title has not decreased at all and, on the contrary, if we consider the offer as a whole, we are faced with one of the most complete management strategies of this generation. Definitely a very valid (indeed, preferable) alternative to the recent SimCity, despite the obvious differences between the two (for example, Anno 2070 is beautiful). The campaign is always there and as in the past it is the weakest part due to the limits imposed by the mission structuring of a similar title. Not that it isn't pleasant to play but, given how easy it is, we can consider it as a long tutorial that clarifies the enormous amount of options available, to then tackle the other modes with more peace of mind. Paradoxically, from this point of view Cobalt Abyss fares better, which offers a new faction to interact with, the E.T.O., and slightly different game situations thanks to the deepening of the underwater layer of the planet. Furthermore, all the new features it introduces in terms of structures and game mechanics become available in free modes (not in the main campaign), making them even more exciting. There is no shortage of extra content released on a regular basis and all those options that have made the members of the community of the series happy. The DLCs are also mainly aimed at adding special structures and additional missions. There are three main DLCs that enrich the facets of each faction (one for each) with dedicated content, often very interesting to play.", "date": "2013-04-16", "grade": "9.0"}
