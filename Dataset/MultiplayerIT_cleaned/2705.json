{"name": "Warhammer 40.000: Lost Crusade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-40000-lost-crusade-recensione.html", "text": "Having a soft spot for the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, we eagerly welcomed the opportunity to review Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade, convinced of the extraordinary potential of the franchise created by Games Workshop. Developed by the small Chinese team Orca and available in the traditional freemium format on iOS and Android, the game puts us in the heavy armor of a Space Marine Captain who finds himself having to face the troops of Chaos at a strong disadvantage after a bloody battle in space. Gameplay The gameplay of Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade is basically divided into three parts. There is the Farmville-style casual strategic phase, the one in which you find yourself building and upgrading the various parts of your space base, training new troops and following a large achievement system step by step which nevertheless gives life to highly guided mechanics, which they leave very little room for personal initiative. Then there is the spatial strategic phase, in which we work on the map to organize sorties which, however, are generally resolved by a simple comparison of statistics, leaving us only the task of waiting for our forces to reach a point and transform it into resources to collect. In this part of the game, however, it is possible to observe the MMO nature of the experience, which places hundreds of settlements belonging to different users on the same map, who can join forces and share their battles. Then there are the shipments, undoubtedly the funnest part of the game, in which a team of heroes is made up that can be summoned with the classic free or paid systems, equip with different items and upgrade in order to improve their skills, and then send them to complete missions. In this case the action is RTS-style, and although the interaction is limited there is no doubt that after the first ten assignments the matter takes on interesting connotations. In fact, if the characters move automatically towards the closest targets, in the context of short corridors full of enemies and with a portal to be destroyed, using the energy that is charged over time, it is possible to send extra troops and/or use spectacular special maneuvers against the toughest opponents. It's a pity that in this case a paywall becomes apparent after already a couple of hours, given that you are required to get to the bottom of the ~dungeon~ within a time limit and can only be done with highly powered heroes. Enhanced by some short cutscenes, Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade boasts an extremely clean and effective graphic style, able to best represent all the different gameplay situations. In the casual strategic phase, the design of the ships and the various components is appreciated, as well as the readability of an interface which becomes a bit too confusing when you enter MMO territory. Typical of Chinese productions, unfortunately. The missions governed by the RTS formula are very nice, with a large number of different characters and enemies who alternate as we enter these corridors, as well as a decent set of animations. Too bad for the soundtrack, which immediately turns out to be less interesting than the premises, adopting somewhat trivial solutions that do not contribute to the general atmosphere.", "date": "2021-01-20", "grade": "7.0"}
