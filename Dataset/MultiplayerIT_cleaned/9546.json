In a far from unexpected way, the clash between the Konami and EA Sports series has also recently moved to the impervious terrain of the iPhone, a platform where only until recently it would have been unthinkable to create a football simulation capable of do not regret what is available on consoles and PC. And this is not due to the technical limits of the device, but rather to ~practical~ limits, in this case the control via touch screen which has often been implemented in a questionable way. The 2010 edition of PES has dispelled all doubts, presenting itself as a product of the highest quality. What about Pro Evolution Soccer 2011? Equipped with an interface very similar to the one present in the other versions, the game brings back graphics and gameplay already seen last year, adding a few extra modes to the package but inexplicably modifying the players' AI, which now appears decidedly poorer and limited. Anyone who hasn't tried PES 2010, however, won't feel the weight of these shortcomings in any way and will still be faced with a small miracle of playability and technique, a complete and enjoyable experience at all levels. But let's proceed in order... Here come the Superboys As mentioned above, one of the strengths of this ~touch~ version of Pro Evolution Soccer are the controls, which prove to be unexpectedly precise and allow us to do almost anything in any situation: crosses, through balls, first-time shots , tap-ins and so on. The default configuration presents the classic virtual stick placed on the left side of the screen, accompanied by two buttons on the right side: the first, A, is used to shoot and to perform a slide intervention; the second, B, is used to pass low shots, for crosses and high passes (by holding it down), to make through balls (by pressing it and then dragging your finger in the desired direction) and to make a tackle (by holding it down while not in possession of the ball). To change the controlled player just touch any part of the screen during the defensive phase. The only perplexities concern free kicks, given that the power bar rises too quickly for the shot to be dosed well. There are two alternative configurations: the first based on a single touch, i.e. with the virtual stick for player movement but a single command for the rest (while maintaining the slide for through balls), which translates into different actions depending on of the context; the second based on the accelerometer instead of the virtual stick and again the single touch, rather precise as regards the movements but unfortunately awkward to use for obvious reasons. The single touch system, however interesting and immediate, still seemed to us to be largely improvable. Ball in the center for Rudy The game modes available are truly numerous: ranging from the quick game with random content to the exhibition, from club competitions (Champions League and Europa League) to the championship-cup combination, ending with the novelty consisting of multiplayer via bluetooth or wi-fi -fi. Unfortunately, the lack of a similar online mode weighs heavily, as it would have further enriched an already quite substantial experience. Team management is immediately simple and immediate, with the possibility of making substitutions on the fly and modifying the form, even if in this specific case it is not possible to manually change the individual positions. We also noticed a small bug: once you get to the screen before starting the game, which shows the physical conditions of the various players, if you go back to the previous menu these conditions are ~reset~ and change as soon as you proceed again. Graphics and sound are excellent, it could be said that they border on what the Konami series has achieved on PlayStation 2 and for a portable edition it is really a considerable achievement. The team rosters are unfortunately not very up to date, but this is not a problem that could affect the enjoyment of the title, while we would have expected more attention to the physical resemblance of certain players compared to their real counterparts.
