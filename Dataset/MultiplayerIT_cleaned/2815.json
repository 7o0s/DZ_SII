{"name": "Fuser", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fuser-recensione.html", "text": "Harmonix is back in the field, this time proposing a different title that winks at what is an increasingly appreciated component (at least until shortly before the pandemic) of the musical field: festivals. The EDM genre (acronym of Electronic Dance Music) especially in the last twenty years has seen the surge of the phenomenon linked to festivals, with the birth of phenomena such as Tomorrowland or the Airbeat-One Festival which now cover the role of real institutions . Harmonix has therefore decided with its Fuser of which you read the review, to bring this phenomenon into your home by putting you in front of the management of your festival both from a musical and style point of view. In a period like the one we are facing therefore, what better way to throw yourself into the notes of your favorite music, on a park full of melting ice cream with Corgis in a titantron and fireworks in the shape of multicolored stars, comfortably on the sofa of your home? We are all DJs Fuser doesn't have so many aspects to be judged for, the Harmonix title is in fact a game that does not want to add useless frills to the gaming experience, because its mantra is simply based on music, on the universal use of the latter and on the creativity that is the basis of this whole system. So don't expect anything more than what a video game of this kind can offer: freestyle sessions, a tutorial, and an online and local multiplayer mode. However, expect excellent variations on the theme, able to satisfy the player and remove from his mind the possible idea of being faced with something insipid and already seen. In fact, the campaign that acts as a tutorial takes care of taking this step, getting you used to the Fuser game systems in a prudent, meticulous and effective way (making the most of the ~trial and error~ vision), the possibility of performing not only against an opponent but also together with him, in order to create a featuring effect that is often seen in the EDM field, and finally from the customization component that aims so much at the most extreme madness. The layout of the modes is classic, but their implementation is inspired and original, the beating heart of the Fuser experience is covered by the gameplay. The Harmonix title will allow you to bring as many songs as you want into your DJ set, obviously chosen from the pool of 100 songs (75 present immediately and 25 belonging to the VIP Edition) introduced in the game. Once you have chosen your set to bring into the exhibition, the fun will begin. On your console you will have four disks available on which to insert specific parts of each of the tracks you have brought with you. Each song will have a maximum of four sections (vocals, percussion, strings, bass, keyboards, melodic base) from which you can choose and each one being mixed with others will obviously have a different effect, thus increasing the percentage of creative possibilities at your disposal .Once you enter the exhibition you will have no limits or objectives (unless you are in the campaign/tutorial of course) except to entertain your audience to the fullest, making them jump and preventing them from turning off and quiet during your performance . The possibilities are therefore many, from the simple number of discs to use, to changing one or more of them, from the entry in fade-in to the exit in fade-off of a certain section of your mix, from managing the musical scale to that of the bpm of the mashup. You can even create your own discs by choosing from a pool of instruments (drums, basses, piano, synths, vocals, etc.) and creating your own rhythm by interacting with a screen similar to a launchpad keyboard. The possibilities are therefore really many and each of them really allows you to manage the musical component of the performance at 360 degrees, thus stimulating every part of your creativity. Modes and customization All this mass of playful content can at first glance be overwhelming if launched into a performance right away. For this reason, the campaign designed by Harmonix serves to gradually familiarize yourself with each aspect present. Once you have created your alter ego (which we will discuss later) you will have to face a series of stages (unlocking them gradually, also to be able to use them in freestyle performances) corresponding to as many festivals and completing the various performances. Each of these festivals, perfectly characterized and made unique also by the organizer who will welcome you, will also guarantee you the accumulation of experience points (more or less based on the stars earned at the end of each eperformance) and in-game currency - there are no microtransactions - useful for buying new stylistic contents such as accessories and/or clothing, but also for unlocking songs not available at the start of the game. The difficulty level increases for each stage , but if you are looking for the classic definition of difficulty you will be disappointed. Fuser wants to be a path and Harmonix has thought of a system that will increase the need of the public during festivals but which will focus entirely on your degree of ability. The more you know how to manage the various aspects learned, the more impactful your mashup will be and the more festivals will be a walk in the park. As well as the playful aspect, the customization aspect is all-encompassing of any possible and imaginable madness. On a technical level, however, this element is divided into style customization and stage customization. The first type concerns the alter ego mentioned above, you can people of all genders, races, sexes and religions and modify their style in any way: starting from samurai masks, ending with gorilla heads, passing through zebra-striped trousers and ending with hair of dubious taste. The flip side of customization is the stage you'll be performing on. Here you can manage the images of the titantrons, the fireworks, the color of the lights, the stage effects to be released in the moments of song drops and the objects that the audience could throw in the moments of maximum appreciation. In short, also from this point of view Fuser offers various possibilities in terms of creativity going to fulfill its objectives. An ineffective track list Is all that glitters gold? Absolutely not, Fuser is in fact not free from defects. In the first place we find a slight approximation of the models of the characters which, although they are not terrible, clearly demonstrate the non-centrality within the playful ecosystem of the title. Fuser is not a game to see but to feel and perceive as well as to model according to one's creativity. The other neo that we find in the title concerns the choice of songs. It won't take lovers of musical genres such as old school Rock, Country or Rap, but the genre of music that is usually played during EDM festivals differs completely from certain musical genres, except for some individual cases where all A completely remixed impromptu quote is inserted into a DJ Set as a tribute. The 100 songs proposed so far (the track list will probably be subject to an expansion) in fact offer a fair number of tracks suitable for the proposed context, but in many other cases they have left us very bewildered. Completely exclude from the list most of the artists who have made the Tomorrowland phenomenon famous - to which Fuser narrowly winks - in the last 10 years (Avicii, Martin Garrix, Alan Walker, David Guetta, Carl Cox, etc.) for inserting Evanescence or Dolly Parton, rather than a-ha, seemed to us rather questionable choices especially in view of the fact that we are not dealing with a handful of cases, but just under half of the track list.", "date": "2020-11-07", "grade": "7.7"}
