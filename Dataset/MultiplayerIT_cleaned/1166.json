And yes, because in Saber Squadron we will have to dust off the old SAS uniforms, which played such an important role in the Second World War, because new, even more demanding missions are on the way. The first, fundamental, novelty that introduces this expansion is a campaign of nine brand new missions, complete with additional weapons and vehicles, but these are details, because what interests us is that Hidden and Dangerous 2 is back in a big way with the its incredible mixed gameplay of action and infiltration, tactics and shooter, which has already fired our spirits once. Once again we will be able to sneak silently and deadly behind enemy lines, at the head of a handful of soldiers ready to do anything for the success of the operation. Let's go back to wearing the hero uniforms. Once again we will be able to sneak silently and deadly behind enemy lines, at the head of a handful of soldiers ready to do anything for the success of the operation. The missions are of the usual variety, so sabotage, salvage, rescue, and so on. While taking advantage of an outdated graphics engine, with grainy textures and angular models, the settings are truly suggestive, The tactical command editor allows you to manage troops with extremely precise command queues, as well as being able to synchronize them with two special ~signals~. In the moments most difficult, coordinating an action with the tactics editor can be difficult. turn out to be the best solution; effective. as if to underline that creativity is always stronger than technique, proposing exotic or gloomy, sunny or foggy landscapes, but always made with excellent class and masterful level design. Once the missions have started, the range of possibilities that opens up at our disposal is enormous, we can choose different ways and approaches, we can choose to capture a Nazi and steal his uniform or to crawl silently against the wall and take the enemies from behind , with a single lethal blow to the head. All this both in first and third person, as we prefer, without forgetting the powerful tactical editor, with which to plan the joint actions of the entire team. In short, all stuff that we had already seen but that is always welcome. Once again we will be able to drive the vehicles and use the weapons mounted on board, but this time we will be assisted by a renewed Artificial Intelligence, at least according to the authors, even if I have found that my soldiers always have the usual suicidal tendency to get in the way to trouble. The command system is essential but very useful to keep the team compact and avoid damage from too much ~free will~, the signal to ~seek cover~ is still an elegant way of saying ~get killed~, but balancing the first control person and management via voice commands it is possible to curb the reckless nature of our companions. [C] As you can see, a load of explosives cannot be used here. which would be good... for us, of course. The cutscenes are in full motion video, but use the game's own engine and are always very well done. Briefings are always clear and well displayed. [/C]Enemies are tough, they gather and warn each other verbally, but SAS soldiers are lethal when well coordinated and pose a much greater danger to them, provided there is tactical supervision by the player. In short, playing Saber Squadron is still damn fun like playing HD2, but perhaps the biggest news is found in the multiplayer area, because the longed-for mode finally arrives... Cooperative mode. The multiplayer menu has closed. finally enriched with an extra voice. Well yes, in addition to a handful of maps for the classic Objectives, Deathmatch and Occupation modes, Saber Squadron finally introduces the cooperative mode, limited, however, only to the new campaign. Then we will be able to tackle the nine additional missions with three other human companions. A decidedly exciting experience, even if perhaps a bitter taste remains in the mouth due to the exclusion of the old missions. We will then be able to embark on the new operations set in France, Africa and Sicily, but nothing prevents us from tackling the new missions designed for the other multiplayer modes. In short, when we are tired of crushing the enemies of the Axis with our tactical superiority in single player, we will be able to indulge ourselves with human opponents, of greater caliber, and with the help of equally skilled companions. Without a doubt, adding the Coop alone is worth half of the purchase, the other half for the single player campaign. The rest are just extras. If you don't want to miss more news on this sitelo, add it to your favorites list. Comment At first glance, the content of this expansion pack might seem a bit sparse. No improvements to the graphics engine, no distortion to the gameplay, a single player campaign of only nine missions, an improved but still imperfect AI and, in the end, just the cooperative mode and a few more maps for multiplayer. But this is not the case, because if Saber Squadron does not shine for the quantity of material, it is undoubtedly appreciated for its quality. The developers have focused their efforts to add new challenges and give gamers, enthusiasts, something to entertain them and not just pass the time. Yes, of course, it does have some flaws... the graphics haven't changed one iota, the Italian dubbing is good, but some blunders in the translation have escaped, the AI can be improved and the new missions are actually very few. but in the end who cares? The spirit of HD2 is still intact, the gameplay is the usual, capable of delivering tons of emotions and making you jump on your seat and scream with joy at the end of a difficult mission, everything that was good before has remained unchanged even now, but in addition there are the juicy news we talked about. The new settings are suggestive and the missions are exciting, the cutscenes made with the usual skill, the level of challenge is always high and there will be moments of exaltation overcoming the most difficult phases. Saber Squadron, like HD2, leaves the player free to invent and experiment, and there are no limits to the satisfaction one derives from one's daring creativity! If this fact alone is enough as a promotion with flying colors, the fact of finding - finally! - multiplayer co-op is the famous icing on the cake. Did you wait for it? Did you long for it and regret it? Well, now it's here, all for you, and then you just have to take up your favorite rifle (I know you love the Springfield with the optical sight), gather some friends and venture out to save the Allies from yet another Nazi danger. Pros: It's still HD2! Brand new full campaign Finally co-op mode Cons: Graphics haven't changed one iota AI could be improved Where were we? Saber Squadron picks up exactly where we left off Hidden & Dangerous 2 (henceforth HD2), without distorting anything and without epochal changes to make you put your hands in your hair. There are no graphical or gameplay improvements, don't expect to have a revamped version of a game you know by heart by now, because Saber Squadron adds substance, not form. I don't want to talk about HD2, also because there is already a very valid review of the game, but I want to show you why if you loved it, you will also love its expansion.", "date": "2004-10-25", "grade": null}
