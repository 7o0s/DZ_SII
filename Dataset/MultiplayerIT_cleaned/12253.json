{"name": "Heatseeker - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heatseeker-recensione.html", "text": "Unrestrained speed! In the past years there have been countless video games dedicated to aerial combat on various consoles, but those that have made school and have remained in the hearts of all fans can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Few titles have been able to refresh a stale genre since the days of SEGA's After Burner, renew with original gimmicks and with graphics that always go one step further. The Ace Combat series, appreciated on PlayStation 2, is certainly one of the most prolific both in quantity and quality, and with its exponents represents precisely the type of game to which this Heatseeker is closest. The control system has inevitably changed: the Codemasters title uses the Nintendo remote connected to the nunchuk exactly as it was done in Wing Island. During the review of the Nintendo title, one of the biggest flaws of that aircraft game was underlined: the remote control could not be used as if we were holding a real joystick, but had to be pointed at the TV as if it were a shooter. Unfortunately, Heatseeker, using the same mechanism, lacks a good opportunity to create a more engaging console aircraft title, at least from this point of view. Initially you choose the difficulty level, which can be set to arcade or simulation: very little changes from the point of view of the controls, rather the enemy AI and the ease with which they will target will vary. Starting the single campaign we take on the role of Mike ~Downtown~ Hudson, through 4 scenarios and 18 missions overall. You get right into the heart of the action, without many frills or boring tutorials. The beginning is in fact very intelligent because it teaches us the commands during the first mission, in a fun and immediate way. Each level allows us to unlock a new combat aircraft, which will then be available in the hangar: F-15, F-16, F/A-18 Hornet, Russian Mig and Nighthawk V1 Stealth Bomber are just some of those present at the appeal. What immediately catches the eye about Heatseeker is that it is extremely fast and frenetic: let's forget all those flight games where it took minutes to turn around and the plane proved to be slow and listless to our stimuli. let's forget all those flying games where it took minutes to turn Unrestrained speed! Mike Hudson's fighters are as crazy and fast as those in the After Burner cabinet, they move immediately with our inputs on the remote control and react very well to turns, dives and accelerations. The nunchuck allows us to dose the power of the turbines, fire the machine gun or engage the fifth gear and set fire to the afterburners, breaking the sound barrier. The missiles, on the other hand, are launched by pressing the trigger located under the remote, which serves not only to give direction, but also to enter steath mode and change the weapon. The game action is always excited, sometimes funny if it weren't for the control system that often gets lost along the way and makes our hands get a little tangled. Mentally it is not always easy to coordinate two free and independent hands that have different but complementary orders such as direction/speed, it is often easy to make mistakes, inverting the inputs and finding ourselves performing the same things with both controllers. Like all games it's a matter of getting used to, certainly if Codemaster had thought of creating a virtual joystick with the remote, it would probably have been better for everyone. At 500mph the textures are not seen With the release of the Wii we all knew and imagined that the graphic sector of its titles would have been significantly lower than that of the competing consoles. On paper, the potential of the Nintendo machine is comparable to an Xbox, or an advanced model of GameCube. In reality, at this point, the situation begins to become worrying, because the graphic quality appreciated in the Wii production since December is well below expectations, reaching on average the first PlayStation 2 and Cubo productions, if not worse. Many software houses perhaps tend to excessively exploit the huge Nintendo machine fleet with easy conversions and large sales, yet Heatseeker is a project on home consoles exclusively for Wii (it is in fact only released on PSP, with which it seems to share the same 3D engine), and it was therefore legitimate to expect something more. The aircraft models are not good at all, they often seem sketchy, with a careful look you can easily notice the lack of many polygons in the details and finishes, yet there are shadows cast, those that break on the plane itself. The game is frenetic, fast, so that from the seat of our F15 fired at 500miles per hour textures definitely take a back seat At 500mph the textures are not seen The scenarios, on the other hand, are better, they are varied and wide, with many elements on the screen and some pleasant effects such as the bloom of solar refraction, but they are composed of few, very few polygons and moreover covered by bitmaps of low quality and resolution. The game is frenetic, fast, so that from the seat of our F15 fired at 500 miles per hour, the textures certainly take a back seat, fortunately. The audio sector is certainly better: the music is well paced and fits perfectly with the arcade spirit of the game. On the other hand, the Italian dubbing is of low quality, with heavily accented voices and unprofessional acting. The memory immediately goes to the wonderful Half Life: ~reveal yourself, Doctor Freeman!~. In general, what is missing in Heatseeker is the feeling of having a ~complete package~ in your hands, as once the single player campaign is completed it will only be possible to replay those levels unlocked by clicking on the mission mode. There is no multiplayer, there are no minigames, there are no special options or twists: the game is an appetizer of something you can only imagine. Comment Heatseeker is a heavily incomplete product. First of all for its brevity and poor replayability, secondly because there is no multiplayer whatsoever, both offline and online, split screen or LAN. The feeling of being faced with a sketchy game is confirmed by the graphics sector that does not spark: to maintain a certain fluidity many polygons have been sacrificed and the general quality of the image does not make one cry for a miracle, it is yet another Wii game that fails to show the potential of this machine. The original control, one of the few reasons of interest, is not well exploited and instead of simplifying the action it often manages to make it more difficult and complicated. Heatseeker is a first step towards a good hunting game, but much more is still to be done. Pros Fast and frantic It's the only hunting game on Wii Cons Fighters have a joystick! Graphic compartment Poor longevity Nintendo Wii is gaining ever-increasing popularity among developers, thanks to the relatively lower development costs compared to other consoles, a considerable installed base and the original control system that opens up new perspectives for new genres and games. Many software houses are currently working on the Nintendo machine, even those that in the past era, the GameCube, have been looking out the window for a while with skepticism and little support. Codemasters has released a new aircraft game: after Nintendo's Wing Island this time it's time to get your hands on the yoke and pilot the very fast Heatseeker F15s!", "date": "2007-05-25", "grade": null}
