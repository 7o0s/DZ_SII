Before Dave Perry, with RC Stunt Copter, reminded PSone owners that a radio controlled helicopter must be flown in order to take into account the forces acting on it and affecting its movement, there were many famous cases of using the inertia in video games. For the smartest, the thought will run to the way in which Capcom managed to make the Street Fighter 2 series survive for ten years without even changing its sprites: an excellent example of inertia. The more innocent and elderly, on the other hand, will think of titles like Joust and its mediocre sequel, both of which happen to be present in the compilation. In Joust, the player takes control of what looks like an ostrich, and must jump from platform to platform while avoiding enemies. Since this type of bird is not very good at flying, the descending parabola of the jumps is only slowed down by the flapping of the wings. Extremely simple in graphics, the game requires a pinch of strategy: you have to calculate precisely the movement of your bird before jumping, and read the movements of your opponents. The scenario changes drastically with Boot Beer Tapper, which dates back to 1986 and which I remember very well as I used to play it at the local bar. In this cute little game you take on the role of a bartender who has to please a herd of drunks by throwing mugs of beer at them on different counters. Sometimes drinkers don't need a single drink, and they send the mugs back waiting for a second round: if the mugs fall to the ground, you're fried; otherwise, completing each level will make the bartender elated to the point of drinking a beer, throwing the mug in the air and smashing it with his heel (adequately anesthetized by alcohol, of course). Second part Midway's Arcade Treasures also contains several driving games. The first that catches the eye is the innovative Road Blasters, in which the player doesn't just drive his car to overtake his opponents, but can also get rid of them violently, using weapons of various kinds. The ~check point~ system in the game is represented by the collection of fuel, without which it is obviously impossible to continue racing. In Spy Hunter the view changes (in this case from above) but not the substance, with our car equipped with every good thing to get the better of the enemies. It's a pity that everything is quite a bit unplayable, above all for how the controls have been transposed on the Dual Shock 2. The same problem afflicts Super Sprint, which in the hall was played by turning its steering wheel like madmen but which does not pay off at all with the pad analog stick. Still set on the street, but fundamentally different, are 720 and Paper Boy. The first is a skateboard game in which you have to perform stunts to earn points and you can move from one stage to another to find new ramps and different routes; the second is a classic remembered by many, in which you ride a boy on a bike who has to deliver newspapers only to certain houses and finds all kinds of things in his path. Of the other titles contained in this collection, Rampage certainly deserves a special mention. In the game you control a giant monster intent on destroying a city, and you have to face the military defense forces in an attempt to bring down all the buildings in each stage. Among the numerous shoot and run of the lot, I cannot fail to mention the ~twins~ Robotron 2084 and Smash TV. These two titles, practically identical if it weren't for the year of production and, obviously, for the technical realization, put you in the role of a character who is surrounded by enemies and must shoot in eight directions to escape their attack. Curiosity: there is also Blaster, a polygonal shooter that gives a good idea of how far vector graphics have come in twenty years. Comment A collection of old video games is aimed at a nostalgic audience, and the twenty-four games contained in Midway's Arcade Treasures represent an attractive loot for those who want to replay a title that marked their childhood. However, due to the bad technical realization and the scarce extras, even a nostalgic will have to think twice before putting his hand to his wallet. After all, it's also true that anyone who buys a PS2 certainly doesn't do it to wonder how, twenty years ago, they could consider videogame masterpieces that today can't even be watched... The numerical vote is to be understood as a mix of the two currents of thought. Pros: Twenty four games Perfect emulation,almost always Game information and interviews Cons: Absolutely bad graphics Sometimes inadequate controls Only for nostalgic Twenty four games in one. To put it this way, it seems like something capable of killing the video game economy at least as much as piracy. Instead it is a ~nostalgic compilation~, let's call it that: Midway's Arcade Treasures allows us to take advantage of the powerful PS2 hardware to go back in time, perfectly emulating (almost always, at least) the games we used to see at the bar when there were no consoles yet. After a sincerely bad introduction, perhaps not even worthy of a PSone, in which an Egyptian pyramid opens its secret rooms to players eager to rediscover the origin of the video game, we are presented with a simple interface with all the titles available in the compilation, arranged in alphabetical order (wouldn't it have been better to follow the chronology?) and ready to give us the emotions of when we were as tall as two stacked drums of detergent. Or at least they try. To the fearless ~sector~ ~journalist~ who is about to review a compilation of this type, full of memories but full of depth, there are only two ways left to get by: 1) elegantly discerning the essence of classic video games, establish contact between pixels and God, travel in the hyperuranium to grasp the intrinsic meaning of each production, take a census of the acids that the programmers of the time certainly used to invent new worlds and stuff everything with philosophical-sociological quotations. Or 2) to present to the readers a Fantozzi-style plank (strictly arranged with the canine member method) of the best games in the collection.", "date": "2004-05-03", "grade": null}
