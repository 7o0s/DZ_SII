{"name": "Un colpo quasi perfetto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/92492-reckless-getaway-un-colpo-quasi-perfetto.html", "text": "Versions tested: iPad and iPhone The developers of Reckless Racing, after entertaining the owners of iOS devices on the dusty rally circuits, have decided to shift the attention towards another and decidedly different type of race, less subject to rules (indeed, to be honest, completely devoid of rules) but equally spectacular. We are talking about cops and robbers-style chases, a genre that made the first episodes of Need for Speed famous and which sees in this Reckless Getaway a very particular revival, full of interesting and fun extras. Sowing the lady In Reckless Getaway the protagonist is an unfortunate bank robber who, after each heist, finds himself at his heels by dozens of police cars determined to arrest him or worse, to cause him accidents to stop him at any cost. Although, due to the financial news reported everywhere, the protagonist's crime is nowadays seen almost as a Robin Hood-like gesture (which, we remember, stole from the rich to give to the poor), the law still remains the same, with the inevitably harmful consequences given by its violation. In fact, each level begins with the escape of the protagonist, hunted down by flying cars, through roads, highways, crossroads and shortcuts of a hypothetical city always and constantly invaded by traffic. In fact, the thief, driving his car in Getaway mode or a mighty truck in Wreckless mode, must face a whole series of obstacles, starting with the other vehicles normally entered into the road flow; going at reduced speed, the cars of passers-by essentially become barriers to overcome in order to reach the escape route in time. Driving the truck, however, the problem is not given by the simple cars, easy to eliminate given the size of the vehicle, but by other trucks and disturbing snowploughs, capable of destroying the mighty vehicle with a single well-placed front end. Naturally there is then the police, whose cars will be activated as soon as the unfortunate criminal passes in their vicinity, trying in every way to ram him. The required skill is therefore quite demanding, despite the simple and colorful aspect of the game: dodging the cars of normal traffic, avoiding those of the police and at the same time not colliding with tunnels, poles, guardrails and all the urban furniture present in the 16 different circuits may seem easy only in appearance, because in the end, passing a level unscathed will be almost impossible if not after a lot of practice. The control system of the fleeing vehicle is entrusted to the classic touch commands, based on two lateral arrows for steering, or to the usual accelerometers, whose adjustable sensitivity is able to satisfy any request; no button to accelerate or brake is present in the game hud, because during the escape, your foot will never take your foot off the accelerator for a moment. In addition to the ~passive~ objectives, i.e. related to the physical survival of the vehicle, in Reckless Getaway there are also bonuses to be collected in order to increase the score or integrate power ups to facilitate salvation; in particular the latter are of three types, namely a classic turbo, a sort of impulse that drives away nearby vehicles and a standing jump that allows you to overcome blocks of cars or other obstacles. The driving style once behind the wheel is obviously totally arcade, albeit based on a very accentuated physics: for example jumps and sudden changes of direction will force you to recover the vehicle by acting intensely on the steering, otherwise you will roll over and therefore stop the race. The ~bird's eye~ camera from above allows a view of the road sufficient to dodge the impediments but not for the identification of the bonuses and power ups, whose position in fact must gradually be learned by heart in order to recover them then at the next restart. A sort of softer ~try and die~ therefore, but necessary to reach the difficult 4 gold stars; 12 stars will then give the green light to the next level. Although of marginal importance, the technical aspect also fulfills its task very well, thanks to the colorful environments and the good (but not excellent) fluidity of the game; therefore, the search for poorly defined textures or neglected particle effects is useless, given the great concentration necessary to bring the skin home. A last mention only to the complete integration with Game Center and the game support promised by the developers, who have already announced new levels and different modes in future updates.
