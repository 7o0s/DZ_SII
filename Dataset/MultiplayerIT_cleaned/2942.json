In our review of Project CARS 3 we will demonstrate how the game has veered decisively towards a more arcade and less simulation direction, seeking a new balance and competing in many ways with another brand of the British publisher, GRID (although, it is good remember, the title is distributed by Bandai Namco). Has this change of setting paid off? A career force From the initial screen it is clear that the Project CARS 3 offer was created taking Forza Motorsport 7 as a benchmark. The lion's share is entrusted to a renewed career mode that follows in all respects that of Microsoft's racing: therefore we find numerous championships, each reserved for a particular category of vehicles, which must be completed in order to then unlock the next ones and have access to more performing cars. The challenges are mainly represented by sprint races of two or three laps (depending on the length of the track), with the player always starting from the center of the grid. There are no qualifications and even the number of participants, generous in itself, is wasted for such fast grands prix. There are also some variations on the theme, such as the completion of one or more fast laps without smudging, but overall we don't find anything really original. The machines are divided by power, and the possibility of modifying them both aesthetically and mechanically has been introduced. The exterior customizations are limited to the color of the livery and the design of the wheel rims, without the possibility of adding aerodynamic details such as spoilers or side skirts. From the development point of view we find exactly the same items that Forza has accustomed us to: the brake calipers, the air filters, the injection and the camshaft can be improved, up to a ~total conversion~ of the vehicle to transform it into a higher class racing car. Conceptually therefore, apart from some events intended for particular categories of cars, the entire career can be completed with the same car, which, not surprisingly, increases in level with use, receiving discounts on updates and exclusive upgrades. Change not to change As stimulating as it may seem, in reality tuning turns out to be a double-edged sword since, being the upgrades common to (almost) all cars, it ends up by standardizing the driving models in an even more marked way than that of the game of Turn 10, reducing, on more than a few occasions, the choice of car to simple aesthetic tastes. During the career, the difficulty curve rises progressively with the increase in the categories, even if the level of difficulty remains unchanged. However, at times it felt like certain challenges were overly biased in favor of the CPU. The progression is rapid, rewarding and stimulates the continuation until the total completion; moreover, the number of competitions and situations is decidedly abundant and able to entertain the user for many hours. The main dish is accompanied by the daily, weekly and monthly events (all aimed at increasing the level and expanding the garage) and the personalized challenges in which to set the track, the number of laps and the participants. The multiplayer sector could not be missing which we could only try for a very short session before the publication of the review. A few minutes spent in the company of top-level players (including two of the programmers) who confirmed the immediacy and accessibility of the guide system, very permissive with collisions, which allowed us to place on the left side of the ranking despite relative inexperience. Interesting, even if we have not had the opportunity to investigate it sufficiently, the system that assigns an evaluation to the pilot both on the basis of driving cleanliness and respect for the opponents. There were only eleven players in our tests, but it's safe to bet that the level of enjoyment will rise when all 32 slots are filled (the limit is reduced to 20 for consoles). Four-wheel drive or two ice cubes? In the ~simcade~ triad, the Project CARS series had always stood out for a more marked simulation value, so much so that it could be appreciated, with due precision, only with a steering wheel. The watchword of Project CARS 3 is accessibility, even if the driving aids are not that many. Along the lines of what was seen in F1 2020, trai can be activatedectories and assisted braking, transforming the game into a sort of little train; then there is the possibility of activating the ABS, traction control and stability control; the latter in particular makes the driving model decidedly artificial and you will soon feel the need to disable it. Without electronics, things improve, but the physics of the cars, entrusted to the Physx engine of NVIDIA, returns unnatural sensations: we are referring in particular to the mass of the cars, which all seem too light, as evidenced by both the sudden changes of direction obtainable even at high speeds is the exaggerated sensitivity to any type of curb and to the roughness of the asphalt, with behaviors that are difficult to predict. The sore point concerns the high-mileage curves: if you miss the apex by even just a few centimeters, the car is literally moved outwards, regardless of the surface and the speed, and there is no way to recover it if not leaning, unrealistically, against the guard rails. Hammer gas... go! Thus, we end up choking very little on the analog sticks, opening the gas wide or pressing the brake pedal all the way, with the result of a driving model very similar to that of Shift 2 or GRID, to remain in the Codemasters portfolio. Not that this is necessarily a negative aspect: the car can be mastered in a few minutes, but a good concentration is always required to avoid treacherous off-track exits. The gameplay manages to give some good satisfaction, but, as mentioned, it is a U-turn that could be difficult to digest by fans of the first minute. Here everyone must therefore make a reflection based on their own needs. To complicate things comes an artificial intelligence that is anything but innovative. Aggressively CPU-controlled pilots often ram the player or brake into turns to quell any kind of attack, avoiding adopting the same agonistic fury between them; when you manage to get to the lead, a rather difficult operation without using strong ways, a groove is usually created which is quickly filled at the first drool. What leaves us most perplexed is the attitude of certain drivers who, at certain points on the track, seem to almost stop and then, once passed, tackle the following curves with a precision worthy of the best Lewis Hamilton. In such a scenario, it should come as no surprise that both pit stops, fuel and tire consumption have been eliminated and that collision management does not lead to any damage (not even visual, if not to the player's car which does not is however penalized except when cutting curves). Open doors If there's one thing Project CARS 3 doesn't lack, it's variety: sure, we're light years away from the pharaonic Forza Motorsport 7 and its 829 cars (DLC included), but the 211 models in the base game are however more than those of the previous title. We find the most famous brands, including Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti, McLaren, Porsche; inevitably some exotic rarities are missing, but in such a generous park you will surely find your favorite racing car. In addition to the classic covered wheels, Dallara of Formula E also clocked in; the Le Mans-winning Bentley Speed 8; even the Lotus 98T driven in 1986 by a certain Ayrton Senna. Unfortunately, the problem of the views remains: the one from inside the passenger compartment is difficult to use, while in those that shoot the car from behind we would have preferred a slightly higher camera to better dominate the asphalt. Also noteworthy is the number of tracks, which wind through 51 locations (twelve less than the predecessor), but the total count of which, considering the various layouts, rises to 121. There are real circuits such as Monza, Brno and Interlagos, but there are also fictitious and often very inspired tracks, such as the revived Mojave or the new entry Toscana. The same variety also reappears in the weather conditions: not only can you run at any time of the day or night, with rain, fog, mist or clear skies: there is even the possibility of choosing the preferred season (unfortunately, however, the temperatures asphalt do not affect the grip of the tires). Graphics engine You may or may not like Project CARS' new arcade setting; the judgment on the technical realization is much less subjective, subdued compared to that of the previous episodes. Right from the game menus (which seemed too inspired by the mobile world) one gets the impression that the title stopped a few years ago. This sensationand is confirmed once the helmet is worn: we are not referring so much to the detail of the tracks, which is difficult to appreciate in motion, but above all to the rendering of the cockpits and cars. A direct comparison with Project CARS 2 demonstrates how in this new edition the textures are flatter, almost impermeable to the light sources that made the racing action of 2017 more vivid. Not only that: even the environmental effects, such as rain or dust raised by a runway exit, are decidedly coarser and, to sharpen the ear, it seems that even the sampling of the engines is a little less defined. This downgrade can be explained by Slightly Mad Studios' desire to maintain a high frame rate even on consoles, where it was set to maintain the ceiling of 60 frames per second; certainly it is a dish difficult to digest by the PC user who has, on average, much higher computational power. As can be guessed, the joypad (the Xbox 360 one was used for the test) is more than enough to have total control of the situation, so much so that a steering wheel is almost excessive.", "date": "2020-08-24", "grade": "7.0"}
