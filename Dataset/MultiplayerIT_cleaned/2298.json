{"name": "Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-rogue-leader-rogue-squadron-ii-4.html", "text": "Of course, the Star Wars tie-ins have been going crazy since the days of Atari and its pretentious wireframe, to continue their tradition on all existing home hardware: even the Sega 32X made us drop at the time in the Ison Corridor of the Death Star, aboard an X-Wing made up of about ten polygons... But the most solid backbone of these digital adaptations follows the axis that takes us from the old, dear, PC with its X-Wing before, and Tie Fighter later, at Nintendo64, when the Star Wars brand ended up in the hands of Factor 5, a team within Lucas Arts. Factor 5 is a marvel: those of you who have never played Turrican raise your hand! You down there!? You are banned from these pages! Point. But yes, that legendary action/shooter we've seen on Amiga, MegaDrive, SuperNes... I even remember a megalithic version with the CBM64 license plate, you can't help but know it! Well, the Factor 5 team, after playing for a while in the ranks of Data East, then Konami, then Capcom, has definitively established itself under the protective wing of Lucas Arts, the label for which it created the very first Rogue Squadron, in absolute exclusive for Nintendo64. The game was a success, mainly in the States, not only for the technical realization which also boasted the coveted Hi-res, but also for that pseudo-simulation gameplay, complete with missions divided into objectives, which the PC tradition required! In short, there was a lot of smoke and a lot of fire! Until yesterday, the wait for this Rogue Leader was mounting like cream, the more the hype around GameCube was mounting, given that Lucas Arts / Factor 5 announced, about a year ago, that the stars and stripes debut of the 128 bit branded Nintendo would have been greeted by the sequel to Rogue Squadron: the first pics that began to circulate on the Net made everyone drop their jaws to the ground, while on the occasion of the last E3, the pitted (real time) movie caused more than one arrest heart rate in the audience. Now it's in my greedy hands and I can shout, without fear of denial, that I'm faced with the most impressive polygonal sideshow ever set up in the entire videogame history! Cinematic rendering, perhaps even more seasoned with effects, more pompous than the five films if possible, beyond photorealism. The number of polygons on the screen is unrivaled, nor preceded: no title of the first line-up of Microsoft Xbox dreams of reaching this, and this is clear to all ... Texture mapping? Refractions? Particle animations? More stupid questions? There is a price to pay and let's get the tooth out right away: in conjunction with an unquantifiably overflowing number of on-screen polygons, the engine hiccups a bit. Nothing to worry about, for heaven's sake: the playful front does not undergo any unwanted sophistication, but when sudden turns are made, sometimes, the engine suffers a little and betrays not only frame drops, but also some slight jerks! Something that never happens, I emphasize and I repeat never, in the glories of targeting, and this is what matters most... Of course, one can see from a mile away that Factor 5's main concern was to amaze us, thus, in order to offer us an unprecedented polygonal orgy, the team decided to turn a blind eye to these slight hitches, which can be found, I repeat, only in the purely acrobatic phases, as well as choreographically too overloaded. Amazement always remains our only true, unique companion. Unprecedented cosmetic astonishment, new term of comparison, absolute, closed chapter... Just speaking of the Targeting System, mentioned above in passing, I instead want to invite all lucky GameCube owners not to abuse the on-board one, which by automatically highlighting the primary and secondary objectives to break down, it halves the real attractiveness of the play package in no uncertain terms! Of course, this way it will be much more difficult to complete the eleven missions proposed, but otherwise you can definitively say goodbye to the extras and additional missions, unlockable only thanks to the infamous medals (bronze, silver, gold) to collect. With Automatic Targeting, no medal. Clear? It is also true that in order to collect gold medals in quantity, both an in-depth and planned study of the various game areas will be necessary, as well as a skill truly worthy of a Jedi, but only in this way does the title truly show its numbers. Longevity reaches peaks of absolute magnificence: don't tell me you don't want to put your ass on Darth Vader's personalized Tie Adveance!? Then get busy! If you're desperate, use theForce!? I did it once... I swear... I closed my eyes, I followed my instinct... OK, some steps can only be completed by a Jedi, I admit it, but did you want something simulative or not? For the rest there is very little to add except that unlike the prequel, you will be able to issue some orders to your squadron: you are still the legendary Luke! Numerous interludes, rigorously in real time that follow what was seen in the cinema with damningly disconcerting fidelity and ease. It will be a very hard blow to sail the skies of the glacial Hoth, directly taken parody from The Empire Strikes Back, with that megalithic hodgepodge of rebel and imperial forces engaged both by land and air: honestly, these are not sequences to be able to comment without indulging in delusions! Delusions that I prefer to spare you, seriously inviting you to test everything with your little hands. Seeing is believing, better, not to believe what will wriggle in front of your beautiful big eyes. GameCube has arrived, it's square, it's bad, it doesn't load and it has absolutely screaming firepower. The sequel to Rogue Squadron succeeds where the sequel to Wave Race failed: to show us what the car can do in a polygonal environment, which is crazy stuff! I advise everyone to connect via S-Video, now available although about 100 papagne: so at this point, Rupee more, Rupee less ... If the graphics sector breaks through to unthinkable goals for the consoles currently present on the market, the sound sector completes a technical framework to be praised and venerated in silence. The playful sector is always very solid, artfully articulated, never repetitive and at times damned gassing, which never hurts: Ison Corridor docet. Longevity is made granite by the medals and the thousand unlockable features, which inevitably leads us to conclude that we are facing an absolute digital cult; and if you are a true fan of the Star Wars universe, I can give you only one piece of advice: buy a GameCube and play... That's all, guys... Pros: The best technical front ever Unquantifiable polygon count Great strategic depth Cons: Slight frame drops during some turns Some passages for Jedi only A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away... What better start for the ~umpteenth~ review of the ~umpteenth~ tie-in extrapolated from Luca Camminacielo's incorruptible epic? Yet another, yet another... The saga is incorruptible, the license incorruptible, but stop everyone, let's be a little more cautious: we're about to have a chat about the highly anticipated Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II! How, who would it be? Simply the title on whose shoulders rests entirely the task of showing the shapeless mass & video game, how swollen the muscles of this GameCube really are! And, cough, cough, they're damned swollen... Ekkome, ekkekkas, but let's proceed in order... The annals of videogame historiography teach us that a videogame adaptation often comes out of a reference film, oscillating between dull and shabby! Why? Basically because the producer/developer who grabs the juicy license of the moment has to give a little effort to sell the game: enthusiasts will jump on it anyway, regardless of its intrinsic quality, a bit like flies do with poop. And in these cases, unfortunately how often, we find ourselves talking about poop; the development costs of a software package inspired by a certain film are deliberately low, just to be able to easily return to the money paid out to grab the rights to this or that brand! Many western manufacturers live almost exclusively on licenses; Who Said Acclaim? Naaah... What is certain is that Lucas Arts, an offshoot of the Lucas empire itself, is not involved in this sinister policy of exploiting famous/expensive-brands: first because the rights must not be purchased (they are his) and second because the empire Lucas cares a lot about ~quality~, a word that must categorically orbit around every component of Star Wars merchandising, associated software. ~Quality~ that also historically binds Nintendo and Lucas, not so much for the personal friendship between George and Miyamoto, but for a collaboration that began on the Nes, continued on SuperNes, then on Nintendo64 and inevitably on GameCube.", "date": "2001-12-27", "grade": null}
