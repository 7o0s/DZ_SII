{"name": "Freaky Fliers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freaky-fliers.html", "text": "leaden skies Hannah and Barbera must have had their ears ringing when the first images and information about Freaky Fliers started making the rounds on the net. The Midway title clearly draws inspiration from the animated series starring Dick Dastardly, Matly and all the rest of the Wacky Races gang who already animated the homonymous cart game on the Dreamcast. Here, however, the game mechanics are similar to the flight sections of Diddy Kong Racing and the only means available are more or less probable aircraft. Great attention has been paid to the design and characterization of the protagonists, each with its own story, narrated by amusing and well-made full motion video cut scenes. The internships are the same for each of the characters, but to unlock them all and with their secrets and attached sub-games, you need to finish the title with each of the aviators available. As you may have guessed, the longevity of Freaky Fliers is great, but it must be emphasized that unfortunately most players will take note of it without even attempting the feat of finishing it in every aspect. The game structure is in fact undermined by a choice in the game design that over time can be annoying. We proceed in the story mode by placing ourselves in the positions gradually requested and overcoming the sub-games that are offered to intersperse the actual races, using shortcuts, power ups and weapons scattered in the seabed which are really vast and full of surprises. To complete the paths 100%, however, sub-missions must be completed which are not always easily tackled: some because they are objectively difficult, others because the exact content is simply unclear. The problem is that these submissions are not recorded as completed once the race is won, but must be overcome all at once on every single attempt, while also being able to overcome other opponents and place on the podium. After the initial frustration, many will abandon the attempt, settling for the story mode, sub-games and multiplayer for up to four players in split screen. The result is that much of the work done by game designers is lost and that the entire gaming experience is flattened. A large reservoir of oxygen could have been the possibility of playing Freaky Fliers on the network via Xbox Live, but this is not the case and the Midway title remains destined for an exclusively offline experience. Between sunny canyons and expanses of snow... A cartoon upside down, that's what struck me about Freaky Fliers. Usually in this kind of productions great attention and detail, even polygonal, are reserved for the main characters who stand out against somewhat sparse backdrops, to highlight their personality. In the Midway title, on the other hand, the in-game counterparts of the protagonists are a little too essential and the different characterizations, so spot on in the full motion cut scenes, get lost a bit, highlighting the multi-platform origins of a graphically pleasing game. The backdrops are the real protagonists, vast, complex and full of animated and non-animated details. The frame rate remains nailed to 60 fps, between lights and explosions of all sorts, but without making use of any of the graphic features that the Microsoft console has proved capable of managing without difficulty throughout its existence. The result is still solid and the interactive cartoon moves on video in a funny and attractive way. To be certainly above average is the musical commentary with some goodies that you will find yourself whistling even when the TV is off. The funky of the main screen and the swing of the stage set in 50s America are some songs of a very good ensemble that explodes with the tex med of the stage where you will be called to save your fort from the attack of fearsome Mexican bandits. Being careful not to hit a folk music ensemble, which plays an exhilarating tune undaunted, regardless of the carnage exploding all around. Comment Freaky Fliers is a discreet game, certainly intended for fans of the genre who are not looking for innovations and who are looking for a title that can be played from the very first moment without jolts. It may not be the best in its class, but it is nonetheless a worthy representative of kart racing and will let itself be played by anyone who wants to embark on crazy chases through the skies of improbable landscapes, animated by the most bizarre creatures. Multiplayer helps the longevity of atitle that alone could be a bit frustrating and a bit cumbersome in the management of the submissions that act as a corollary to the individual stages. Had it been compatible with Xbox Live, Freaky Fliers could have really made its mark on the Microsoft console line up. As it is, it remains a pleasant pastime for enthusiasts, far from the progenitors of the genre, but certainly attractive given the reduced marketing price. Pros: Captivating and fluid graphics Good characterization Long-lived and challenging Cons: Few flashes of creativity in game design The objectives to be achieved in the submissions are not always clear The system with which these are implemented is frustrating Positive surprises often come in silence, some really end up following the luminous trail of glimmers that emanate from a game package when you open it (definitely TDK's Yager in the last year), some others get lost along the way and does not arrive at its destination. Midway's Freaky Fliers is certainly part of the latter category of games and, if on the one hand it may interest the many fans of cartoony Kart Racing, on the other it probably doesn't have the qualities to captivate other users, despite the purchase price being certainly tempting.", "date": "2003-10-27", "grade": null}
