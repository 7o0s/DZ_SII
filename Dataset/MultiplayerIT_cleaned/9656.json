{"name": "Splitgate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splitgate-recensione.html", "text": "A base of Halo, a fair dose of Portal and a pinch of Fortnite: these are the ingredients of the free-to-play shooter developed by 1047 Games, which in the month of its debut on PC had a success as big as it was unexpected, with over 600,000 downloads and a network infrastructure that was hastily upgraded to support all that weight. Then it was the turn of the debut on PS4 and Xbox One consoles, which occurred in conjunction with a general rethinking of the mechanics and the introduction of cross-play, and the launch of the first season with the inevitable Battle Pass. Finally, the news of the debut in the world of eSports is recent, which marks the closing of a circle for a project born from below and carried forward with a lot of enthusiasm. We took advantage of these latest updates to get our hands on the game again, check its status and try to understand the reasons for its success: we talk about it in the (late, we know) Splitgate review. Gameplay Splitgate, the opening of a portal on one of the dedicated surfaces Let's start with the gameplay, an always fundamental element but even more so in a multiplayer-based production. The combination of Halo and Portal for Splitgate is not accidental, given that the authors themselves proudly claim to have been inspired by the two classics to give life to their creature, and this in fact appears evident from the first games, together with the abundance of aesthetic objects and prize boxes (spheres) which, however, do not affect the balance in any way. The formula is in fact that of a futuristic shooter for ten players, with a fairly long time-to-kill (but not as long as that of the multiplayer sector of Halo Infinite) and hitboxes that we could define as generous, characterized by a very permissive free-to-play model and the traditional double progression for those who play for free and those who have purchased the Battle Pass, which costs 900 Splitcoins (about 9). Just the progression regulates the gradual access to the contents and in particular to the ranked matches, available only after having reached a certain level of experience. Splitgate, the Stadium map seen from above during a match The character's mobility is excellent and practically without limitations: thanks to the powered armor worn by the fighters (which, however, on the design side, perhaps represent the weakest point of the production) you can run endlessly, use a jetpack which guarantees a few seconds of propulsion to take large double jumps and to ~glide~ when necessary, and finally exploit certain surfaces to open or close two communicating portals, to be exploited in various ways during the games. The mechanics of the portals is not easy to integrate into the loop at first , but you get carried away and can certainly add an element of strategic depth to an otherwise very linear gaming experience. By opening a portal it is in fact possible to go beyond it to reach the opposite end of the map in an instant, but also to look inside it to identify any opponents and shoot them treacherously: for this you are also equipped with two grenades which are used to destroy the gates opened by the other players . Splitgate, a player exits a portal Portals allow you to fall back quickly after a firefight that has substantially lowered your defenses, making you very vulnerable to a sortie, but also to draw unexpected paths within certain stipulations (for example when carrying the sphere in the Oddball Team mode) and take advantage of the excellent vertical development of the scenarios, perhaps opening a gap in a quite raised point to be able to watch the opponents from above and target them with impunity. The combination of all these possibilities, together with a battle royale-style approach to equipment (it starts with two random weapons but it is possible to replace them with other tools, positioned in the Gears of War-like map, complete with a reappearance timer), draws an exciting picture for those looking for pure, leveled and basic gameplay from this type of experience , and isn't afraid to give up on well-established things like classes and their builds. Contents Splitgate, a player shoots at an opponent To support the solid Splitgate system we find a large number of different modes and the progression system we have already mentioned, which regulates access to the various contents based on the level of experience achieved. In reality, however, even without a Battle Pass, a couple of days are enough, perhaps taking advantage of the multipliers of the special events, to unlock everything that the 1047 Games title has to offer. What is even more important, compared to therecent beta matchmaking problems that generated long waits for accessing matches have been resolved: on Steam the system works rather quickly and finds matches and players despite the abundance of available stipulations, which the latter generally tend to fragment the user and to obtain the opposite effect. Splitgate, a player with extra unlockable skins and an original look to say the least They range from the classic All Against All, to Team Swat, a deathmatch with deadly headshots; from the King of the Hill to the Instagib, where you fight wielding a lethal Railgun; from the randomly equipped Team Fiesta to Domination, with its control points; from Team Shotty Snipers, which prefers the use of sniper rifles, to the traditional Team Deathmatch. And then again from Contamination, with a single zombie that can convert the entire team, to the frenetic escapes of Split Ball; from Team Oddball, Capture the Flag style, to Showdown no-respawn clashes; from Gun Game, in which performances allow you to get better weapons, to the variation on the Big Head Snipers theme and finally to Takedown, in which you have to eliminate the entire opposing team to win a round. Spitgate, two teammates run into the map An abundance of stipulations, we said, but the authors have not left out maps and weapons either. In fact, there are fourteen standard scenarios and seven simulation-style scenarios, visually much less appealing, which alternate more open and simple designs with other intricate and complex ones, they develop in height or less, they present deadly chasms or comfortable shelters where you can snipe your opponents without running too many risks. As far as the arsenal is concerned, the eleven available guns boast peculiar characteristics that make them more or less suitable for certain styles of play and situations. The shotgun is best for close quarters, for example, while the assault rifle is ideal for medium ranges with its continuous burst. Carbine and Battle Rifle both lend themselves to the execution of lethal headshots, as obviously the sniper rifle, whereas Railgun and Rocket Launcher offer devastating power but must be calibrated. Graphics and sound Splitgate, a player points to the unknown We therefore arrive at the sore point for Splitgate, that is the general lack of personality of the game which is found not only in the derivative mechanics of which we have already spoken, but also and above all in the general design. The armor of the characters are extremely generic, while the scenarios draw suggestions here and there (even from Rocket League, for example), unable to impose their own personality. It is obviously a problem on several levels, because it is clear that within a such a crowded and competitive vein as that of multiplayer shooters necessarily serves to stand out from the competition with a strong basic idea, a precise characterization that the 1047 Games title does not possess. The general lack of effects helps to make the game rather light, and in fact on the test configuration it runs at 4K and 60 fps without any problems, with all presets set to maximum. Unfortunately, there are no options for dynamic scaling or upscaling managed by artificial intelligence, but the available options are actually enough to scale the experience on mid-range PCs. Finally, the sound sector moves between highs and lows: the main theme is nice and remains in the head (also because you will hear it played over and over again in the menus between one match and another), but otherwise the music is absent. On the other hand, little to say about the effects: again nothing sensational or original, but they do their job well.", "date": "2021-11-29", "grade": "7.5"}
