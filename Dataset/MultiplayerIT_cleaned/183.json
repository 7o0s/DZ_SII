However, Ouendan did not pass unscathed by the gauntlet of conversion, on the contrary; evidently considered ~too Japanese~ for Western palates, the original game has been practically completely rewritten, keeping only the basic mechanics intact. In fact, the almond-eyed progenitor revolved around a trio of students/dancers, capable through dance of solving authentic existential dramas of a whole series of absurd characters. How else to define a boy unable to do his homework due to the noise caused by his family, or a talented violinist blocked by an intestinal problem right on the way to one of his important concerts? These very funny and demented skits, represented through pure manga-style cartoons, constituted the theater of the 14 levels of Ouendan; the latter were also enhanced by as many absolutely irresistible j-pop musical pieces, and fundamental in creating the overall picture that determined the success of Nintendo production. But as we said a few lines ago, simply translating the incomprehensible ideograms would probably have further restricted the catchment area of a game that is already rather sectoral in itself. An alternative route was therefore chosen, based on the total revision of both the main characters and the available scenarios; from this decision Elite Beat Agents was born, practically a sequel to Ouendan, or rather a parallel episode. The agents of the title, three to be precise, are this time the heroes destined to travel the world with the task of putting an end to the problems of a series of desperate characters. Although the protagonists have changed, fortunately the method for carrying out the missions has not changed, that is dance; certainly not a normal dance, mind you, but authentic complex and articulated choreographies that make Enzo Paolo Turchi envious. And therefore the stories that frame the game are also completely new, absolutely absurd even on this occasion. So here is a babysitter who asks her boyfriend to help her with some pestiferous children, or Leonardo da Vinci busy trying to impress the Mona Lisa, or even a desperate dog because, after dozing off in a van, he then woke up hundreds of kilometers from home. The result is simple: playing Elite Beat Agents means staying with a permanent smile on your face, often destined to lead to big laughs in front of the most absurd breaks.

The gameplay has remained virtually unchanged from Ouendan; in practice, the aim is to touch the numbered circles with the stylus to the rhythm of the music. Fortunately, the undertaking is simplified by the presence of larger circles around the first ones, which narrow until they overlap their circumference. That's the exact moment to poke them with the stylus. There are also small variations on the theme, such as spheres to touch following them in their rolling path or wheels to spin quickly, but the gist is basically this. Simple therefore, immediate, but not for this without a particular depth determined both by the increasing difficulty and by the possibility of repeating the levels to obtain a higher score and vote. Overall, therefore, the picture of Elite Beat Agents so far is positive; despite having lost a slice of charisma and absurdity typical of Ouendan's strongly Japanese key, the western transposition was still less painful than expected, and most of the stories of the 19 levels are characterized by absolutely delusional plots. Where unfortunately the Nintendo production suffers the most the blow in the internationalization process is in the music sector, obviously deprived of the excellent j-pop songs replaced by tracks closer to the taste of the general public. If some choices therefore appear to be hardly criticizable, such as for example the very suitable YMCA by the Village People, one certainly cannot remain enthusiastic in front of the notes of Sk8er Boy by Avril Lavigne, Survivor by Destiny's Child or Makes no Difference by Sum 41. be particularly strange the mix of current pop songs and canzones of a completely different class from several years ago (see tracklist), with a final result more similar to a soup than to a list with a common thread. A defect that however only minimally affects a thick product, with an unexpected depth that is further amplified thanks to the multiplayer component for up to 4 players. Comment Elite Beats Agents does a great job of bringing the awesome but too Japanese Ossu to the West! Tatakae! Ouendan!, adapting the original formula to the tastes of the rest of the world without distorting the brilliant game mechanics and the incredible insanity of the topics covered. The only flaws that slightly affect the final value are fundamentally linked to the less intriguing characterization of the protagonist agents compared to Ouendan's students, and above all to a tracklist that is not very cohesive with itself and debased by a handful of truly mediocre quality songs. Despite these minor missteps, and despite Ouendan's novelty factor having long since faded, Elite Beat Agents remains one of the best games available for the Nintendo DS without a shadow of a doubt. Pros Incredibly fun Deep and highly replayable Original Cons Lost something compared to Ouendan Questionable tracklist The massification of the video game market has brought with it, among other things, the expansion of genres deemed ~worthy~ to be adapted and distributed outside the country of the Rising Sun. And so while once resorting to importation was an authentic necessity for anyone who wanted to be able to enjoy products labeled as not very ~commercial~, today even in the West it is the norm to find among the shelves of shops even less conventional games, characterized by bizarre mechanics or variations on the theme of the more classical strands. The exception was Ossu! Tatakae! Ouendan!, a rhythm game for Nintendo DS which, despite having never seen the light outside Japan, has constituted an authentic small phenomenon, prompting many owners of the Nintendo console to deal with incomprehensible ideograms in order to be able to appreciate this jewel. Evidently amazed at the success achieved, Nintendo therefore thought well of changing their plans and bringing the effort of the Inis team to our parts as well.", "date": "2007-01-05", "grade": null}
