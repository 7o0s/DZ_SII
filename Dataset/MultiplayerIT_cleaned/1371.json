{"name": "Ninja Gaiden", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-gaiden_a.html", "text": "You will never, never forget After bringing duels to the death - and more - with Dead or Alive to Xbox, Team Ninja has taken the return of Ryu Hayabusa under custody. The silent hero will be engaged in the search for a sword, called the Dark Dragon Blade, stolen from Ryu's native village by obscure figures, who could not logically limit themselves to mere looting. The initial scenario therefore presents a stolen sword and a village razed to the ground, far too much for those who make revenge their principal. This is, broadly speaking, the basic outline of a plot that will accompany the player throughout the game thanks to spectacular FMVs, among the best ever seen, and interludes in real time. The scenography of these filmed sequences is specially designed not only to paint the portrait of a ruthless and laconic hero, but also to accentuate the redundant flamboyance of the latest Tecmo effort. Of course, the plot, as in any good self-respecting action game, is merely functional to the action but it is undoubtedly satisfying to see your alter ego, Mr Hayabusa, stand at the top of a light pole with a cloud of fire in the background, to then open your arms and launch headlong using the electric cables as a handhold. Not just katanas During the game there will be a large number of weapons, each with its own characteristics and combos: swords of all kinds, Nunchaku, hammers and spears, but also rather unique weapons which it is better not to mention so as not to spoil the surprise. Each will therefore have well-defined characteristics, such as lightness and effectiveness, but also a set of special moves. It will therefore be necessary to learn the sequences for each weapon in order to be able to best use the desired one at the moment it is considered most appropriate. You will also have all sorts of shurikens and bows available to be able to hit opponents from a certain distance. 10 ...the moment, the earth that shook Structured in chapters, Ninja Gaiden places significant emphasis on the exploration of the various scenarios. Those who hypothesized a game essentially on tracks will largely have to change their mind. Maps that grow exponentially in size form the basis for all the evolutions of Ryu, who will be forced to jump through hoops to reach every corner of the background, all expertly mixed with much more linear paths and strong backtracking which is also essential for finding objects secrets. Our alter ego will therefore be able to run on walls in horizontal and vertical ways, loop the loop and hang himself, in a successful result of utility in the service of showiness. The only flaw is a rather low level of interaction with the settings, mostly limited to a few levers to pull or objects to destroy. On the other hand, the growth of the character is of a completely different kind, essentially linked to the upgrades that will invest the various equipment. Ryu will be able to carry a large variety of weapons with him, each with its own characteristics and moves that will expand as the level of the weapon increases. This solution adopted by Team Ninja is fully satisfactory, leading the player to slowly discover all the potential of his hero. Furthermore, the possibility of using throwing weapons - such as bows and shurikens - and magic will constantly give lifeblood to an articulated and exceptionally spectacular combat system. The air caught fire... As happened in the ancient prequels, Ninja Gaiden slightly distorts the essence known to us of the classic ninja, perpetually wrapped in shadow and darkness, leading him to be much more devoted to action. The combat system is nothing more than an epic hymn to the most boundless technicality, as well as a boon for pad virtuosos especially in hard game mode. The player will have to learn, even before moving the first sword strokes, to dodge and parry. Throwing yourself into the fray head-on without caring too much about the fine combat strategies that surround this Tecmo production will simply serve to make the Game Over writing appear prematurely. Therefore hinged on an effective defense system, the combat system will offer much more than a solution to kill the various enemies that will present themselves during the game. Soon the parade will be joined by the possibility of counterattacking following very precise timing procedures, the same ones that will be indispensable for creating combos and moves of all sorts. Spells and throwing weapons will also take care of instilling further depth, which will add attack solutions to the already numerous ones present. Assisted by an almost perfect control system, we will therefore be able to exploit the power of a powerful as well as loadable shot and, at the same time, make use ofPress one key for faster but less damaging swings. On the fronts we will find, in addition to these, also a button for jumping and one for using throwing weapons. Dorsals instead intended for the reset of the room behind Ryu and for the fundamental parry. The latter will lead the protagonist to an almost statuesque immobility, unbreakable only by releasing the trigger or with the help of the left stick, which will lead our hero to perform sudden dodges. The only defect found could be cataloged in the archive of venial errors. In some combat circumstances, in fact, it will happen to send the interaction and the fastest slash in opposition, both used for the same key on the pad. The consequence is quite clear: in the middle of a fight to the death it will happen to open a dialogue window instead of hitting the opponent. Luckily, this doesn't happen very often. ...and then, silence. The undisputed beauty of the fights is further enriched by the artificial intelligence of the enemies calibrated in all its facets. Various and complex attack patterns will range far and wide among the multitude of opponents present in the game, among which the end-of-chapter bosses stand out for their excellent characterization. Even in terms of design, the various characters present in the game offer much more than a starting point, from the top of a style that draws heavily from the manga Ken the Warrior in some cases and from the more appropriate Dead or Alive in others. Ryu Hayabusa shines both for polygonal complexity and for animations and design, proposing himself as a status symbol of the perfect lone wolf. The settings are no less which, in addition to varying from the Japanese to the Western architectural style, will show a noteworthy polygonal complexity. Small drawback given by the camera, which although good in following Ryu step by step, as well as resettable by the player, will show many difficulties in narrow spaces. Ninja Gaiden re-proposes all the violence of the clashes with white weapons with severed heads and blood splatters to dip walls and floors, and it would be a shame if the European version were, as unfortunately it seems, censored. Last notes for the sound sector all in all good, with a varied soundtrack and always relevant to the situations proposed in the game, although it does not present traces of absolute thickness. Final comment And so Microsoft drops the first ace of this 2004 which promises to be hot and full of excellent titles. Ninja Gaiden goes far beyond the most optimistic expectations, and if from the technical side the doubts have always been minimal, from the purely playful one it offers many surprises. A vibrant and honest game in its desire not to invent anything new, but which manages to offer an almost unique gaming experience in its genre. A challenge like few others that manages to almost never be frustrating, except for the saves reduced to a minimum, but a satisfying overview of what a game with ancient roots must be. Highly recommended to everyone, indiscriminately, although the high difficulty makes it rather difficult for novice players and more suitable for those who really know how to use the pad. Master Piece in all respects. Pros: Great combat system. Technically excellent. Virtually perfect controls. Challenging and rewarding. Cons: Camera not always reliable. Tested the Italian version! As sadly announced, the PAL version of Ninja Gaiden has undergone minor tweaks, not to mention outright censorship. To meet European legislation (German in particular) and guarantee the game a PEGI 16+ rating, many violent aspects of Ninja Gaiden have been modified, while others, such as the beheading scenes, have been completely eliminated. In its latest press release in this regard, Microsoft has done its utmost to reassure the general public that the characteristics of Ninja Gaiden have also remained unchanged in Europe. Pretending for a moment that heads roll and blood flows like it happens in the rest of the world, the Italian conversion is really excellent from all points of view: playability, speed, graphics and 60hz have remained unchanged in the conversion. A deserved conclusion for the truly excellent Italian translations in any case and for the always correct, precise and functional cultural, grammatical and syntactical adaptations.Claudio Camboni Matter of axioms. The current generation of consoles is methodically remaking the classics of yore, specially coated and greened thanks to 3D. Those nostalgic for the 'video game that was' were therefore able to reconnect with the pastwith titles such as Shinobi, Castlevania (pretending to forget the N64 version) and Prince of Persia. The results of these productions have been rather fluctuating it is true, but it is equally true that they have managed to open a welcome playful window to all budding players. To increase the ranks of titles anchored to the glorious 80s also arrives, and by popular demand, Ninja Gaiden, one of the bright pearls of the Tecmo house and fourth chapter of the series. The previous three saw the light on the NES and were appreciated for the classic beat 'em up approach of the time. Well, after a demo, released in the States about a month ago, set fire to the spirits of all Xbox owners, we've finally got our hands on the definitive import version. Could we therefore refrain from writing an in-depth review? Not a chance...", "date": "2004-03-12", "grade": null}
