{"name": "Shantae: Half- Genie Hero Ultimate Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199317-shantae-half-genie-hero-shantae-half-genie-hero-ultimate-edition-la-recensione.html", "text": "Just over a year ago Shantae, the most famous Half-Genius heroine in the world of video games, returned to the fore with a new chapter in the series, the result of a successful Kickstarter campaign; a few months later Shantae: Half-Genie Hero also landed on Nintendo Switch, given that the buyers of the hybrid of the Kyoto House were clamoring for a port also for their brand new console. At this point, last summer we were all convinced that the Shantae operation was over, marking a new success and an important point in the technical renewal of the small franchise. WayForward, on the other hand, evidently wanted to strike while the iron was hot, releasing new additional content on a regular basis, some of which are really nice and particularly worthy of attention. In the end, the game was enriched so much as to justify the launch of its definitive version, the Shantae: Half Genie-Hero Ultimate Edition, an important occasion for those who had lost the basic version along the way in that distant December of 2016. A brilliant craft Shantae is the guardian genius of the small town of Scuttle Town, a job that provides her with room and board but certainly not very peaceful: since she has been in charge, the village has been constantly attacked by unlikely enemies, strange creatures and war machines assorted. Among other things, Shantae possesses very particular powers, but she is half genius and half human: she compensates for her lack of genius with a lot of grit, will and a certainly interesting temper. The new adventure of the long-haired heroine follows her previous events narrated on Nintendo 3DS, but it is perfectly understandable even for newcomers: in fact, things, characters and places will obviously be immediately recognizable to those who have already had the opportunity to enjoy the productions of WayForward complete with nice quotes, but the title explains, hints and makes everything clear even to those who meet Shantae for the first time. The basic philosophy remains unchanged from previous productions: once again we find ourselves grappling with an old-school 2D action-platform in which we will make our way through enemies using Shantae's flowing hair as if it were a whip, hoarding along the way of many secrets, collectibles and gems with which to enhance the character. The central village of Scuttle Town serves as an improvised base: it is here that we will obtain new missions by unlocking the various game worlds and levels, and it is always here that we will be able to go to the bazaar in the square to be able to buy upgrades, skills and consumables for Shantae. Although not a complete genius, the girl is in fact able to master, through a graceful magical ballet, some incredibly useful transformations to overcome the obstacles conceived by the developers in the various levels. Is a giant boulder blocking our way? Shantae-Elephant can give him a good headbutt to send him flying. Is the distance between two platforms really too big to jump over? The transformation into a bat or monkey allows us to solve the problem. There are numerous elements that make Shantae: Half Genie Hero Ultimate Edition the most complete and satisfying episode of the series: the number of transformations has been increased and some are completely new; offensive and defensive spells have been introduced that can be activated at will, keeping an eye on the mana bar on the left, the level design is never as inspired as in this case and full of hidden paths and ways, accessible only thanks to a studied backtracking . But it is above all from the three artistic, graphic and technical points of view that Half Genie Hero marks a clear detachment from the past: the title is beautiful to see, enriched by a captivating and inspired soundtrack, and skilfully studies some mechanics in 2.5D above all during the boss fight. It's not all rosy, all right: the level of difficulty, for example, decreases as we get closer to the grand finale, because by then we will have collected so many power-ups for Shantae's health that we won't even be afraid of fireballs that they hit us in the face. At the same time everything we see is beautiful, fresh and original, but it is also true that the levels are not so many and that in the long run returning four times in a row to the same point to collect a different collectible each time is not that the case rewarding: overuse in backtracking leads to repetitiveness for its own sake. Even richer: the contents of the Ultimate Edition As we mentioned just now, Shantae's basic adventure has been enriched in recent months with various DLCs andinteresting additional content. Some may appear as trivial alternative skins of Shantae, offered among other things at the price of a tidy sum, but that's not the case: when WayForward adds an apparently aesthetic content within its title, it is usually careful to link it to some specific characteristics able to vary the style of play. The exact same thing also happened with Shantae: Half Genie Hero, but you have to pick up the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con (or the PlayStation 4 pad, if you want) to realize it. The Ultimate Edition contains, for example, the Costume Pack, a series of additional clothes for Shantae that transform her into a Master Ninja, an improvised bather and one of the policewomen from the Mighty Switch Force series (simply brilliant crossover). Tackling the main adventure dressed up with one of these outfits drastically changes our way of approaching enemies and levels: Shantae Ninja is able to teleport covering greater distances than those that can be tackled by simply jumping, throwing shurikens and moving a little more quickly than normal; Shantae in beachwear has a special ability that allows her to throw inflatable balls at enemies that can bounce off surfaces; Finally, Mighty Switch Force's Shantae can even take advantage of the same blocks of the series of origin to ~crush~ enemies against the Nintendo Switch screen. These are just a few related examples of simple additional costumes: in addition to those we have mentioned, there are also available, partly for the first time ever, dresses dedicated to the transformation into Tinkerbat, Blue Shantae and a classic version for Risky Boots. If on the one hand WayForward has aimed at an aesthetic enrichment and at new nice possibilities linked to the use of the main heroine, on the other it has also introduced contents that expand the main plot: Pirate Queen's Quest Story is a real expansion dedicated to the Shantae's archenemy, Risky Boots. In the handful of hours foreseen (proceeding calmly) by the DLC, this time we take on the role of the pirate queen engaged in her mission to conquer Scuttle Town: Risky's controls and skills are completely different from that of the half-genius, thus proposing not only an unedited adventure but also a new approach to what is still a scrolling 2D action platformer. A similar but less long-lived direction is also that of the third noteworthy additional content: Friends to the End. The expansion is placed in a precise point of the main plot linked to Shantae, of which we cannot tell you anything to avoid spoilers: the player will be called to control from time to time the three friends of the protagonist, RottyTops, Sky and Bolo, once again each with its particular movements, its own abilities and unique possibilities, within completely new levels that provide other hours of fun. The Ultimate Edition contains all the contents we have told you about, at the all in all honest price of around 24 euros in the digital version: the real problem is that those who already own the basic version of the title must in any case repurchase the entire package, because DLC and expansions are also meant to be sold individually... at least for now.", "date": "2018-05-17", "grade": "8.5"}
