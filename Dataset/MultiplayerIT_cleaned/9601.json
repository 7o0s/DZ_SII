The premises are therefore almost as simple as the game, and this is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if we consider the franchise itself: Clone Wars Adventures is inspired, of course, by the acclaimed 3D animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, considered by fans of the Star Wars universe such as George Lucas' sincere thanks for not burning down his Skywalker Ranch after the creation of Jar Jar Binks. However, the game manages to be a bit contradictory: it seems clearly aimed at a very young audience, despite the themes and some sequences of the series being anything but childish, yet it asks for something that very young people hardly have, a credit card full of hard cash. Question of the week: Would you spend a handful of euros to show off a new lightsaber? It's a matter of looks Clone Wars Adventures takes advantage of the same modern and stylized style of the animated series to propose a series of small settings that act as a hub and meeting point for the various players, personified by very similar three-dimensional avatars. So far, everything works as in a normal MMORPG: it is possible to interact with other players, communicating via the chat window or adding them to a personal friends list. The aesthetics are pleasant and well done for the size of the client, the polygonal models are simple but not without details and nice animations, and the interface is welcoming and practical. Thanks to a few buttons and shortcuts, it is possible to immediately examine one's personal card, change some parameters and find out almost immediately where the donkey falls. As we said, the look of our avatars is in fact initially very, very basic. Who wouldn't want to be able to take off their rags by default to wear, perhaps, the legendary Obi-wan Kenobi uniform or Mace Windu's dress? Or maybe you'd rather change the color of your lightsaber from blue to green? Clone Wars Adventures allows you to do this, but to do so you will have to pay hard cash. Each upgrade, which is actually only aesthetic, can be purchased with Station Points, which in turn can be purchased in various packages by paying via Paypal or credit card. We soon realize that a good 90% of the game is based on microtransactions and almost all the possibilities offered to the player must be bought. As already mentioned, switching lightsaber doesn't really affect anything, except the aesthetics, and the purchase would be justifiable in view of broad social interaction within a solid community, but none of this exists in Clone Wars Adventures: the hubs are in fact sparsely populated by players engaged mostly with the various mini-games and very little interested in making conversation. A collection of minigames Clone Wars Adventures does not fail to encourage the player with some tricks, such as a sort of private home in which to admire the trophies won during the game. In fact, we talked about playing minigames, so the question arises: how do you really play this MMO? Despite the acronym that identifies it, Clone Wars Adventures is a decidedly single-player game, although the records are recorded in special leaderboards; by pressing a button it is in fact possible to access a menu that offers about twenty different mini-games, often inspired by already existing IPs, reworked on a Star Wars theme. The most striking example is undoubtedly Republic Defender, a sort of ~tower defense~ in which we will have to develop and upgrade defense weapons in various maps. The minigames offer an excellent variety of gameplay and challenges for all tastes, so between minigames in which you have to find the differences between two images or write the words suggested on the screen, clearly oriented towards the little ones, there are also more elaborate tests that they involve choreographed lightsaber duels controlled by pressing a few buttons in a time limit or high-speed speeder races that take advantage of a decent three-dimensional engine. The quality of the mini-games is satisfactory and even for the older ones there are interesting pastimes, but it soon turns out that only a small part of each mini-game is free, practically only the basic level of difficulty: the rest is accessible onlyso paying a month of play, i.e. going from padawan account to Jedi account. For his ~efforts~ the player is rewarded in Republic Credit, the virtual currency with which it is possible to purchase a handful of features, always above all aesthetic, but in reality the bulk of the bonus elements remains confined to the universe of paid Station Points , certainly out of the reach of the children to whom the title seems to be addressed.", "date": "2010-12-01", "grade": "5.5"}
