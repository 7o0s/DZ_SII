{"name": "Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/circus-maximus-chariot-wars.html", "text": "In search of Varenne's ancestors Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars was developed by Kodiak Interactive, an American team that is not very well known and is currently engaged in the conversion of the game for PlayStation 2. Unlike what you might imagine, we are not dealing with a chariot driving simulation but with a classic racing that simply replaces modern cars with older chariots. Having said that, Circus Maximus develops like many other driving games and the behavior of the horses on the road does not differ much from that of a car. To the racing component is added the bloodiest one made up of hard clashes between the ~crews~ of the chariots. Before starting, we will in fact be asked to compose a real team by choosing the model of chariot, the breed of horses, the driver and the warrior who will take care of keeping the opponents at bay with swords, spears and with his own armaments. a gladiator. It should be noted that both the driving of the chariot and the control of the warrior will be entrusted to us, so you can imagine how difficult the undertaking is. The choice of chariots, horses and the rest of the ~crew~ is a very important phase of the game, which will influence the unfolding of our races. We will be able to choose horses of all kinds among those that actually exist, between more or less powerful and armored chariots, whimsical and fast riders, warriors of all races and origins. The modalities The game modes available are: Circus, Empire, Tournament and Academy. Despite the somewhat evocative names, we find ourselves in the presence of the traditional modes present in almost all driving games. Circus is the classic fast race that will allow us to run in a single race on a circuit of our choice; Empire is the multiplayer mode that will put you in front of 3 of your friends or a cooperative formula can be chosen that will assign the control of the chariot to a human player and another will be asked to fight against the opponents. Tournament, on the other hand, is the inevitable ~career~ that will allow us to advance through the levels, buy new chariots and weapons simply by winning the races. Finally, in case you want to train before participating in the games, the Academy mode will come to your aid in which you will have to face numerous tests that resemble the Gran Turismo licenses as a structure. Give me the third hand Once we get to the actual game, we realize how many good premises have instead been disregarded. One begins to turn up one's nose due to an inadequate and difficult control system from start to finish. Practice will help to obtain better results but I assure you that it will not be easy to navigate the winding streets of Rome and at the same time defend yourself with weapons from the attacks of your opponents. The left analog stick controls the chariot and the movements of the rider and warrior who can duck to avoid natural obstacles or dodge blows inflicted by enemies. With the right stick, however, it is possible to control the speed of the chariot and, which is not at all fun for animal rights activists, use the whip more or less frequently with the horses to stimulate their racing. The triggers are invaluable as they facilitate the execution of the curves by making the horses perform considerable evolutions, but at this point one wonders if the programmers have realized that Circus Maximus is not a Rally game. The key situation might seem complicated enough at this point were it not that the worst is yet to come. The other keys of the XBox controller are in fact used to fight when joined by other chariots. We will thus find ourselves having to lead our chariot towards the finish line and at the same time facing bloody hand-to-hand battles and I assure you that it will not be easy to do both at the same time. A solution could be to have an additional hand but I doubt that this is feasible in a short time :). The second big problem of Circus Maximus is that it is a game that is not very varied and indeed very repetitive and devoid of any attraction capable of keeping us glued to the joypad for a long time. The races are resolved in monotonous rides that do not present any variation to the theme if not that of the fights, however not very exciting, between chariots. The programmers big mistake may have been to have conperceived the game as if it were a simple racing, without worrying about giving us the illusion of driving a horse-drawn cart and not a Gran Turismo racing car. Have the miracles ended? From a technical point of view, unfortunately the situation does not improve. Although the design of chariots and warriors appears appreciable, the same cannot be said of the settings and of everything when it surrounds the racing. The XBox has very often spoiled and delighted us and that is why a new visual miracle is always expected from every title that arrives on the Microsoft console but unfortunately this is not the case with Circus Maximus which has rather lackluster textures and a number of details frankly disappointing. Precisely for this reason it is not surprising that the game is very fluid and fast. The sound, on the other hand, makes a good impression thanks to the appropriate effects, while the same cannot be said of the music which seems to have been chosen without taking into account the type of game and its historical setting. Horse racing is better From Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars, after months of promising advances, much more was expected. The idea behind the game is certainly good but it could have been exploited with greater originality, perhaps recreating the chariot races with more realism. On balance, the game isn't all that bad but a lot of the fun is drained by a control system that couldn't have been more awkward. Russel Crowe fans and would-be gladiators may still find some appeal, perhaps thanks to the multiplayer mode which slightly improves the fun factor. For everyone else, the advice to save your pennies while waiting for more interesting titles is inevitable. Pros: Good idea Fast Cons: Monotonous Control system to forget Graphics not worthy of XBox Uninspired music Materials: Screenshots Preview Tips Everyone at the Circus! After decades of uninterrupted presence in cinemas, ancient Rome lives on XBox in a game with an ancient flavor but a tremendously modern soul. In the wake of the global success achieved by Ridley Scott with ~Gladiator~, it was foreseeable that the historical Roman trend would also return to consoles and this is how titles such as Ben Hur (PS2) and Circus Maximus appear on the horizon. Precisely thanks to the latter, in recent days I have breathed the atmosphere that was lived in the imperial era on the occasion of gladiator fights. This time however, not the very crowded arenas were chosen as the theater of the fights but the common dirt or cobbled streets that will host the bloody races between horse-drawn chariots. Honestly, we didn't miss a driving game with chariots, however let's find out if this Circus Maximus is able to restore Rome to its former glory or if the latter is destined to be forgotten on the Microsoft console.", "date": "2002-06-26", "grade": null}
