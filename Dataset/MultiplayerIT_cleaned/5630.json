Now this little four-legged hero is back with Mimpi Dreams, a sequel that doesn't dare too much to put his hand to the original formula and that shifts the setting into a dreamlike scenario. Let's see if this move will prove to be sufficient to give vigor to this second chapter. Despite being very short and easy, Mimpi Dreams is a little design gem Help me Mimpi The premises are extremely simple, also because the story of Mimpi Dreams is narrated without the use of text or dialogues, but only by showing the actions performed by the various characters and their strictly non-verbal communications: the bottom line is that the protagonist dog falls into a deep sleep during which he lives five different dreams (which in fact make up the game levels), each characterized by a different setting and some pet in difficulty to save. As mentioned at the beginning, the gameplay does not differ too much from what was already shown by the prequel three years ago, thus confirming a very linear two-dimensional structure, with the player who is called to bring Mimpi to the end of the various stages by solving a whole series of puzzles environments interspersed with very docile platform sections. The basic control system immediately makes it clear that SiliconJelly's intention is to propose - again - a title accessible to practically anyone: there are only three virtual keys that appear in the lower part of the touchscreen, two to move the candid quadruped to the right and left and one to make him jump. It is obviously the design that makes the difference when the components involved are so few, and fortunately that of Mimpi Dreams is undoubtedly of excellent quality: the various puzzles encountered along the way manage to be stimulating, fun to solve and very well differentiated from each other, always in any case maintaining an affordable level of challenge to say the least. Difficult to get stuck for more than a few minutes in front of puzzles that basically require you to interact with certain elements of the scenario through simple taps or swipes on the touch screen, and even if this happens, Mimpi Dreams uses a system of hints that indicate the solution to the problem. In light of all this, it is almost superfluous to state that the SiliconJelly product represents a real walk of health for the more expert users, who would undoubtedly be able to complete the five levels that make up the adventure in a short time, collecting moreover all the bones (the only collectibles in the game) without breaking a sweat. If Mimpi Dreams certainly cannot be blamed for wanting to offer relaxed and not particularly demanding gameplay, certainly the lack of longevity is an evident gap that will hopefully be filled with future updates of the application that add new dreams for the dog to live hero. While it lasts, Mimpi Dreams is in any case a very pleasant mobile game, which combines playful pleasure with a respectable technical sector, above all as regards a delightful graphic: the scenarios are colourful, the characters carefully created and the animations rather varied, and there is no shortage of small touches of class such as the different costumes that can be unlocked and put on by Mimpi.", "date": "2016-03-25", "grade": "S.V."}
