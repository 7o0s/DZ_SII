A very old-fashioned flight simulator, one of those that haven't been used for a lifetime, ready to take advantage of both the latest generation PCs and a decade of innovations in artificial intelligence and data and map analysis. But, even more importantly, a product with these assumptions, historically confined within the reserved confines of a niche inhabited only by the most hardcore players ready to invest hours of play just to study a flight route, would also arrive on consoles. In particular on Microsoft-branded machines, taking advantage of the new generation and the extraordinary work of the Asobo Studio guys. And so here we are, just under a year after the release of the PC edition, again in the midst of a hot summer, ready to return to the skies aboard propeller, turboprop and jet aircraft, with no limitations whatsoever and with the entire globe at our disposal. Only this time there are 11 months of news and additions, to further enrich an already full-bodied package given that the review of Microsoft Flight Simulator for Xbox Series X | S talks about a game that will arrive on consoles perfectly aligned with the PC counterpart . Microsoft Flight Simulator for Xbox Series X|S will in fact be available on the market starting July 27 (at 5 pm here in Italy), obviously within the inevitable Game Pass and also in the 3 digital editions that can be purchased in the traditional way: the standard at 70, the Deluxe at 90 and the Premium Deluxe at 120. The first, the ~normal~ one will be the same one present in the Redmond house subscription, while the other 2 only offer a handful of additional hand-drawn airplanes and airports: 5 and 5 in the Deluxe and 10 and 10 in the Premium Deluxe .Everything else does not change: our planet recreated thanks to the processing of Bing maps and photogrammetry and about 37,000 airports, all existing ones, including commercial, private, airfields and even military runways not covered by secrecy. In short, the definitive airplane simulator, which not only arrives for the first time on consoles, but which is presented in cross platform, cross buy and cross save mode with no limitations whatsoever. That is: you buy it on a platform and you have it in automatic on the others too, progress and saves are shared and, when you decide to play online, you can easily meet players regardless of the platform they are flying on. It was really difficult to ask for something more from Microsoft and Asobo but, as if this were not enough, the release of the console version brings with it a handful of small improvements accompanied by some secondary additions which, at the same time, will also arrive on PC. And it is precisely on these ~news~ that the review of Microsoft Flight Simulator you are reading will focus: in fact, if you want to know every detail about the game and its gameplay, we refer you to the review of the PC version, considering that the game remains the same. In the rest of this article you will find our considerations on the new implementations and, obviously, on the technical and graphic aspects of the conversion for Xbox Series X | S. Redesign and rationalization of menus A multiplayer flight Let's start with the less content but paradoxically more striking news: Microsoft Flight Simulator for Xbox presents an interesting redesign of the navigation menus directly linked to a rationalization of all the usable game options. To be clear: now the tutorials are divided into 4 different types of flight training of increasing difficulty and all that is not the simple free flight starting from the navigation of the terrestrial globe, is enclosed within a general menu Activities which contains, in addition to the tutorials mentioned above, the challenges of landing, naturalistic excursions and discovery flights. The latter is the first, real ~content~ introduction of this conversion which we will talk about in the next paragraph, also explaining the reason for the use of quotation marks, while the other items are old acquaintances of the base game. Let it be clear that we are talking exclusively about a redesign of the menus able to facilitate better navigation of the contents which, basically, remain the same. A similar rationalization work can also be found in the integrated shop which now allows you to use a handful of tags on the fly to skim the free add-ons that can be purchased separately more quickly. A snowy landscape No news on the other handThe front of the options menus which maintain their structure divided between general options, for in-flight assistance and for managing controls. The latter obviously have native support for the Xbox controller which, for the occasion, has been redesigned from scratch with a much more reasoned default assignment of the keys and which takes full advantage of the pad backbones as modifiers to manage camera and advanced flight systems. Among other things, this work on the updated controls can also be found in the first tutorials which, in this way, truly become exceptional aids for playing Microsoft Flight Simulator even if you are completely unaware of flight simulators, slowly becoming familiar with the management of the aircraft and with the main functions of the aircraft. However, the criticism we made in the PC review remains valid: we would have liked to find more advanced guides or tutorials for those who are already experts in the art of flying so as to deepen some more complex aspects such as the autopilot or the correct use of flaps, air brakes and jet throttles in the most complicated flight experiences, but on this front Microsoft and Asobo continue to count on the player's willingness to explore these simulation aspects independently. maybe watching videos on YouTube. Discovery flights Atolls and splendid sea: a dream landscape in Microsoft Flight Simulator The second novelty which is actually more conceptual than content is the discovery flights, one of the 4 items that we will now find in the Activities menu. In concrete terms, it is a handful of preconfigured free flights over particularly well-known or fascinating cities and landscapes. In practice, the player simply selects the scenario, the game already sets the starting point, the weather conditions, the aircraft and after loading we find ourselves flying exactly over the chosen area with the various points of interest highlighted and beautiful music accompaniment in the background. This new version introduces 6 of them (including Naples, New York, Bora Bora, Giza, Rio de Janeiro and Everest) with another ten that we can access once we have downloaded the 5 world updates distributed during the year. Conceptually, they are perfect for showing the graphic marvels and incredible realism of Microsoft Flight Simulator and can represent the immediate step after the tutorials given that all discovery flights are carried out in perfect weather conditions with aircraft that are not particularly complex to manage and with configuration already in flight. There are no objectives or ~victory~ conditions, we simply continue to fly as long as we feel like it with, of course, the possibility of leaving the starting area to continue exploring the neighboring area. The flight attendant A Boeing 747 ready to taxi Even the third unpublished implementation was evidently designed by Asobo with the aim of making Microsoft Flight Simulator even more user friendly and definitely more within the reach of newbies of the genre. In particular of console players. We are talking about the flight assistant: an overlay menu that we can call up while we are on board our plane and which allows us to select a point of interest in the immediate vicinity (within a radius of about twenty km from our location), such as cities, airports, local wildlife and monuments, and enable a handful of supporting visual indications, such as a target to see at a glance where we need to go, or guides to facilitate the taxiing and landing phases, but also enable artificial intelligence to make it pilot the aircraft for us. The computer is also exploited for a handful of further options, less invasive than piloting tout court, such as anti-stall protection, management of radio communications (which in reality was already present also in the base game), a self-compensation to manage the altitude according to the engine power and an additional piloting configuration that enables the automatism only when we use the cursor mode, i.e. we choose to move between menus and instrument commands by untying the analogs from the flight control. Particularly useful to avoid losing the cruising route or altitude if perhaps we have chosen to tinker with the autopilot. Attention because the flight assistant is very different from an autopilot. First of all, it allows you to select only nearby points of interest and, secondly, it does not allow any type of granular or advanced configuration: that is, we will not be able to set height, speed, flight mode or a route by degrees. It is in all respects an aid for those who are beginnersmi to let the computer have the honor of heading towards a certain half. Skis and floats In Microsoft Flight Simulator, you can also land on water Before getting to the central nucleus of our review, the part relating to the analysis of the conversion, we dedicate 2 lines to the last, small introduction linked to the Xbox version, which will also arrive on PC at the same time. We are talking about the additional configuration of the trolley which can now also have floats for landing on water and skis for landing on snowy surfaces. Attention because these are not accessories that we can freely mount on any aircraft model, but they are specific to a handful of aircraft that we will be able to select in our hangar. To go into detail we will be able to use the Cessna 172 by Textron Aviation, both in the basic configuration and in the G1000 one, the Shock Ultra by Zlin Aviation and the X Cub by Cub Crafter. For these 4 planes we will now be able to select the 2 alternative landing gear configurations. Technical aspects and graphics Multiplayer stunts And we come to the crucial part of this Microsoft Flight Simulator review: the analysis and our considerations on the technical aspects and graphics of this conversion for Xbox Series X|S. The game actually runs in 4k and in non-native 1440p but with resolution dynamic on Microsoft's flagship console and the cheapest one, respectively. At a glance, the visual result is simply extraordinary since the game seems to run with very high graphic settings: not comparable to the maximum ones available on PC, but absolutely able to offer an excellent result on large TVs and monitors, especially especially with HDR enabled. On this front it is really impossible to criticize the work done by Asobo who has succeeded in the extremely difficult task of not making a game run on hardware that costs a third of an acceptable gaming PC look bad. The glance remains extraordinary, often shocking, and very often you will really struggle to realize that scenarios and textures rendered by a SoC pass before your eyes and not high-resolution footage of aerial shots. However, there are a handful of reverses of the medal. First of all, the frame rate is locked at 30 FPS, without any kind of possibility for the player to work in any way on the graphics settings or on any rendering modes. Being a simulator, which among other things requires enormous precision when faced with the Xbox joypad, we would not have minded finding a possible Performance mode to reduce resolution or graphics settings in favor of a frame rate close to 60 FPS. We are convinced that Microsoft Flight Simulator would have benefited from it. In Microsoft Flight Simulator it is also possible to meet the local fauna Furthermore, these 30 FPS are anything but solid: during flights between 3000 and 8000 feet, i.e. when the terrain is still very detailed but the visual horizon is wide or in the presence of particularly crowded cities recreated with photogrammetry (London, New York and Paris above all), the title inevitably loses more than a few frames, with small repercussions on the input lag and the precision of the controls. Let it be clear that we are talking about trifles in the face of the visual magnificence of this game, and above all in the face of its stability since in a dozen hours of practically uninterrupted play, it crashed once, but when the graphics settings are blocked, we always expect the best result in terms of rendering speed constancy. Then there are 2 further criticisms, of an absolutely minor entity, that we feel we can raise. The first concerns the loading times which, despite the optimizations implemented in all these months and, in the face of the revolution of SSDs mounted on consoles, continue to be long, sometimes exhausting. Microsoft Flight Simulator requires more than 3 and a half minutes to start from zero and, in some free flight conditions, especially near large urban agglomerations, it may happen that you have to wait up to 45-60 seconds to enter the cockpit. Still too much for our idea of next-gen. The other note concerns the support for additional peripherals. Although the title is completely cross platform between PC and Xbox and can be played with a controller, mouse and keyboard, it does not seem to support most of the accessories on the market. In our case we tried it with 2 different yokes, 2 different throttles and 2 different pedals, all medium-high range and none of the peripherals were recognized by the game.
