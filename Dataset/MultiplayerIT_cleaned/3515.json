{"name": "Final Fantasy VIII Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-viii-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "It's a difficult task to write a review, with little time available, dedicated to a legacy as important as that of Final Fantasy VIII. What over time has proved to be the second most commercially successful of the series, is also the most controversial and debated title. Already in his debut in 1999 he found himself forced to take up the scepter from that Final Fantasy VII which redefined the importance of the genre and which, in recent years, is receiving its remake in episodic form. Despite this, upon its release it received great acclaim, perhaps precisely because of the progress made from a technical point of view and because, conscientiously, it adopted a visual style closer to reality, detaching itself from the past of the series. The writer is part of that generation of Italians who, whether due to age or adaptation to our language, began their experience with the series precisely through the adventure of Squall and his companions. We can therefore hardly fail to appreciate an operation of this type, aware of a series of original problems of the game that make it one of the most ~broken~ Final Fantasy ever released on the market. The story of the Final Fantasy If you are not inhabitants of the Moon you will certainly already be aware of how the Final Fantasy saga works. Forget related stories and direct sequels (even if it happened but let's pretend nothing happened) and welcome anthological seriality. Each main chapter of the series touches on different themes, settings, style, characters and combat system. Sometimes it went well, others less, but overall the series born under the SquareSoft brand has almost always given adventures that have left their mark. The eighth chapter specifically puts us in the shoes of a group of boys, students of the Balamb Garden who, following the achievement of the SeeD diploma, will find themselves in spite of themselves living an adventure that will go far beyond the classic mercenary tasks that their education prepared them to face it. A threat greater than any other looms over the world and Squall, Rinoa, Zell and the other members who will join the group will be called upon to put an end to this confrontation. What still surprises today about the narrative arc of Final Fantasy VIII is its ability to combine the fantastic with politics, education with the yearnings of love. Over the course of the four discs that were needed at the time to get to the end credits, each of us got lost in the maze of an interesting and fascinating world, as well as its protagonists. Imaginative gameplay As we said at the beginning, each Final Fantasy is independent both in terms of the plot and in terms of progression and fights. After having already tried a particular path with the matter of the seventh chapter, in this case things change further. The growth of the characters is simplified who, by acquiring experience, automatically rise up to the maximum level, but the management of skills and spells is significantly complicated. As students of a Garden, our heroes are called to join forces with the so-called Guardian Force (GF), which are nothing more than the classic summons of Final Fantasy. In the organization menu of your party it will therefore be possible to activate the junctions, that is the object of hatred of many. In this Final Fantasy the concept of magic points disappears, as well as the accessories useful for increasing certain specifications. Unlike the past and also the future of the series, with a concept somehow taken up only from the last numbered chapter, the spells are recovered during exploration or assimilated during fights. They do not cost a specific number of magic points but have a consumption based on the amount of magical energy assimilated. Through the junctions with the GF it is possible to increase the parameters of your party members, activate certain skills, as well as choose which ones to make the same equipped creature learn. In fact, these level up exactly like the main characters and also accumulate PA which are useful for unlocking new active and passive skills. The problem exists when you try to delve into an interesting and profound system on paper, but which ends up being cumbersome and irreparably tempting the player towards the path of automation. In fact, one can decide to follow some main parameters according to which the CPU must apply junctions and points in the most suitable way. For all those who prefer the path of stoicism, it will become clear in the more advanced stages that the imbalance of the growth and enhancement system leads to abandoning the use of magic very soonand to make only those GFs focused on support and stat boosting useful. Speaking of what concerns exploration, Final Fantasy VIII does not differ from the stylistic features of the series, divided between detailed areas ranging from villages to towns to end up with dungeons, and the so-called world map, or a scaled version of the world of game through which it is possible to move quickly both on foot and by various means. The Triple Triad, which represents the important mini-game of this iteration, cannot be kept aside either. Compared to the previous chapters, this does not just surround the game but embellishes it with a whole series of elements that can be unlocked by recovering new cards or performing particular actions during matches. Even the monsters you will meet during the game will be possible to capture them and, ideally, transform them into additional cards to add to your deck. Unfortunately, the imbalance that afflicts all production persists here too. Speed everything up Old-school JRPGs aren't exactly the most successful genre today. Probably for this, but also to overcome some limits in the grinding of the original, three different modifiers have been added that can be activated by pressing the analog sticks. These are useful both in exploration and in combat. Uno totally speeds up the action up to three times the standard one, giving a significant boost to speed. A second is used to recover HP, increase strength and make limit break moves constantly active (usually only available when a character reaches a critical life point threshold). The third and last is dedicated to the zeroing of random encounters, a choice that could lead to the joy of all those who, rightly, no longer digest an actually outdated mechanic. Speaking concretely of these additions, the writer is part of those who always appreciate one more choice than one less: specifically, these are also useful for solving some problems that afflicted the game twenty years ago and which are felt even more Today. The PC version then allows you to take advantage of an even greater number of tricks to activate, but certainly less impactful than those also available on consoles. The power of the remastered We arrive at the key element of this re-edition: the technical aspect. We have known for some time that, at least according to the statements of Square Enix, the reason for the delay in the publication of this remastered is due to the loss of the source code of the game. For this reason, the work carried out required a greater commitment than the average of this genre. Unfortunately, the result fluctuates: if on the one hand the models still look watchable after twenty years, the same cannot be said of the backdrops which have obviously remained the pre-rendered and low definition ones of the original. This unfortunately leads to that unpleasant sensation generated by polygonal models placed in an old and not very detailed environment. Nothing that makes it impossible to use, mind you, but it is inevitable to notice it while wandering around the world of Final Fantasy VIII. On the other hand, it is difficult to blame the lack of support at 16:9 and the presence of the lateral, upper and lower bands. Solving this problem would have required redrawing entire seabed areas not foreseen in the original, making the job long and expensive, without prejudice to the existence of tools which, currently, would be able to remedy most of the problems automatically. Fortunately the soundtrack, a masterpiece of the time and of the master Nobuo Uematsu has been brought back in its original version and not the one, far from appreciated, of the first porting to PC. To be fully clear, there are some problems to report, probably due to the impossibility of reviewing the entire code: sometimes, in fact, some songs are revealed in their MIDI version, as well as small bugs here and there making it difficult to use the boosts . What really makes you smile is that, despite this, nothing has prevented the developers from going to retouch some models (like Rinoa's) to decrease the neckline of her dress, almost eliminating what appeared to be a sort of lace petticoat . This is not the only ~censored~ element of the title. Nothing that soothes the enjoyment of the game, but certainly a trend that returns with increasing frequency in the industry and which should avoid going too unnoticed.", "date": "2019-09-03", "grade": "7.5"}
