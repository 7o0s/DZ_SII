{"name": "Shinobi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shinobi-2.html", "text": "Japan under siege how strange The plot of the game is little more than a pretext for the player to enter a battered Japan, reduced to rubble by a catastrophic earthquake. But there is something strange, something that doesn't add up. Where everything leads to natural disaster, a huge golden palace, erected in these serious circumstances, suggests something demonic at the root of the tragedy. If we add to this scenario the advent of a crowded horde of undead ninjas and demons of all sorts, we have a complete picture of the situation; a huge skein to unravel, and to do this you will need superhuman qualities, requirements such as mastery of the sword, speed of action and cold blood that are not in the baggage of all mere mortals. And here is this concentrate of martial arts materialized in Hotsuma, a true incarnation of revenge with which to vent all our latent ninja instincts. It's been a while Shinobi faithfully maintains the same appeal of the previous two-dimensional incarnations, making frenzy and combat the focal points on which to build all the gameplay. The setting is the classic one of the 80s, with the levels divided into areas (1-1, 1-2 and so on) and bosses of all kinds at the end of each section, a choice that will delight every nostalgic. The game concept leaves room for a few alternatives, limiting the player to continue killing everything that comes in front of him; to this is also added the execution speed factor given by Akujiki, the demonic sword of Hotsuma which, once awakened, will feed on the souls of the killed enemies and, in case it is left fasting for too long, on the lifeblood of his master. This, as you can easily guess, is one of the key components of all the gameplay of Shinobi, giving the player little room for reflection and leading him to concentrate excessively on the extermination of enemies, firmly based on a splendid combat system which alone, however, it is not enough to lift the fortunes of the new Sega-branded birth. In fact, Hotsuma will be able to slice enemies thanks to his lightning-fast movements, capable of holograming the silhouette of our glacial ninja for a few seconds, complete with a lock-on to allocate his fatal blows to a single enemy, where the perfect position for killing him with one blow is obviously behind him. The implementation of the Tate is interesting, that is a sort of multiple assassination that will give the most capable players splendid sequences in real time, showing with them the dismemberment of the enemies and the post-combat rites of the protagonist. The areas to be addressed, of an almost disarming linearity, are not exactly a hymn to interaction and variety, also taking into account the impossibility of backtracking, given by the systematic closure of the sections left behind. Unfortunately, the sense of repetitiveness is already felt after a few game sessions and, in addition to this, a decidedly high difficulty must be added combined with a questionable save system. Therefore, it will often happen that you will be faced with the Game Over writing, having to restart the level from the beginning every time in perfect coin-eating coin-op style. 3D vs 2D Technically, the Overworks title stands at medium levels, essentially exploiting the Sony hardware to give the experience all the speed and fluidity required for a game of this kind, without however placing particular accents. In the total absence of dynamic shadows, distinguished by the classic sticker at the feet of the characters, and proposing repetitive textures in a rather sparse background, Shinobi gives its best in the design of Hotsuma, decidedly inspired in his role as a pseudo-cursed and gifted ninja both a good number of polygons and textures definitely above the standard of the game. Even the animations of the protagonist are good, enjoying a large group of moves and movements entirely attributable to the ninja practice. The small group of enemies to face is decidedly less good which, despite the fact that the screen is always populated with fierce and numerous hordes, sees, even in this circumstance, a substantial absence of variety, always proposing the usual two types of opponents per level. The soundtrack is also in perfect retro style, which offers background music that seems to come from the cabinet of the first episode of the game, giving a very special Japanese atmosphere. In addition to this, the dubbing entirely in Italian of a good standard certainly needs a mention, which guarantees, to those not accustomed to the Anglo-Saxon language, a total immersion in the, albeit limited, plot. Comment So Sega firedand yet another cartridge re-presenting one of its many old glories, updated to 128bit. Without infamy and without praise Shinobi is proposed covered from head to toe with a polygonal engine all in all in the norm, but the game inevitably sins, given the setting that has its roots in the structure of past two-dimensional episodes, for the variety of situations to be faced , limiting itself to being a dodge-hit-dodge with little depth and not entirely adequate by today's standards. Unfortunately, the addition of a dimension does not evolve a game concept that has now been lying in mothballs for years, and this is why the title is recommended almost exclusively to only avid fans of the saga or to lovers of pure action without many frills. To all the others we recommend trying the game and deciding later on a possible purchase. Pros: Fast and intuitive combat system. Impeccable Pal conversion. Totally in Italian. It's Shinobi... Cons: ...remained as it was in the 2d versions. Frustrating and repetitive. Understated graphic design. The history of Sega, harmoniously characterized by ups and downs of all kinds, could easily be the basis for any Latin American soap opera, finding its epicenter in recent years, characterized by financial collapses, ~marriage~ proposals left and right , and consoles prematurely abandoned to their gloomy fate. The last in order of appearance was the Dreamcast which, still today, is present in the memories of the very loyal Sega-fans as a miracle of electronic engineering and which, still today, boasts in its line-up some of the best exponents by genre on the market. Among these big names, Skies of Arcadia certainly finds a prominent place, an authentic purebred Rpg with a lot of pedigree, developed by one of the many internal sections of Sega, Overworks, which for their debut on the black monolith Sony have resurrected an old glory of the line-up that distinguished Sega in the 80s: Shinobi. It was back in 1987 when this game was playing in arcades all over the world, when 200 lire were enough to play a good game and, why not, also to complete it. Times have changed radically in the world of video games, but this Shinobi has every intention of reopening a large window for a nice breath of fresh air with a retro flavour.", "date": "2003-05-26", "grade": null}
