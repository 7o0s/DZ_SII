However, the formula behind the game remains very fascinating, as demonstrated by RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch, which succeeds in consolidating the experience on touch devices (for the moment only iOS) after a few ~test~ episodes that had certainly not done cry out for a miracle. But let's proceed in order. Our task in this simulation is to manage an amusement park, trying to make it grow both in terms of square footage and attractions in order to exponentially increase the number of visitors and, consequently, the revenues produced. As repeatedly demonstrated, the touch interface proves to be almost perfect for this kind of application, allowing you to select objects, buildings and icons on the fly, as well as possibly modifying the structure of the roller coaster to make it more fun and capable of attracting a large greater than people. After a ride on the roller coaster, perhaps our visitors will want to bite into a nice sandwich... or go quickly to the toilet. In both cases we will have to be able to respond to their needs. RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch undoubtedly stands as the best mobile reduction in the series Bio Park The first stages of the game with RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch are, as usual, deputies to the tutorial, with a character who takes us by the hand indicating the functionality of the interface, the categories of available buildings and the upgrade system of each single attraction, which works through a solution very similar to that seen in the blockbuster Clash Royale, that is through the collection of cards which, collected in a certain quantity, allow you to upgrade and therefore be able to build a greater number of those specific objects. Obviously, gold coins will also be needed to complete the work, and here the proverbial donkey falls: after a few hours, one realizes that the freemium approach of Atari production is anything but accommodating, and once the money runs out, we will have to of things, wait a few hours for the coffers of our attractions to have raised the amount necessary to be able to construct further buildings and therefore continue with the creation and refinement of the park. Beyond this small, big limitation, however, it must be said that the developers have done an excellent job in making the interface coherent and accessible, as well as in inserting a long list of achievements that give a strong sense of progression to the experience. also rewarding us with the release of coins and cards. Managing the position of the attractions, making the roller coaster route more exciting, placing public toilets and restaurants in strategic points and paying attention to the needs of visitors, explained through specific icons, proves to be a fun and stimulating pastime, albeit rather heavy from the point of technical point of view: despite the use of an iPhone 7, the game appears very heavy and you are forced to close the applications in the background or restart the terminal for the controls to acquire the reactivity necessary to offer fluid gameplay without uncertainties.", "date": "2017-03-01", "grade": "8.0"}
