For all those who like to combine management phases, interplanetary trade and diplomatic relations with dogfighting among the asteroid belts, the Egosoft saga has always represented the only possible point of reference and, above all, the only genre brand alive today again. Although each new release has been accompanied by a considerable load of inaccuracies and bugs, over time, and with patches, the development team has always proved capable of smoothing the corners and making the vast space epics enjoyable. With X Rebirth, the German software house had promised a true rebirth of the saga, accompanied by updates for the most obsolete mechanics, a finally exhaustive tutorial, and in general an emphasized accessibility. Some longtime fans, already at the announcement, had raised an eyebrow (after all, part of the beauty of X has always been represented by its hermetic nature), but many have looked at this new release with confidence, also because of an absence from the shelves that dates back to 2008, the year X3: Terran Conflict was released, followed by the Albion Prelude expansion in 2012. A mix of desire and nostalgia, that of the fans, which unfortunately has to collide with a really harsh reality. We are not given to know what happened during the long development of Rebirth, but two things are certain. The first is that the game is far from complete, the second is that, this time, patches will hardly be enough to fix the situation. In the space... The problems of X Rebirth already begin during the very first stages of approaching the game. Our experience has seen us restarting the client several times just to access the first game, and, despite several days and two small patches (about 10 MB each) elapsed from the start of the tests to writing this review, no tangible improvement has it is clear. Even before diving into the tutorial, it is good to choose the way in which the game will be controlled, and although the latter places particular emphasis on the use of a pad, this solution proved to be unsuitable for the experience. Our tests with an Xbox 360 gamepad have indeed given us various problems, not so much in the navigation phases, but in the exploration of the menus, which, due to the bad design and poor optimization, are unfortunately even more complicated to use with a gamepad, and putting the device down every time to manage even basic functions has not proved to be a happy choice. We have therefore adapted to the use of keyboard and mouse, which, on the other hand, have proved to be poorly optimized for dogfighting. The tutorial proposed by Egosoft accompanies the player in discovering the salient points of the gameplay of X Rebirth, which, as per tradition for the saga, is divided equally between free exploration, combat, trade and managerial aspects, including management of one's fleet and eventual construction of a space base. The first difference to catch the eye compared to the previous chapters is the impossibility of driving the other ships of your fleet, to which you will have to limit yourself to giving orders. In fact, X Rebirth grants control of only one ship, the Skunk, for the duration of the adventure, with no possibility of sitting in another cockpit. Although the ship is customizable in several of its performance aspects, remaining tied to it for the entire duration of the game still represents a limitation, further accentuated by the fact that managing your fleet remotely, rather than piloting it in the first person, is a very inconvenient operation. Although the visuals from space suggest a very accurate simulation, a more in-depth analysis shows several weaknesses, right from the tutorial. The space bases, very rich in details from the outside, instead leave much to be desired once inside, both from a graphic point of view and from that of the gameplay, which is reduced to opening lockers to steal objects of little value (with a predilection for spacesuits), getting lost in the anonymous corridors in search of this or that character and completing a very trivial mini-game to get discounts on goods. If that weren't enough, a short tour of the galaxy will be enough to see how base assets have been reused endlessly, in stark contrast to the variety of exterior designs. Adding to this a poor job on character modeling and facial animations, it can be concluded that, in X Rebirth, whatever happensga outside the spaceship was done in the worst possible way. Despite some good ideas behind it, X Rebirth is a failure across the board ...no one can hear you scream... Although, compared to the aseptic visual proposed by the previous chapters, the view from the cockpit of the Skunk is actually very immersive, it is inexplicably accompanied by some shortcomings in terms of game design. As X fans are well aware, the gameplay of the saga involves a lot of time spent in the game menus, since the combat and space exploration phases correspond to at least as many hours spent trading and establishing relationships with the various systems. Unfortunately, this very important phase of the game was managed in a very clumsy way, replacing the more comfortable full-screen menus with virtual screens inserted in the ship's cockpit, which are not only uncomfortable due to their limited size, but also not very reactive and poorly designed, to the point of making most of the game operations impractical, some so tortuous as to force the player to waste time memorizing the internal paths. All this is accompanied by a really poor rendering of the ship's interior (which, we recall, is the only one that can be controlled throughout the main mode), which are limited to the command bridge and a single room behind it, completely devoid of of interactive elements. Even a simple operation such as the exploration of the galactic map, in X Rebirth can turn into a nightmare, thanks to the bizarre system proposed by Egosoft, which sees the main sectors connected by what we could define as ~space highways~. Once you have accessed these tunnels, to obtain maximum acceleration it will be necessary to queue up with other spaceships, taking advantage of their wake. It is not only a conceptually embarrassing idea, but also a badly made minigame. The situation does not improve when, having set aside diplomacy, we move on to combat, regulated by artificial intelligence mechanics and routines that leave a lot to be desired, with an ease of most of the clashes that is really excessive. Even the cockpit view soon reveals gross shortcomings, such as the inexplicable absence of a radar, which forces you to constantly keep an eye on the edges of the screen to follow enemy ships and points marked on the map. Perhaps, in Egosoft's vision, the co-pilot Yisha should have made the navigation phases more entertaining, but, given the endlessly repeated lines of dialogue and the dated animations, the result is unfortunately tragicomic, if not annoying. As for fleet control, which is essential for effective progress, the latter is regulated by uninspired mechanics. The impossibility of controlling the ships directly collides both with the inconvenience of the menus and with the need to personally recruit different lieutenants for each vessel and bring them personally from the space base to the assigned ship, before this is self-sufficient and capable to go on a mission. Although the officers are characterized by scores divided by various statistics, this does not seem to reflect sensibly on the gameplay and in general the mechanics related to fleet management are uncomfortable and tending to an infinite repetition of the same operations. ...of anger From a graphic point of view, X Rebirth alternates a good rendering of space exploration, although in any case far from today's graphic standards on PC, with an incredibly dated realization for everything concerning the interiors of the space bases, which however cover a certainly no secondary role in the gameplay. In the latter area, everything from polygonal modeling to animations seems to come directly from a production of ten or more years ago, with no possibility of recovery. All this is decidedly at odds with the visuals from space, full of details and convincing effetistica, especially in the case of large-scale clashes between large ships. Too bad that, in this case, the lack of optimization spoils the good performance, which at the moment does not allow you to exceed 30 frames per second regardless of the hardware supplied, with frequent and dramatic drops. Very annoying bugs, which sometimes don't allow even simple operations to be completed, and frequent crashes close the circle, confirming, in case there was any need, that X Rebirth was released in a version closer to alpha than to beta. The audio sector does not reserve better surprises, with generally dated effects and an English dubbing (accompanied by Italian subtitles) of stampo clearly amateur.", "date": "2013-12-02", "grade": "3.0"}
