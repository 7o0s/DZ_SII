The competitive multiplayer experience that Capcom has promised to Village owners should have arrived in conjunction with the last chapter of the series, but for one reason or another the launch has been postponed: not a good sign for such a project , who could have taken advantage of the excellent debut of the game to build a solid user base. It took practically a year and a half for this competitive spin-off to finally be ready, made available on digital stores taking advantage of the release of the Gold Edition and Winters' Expansion. Well, was it worth the wait? The synthetic answer is a dry no, but we are ready to explain everything to you in the Resident Evil Re:Verse review. Structure: is that all? Resident Evil Re:Verse, Leon roams the map with his shotgun in hand Generally when a game is postponed it is because the developers believe it is not yet ready for launch, both in technical terms and in terms of content. Therefore, some time is gained in order to introduce something else into the package, enriching it to arrive at the appointment with the public in the best possible shape. Just what didn't happen with Resident Evil Re:Verse, which comes with a single mode and two maps. Accessible via matchmaking or in private rooms with passwords, the classic deathmatch of the Capcom spin-off is open to participation of six players, who find themselves battling within two possible scenarios: the Raccoon City Police Department and Villa Baker. Unfortunately in both cases these are extremely simplified locations in terms of design compared to the originals, with no vertical development and frankly a bit sketchy. Six characters available: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Leon S. Kennedy, Claire Redfield, Ada Wong and Hunk. Each of them is equipped with different equipment and special skills that distinguish them on the battlefield, with some fighters who are immediately more effective than others (see for example Chris), highlighting some balancing problems. Then there are the Creatures, which we will transform into when we are knocked down and which change based on the number of viral capsules collected up to that moment: from the pathetic obese Micromorph to Hunter y and Jack Baker, finally arriving at Nemesis and the Super Tyrant: true and own unstoppable monsters, with which we will be able to inflict a lot of damage before the next respawn. Gameplay: few acute notes, a lot of approximation Resident Evil Re:Verse, two Jack Bakers fighting The only mode available in Resident Evil Re:Verse, as mentioned, is an all-against-all for six players in which whoever scores the most points from eliminations wins. We will be able to choose our human character and possibly equip him with upgrades that can be unlocked through the currency that is obtained at the end of each game, then jump into the action and try to kill the other users according to rather traditional mechanics, even if the fire is inhibited as long as the aim is not activated. The variation on the theme, which is really interesting, concerns the transformation of Humans into Creatures when they are knocked down: after having assumed the form of a mutant, we will be able to continue wandering around the map and attacking other players in an attempt to scrape together a few more points before the final knockdown that leads to respawn. To add a minimum of thickness to these mechanics we will find extra ammunition, seedlings for restoring health and special disposable weapons. Resident Evil Re:Verse, Chris shoots a Nemesis from a distance Unfortunately in terms of gunplay we found Re: Verse really inconsistent and approximate, unable to render impacts well and therefore inevitably slippery both in firefights (also due to not exactly perfect hitboxes) and in melee attacks. The control system, however, has by default an excessive sensitivity of the sticks which makes it difficult to aim well and which needs to be adjusted. Around this simplistic system we find an unexpected frame of microtransactions and an equally unexpected Premium Pass for the obtaining extra rewards, mostly of a cosmetic nature even if, as mentioned, there are some upgrades for the characters that can make the difference during the game. Technical realization: dated and uninspired Resident Evil Re:Verse, our character transformed into a monster roams the Villa Baker map Resident Evil Re:Verse uses the polygonal models of the various characters from the Capcom saga, albeit in a version that is in many ways simplified and devoid of effects capable of addingnge thickness to the visual compartment. Thanks to the frankly ugly animations, the final result appears dated and uninspired, beyond the fact that the game is actually only available in the old-gen versions and must be played in backwards compatibility on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The scenarios do not improve in any way the general feeling of being faced with a modest and very unambitious production, and the sound is limited to being functional, accompanying the action with discreet effects and a few shouts when you manage to score a finisher . During our tests we finally came across more than once in a collapse of the host complete with early termination of the match due to peer-to-peer online.", "date": "2022-11-05", "grade": "5.0"}
