Rather emblematic of Kinect's path could be that of FRU, which started as a very promising demo on the potential of playful applications of the Xbox One camera and then completely disappeared from the radar for two years, devoid of any updates and communication from the team and Microsoft itself , until suddenly arriving at its release this summer. A launch out of time, when Kinect has now become a kind of ghost of the recent past and a symbol of the renegade choices of the first Xbox One, scrapped by Microsoft's new technologically progressive vision on its console. Ironically, FRU is probably the absolute best expression of the use of Kinect in the videogame field: a game with a conceptually simple design but studied to the millimeter, perfectly designed around the peripheral yet also fun and challenging like a real old-fashioned platform school. As happens in very rare cases, the basic ~gimmick~ of the peripheral is present here but becomes a fundamental element of a gameplay that is in any case studied and structured through rigorous game design, bending to playful dynamics without being intrusive. FRU finally arrives on the market after years of waiting and teaches everyone how to make video games with Kinect A long journey As we said, FRU took a really long time to arrive on the market, considering that it had already made itself known in 2014 as a particularly promising title, but the developers cannot be accused of wasting time. Even simply looking at the three builds that appeared in public, starting from the first prototype built in 48 hours during the Game Jam, passing through the intermediate version of GDC 2014 and arriving up to the final build, one notices a remarkable structural evolution of the game, which from one simple ingenious idea has been building and evolving as a real puzzle platform from solid scaffolding. On the other hand, it's certainly not Through Games' fault if Kinect met a bad end and wasting the potential glimpsed in the first appearances with hasty processing would have been a huge sin. If anything, it could be pointed out that communication about the game has been practically absent for too long, but this is an aspect that probably has little to do with the small indie team, falling more on Microsoft's shoulders than perhaps it didn't expect to have. in the maze of ID@Xbox, a pearl capable of ennobling the gaming Kinect for once. Among the creators of FRU we must also mention the presence of Mattia Traverso, a young Italian developer who recently joined the ranks of Ovosonico, who has already made himself known previously for the fascinating One and One Story and contributed to building the game as lead designer and once again demonstrating skills to keep an eye on, also considering his age. The game is all gameplay but the extra period spent in development helped shape it into a more orthodox video game form, with an elementary but fascinating story able to support the strange and magical atmosphere that characterizes the scenarios and the masked protagonist, who it reveals itself as a broken fairy tale for the four worlds that make up the itinerary. Also noteworthy is the evolution made by the graphic sector which, while remaining extremely simple, all set on a classic 2D old-school platformer, has become much more refined and full of details and atmosphere in the final version. The perfect detection of collisions and contacts between the sprite and the elements of the scenario also becomes an indispensable support for the correct functioning of the whole game mechanism. Inside the game, between two worlds FRU works like a classic puzzle game, in which we simply have to reach the exit of the levels formed by fixed screens and grouped in four worlds with different settings and characteristics. Each screen has a different and complementary configuration existing in a sort of ~parallel dimension~ which is revealed throughor the silhouette of the player identified by Kinect and transposed in real time on the screen. The portion of the level that is covered by our figure is therefore different from the standard one and the joint between the two worlds must be used in various ways to reach the exit unharmed. This system requires you to assume different poses in front of the screen, in order to reveal new elements of the scenario, in a constant and fluid transition between the two dimensions that takes place in real time, thus reacting immediately to the different dispositions of the body. The result is a strange and unprecedented coordination between the player's movements and those of the character, who at the same time is guided directly through the Xbox One controller, so freedom of movement is absolute. To allow maximum mobility of the body, the developers have thought of an excellent control system that uses only any analog for moving and any trigger for jumping, which allows you to hold the controllers with one hand, right or left whether it is, while we experience the most absurd positions in an attempt to bring up the right portion of the screen, the specific hidden platform or cancel an obstacle that prevents us from continuing, just to give some examples. Obviously this mechanic also requires a certain physical effort in some cases, and the body dispositions that you will find yourself experimenting with will not fail to make you laugh like crazy in front of the TV. Xbox One goals Also due to its brevity, FRU contains only 16 unlockable objectives, four of which are linked to the conclusions of the chapters and the others to particular performances to be performed during the game or in the individual levels, such as making certain moves, assuming particular positions, avoiding certain solutions and more. Apart from some particularly demanding requests, the hunt for basic achievements is quite within reach. The Kinect revolution It's difficult to accurately convey the genius of the mechanism with a simple description in words, especially since its implementation is supported by a truly masterful level design that must be experienced firsthand. It is not simply a question of placing oneself precisely in pre-set positions, limiting oneself to finding a single path towards the exit but an impressive freedom of choice often emerges in the solutions to be adopted to conclude the scheme and possibly collect the collectibles hidden in some of these. In short, FRU is not a game that takes place alone or with a passive involvement of the player, on the contrary it requires a creative disposition and the need to think rather outside the box, offering puzzles that are easy to read but not trivial to solve, with different possibilities of tackle the levels and a bizarre, unprecedented synergy between the two-dimensional movements of the character on the screen and those of the player in real three-dimensional space, with the two entities somehow and surprisingly finding themselves interacting and moving simultaneously to reach the finish line . With a solution similar to Braid (a title with which FRU certainly shares something, also as regards the narrative style adopted) each chapter introduces a new fundamental mechanic that significantly varies the gameplay. In the first we find ourselves gaining confidence with the system of dimensions, above all by making platforms, walls and obstacles appear and disappear based on the disposition of the body, in the second chapter the silhouette reveals an aquatic world that allows the protagonist to remain suspended by swimming in the fluid , where, however, dangers abound and so on. The problem, in fact, lies precisely in the scarcity of these variants. Four chapters are undoubtedly few and the game ends in a handful of hours leaving a great desire for other levels and further alternative mechanics and this is the major (and perhaps only) flaw of FRU: a blaze of gameplay that lasts too little and it does not offer many possibilities to go back to it, once all the collectibles have been collected and even the single additional bonus mode has been discovered.", "date": "2016-07-12", "grade": "8.8"}
