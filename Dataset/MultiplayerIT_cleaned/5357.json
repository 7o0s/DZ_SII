{"name": "Piccolo grande Re", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/172215-little-kings-story-piccolo-grande-re.html", "text": "Little King's Story was certainly one of the great successes of a few years ago on consoles, in terms of real-time strategy and management. Initially released on Nintendo Wii, where it won enthusiastic reviews, and then re-proposed in a new guise without much luck on PlayStation Vita once it was orphaned of its original authors, the product finally arrives on PC as well. However, Little King's Story for personal computers is the port of the Wii version, with high definition graphics, support for various European languages including Italian, and all the freshness, despite the years, of a fun and satisfying game system where the progressive exploration of the areas and the strengthening of one's possibilities are the fulcrum of the adventure and expertly dosed elements. The excellent Little King's Story finally arrives on PC with some small but interesting news A King and his subjects Little King's Story tells the story of little Corobo, a shy and awkward boy who discovers a magical crown that has the power to transform anyone who wears it into a king. Thanks to it, the little one therefore finds himself suddenly having to lead his people in daily and military activities up to the conquest of the world. But the rise will not be easy since the gamer begins his story from a shed, flanked by three advisers and a handful of rather lazy inhabitants who are not inclined to work. It is therefore necessary to roll up your sleeves right away and start a series of expandable activities as you continue in the adventure and which then lead to expanding your kingdom in terms of buildings, inhabitants and so on. The concept of progression is the beating heart of the mechanics that move Little King's Story. Each phase of the adventure is marked by a clock that marks the hours from morning to evening: Corobo therefore begins each day by getting up and gathering a certain number of citizens to lead them to explore a portion of the scenario to collect supplies, basic necessities, treasures and free the area from the presence of menacing creatures as much as possible. The gamer directly controls the little King, through which, however, he can basically attribute orders to his subjects by selecting them with a special key (on the keyboard or on the pad) and subsequently directing them towards the goal. These can be, depending on the case, a piece of land to clear, a point to build a house, a cliff to build a bridge, or a group of enemies to attack. In this sense, it is obviously necessary to select the most suitable team for the action based on their characteristics, including carpenters, farmers, soldiers, and so on. Note of demerit to the fact that the game lacks the ability to use the mouse (serious flaw in a similar title) and that the controls via the keyboard have been badly optimized. In this sense, they are not always very comfortable to use, especially as regards those actions that require diagonal movements, to the point of pushing the user to opt for the use of the pad, if possible. Be that as it may, returning to the game, when it starts to get dark, the group returns home and there essentially settles the accounts on the ~profits~ of the day that has just passed. Then you spend the money raised to expand your kingdom with new infrastructure or to upgrade existing ones. Not only an aesthetic factor, given that building new houses can also mean an increase in the population of one's kingdom, with all the advantages of the case, as well as developing new shops allows to train subjects towards new professions initially missing or carried out by a single individual, such as archer, woodcutter, cook, hunter and so on for a total of about twenty specializations. A sovereign at 360 degrees It is thanks to the ~unlocking~ of new professions that the gamer can progress further, given that thanks to them it is possible to overcome areas previously blocked precisely by the lack of units trained for a certain task, such as perhaps eliminating heavy boulders that were blocking a passage. This sort of daily routine, which is not such as the desire to explore new locations, to discover hidden areas or the satisfaction of seeing one's realm grow are elements that constitute a good motivational push to move forward for the player, is broken from original and amusing fights with bosses or cutscenes that highlight events of particular importance, such as the street parties organized right after having eliminated monsters and keepers who guard certain areas, which from that moment on, once freed, become part of the borders of the realm. Notthen moments of daily life are missing, to underline a certain depth of play that may not appear at first glance, and which instead are not only there but further embellish the production. Weddings to celebrate in church, celebrations for a birth or a birthday, but also the pain for the loss of some faithful subject to pay for the funeral. In fact, each member of the community has a name, a life of his own and feelings that can lead to love for another member of the community, sympathy or hatred for the King himself, and so on. Almost real ~people~, to whom the player ends up becoming attached. To make the game even more enjoyable there is a technical sector that is perhaps not exceptional, given that after all it is a porting from the Nintendo Wii, but certainly fascinating and pleasant, above all thanks to an original visual style that returns particularly ~ fairytale~. However, it should be highlighted that the graphics have in any case done a good job (nothing shocking, mind you!), implementing a new series of textures with the resolution set at 1080p which improve the overall view of the scenarios, taken at bird's eye view, and the polygonal models of the characters, further enhancing an already valid character design. The animations, then, are varied and pleasant to look at, despite in passing from the possible setting from 30 to 60 frames per second, even if by default the game advises against using this last option, you may witness some sporadic glitches or a brief moments where the picture clicks slightly, but nothing really annoying or continuous. Similarly, an improved lighting system restores brighter colors and a good play of shadows to the eye. All this is accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack composed of a series of excellent reworkings in a fairytale key of famous classical music pieces, arranged and skilfully mixed together with original pieces, and capable of properly underlining every moment of the story. In the same way, the audio effects and the babbling of the characters are very successful, with their funny and incomprehensible language.", "date": "2016-08-09", "grade": "8.0"}
