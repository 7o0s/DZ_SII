{"name": "Persian Wars - Microids chiama Aladino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/persian-wars-microids-chiama-aladino.html", "text": "A sea of sand at the four horizons atmosphere please! Persian Wars is inserted in a fascinating but little exploited videogame setting (only Prince of Persia and Magic Carpet come to mind...), or the Arabian one of ~The Thousand and One Nights~: flying carpets, magic lamps and bottled genes will be then your daily bread. By the way, your very original name is Sindbad and you are nothing more than a humble desert nomad who hopes one day to found his own tribe, defeat his enemies and come into possession of the mythical King Solomon's Ring, thanks to which possession as the absolute and unchallenged ruler of the entire universe. At the beginning of the first campaign you will find yourself alone and abandoned in the middle of the desert, without food or water and your first task will be to gain the trust of the chief of the neighboring tribe, marry his daughter and become the new boss as soon as the old will kick the bucket. To carry out so many and such good intentions you will have to successfully complete the first missions, which also represent the tutorial of the game itself: once you are in charge of your men, you will by now have mastered the art of combat and command, without forgetting the basics of magic. It will then depend on your skill if you will be able to move forward in the, I must say, well thought out plot of the game. I won't anticipate anything, but know that it represents the main element of interest of this title, since based on the choices you make, the story will actually evolve in a completely original way. Do you think that you will also have the opportunity to betray your own tribe and ally with rival ones, rather than with the wicked Amazons or even become a lord of the Ghuls, treacherous undead that infest the desert... The usual heated soup? The first approach with the game left me dumbfounded for a moment: more than a trivial real-time strategy Persian Wars appears as a bizarre combination of different genres. We could define it as an RTS with a certain ~role~ component, which I will go into further later. So let's start with the strategic elements: first of all, the classic map exploration phases (no fog of war), building construction and troop production are completely absent, since both will have to be purchased at the beginning of each mission thanks to previously earned credits. And in this regard, I must admit that the variety and quantity of units mark a point in favor of this game: by purchasing new structures you will have access to an infinite number of possible variants, ranging from the Bedouin on foot to the armored camel with a firearm, passing through trained lions, snake-men, giants and so on, not to mention all the possible upgrades and the possibility of forging alliances with genies and other supernatural creatures! Unfortunately for us, however, all that glitters is not gold. The maps are all quite small, and the absence of the classic ~fog~ allows you to immediately know exactly what to do and how; consequently some missions are reduced to a kind of puzzle-game consisting in the elementary operation of duping the enemy's very scarce artificial intelligence to reach the objectives (wells, mines, villages, etc.). Alternatively, if the aim is to destroy all opponents, a little more military tactics will emerge, if one can speak of tactics. In fact, in terms of strategy, Persian Wars is rather primitive, thanks (in addition to the already mentioned artificial intelligence of the troops) to a rather limited control system which allows you to order only trivial movements in a straight line and frontal attacks that have very little strategic (no assignments to individual units, no advanced commands, no waypoints, nothing at all). The only two ~innovations~ (if we really want to call them that way) are the ability to block the game with the simple push of a button and to still be able to navigate the map and issue orders that the troops will execute once the game is restarted. In short, a bit like what happened in Baldur's Gate. The second element is the tactical map, or a sort of geographical map that is displayed before each mission, on which cities, settlements, oases and so on are represented: based on our movements, we will decide which mission to face. It is interesting to note how our position, like that of our enemies, are marked by special flags, and each of our movements will correspond to one from them. If by chance we were to meet halfway between one goal and another, it will be clear affroam the battlefield in a scenario created randomly for the occasion. Not bad right? Well I could say that this is the most purely strategic part of PW, since as I said, in the real game things are much less exciting. Just think that the interaction with the scenarios is close to zero, the buildings are simple decorative frills and the only strategically determining element of the game maps are the usual raised surfaces such as canyons and hills. In short, it is certainly not thanks to warlike Confucian tactics that you will be able to finish this title, given that through the assiduous application of the most classic of schemes (the suicide attack a la Command & Conquer) I concluded the first of the two campaigns in just four days My name is Sindbad, lord of the Dunes and master of hosts Let's now move on to the RPG aspect, the second soul of this game: Sindbad's character is to all intents and purposes your ~avatar~, who over time will be able to accumulate experience, increasing his level of vital energy, mana, the ability to cast spells and the beating coefficient; unfortunately there is no skill system or any other element capable of deepening the characterization of the character and in general of deepening the ~role~ component, which remains a note of color, but nothing more. Sindbad is reduced to an enhanced version of the common infantry units, with the considerable disadvantage that if unfortunately he were to pass away on the battlefield, inevitably you will have to reload the last saved game. And I assure you that this is quite frustrating, firstly because it is possible to save only at the end of the missions (which fortunately are very short), but above all because in the most agitated phases it is almost impossible to identify our Lilliputian character in the middle to the crowd, and since to give him orders it is necessary to select him in advance like any ordinary unit, you can easily imagine the difficulties I encountered in keeping him away from the most dangerous melees. Fortunately, it is possible to assign a combination of function keys to groups of units, in order to recall them without too much effort, but this is a feature already present starting from the old C&C. Graphics and sound: those who are satisfied enjoy For what it has to offer, PW could easily run on a laptop: the 2D graphics are very reminiscent of Blizzard's strategic ones, with big and well-defined as well as well-animated sprites. Even the light effects of the spells available to Sindbad are effectively realized, without leaving you speechless. In general, therefore, the graphics factor is satisfactory, were it not for the incessant monotony of the scenarios (but on the other hand we are in the desert ...). On the sound front, the matter becomes more complicated: the background music is nothing more than tremendously repetitive oriental tunes, but fortunately they have the advantage of being so insignificant as to make you forget their presence within a few minutes... The sound effects, on the other hand, earn the sufficiency, especially as regards the voices of the characters, who rightly speak in Arabic: can you imagine the Bedouin who snaps to attention shouting ~YES SIR~?. Conclusions Summing up, despite the good ideas, an engaging plot and overall pleasant graphics, Persian Wars ends up being a bit too approximate in its attempt to reconcile different genres and while being quite funny, it certainly cannot be defined as a race game. In any case, I wouldn't recommend it to RTS savvy (it's too easy), nor to role-playing game fanatics, just as I consider it unsuitable for those who want to approach one of the two genres for the first time, as it would end up misconception of both. Rather it could prove to be an excellent ~thought harp~, something to play in moments of pause, given the brevity of the missions and the undemanding gameplay for the neurons. But be careful, for this very reason you could get tired of it soon! Here it is finally on our screens the highly anticipated Persian Wars, a title that certainly needs no introduction. How do you say, you've never heard of it? Um, I wanted to see if you were paying attention But I'm sure that the name Microids will remind you of some great works like Amerzone and Empire of the Ants. But soon let's take a thorough look at this strategic, indeed, rather anomalous one.", "date": "2001-06-08", "grade": null}
