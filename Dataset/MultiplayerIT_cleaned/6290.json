{"name": "La macchina del tempo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/150772-the-silent-age-la-macchina-del-tempo.html", "text": "We are in the USA of the fabulous 70s, among flared trousers, improbable hairstyles, funk music and men's shirts invariably opened to reveal a hairy chest. Joe, our protagonist, practically the archetype of the average man, a face framed by a mustache and large sideburns, works as a janitor at a large company, but one day his normal routine is disrupted by some events outside the ordinary. After finding traces of blood around, in one of the laboratory rooms he runs into a mortally wounded man, who gives him a mysterious device and asks him to help him save the world. When the security officers arrive on site, the scene appears unmistakable and Joe is taken to the police station, where two officers grapple with the traditional script of the good cop and the bad cop. The interrogation ends abruptly, however, when Joe tries to explain where he got the electronic device and inadvertently activates it: the room changes radically, as does the scenario around it, and the station turns into a building that has been abandoned for who knows how many years , inhabited only by creepy skeletons. The dying man's words were true: the device is a miniature time machine and Joe's will really be a mission to save the world. The Silent Age is an adventure with an engaging story, full of atmosphere and minimalist style Matter of style The Silent Age made its debut at the end of 2012 on iOS and Android devices, standing out for the quality of a narrative full of atmosphere, supported by an extremely convincing and engaging storyline, from which it would actually not be difficult to make a film. And maybe someone will think about it now that the game has also arrived on Steam, with a complete edition that includes both episodes (originally the second was available as an in-app purchase) and a technical section remastered for the occasion, with high-definition graphics that best value that mix of minimalist style, inspiration and art of getting by that led the developers of the small Danish team House on Fire to obtain visually interesting and coherent solutions, albeit limited in terms of animation. The game makes use of nuances, stylized characters, flat colors and combinations that are never risky, and the final result is not only pleasant but also denotes a certain personality. Among the novelties of the PC version we also find the dialogues in English, created thanks to a cast of professional actors who have done a slap-up job, giving further facets to figures that we were used to seeing speaking with purely textual messages, on the screen of our smartphone or tablets. The package also includes an achievement system that adds a pinch of replayability to the experience, perhaps prompting us to complete certain chapters again in search of secrets, hidden objects and alternative situations. From mobile to PC On the other hand, the game structure has remained unchanged, which is that of the classic ~point and click~ adventures, with ten discretely linear chapters in their puzzles and the important element represented by the time machine, which allows you to pass in an instant from that present from the 70s we talked about to a post-apocalyptic future, in which humanity seems to have become extinct due to a pandemic, and therefore to interact with locations in many different ways. If in a scenario we find a locked door, for example, projecting ourselves into the future could put us in front of the same torn and accessible door, with all that it entails. Or a solid steel grate, which doesn't bend using pliers, could turn into rusty, malleable scrap metal as we move forward in time. Or the remains of a corpse could provide us with clues on how to deal with certain situations in the present. The alternation soon becomes a fundamental tool for collecting objects that may prove useful in one of the two timelines in which we move, and everything takes on a sense of great naturalness in a few minutes, to lead us to the end of the story, with all its twists and turns and moments of reflection, in the space of about three hours. Duration is clearly one of the limits of The Silent Age, which was born as a mobile production and was therefore designed around the needs of a different user, in an area where a certain type of direction would have proved too slow and tedious, where instead on PC it would have been appropriate to take a few more breaks, dilate the pace to bet even moremore decided on an atmosphere that the excellent soundtrack, despite its essentiality, always manages to keep high. However, it is clear that the new edition is aimed at those who have not yet had to deal with Joe's temporal enigmas, and find themselves approaching this experience for the first time, with a never excessive degree of challenge and a coherence of fund that prevents you from getting lost or stuck in long downtimes, also thanks to a subdivision into ~watertight compartments~ that places a large limit on backtracking. The control system, which rests solely on the mouse, is simple and immediate, perfectly suited to the mechanisms of the game.", "date": "2015-06-02", "grade": "8.0"}
