{"name": "Objects in Space", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/objects-in-space-recensione.html", "text": "Objects in Space, the ambitious space sandbox of the prolific Flat Earth Games, is the particular protagonist of a review that talks about intergalactic travel, but has to deal with a game setting inspired almost entirely by the world of submarines. The result is a peculiar experience, a Julesvernian sandbox with a markedly vintage aftertaste that sees us in command of a ship full of panels and mechanical noises, a vessel that cannot be controlled with a stick and that does not allow us to observe the outer space, but by carrying out complex and slow maneuvers in narrow spaces, in the light of a screen that indicates in an approximate way what is in the surrounding space. A factor on the one hand is inevitable, given the modesty of a game engine that takes us back several generations, and on the other strongly desired as the fulcrum of a title, which arrived at version 1.0 a year after the debut of Early Access, which look at the video games of the past, when the three dimensions were still in their infancy. Space submarines and dangerous noises Objects in Space is vintage both in graphic design and in substance, structured in single rooms with a fixed shot ranging from the claustrophobic environments of spaceships, on which we can also find a relaxation area if the dimensions of the vehicle allow it, up to the large space station halls that offer us the opportunity to obtain information, exchange goods, buy resources, repair components and purchase increasingly advanced ships, modules of various types, including armaments, which allow us to customize the ship to the core. And it is here that the Flat Earth Games title rejoins the canons of space simulators, also offering us a conspicuous narrative dimension, albeit fragmented into small stories that we can either follow or completely neglect, aiming exclusively to enrich ourselves thanks to missions, smuggling, get battling, passenger transport and whatnot. In short, the whole package for a title that doesn't allow us to observe the outside of the ship, but doesn't let us miss a universe full of pilots, pirates, precious minerals, nebulae, torpedoes, countermeasures and the possibility of communicating. Yet, although the structure is the classic one of the genre, the submarine-inspired gameplay changes the cards on the table and substantially alters the experience. Whatever path we decide to take, we must in fact follow it through the complex panels of the ship, taking into account the energy consumption and even the noise level emitted by the modules, so as not to attract too much attention in full submarine style. In this case, finding ourselves in a vacuum of space, the problem should not exist, but the poetic license adds depth to a gameplay that is also staid in the fights, transforming each maneuver into a strategic challenge to be enjoyed very calmly. But if the slowness of the experience, excluding the fights, is a common element in many space sandboxes, the submarine simulator mechanics can displace those who are used to flying around space and are faced with a complex control system, a system made up of screens dedicated to communications, text commands to consult files, systems to be repaired manually and modules of all kinds, some of which are fundamental even if only to be able to maneuver the ship. Part of the complexity is only apparent and depends in part on a drastic lack of information that contributes to the player's confusion. Over time, the gaps in the tutorial are compensated for by experience and by meeting pilots who, by revealing new information to us, make the experience more and more smooth, without losing the unpleasant sensation of being confined to a contraption. space, lost in a dirty and hostile universe of those who have marked the great masterpieces of cinematic science fiction. A particular experience still in evolution It all begins with the classic mission gone bad that projects us into a largely unexplored space, initially tied to a run-down ship but with the possibility of exchanging it to start our climb to success. However, this becomes possible only after buying that RCS module whose lack forced us to ask for help, while we were adrift in space, paying a hefty sum to return to the starting space base. And it is here that, impoverished by the few finances in our possession and without the possibility of reloading given the automatic saving on a single slot, we were forced to ask for a loan in order to finally be able to equip the ship fully, finally ready to leave butintimidated by the modest rewards attached to the most accessible job offers. Here we are again faced with mechanics that do everything to slow us down, but running the risk of making some activities so unattractive as to compromise the overall balance. On the other hand, however, smuggling including stealth modules to reduce the noise emitted by the ship, exploration at the edge of known space and the satisfaction one feels in achieving some objectives, even practical as in the case of installing a jump drive or a sun sail, two factors that drastically increase independence and freedom of movement, literally changing gears to the experience. On the other hand, the technical tenor of a title that exploits the vintage imagery to compensate for a modest graphics sector does not evolve. But the design work dedicated to the well-differentiated interiors of the numerous ships, to the panels, to the emergency lights, to the advertisements and to the details stands out and enters into synergy with the important sound sector which includes some excellent quality ambient tracks from play with the ship's player. And all this is more than enough to bring the developers' vision to life, a unique journey inside a claustrophobic vessel launched in an immense space. And it's a constantly evolving journey that has been strengthened first with as many as 17 scenarios and with fundamental elements such as key mapping, and then, with the arrival of version 1.0, with the opening to modding, with the substantial enrichment of narrative dimension and with the addition of 4 player LAN support, hopefully a starter to online multiplayer, sadly so far only mentioned as a possibility for the future of Objects in Space; which we hope will include first of all some other refinements to the code and the interface, still crude both in game and in the options, as well as an improvement in the balancing, with some missions that are really not very sensible, sometimes offering earnings lower than the costs of docking a a station. Furthermore, there is a lack of some more interaction with the surrounding space, even if only in the form of a few mini-games to pass the time on the ship or a simple coffee dispenser that would guarantee greater credibility and completeness to the experience, without altering its dynamics. Nonetheless Objects in Space is certainly not lacking in appeal, it has potential in quantity, a commensurate price and with the opening of modding it could take surprising directions.", "date": "2019-03-16", "grade": "7.5"}
