The influence of Everybody's Golf (also available in portable contexts, in this case PSP) in the genesis of Let's Golf! 2 appears clear, but the game shows its own personality right from the start and avoids marrying the cause of extreme arcades, while offering an experience that in no way pretends to reflect reality. The French house has repeatedly shown that it is really good at taking ~minor~ sports and designing a structure around them capable of focusing on both immediacy and depth, and this latest effort is no exception with eight characters, four modalities, six scenarios and a large number of variations on the theme. From the start screen it is possible to choose whether to play alone or access the multiplayer mode, which works ~locally~ (via bluetooth or Wi-Fi) or online through the excellent Gameloft Live service, which allows you to easily manage the list friends and possibly to chat. The multiplayer experience is really good, with very fast matchmaking, almost no lag problems and immediate feedback for our score in the world leaderboard. Although of great value, online is not the strong point of Let's Golf! 2 and indeed ends up being just an interesting extra in front of the numbers of single-player modes: ~quick game~, ~career~, ~challenge~ and ~single holes~. The first and last modes are ideal if we're short on time and want to play a few holes quickly, while the ~challenge~ mode allows us to hone our skills within four categories of increasing difficulty: ~ aim for the star~, in which you have to hit the stars present within the scenario within a time limit; ~difficult birdie~, in which we have to make a birdie in increasingly more complicated conditions; ~long putt~, with low shots towards the hole from ever greater distances; ~ball bunker~, in which we have to go into the hole starting from the sand. A career golfer It is clearly the ~career~ mode that constitutes the fulcrum of the Gameloft title, thanks to the now tested ~rewards~ system which, depending on the results (in terms of medals obtained) allows us to unlock new characters, new objects with which to modify their appearance (hairstyles, clothes, clubs, balls), new scenarios and new missions. There are five locations, but not all of them are available immediately; just as within them you cannot immediately access all the challenges. In terms of variety, the developers have done an extraordinary job: the Germany stage takes up the spectacular panoramas of the Bavarian castles (initially you play in the Schwangau valley, at the foot of Neuschwanstein castle), with wide open spaces that favor a obstacle-free play; in Mexico instead we find a series of Aztec pyramids that make our shots more complicated and sometimes force us to ~go back~ in order to place a swing to climb over; the desert scenario of Kenya does not disdain the mountain peaks between one hole and another, and therefore sees us throw the ball from one top to another before reaching the hole; in Greece you play on islands suspended in the air overlooking the sea, with the obligation to perfectly dose the power of your shots so as not to end up out of bounds; finally, Greenland hosts our matches between ice and snow, in a difficult atmospheric context. The eight available characters each have a unique ability that ~charges~ as we obtain results and allows us to enjoy an extra advantage for a single shot: greater power, the absence of wind, an ideal surface for ball, etc. The control system of Let's Golf! 2 is based entirely on the touch screen and works excellently, also thanks to a really well organized interface. Our character is in the classic starting position and by touching the screen left and right we can change the aim of the shot. At the top right we find an image of the path, which with a touch allows us to manage the arrival point of the ball as we wish, which by default is placed in the best area but which does not always take into account the roughness of the terrain, and which so sometimes we need to change. Another way to have control of your shots is to change the club used, since each one has a different ~range~ and provides for more or less arched trajectories. Also in this case the game suggests the best solution by default, however it must be said that the controls relating to the change of the club do not react well to the touch and make the operation long and macbent over. Balls in the hole When we're ready to swing, just tap the ball icon in the lower right to fire a power gauge, tap it again to lock it, and do it a third time to determine shot accuracy. If we have been precise, the ball will shoot off in a trail of fire (literally) and will reach the desired area with a more or less marked lateral push depending on the strength and direction of the wind. To make a last-minute correction, we can act on the rotation of the ball while it is still in flight, producing for example a soft landing, or by forcing the ball to move slightly sideways after touching the ground. When we're close enough to the hole, it automatically switches to putt and the view shows us a grid representing the ground conditions, with a projection of the ball's trajectory. In all cases, these are really simple mechanics, which do not require particular tutorials to be learned and which prove to be fun and engaging from the first game. Furthermore, the presence of numerous different types of ~mission~ (stroke race, timed strokes, elimination, near the pin, hole race, etc.), succeeds in making the experience varied and never repetitive. The technical realization is excellent, in particular as regards the frame rate (which drops very rarely) and the attention to detail that characterize the various scenarios. The game is therefore very fluid, with bright and lively colors and a series of spectacular visual effects. The polygonal models of the characters, designed in full Japanese style, have a decent set of animations, even if sometimes their movements appear too wooden (see the celebrations). The musical accompaniment is nice but not essential, luckily you can replace it with a personalized playlist.
