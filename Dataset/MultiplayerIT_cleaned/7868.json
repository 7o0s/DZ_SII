To survive the shrapnel that penetrated his chest, he develops a reactor that keeps them away from his heart and acts as an almost inexhaustible energy source, allowing him to power a high-tech armor with which he intends to fight criminals like those who have almost killed. We have seen these events narrated in the first ~Iron Man~ film, in a fairly faithful reworking of the comic book origins of the Marvel character, and the film represented a successful film debut for the House of Ideas, shortly before being purchased by the Disney giant . A sequel set aside below expectations, here is ~Iron Man 3~ in these days. Could a tie-in for iOS and Android made by Gameloft have been missing? Exactly, it could not be missing, but the nature of the game ended up surprising everyone a bit. After the sandbox-based action game dedicated to Spider-Man, in fact, the French company has decided to make Iron Man 3 The Official Game as an endless run that can be downloaded for free. Let's make one thing clear right away: unlike the controversial Dungeon Hunter 4, in this case the experience can be enjoyed without necessarily having to spend any money, as long as you settle for a couple of armors rather than unlocking all eighteen of them (which would cost like , ahem, eighty euros if you want to do it right away). The ~hard~ currency, the classic diamonds, are in fact given very sparingly while the release of experience points and ~arc reactors~ (the ~simple~ currency) appears more generous, albeit within the limits of freemium productions. The problem is therefore not the presence of IAPs nor their ~aggressiveness~, but rather the basic concept with respect to what were instead the legitimate expectations of Iron Man fans. Iron fist Whether endless run is, therefore, but of quality or not? Let's start from the end, or from the technical sector, because from this point of view Iron Man 3 The Official Game does very well and sweeps away any direct competitor. The developers have done an excellent job in reproducing the armor, represented on the screen by very detailed polygonal models and enriched with interesting reflection effects, and in the same way the large scenario is of great impact, very detailed and full of static objects or in movement. The downside is the heaviness of the whole, which causes drops in frame-rate on more than one occasion which fortunately don't directly affect gameplay. Things are less good on the gameplay front, firstly because a rather vague choice has been made regarding the movement of the character on the screen, which does not follow the traditional three lanes but rather can move freely to avoid obstacles in its path. Thanks to an insufficiently precise control system, both in the tilt variant and in the touch variant, this unfortunately translates into unwanted collisions and, therefore, in a loss of vital energy that appears ~unfair~ compared to an otherwise impeccable conduct. We then wanted to make things even more complex by inserting enemies, who must be tackled by touching their figure on the touch screen or by drawing lines to activate a persistent ray. Apart from the fact that the checks also in this sense are not punctual, the situation that arises is inevitably one of great confusion. Luck, if we want to call it that, is that each game doesn't last that long due to a too hasty approach to the genre, in full Temple Run style, with excessive acceleration of the action in a limited amount of time and therefore l 'impossibility to go beyond a certain distance if not taking advantage of large barrels of cu... um, strokes of luck.", "date": "2013-04-29", "grade": "6.4"}
