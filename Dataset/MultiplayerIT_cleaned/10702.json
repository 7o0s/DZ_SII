{"name": "The Sims 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/oh-no-uno-scarafaggio-nellinsalata.html", "text": "Five years after the previous chapter and nine from the original one, the Sims are back on our screens with all their load of neuroses, ambitions, social relationships and careers to follow. But what can still be innovated in a genre that seemed to have said it all by now? All together in Peyton Place Yet he succeeds. Proposing the same, usual formula, apparently hackneyed The Sims 3 manages to generate the unusual alchemy capable of fascinating us, of gluing us to the screen and forcing us to experiment with new possibilities in the life of our simmers. We all know, by now, a saga that since its now distant debut in 2000 has presented itself on our monitors with dozens of expansions, variations and possibilities. The modder community indulged endlessly, creating entire catalogs of objects, clothes and physical traits to download and add to the game's library, while not exhausted, as well as generating a wealth of addons that allowed new interactions and some changes to the appearance of the game. The ~nude-patch~ was famous, which removed the censorship on the sexual traits of the Simmini. Yet, despite the fact that EA's famous life simulator has been exploited so much, it incredibly manages not to taste old. One of the best arrows to his bow is certainly the introduction of the almost total integration of our virtual alter egos in the town in which they live. Indeed, today we can reach all the community places from the city map and our life is no longer limited to our home: we can visit the art gallery, the municipal swimming pool, the stadium, the gym and a series of other community lots in which we can carry out the appropriate activities and interact with the other Sims present. Then there are the premises, where we can go to carry out specific activities or missions that are entrusted to us. For example, we can attend painting courses, go shopping at the supermarket, have a beauty treatment done in the beauty centre. And of course work, even part time. Or visit neighbors' homes and hang out with them. In short, all the environments that make up the town to which it belongs can be freely visited, in every corner, both on foot and with the means available. This time we can own bicycles and cars, with which to move around at will. This is one of the real great novelties of the third chapter of The Sims: no longer an instanced world with limited possibilities of visiting external locations but a truly unique interactable environment in which to truly feel part of a community. It is up to us to choose which opportunities to exploit and what kind of social integration we wish to have. A superego expressed in pixels But while the extension to a city reality is one of the most important updates of the Sims 3, it is not the heart. Which is instead represented by our characters, the simmers who, similarly to the tale of Pinocchio, try to rise from their status as a pile of pixels and claim a soul. Albeit simulated. And how much the latter is a mirror of ours, our ambitions, our desires or even the result of an impulse of rebellion, sublimation or simply freedom from conventions is completely up to us. The variety of character customization options has essentially remained the usual one we knew, albeit enriched by more possibilities and combinations. Simmer creation ages have been expanded, but only from ~young adult~ onwards can independent households be created. Numerous new customization sectors have been added, both for the features of the face and for the textures of clothes and accessories and not even too virtually, the possibilities for creating unique individuals become almost infinite. However, the most important customization options remain those relating to personality traits, for a maximum of five. The possibilities range from ~bookworm~ to ~kleptomaniac~, from ~hopeless romantic~ to ~computer whiz~ and so on. The choice of the five main traits that will define the character of our Simmini also opens up possible lifelong wishes which are essentially the goals in the working career that the Sim will want to reach in order to be realized as a virtual ~person~. A sim with artistic traits could become a musician, or a painter. One with technical prowess a great hacker, and so on. And the mechanism remains the usual one we are used to: carrying on the life of our characters in the way we see fit, between social relationships to maintain, careers to follow, houses to furnish, skills to level up. A series of minor novelties make thel all much more dynamic. Among other things, we can now choose how to deal with daily activities: work, which takes us up several hours of the day, will now have the possibility of seeing us choose different ways of dealing with it, whether it is by idling or undertaking parallel activities, or by discussing with colleagues and so on. Different choices will affect our needs in different ways. Working hard will tire you out more than lounging around, while chatting with co-workers will raise your relationship bar plus generate new acquaintances and friendships. And speaking of the latter: compared to previous titles it is no longer essential to go crazy behind social relationships. We can decide to be loners or party animals, without this frustrating our style of play and the possibility of achieving our goals. The possibilities for interacting with the other Sims are also much more numerous and varied and everything, in general, really reaches a higher level of simulation than what has been seen so far. Our Sims seem more and more ~alive~, although this may leave the most skeptical perplexed. Of course, the risk of alienation is around the corner, but the experience that comes closest to a real ~God game~ is undoubtedly full of profound and irresistible charm. In the name of optimisation Technically the game is impeccable, fluid and easily manageable both through keyboard choices and through simple mouse clicks. The graphic sector is quite clean, the characters are extremely more detailed thanks to the many customization options and, in general, the whole game world appears more and more realistic and detailed. The audio sector reaches the same level of cleanliness and variety, making the atmospheres enjoyable thanks to the good level of sound effects and background music choices. One of the few defects that we have instead found in The Sims 3 is perhaps the passage of time which, although perfected, would perhaps still need some improvements. If in the previous titles time was running out, in fact, above all because of the careers that became essential and in fact took away the entire day from the Sim who then, without energy, returned home and had little space to cultivate other interests or relationships. this time there are several solutions to improve life. First of all, services such as babysitters to keep the children allow us to get away and not have to constantly stay close to the needs of the children. Secondly, the possibilities for customizing the way you spend your time at work allow you to manage energy, sociability, entertainment and even learning, effectively streamlining the tasks to be performed in your free time. The ability to skip three days of work without running into problems also helps from this point of view. What remains the real sore point is rest: once the energy bar is exhausted, recovering it is an all too slow process, even on beds with maximum rest capacity. And all we have to do is wait for the bar to fill up again, perhaps taking the opportunity to remind us to look out the windows of our real homes. Finally, the presence of an online support including the possibility of downloading elements of all kinds, for a fee, plus the free objects made available by the community exchange service and an entire town to be downloaded free of charge for all registered users make the truly endless gaming experience.", "date": "2009-06-11", "grade": "9.1"}
