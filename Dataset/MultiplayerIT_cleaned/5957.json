This category includes Warhammer 40,000: Deathwatch - Enhanced Edition which features a team made up of the best Space Marines around, intent on maintaining control of a sector by facing hordes of Tyranid creatures in a series of claustrophobic maps. As the title clearly indicates, we are dealing with the enhanced PC version of a title that has already been released in a mobile version: this means that we can forget about a particularly complex game. But before letting ourselves go to lapidary judgments, it is good to take a closer look at the work of Rodeo Games. Warhammer 40,000: Deathwatch has arrived on PC in an enhanced version Wait-and-see policy The most obvious change concerns the graphics which are not radically transformed but still take a clear step forward thanks to the Unreal Engine 4, the dynamic lights and the addition of numerous effects. However, we are talking about a technically modest title but the Space Marine models are not bad and the overall performance is solid and rather pleasant in its simplicity. Finally, the interface adapted to the mouse works quite well, even if we must say that the subdivision of the team customization menus is not particularly intuitive. But let's move on to what really interests us, the mechanics whose mobile genesis is evident: rotating the character doesn't cost action points, there are no shooting positions, ammunition is infinite and there is no cover system. The obstacles, in essence, limit themselves to blocking the view, preventing us from seeing the enemies who sometimes wait passively for us to pass while in some missions they attack in waves, emerging from pools, crevices and hatches. Suddenly we can find several pairs of claws within walking distance that can create problems even for the most armored of the Space Marines and the only real weapon, in these cases, is the overwatch that allows our soldiers, placed in a defensive position, to fire automatically when the enemy enters the controlled area. This preponderance of the one defense skill combined with the predictability of enemies narrows the range of possible situations and slows down the pace of the game, but limited as this setting is, it makes sense in combination with specially designed maps. Sure, a little more complexity in terms of mechanics wouldn't have hurt but we find this, at least in part, in the evolution of the Space Marines. Initially the gameplay is rather flat but things are destined to quickly become more complex as the characters acquire talents and skills, or by earning points in the resistance, aim or critical characteristics. Among other things, there are incredibly powerful perks that reset the cost of overwatch and others that allow you to shoot all enemies, greatly increasing the potential of a Space Marine. The arsenal is also quite large and includes insignia, devices capable of increasing the critical of the entire team, grenades of all kinds and large cannons with powerful loaded shots. Initially, only the main weapon slot can be manipulated, but three additional slots can be unlocked for each Space Marine by spending experience points. The equipment therefore comes to greatly influence the gameplay and the skills it guarantees, not surprisingly limited by often full-bodied cooldowns, can make the difference in the midst of a swarm of genestealers. In the service of the Emperor There are two ways to get new pieces of equipment. The first is to hope for good loot during missions. The second is to accumulate requisition points that allow you to open packs of cards, and in the packs you can also find some Space Marines, perhaps graduated and therefore equipped with better characteristics and a higher growth margin. Among other things, the novelties of this improved edition also include the Space Marines of the Dark Angels, Imperial Fists and Black Templar chapters which increase the possibilities for customizing the team. In fact, each type uses different weapons, spends a different amount of action points to shoot or enter overwatch and has different possibilities to wear specific pieces of equipment. Furthermore, each order has its own philosophy that finds a place in the simple Deathwatch. Plot and objectives of the missions are the most linear imaginable, almost mere prand texts, but the Space Marines converse, giving rise to not always calm exchanges of opinion which give the characters a pinch of depth, a limited but still important depth to involve us like the spot-on, albeit repetitive musical accompaniment. On the other hand, as in any game of the genre, it is almost inevitable to become attached to one's soldiers and the good news, at least for some, is that this time we don't have the burden of facing permanent death. When a Space Marine leaves the pens but the mission is successful, here he is back on track even if this does not mean that he has lost nothing. In fact, failure costs him all the experience points not yet spent which can be quite a lot when we are saving them to acquire particularly expensive slots or skills. Therefore, there is no lack of incentive to keep all the characters alive, which is not very simple when large enemies enter the field, even if we are still faced with a less punitive solution than that adopted by other titles of the genre . But the choice is absolutely congruous with the structure of a product that certainly doesn't aim at purists but at the less demanding mobile public, and this is precisely the problem. We are in fact talking about a PC port which, among other things, costs several euros more than the mobile version and does not even bring us multiplayer. The developers have promised to implement it with lots of four-player modes and asynchronous battles, but at the moment the experience is limited to the campaign which, if nothing else, is pretty long. The missions are forty, there are two levels of difficulty to unlock and there is even the adaptation of the texts in Italian.", "date": "2015-10-20", "grade": "6.5"}
