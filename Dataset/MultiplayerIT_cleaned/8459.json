When the presenter of the ceremony mentions the name of the first, however, all hell breaks loose and the Joker and several other criminals burst onto the scene, intending to clean out the pockets of the rich participants in the event. Wayne manages to slip away, wears the bat-suit and together with the inseparable Robin sets off in pursuit of the villains, finally handing them over to the police. Gotham's troubles aren't over, though; indeed, they are only at the beginning: struck by the Joker's spirit of initiative, Lex Luthor decides to free him from prison together with his ~colleagues~, to launch together an offensive aimed at annihilating not only Batman, but also Superman and the various members of the Justice League. This is the incipit of LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, the second episode of a series born in 2008 and created by the usual TT Games, a team specialized in the LEGO franchise. There are two most important novelties of this product: the first concerns the cutscenes, which for the first time see the various characters utter a word instead of basing their interaction solely on gestures. This factor is enriched by the excellent dubbing in English, even if for a title aimed at a very young target it would have been appropriate to invest in a complete localization in Italian, rather than just for the subtitles. The second novelty is represented by the possibility of exploring Gotham City in a sandbox context, aboard the various bat-vehicles, to access secondary missions of various kinds. Let's say right away that unfortunately this feature, in fact the most important in terms of renewal of the series, is not present in the portable versions of the game, which therefore refer to the classic structure: small-sized scenarios, fights, simple environmental puzzles and then on, towards the next challenge. The 3D effect Fans of the three-dimensional effect will inevitably be disappointed by LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, as the game uses this peculiar ability of the Nintendo 3DS in a bland way, giving thickness to the interface but without ever giving three-dimensionality a leading role. More of the same On balance, in short, the Nintendo 3DS version of LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes stands as a classic sequel, a ~more of the same~ that re-proposes the structure and gameplay of the first episode without introducing substantial innovations, as instead happens on the home console. This absolutely does not mean that the experience is evil, on the contrary, exploring the limited scenarios in search of objects to be used to build devices and exploiting the various powers of the characters to activate them remains a fun and carefree practice; a nice pastime especially for younger gamers, given the almost total lack of challenge due to the elimination of the ~game over~ concept. It must also be said that on 3DS the fights with the various super-villains and their henchmen represent something more than a mere parenthesis, because it is necessary to score a few combos to tick it whereas on PS3, Xbox 360, PC and Wii a single punch to knock out any ~average~ opponent. Again, however, the infinite respawns end up making all this very relative: you fight, grab enemies and maybe even dodge a few blows, but if it goes wrong, the character will reappear on the stage as if nothing had happened . Batman and Robin have a greater number of costumes and, therefore, skills: ranging from the ability to absorb and transfer electric shocks to that of hiding from security systems and looking through certain surfaces, passing through the costume that gives the Knight I obscure super strength and ability to shoot grenades. The Boy Wonder is no different: with his acrobat suit he can reach otherwise inaccessible places and close himself in a plexiglass sphere useful for activating some devices, or he can adhere to metal surfaces using magnets, or even collect and spray liquids of various kinds . To this generous mix of abilities are added those of the other heroes: from Superman, invincible and capable of doing practically anything, to the very fast Flash, from Wonder Woman to Martian Manhunter, passing through Green Lantern and so on. In short, there are variations on the theme, while remaining within the confines of the structure that we know well, and guarantee a minimum of freshness to the product, otherwise not at all attractive compared to those who already have experience with LEGO games. Little to say about the technical sector, which in the absence of the sandbox-style setting and vehicles is expressed through a classic style, without infamy or praise. Splendid insteadthe sound, thanks to the soundtrack signed by Danny Elfman (with the participation of John Williams when we fly with Superman) and the excellent dubbing, even if only in English.", "date": "2012-07-04", "grade": "6.9"}
