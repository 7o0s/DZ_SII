{"name": "Roba da ninja", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99815-ninja-gaiden-sigma-plus-roba-da-ninja.html", "text": "A veritable manifesto of hardcore gaming applied to the action genre, Ninja Gaiden is not so much the son of the platform released in 1988 on the NES, as much as the coin-op that arrived in theaters the same year (remember that? The one with the legendary maneuver of the ~wheel~ with consequent launch of the opponent), much more challenging and multifaceted in its scrolling fighting game mechanics. The protagonist of the series is the ninja Ryu Hayabusa, also cleared through customs in the Dead or Alive franchise, descendant of a clan that is both blessed and cursed as the repository of powerful and terrible knowledge, as well as guardian of a dark sword that no one, it seems, can wield without that his spirit is irreparably corrupted. At the beginning of Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, Ryu enters the formidable Murai's fortress in order to start a training period, but he doesn't even have time to acclimatize (ok, after having sliced a few dozen opponents anyway) that beautiful Ayane (also part of the cast of DoA) warns him that her village has been set on fire by a mysterious group of ninjas, who have managed to steal the Dark Dragon Blade. The ninja runs back home and finds the place completely devastated, in flames, among which stands Doku, an apparently invincible opponent. The defeat comes on time, but Ryu can't give up and so, having recovered from his wounds, he sets off in pursuit of the ninja who stole the sword. His adventure will take place over the course of nineteen chapters, gradually more challenging, in which we will also find ourselves controlling the beautiful Rachel, a blonde warrior who wants to take revenge on Doku for having placed a curse on her family. If you've played Ninja Gaiden Sigma on PlayStation 3, let's make it clear right away, you know exactly what we're talking about and you also know what to expect from this new version of the game for PlayStation Vita, which accompanies the launch of the Sony console basically because a re-release is always handy. but it doesn't add much to the starting product or solve problems that time hasn't helped to make less annoying, far from it. The ultimate fighting game? Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus cannot boast the facets of any ~technical~ fighting game as far as fighting is concerned, but the philosophy on which it is based is still very current and boasts an unexpected depth, especially for those used to the average of current action games in third person. PSone owners may remember a title called Bushido Blade and whose protagonists, samurai armed with swords, could kill each other with a single successful blow, resolving the duel in a second or prolonging it for long minutes full of tension. In the game developed by Team Ninja such extreme peaks are not reached, however there is a big difference between a blow that tears the flesh and one that instead goes empty, with the vital energy bar that empties with surprising speed if our approach to battle is careless. A rule that applies in particular to boss fights, really ruthless in certain situations and in which it is essential to memorize the opponent's movement and attack pattern in order to be able to respond effectively and avoid defeat. The control system on PlayStation Vita is very similar to that seen in Ninja Gaiden Sigma for PlayStation 3: the analog sticks allow us to move the character and manage the view, which is centered by pressing the right backbone. The left backbone is used instead to parry, but it is a maneuver that does not guarantee our safety at all and that the enemies can break with a combo, leaving us at the mercy of their blades. The watchword is therefore ~timing~, both to dodge an assault at the last second and to carry out a powerful counterattack at the precise instant in which a hostile katana comes into contact with ours. Once the opponent's guard has been penetrated, the possibilities are wasted, with combinations that vary according to the weapon in our possession (single sword, double sword, nunchaku, the powerful Lunar mace, the war hammer and so on, to form an arsenal undoubtedly rich) and allow us to eliminate enemies even with just a couple of taps. The problem is that we will never find ourselves facing a single ninja, on the contrary we will always be clearly outnumbered and therefore we will have to carefully evaluate the strategy to use, because the maneuvers must always be completed and it is not possible to switch to the block in the middle of a combos. Playstation 3 trophies Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus allows us to conquer a total of fifty-one trophies. Many of them revolve around eliminating a certain numberI was of enemies, generally a thousand with each weapon, or the use of particular techniques against a hundred opponents. Completing individual chapters also results in obtaining a trophy. Cross and delight We said that Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus is practically unchanged compared to the PlayStation 3 version released five years ago, and in terms of content the statement is certainly true: same levels, same weapons, same characters (with a few more unlock, indeed) and, here too, the presence of a mission mode (in this case more substantial) that allows us to test ourselves with a series of sometimes really difficult challenges. The gameplay, extremely difficult but at the same time extremely fascinating and engaging due to its degree of challenge, does not go very well with the ~portable~ philosophy of PlayStation Vita as the save points are anything but close to each other (but in this if you put the console on stand-by and amen), ergo the experience should preferably be lived at home rather than in the typical ~handheld~ situations (and in any case it's never nice to swear in public, let's face it). The use of the peculiar capabilities in terms of input is not exciting, but there is: by touching the screen we can switch to first person view at any time, move our gaze by moving the console (thanks to the integrated gyroscope) and simply hit enemies touching its shape. This is a nice but far from practical feature, considering that the sensitivity of the touch screen means that the first person view is often activated by mistake, but above all that our potential targets will never stand still waiting to be hit and indeed they will be the first to target us, which will make it at least difficult to hit them without losing some energy. Fortunately, it is possible to deactivate this possibility from the options, while the use of the rear touch pad to ~load~ the ninpo (the ~ninja magic~ that Ryu Hayabusa can cast) cannot be deactivated, whereas on PS3 it was necessary to shake the Dual Shock like gods crazy people. Speaking of options, unfortunately the audio in English cannot be replaced with the original in Japanese (bad!), while the developers have seen fit (no, bad!) to implement the now infamous ~hero mode~, the lowest difficulty level that is activated if we ~abandon the way of the ninja~ after three game overs (pay attention, eh) and which gives our ninpo character infinite and even automatic dodges when he is about to die. If you want to play Ninja Gaiden like this, mind you, you'll miss out on all of its beauty. Finally we come to the technical sector, which unfortunately represents the biggest disappointment of this otherwise very faithful conversion. Beyond the polygonal models and scenarios, now evidently outdated in terms of detail and polygonal count (we're talking about a 2004 product, although the PlayStation Vita screen makes everything look beautiful...), although the animations can still have their say , Team Ninja has inexplicably cut the frame rate in half, going from the traditional 60 fps that have always characterized the series to 30 frames per second. Very solid, for heaven's sake, but problematic precisely because of the discussions on the ~timing~ of the fights made previously, and moreover inexplicable considering the general cosmetics of the title, far from demanding for the Sony handheld hardware. Final words for camera management: Terrible. This is one of the ~historical~ problems of Ninja Gaiden Sigma and it is therefore absurd that nothing has been done to fix it, also because in certain situations it takes on tragicomic connotations, with the camera following absurd angles and finding itself in great difficulty both in narrow and wide environments.", "date": "2012-02-29", "grade": "7.3"}
