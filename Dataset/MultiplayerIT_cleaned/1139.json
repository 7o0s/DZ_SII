{"name": "Medieval Lords: Build", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medieval-lords-build-defend-expand.html", "text": "Elegy to simplicity Above all, make way for simplicity, Medieval Lords certainly does not claim to impose a radical revolution on the strategy genre, but immediately presents itself as a title of maximum accessibility and playability, willing to offer each category of player its direct formula and captivating. The gameplay turns out to be a compromise between management and real-time strategy. It is singular, but the weight of the war aspect in this game is not as overwhelming as one might expect. The action revolves more around the managerial aspect of managing the city. The player's first concern, once the center of the city has been established, will be to guarantee the population good health, safety and above all plenty of water and food. To ensure that this can be achieved, it is first of all necessary to have a good organization from an urban point of view. Each agglomeration of houses must have access to the structures used for the production or distribution of food and to water wells. There are six categories of needs to be constantly monitored to guarantee a good level of satisfaction from the population and to have a constant development of the structures and of the population; in fact, a favorable environment ensures a significant demographic increase, which leads to a greater number of laborers to be employed in the fields, a wider pool from which to draw for enlistment in the army and, obviously, the greater the population, the greater the income coming from taxes. Each building has its strengths and weaknesses, and has a dynamic influence on the territory. Farms, for example, make the area unattractive for the construction of houses, for this reason it is necessary to make every effort to construct buildings that raise the level of serenity, so that the commoners can live peacefully and increase in number even in the less hospitable areas. Organize to survive Food production must be organized to cover the whole year, since while small gardens and farms produce throughout the year, crops are seasonal (as in reality) and stocks can run out in a very short time if they are not continuously fed by regular productions. The houses can evolve through nine different stages, which distinguish not only the quality, but also the capacity. The construction of the fields used for cultivation is extremely arbitrary, in fact the player is totally free to design the perimeter of the field as he pleases, always bearing in mind that the land can be more or less suitable for production, based on the relative level of fertility, from always keep an eye on. In addition to being very dynamic, this solution gives a truly variegated aspect to the visible result of the possessions, giving the possibility of creating ever-changing panoramas. Victory in Medieval Lords always comes only in cases where the player, in addition to fulfilling the tasks of the mission, knows how to manage, from the early stages, a strong and above all farsighted city. In fact, during the course of the game the player can come across unpleasant inconveniences such as an epidemic that can reduce the production derived from pets or hail to the limit, as well as drought, which can deprive a large part of the proceeds from the cultivated fields . Maximum importance is given to land management. Natural barriers often constitute a really tough obstacle to overcome in the management of your city and you often find yourself having to deal with the limits imposed by slopes that are too steep or land unsuitable for cultivation. Innovation in simplicity The peculiarity of Medieval Lords is accentuated in the management of the fights, which we can define as a marginal and at the same time fundamental aspect of the dynamics of the game. In fact, many aspects of city management revolve around military activity. Citizens, for example, feel safer in the shadow of a tower only if it is occupied by a reasonable number of men who can guarantee its safety. Yet, despite the importance of the fighting and the military defense of the territories, the fights are almost stylized. The attack mechanism is always the same, to wage war against a faction it is sufficient to move one's armies on enemy territory, where a camp will be set up; from this moment the so-called ~truce of God~ starts at the end of which (a countdown will indicate the exact moment) the troops displaced on the enemy territory will start to assault the enemy possessions automatically. At this point the player can interact smainly by building war machines on the battlefield to provide support to the troops engaged in battle. The battles therefore look more like a question and answer and clashes on the open field and large pitched battles are almost non-existent as they are almost always retaliatory actions or mass invasions to be carried out against the enemy city. A faction is defined as defeated when the main tower is demolished, for this very reason the soldiers, always guided by artificial intelligence, concentrate their forces on this objective. Although the battle cannot be directly controlled, it is possible to manage the situation by exploiting the period of the initial truce to organize one's own defense forces, cut bridges to prevent the entry of enemies and transfer the crops from the various granaries in order to avoid damaging looting , which could put the city's economy in crisis more than the direct damage caused by the destruction can do. Comment The secret of Medieval Lords is enclosed in its simple formula and in its pleasant appearance, capable of putting the player at ease from the beginning. It can be appreciated by everyone, even by those players accustomed to decidedly more demanding titles, since it is a title that contains its power in its direct and non-dispersive being. Few parameters to manage, few types of units to govern and commitment on the battlefield reduced to the bone, but maximum importance to management and pure strategy, all supported by a respectable graphic sector, alive and fluid, by an interface simple but accurate and by a 3D engine thanks to which it is possible to make detailed zooms and very wide panoramas. We hope that players will applaud this brilliant and original mix of management and strategy. Pros: Simple and straightforward Fight management Original Scenario editor is available Cons: Poor soundtrack Some graphical bugs The main complaint leveled at the videogame industry in recent years is that of not knowing how to differentiate itself, and of having lost the ability to offer original products in a short time. And it is no coincidence that it is precisely the so-called ~minor~ productions that throw a few stones into the still pond of the PC entertainment market. Medieval Lords is part of what we could define as a timid attempt at a resurgence in this sense, bringing to the RTS genre, which has been too revisited, a starting point that bodes well for the future. It is certainly not a revolution, nor an earthquake, but a breath of fresh air on a stage that now smells stale.", "date": "2004-11-15", "grade": null}
