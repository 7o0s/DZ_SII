Seriously, it is undeniable that the current panorama of music video games is going through a tired phase, made up of continuous updates but few real innovations, on the altar of increasingly full-bodied but often recycled and less beautiful soundtracks overall. While on the one hand there are exceptions that prove the rule, such as The Beatles: Rock Band who managed to offer an exceptional artistic system, contour and ~historical~ research, on the other we have to look at Activision Blizzard and FreestyleGames for finally breathe a renewed air, which could give rise to a successful series if it does not remain static or gets lost in useless style exercises. The DJ Hero project has been rumored/denied several times until its official announcement and, it seems, its arrival brings with it many perplexities, either for the type of musical genres offered, or for doubts about the actual fun it can cause , or for the not very popular price of the supporting peripheral, which is sold together with the game for an indicative figure of 110 euros. So let's make room for our first console to become a virtual DJ (for the physical description, we refer you to the appropriate box on this page), which offers gameplay that is in some ways unprecedented and has its own personality. The basic concepts can be combined with those of a Guitar Hero (just to stay at Activision Blizzard), or those of showing off one's skills at the service of music, using the timing and speed of one's hands to imitate what a real DJ with his work (make it clear, in the result, the execution less), or that of mixing together various musical tracks also adding sound effects, voices or modifying the rhythm of the songs themselves, in such a way as to obtain a perfect result for concerts, parties and celebrations based on water and sugar. Wishlist for the future Those who are satisfied enjoy (so-so) and therefore it is already time to draw up their own ~wish list~ for the future chapters of the newborn Activision saga.Here is ours!1)More structured and interesting career mode 2)More stats and online and offline multiplayer with more variables 3) Ability to create your own personalized mix, starting from the choice of any two music tracks 4) Dj Vs Guitar more expanded, use of the microphone integrated in the gameplay 5)Some Italian DJs! The DJ console With DJ Hero we have a new entry into the by now crowded world of music videogame peripherals. The turntable, deck or simply DJ console consists of a plate equipped with three colored buttons, which are used for scratches, rewinds and to intercept the notes that pass on the screen. Together with the platter there is a base that houses the crossfader, the Euphoria button and the effects knob, while at the top there is a compartment, which can be closed to prevent it from being touched during a performance, which houses the controls of the pad. In the specific case of PS3 the digital cross, the start, select, PS keys and the front buttons. It is also possible to attach this base to the opposite side of the turntable, for all left-handed DJs. The peripheral is made mostly of plastic, with metal inserts on the sides of the platter. The top of the platter itself has some grooves which serve to ensure a good grip and mimic the real ones of the records. On the back there are some rubber pads dedicated to ensuring stability on the surfaces where the device is placed. As for the dimensions, the console is rather small if compared to a real DJ station, both for the dimensions itself and because it is composed of a single plate, unlike the two typical of the real counterparts. Overall, the build quality is quite good albeit plasticky, the console gives its best on a specially created workstation but can also be used on the legs with few problems. The most critical point is the crossfader, which has a small cavity in the central part that serves to give a sense of position, but it is too ~suggested~ and in the most agitated phases you risk not feeling it and therefore going further in the opposite direction . The Renegade edition, the more expensive and exclusive one, offers black and glossy finishes with a greater use of metal, as well as the four-foot support for the peripheral. Playstation 3 trophies DJ Hero provides 51 trophies, of which 2 Gold and 7 Silver. To unlock them you need to get the maximum number of stars on the difficulty levelsty higher, perform the various tricks within the game, play all the setlists, win 10 online games, make long sequences of notes, perform in a dj vs guitar mix. To obtain Platinum you must therefore be quite good at the higher difficulty levels, but most of the trophies can only be unlocked by playing and trying all the tracks on the disc. Queen vs. Daft Punk?!? The undisputed stars of this production are the mixes present on the disc, 93 which range in different genres and which often reach excellence in terms of realization and in how they are offered to the player and integrated with the actual gameplay. For more details there is the dedicated box, but also in this case we are faced with an aspect that clearly breaks into the musical genre, bringing freshness and fun, also because it is one of the very first experiments in this sense. But as a wise old man would say, who cares... On the game screen there are three tracks that scroll constantly and which represent the two songs to be mixed on the outside, and all the effects that are applied in the center. First of all there are the notes that must be intercepted in the classic way, thanks to the three colored buttons on the DJ plate; by leaving them pressed and moving the record up and down, you can scratch. On the side base of the console it is possible to use the crossfader which, initially placed in the center, allows you to exclude one or the other track by following the scroll line on the screen, which moves further out when you need to concentrate the sound only on one song. In the central area there is also the possibility, when proposed, to perform freestyle, choosing from a series of samples among those available. Other techniques can be found in the knob placed above the crossfader, which allows you to apply distortion effects and double the points multiplier; next to it on the left we have the button to activate the Euphoria, when available: think of the Star Power to double the points, in this case during its use the game automatically crossfades, and it is therefore useful to activate it perhaps near quite difficult sections. Furthermore, if the icon at the top of the points bar should light up green, it is possible to throw the platter backwards for rewind up to 720 degrees, and repeat a particular section with the multiplier doubled. What changes from one difficulty level to another? In the five iterations available, from very easy to expert, the scrolling speed of the audio tracks obviously increases, and at the higher levels there are also more complex scratches with high and low closing, instant crossfades and notes to be pressed simultaneously, for a mix that does not leave a breather. This is in summary the gameplay of DJ Hero, which proves to be extremely enveloping especially at higher levels, which require good coordination and skillful use of the Euphoria key in the most complex moments, also because there is, literally, an abyss between the first tracks and subsequent ones that become available. The video review Dj Tanzen recommends As mentioned DJ Hero provides 93 music tracks, mixed in groups of two by some DJs within the developer and by well-known names in the sector such as DJ Shadow, not to mention that the tracks mixed by David Guetta will soon arrive (at unbeatable prices really popular, we are talking about 3 euros per mix) and others. The choice is quite large, and artists such as Queen, Daft Punk, Benny Benassi, Gorillaz, Eminem, The Jackson 5, The Killers, MC Hammer and so on stand out. To take a peek at the complete soundtrack, just follow this link on Multiplayer.it, where there is the all-inclusive list of the title. Instead, here are the five recommended to start by DJ Tanzen, strictly to be played in Expert mode:Another one Bites the Dust (Queen) vs. Da Funk (Daft Punk) Boom Boom Pow (Black Eyed Peas) vs Satisfaction (Benny Benassi) Fix Up, Look Sharp (Dizze Rascal) vs. Organ Donor (DJ Shadow) Six Days (DJ Shadow) vs. Where it's at (Beck) Somebody Told me (The Killers) vs. Pjanoo (Eric Prydz) Mix that passes you The progression is entrusted to the stars that are obtained upon completion of each mix, which in turn is inserted into playlists that offer songs that must be performed in sequence. Gradually, increasingly long and difficult new ones are unlocked, often themed by genre or DJ, up to musical delirium that is very difficult to complete with maximum stars as an expert. The desire to move forward is all about wanting to play new mixes and the pure pleasure of playing the title, while objectivelythis first round the developers have not done much to develop this structure. Surely among the positive aspects there is the possibility to gradually choose and unlock different new stages for performances and DJs with related headphones, clothes, dishes, different themes and samples, which are then reflected on the graphics that form the background of your performance and that does its honest job, but without following in its movements what is actually happening on the screen. We have some variations such as the possibility of using the microphone to play the vocalist, which however runs out immediately when there is only one trophy connected and no visual recognition or to follow, it would have been nice instead to have a harmonic bar or the possibility to record your voice to listen to it later. It is therefore only useful if you use the game in the company of friends or during some dedicated party. The DJ vs Guitar mode is more interesting, which allows a partner to use a guitar to accompany the DJ on duty according to a gameplay similar to that of Guitar Hero. This mode, which also appears in some playlists when supported by the computer, however has only 10 tracks, and even in this case it could be exploited in a superior way. In the case of multiplayer we have the ability to create instant lists with your own mixes or 3 personalized playlists (one dedicated to the guitar), to be recalled at any time. Unfortunately we only have the choice of playing cooperatively or in versus, with the two DJs doing exactly the same things, it would have been nice to also take turns in the clips or affect the other DJ's performance. We have the same methods online, with the possibility of participating in a personalized game, closed with your friends list or fast, thanks to an immediate matchmaking that works quite well. Last but not least, the online rankings do not take into account the level of difficulty but group everything together with the first places obviously occupied by those who perform excellently at higher levels of difficulty. Why such a high final grade then? What counts in a new game like this, gameplay and soundtrack, is of exquisite workmanship, with absolute peaks given by some mixes to try and try again to perfect your score and that passage that initially seems impossible to complete successfully.", "date": "2009-10-30", "grade": "9.0"}
