But it is when we need to save the human race from itself that things get complicated: instead of a sniper rifle we need to use the right policies to save forests, instead of shooting grenades we need to get busy with education in underdeveloped countries and etc. With more than just a pinch of desire to draw players' attention to the real problems of our planet, the guys from the Red Redemption independent development team have created Fate Of The World, a game that calls us precisely to cover the leading role of an international organization, the GEO, committed to leading the world towards salvation from pollution, global warming, hunger and all the problems that the greats of the Earth will inexorably face in a hundred years from now. To do this, the choice was to direct the game mechanics towards those of a classic turn-based strategy, where we properly weigh our decisions and then discover their effects on the whole world. Good old days As soon as Fate Of The World is launched, its style immediately proves to be a bit retro, as if to pay homage to the times of the Amiga: the filmed presentation is certainly the most striking example, at the same time able to clarify what our role is within the game before launching into the initial scenario chosen as a mini-tutorial by the developers. In fact, our first commitment is to save Africa from poverty, giving its population a decent standard of living: right from its early stages, the game is only concerned with providing the essential information to move forward, letting it be then the experience aimed at making the player grow, to the point that even this first scenario proves to be anything but easy to digest immediately. As mentioned above, the mechanics are fully attributable to those of a turn-based strategy game: in each of the playable nations (or territorial zones) we can send one or more GEO agents, so that their number also becomes that of the possible actions to be take in one shift: if, for example, in the United States we have two agents, it is possible to take two different measures, and so on. The actions to be carried out are identified through cards, or rather decks that can be unlocked separately by creating the appropriate GEO office in the chosen nation: their classification is divided into environment (green), technology (blue), energy (yellow), welfare (red ) and policy (black), plus a ~multicolor~ that identifies long-term measures of various kinds. Do you want to start an education program in South Africa? Well, then it will be necessary first of all to build the appropriate welfare office to unlock the relative deck, then choosing the red card that identifies the action we have in mind in the next turn. Speaking of shifts, with each advancement the game engine takes us forward five years starting from 2020, to reach, at the most, up to 2200 depending on the scenarios proposed by the developers. Among the latter we also find a ~Doctor Apocalypse~, with which to forget all good intentions and make sure that the global temperature rises to the point of making all living races extinct. But let's go back to normal game modes, where the goal is precisely to avoid the worst: saving the world is not easy at all and Red Redemption makes us understand it widely thanks to a whole series of parameters to take into consideration to achieve success, also bearing in mind the context of the specific territory, thus carefully pondering the measures to be taken. Pushing too much on industry can, for example, solve the problem of work, but cause temperatures to rise and problems in finding raw materials. After all, the game constantly puts its effort into ensuring that the player has to study his moves carefully before moving on to the next round, providing a whole series of important information (there is also an encyclopedia of terms) which enhance the will of Red Redemption to make us not only play what is a full-fledged video game, but also to make us learn something about issues that should be of interest to all of us at present. I look at the world from a porthole From a technical point of view there is certainly little to say about Fate Of The World: completely leaving aside any claim to special effects, we can say that the few animations present perfectly fulfill their purpose.or task, while the game interface is intuitive especially when playing the cards, while vice versa the data consultation phase proves to be a little more complicated than necessary, also thanks to the large amount of parameters present. The soundtrack is composed of a series of music that varies according to the nation to which one's attention is being directed, and little more.", "date": "2011-03-10", "grade": "7.5"}
