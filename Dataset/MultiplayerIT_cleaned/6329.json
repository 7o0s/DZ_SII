{"name": "Un bagno di pixel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149940-un-bagno-di-pixel.html", "text": "It was 1983 when Taito brought his Elevator Action to the arcade. The idea was simple: the player looks through the facade of a building and eliminates the gang of assassins that he encounters on each floor. Although the environments in which to carry out massacres changed, with the addition of stairs, elevators and escalators, the purpose remained the same, which was to eliminate the threats that tried to kill us. Thirty-two years later, Roll7 takes back the original concept which in the meantime has passed through the hands of dozens of platformers and developers, and artfully elevates that simple formula: ~kill, change plans and kill again~. It's a world of pixels and violence, where the punishment for a crime is washed away with blood Vote for Bunnylord, your mayor The fact that this game is immediate, very fast and splatter does not mean that there cannot be a story to motivate the deeds of the ruthless assassins who populate its levels. Knowing that you are the good guys and everyone else is not is superfluous. In the narrative arc of a pseudo-plot that we don't want to spoil you, this aspect will not be so clear-cut, but whatever uniform may fall under the blows of your guns you don't care. What really matters is the extreme fluidity with which you will go from one fight to another. As your eyes watch a mound of anthropomorphic pixels hit the ground in a bloodbath, you'll have to think that soon after others will try to get your scalp. The future mayor of London has clear ideas. He doesn't want to stop crime in words, but he really wants to eradicate it with deeds from the foundations, drill it with shots and send a clear message to the citizenry by sticking a grenade in the backside of criminals. Twenty-one are the days that separate you from the election for the office of mayor and your boss wants to aim very high: if you manage to bring home more substantial successes, even his aims will push in the direction of higher roles. Prime Minister, King of England or Global Megalord - and something suggests that his purpose is precisely the latter. Although a level can be completed in a few minutes, you will have to memorize some patterns, especially the fastest routes, because performing certain actions, within a given amount of time, is one of the most complicated results to bring home. There's no denying that the high rate of primary-colored violence brings back recent memories of that indie gem called Hotline Miami. In fact, it is no coincidence that the publisher of Not a Hero is the same Devolver Digital that brought to light the masterpiece by Jonatan Sderstrm and Dennis Wedin. The Roll7 team, on the other hand, responsible for the work of this title, boasts the two OlliOllis behind it, which the world of critics and players liked as much. There are not many buttons to remember, also because it is essential to press them correctly and in rapid succession. If you find yourself making a mistake, you will pay dearly for it, with a clear decrease in the life bar. That said, this will return to the optimal level if you manage to catch your breath or find cover in a safe area. Consider that the magazines run out and with a button you will have to reload, an action that requires a more moderate and less bold approach to the clashes. A ~tamarro~ element, but also a damned funny one, is that of being able to enter the scene by sliding - as if it were a John Woo film - making enemies fall, stunning them and putting an end to the victim's life with a final move. Of course, as in any good action film, the ~successful entry~ factor is valid, for this reason it is possible to break through the glass of a window by jumping from one building to another or from one floor to the one below. If it is true that the weapon cannot be changed, a series of special ammunition will come to your aid, such as incendiary ones or real missiles, which you acquire directly in the field. In the same way it is possible to increase the number of deceased through the use of grenades - which can be thrown freely, but be careful that if the aim fails it will damage you too - or many other artifacts useful for the future mayor's ~peacemaking~ campaign, such as machine gun turrets. The pixels you don't expect You will be exactly the right man in the wrong place, but it is not correct to say ~man~, as Steve, the first anti-hero you play, may be replaced by a large group of mercenaries in the pay of BunnyLord. To defeat the hordes of enemies scattered in various points of the British capital, as you may have guessed, you will not have to rely on diplomacy but on lead and quick reflexes.The choice to be made will put you in the shoes of warriors with different physical characteristics or weapons. In fact, for each mission you will have to complete optional extra objectives, these will be completed more easily thanks to the peculiarities of the latter. If Steve is perhaps the one who is more balanced in combat performance, equipped with a pistol and a decent reload speed, you will still have to choose the other eight companions in misfortune, if you want to get the best result, based on the reference stage. To name a couple more companions, let's move on to the lovable Cletus, who sports a respectable shotgun, capable of engaging a good number of enemies in his death trail. The beautiful Samantha, on the other hand, is armed with a machine gun and is quick to run, so she can shoot while running. Knowing that you are sensitive to this detail, we carried out a test with both the pad and the keyboard: in both cases the result and control are excellent, even if perhaps the experience with a controller has proved to be more effective. During our test we noticed on more than one occasion drops in frame rate during shootings or suspiciously long loading between one mission and another, probably due to some bugs, as it didn't happen on every start.", "date": "2015-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
