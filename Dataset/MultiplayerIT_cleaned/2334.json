Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 can certainly enjoy good graphics and a decidedly apt soundtrack. However, the problems that gripped the control system of the two previous versions are still present. But let's go in order. The game is essentially structured around the ~career~ mode where you have to choose a professional BMX rider and guide him through the game's eight basic levels, completing a wide variety of challenges along the way. The main objective remains essentially unchanged: to obtain the highest possible score thanks to challenges based on the ~high score~, ~long grind~ and ~big air challenges~. Each level is populated by other professional BMX riders who will increase the difficulty of the challenges, many of which consist of performing ~tricks~ in specific places within the various levels. This interaction between the characters will help you immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the game, even if in reality the other ~riders~ essentially act as ~puppets~ equipped with a questionable artificial intelligence. You will also find a variety of motorized vehicles that roam the environments, each of which will give you the opportunity to interact with a ~grind~. The two-player mode has been significantly enhanced now offering 13 different types of challenge including the usual ~high score challenge~ and an original ~knock down the smartest~ complete with a hunt for the most skilled. The game also includes a ~level editor~ comparable to the one seen in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. In fact you will have many themes with which to characterize your level, a large space on which to build it and a myriad of objects with which you will make it unique. Tricks a go-go!!! One of the most striking improvements that the PS2 hardware has allowed to make is that of the enormous size and width of the levels. The Woodward Camp stage is now four times the size of the first Dave Mirra, and the level design in general is also much more varied and defined with paths that vary from old industrial stations to crowded urban centers, up to the peaceful desert of Arizona. Unfortunately, the balance of controls has remained the same as in the previous two incarnations. The control scheme is based on the X button for jumps, Triangle for grinds, O for biker and bicycle stunts and Square, used in tandem with O to vary tricks. This allows for the possibility of physically impossible stunt performances. The game still suffers from the magnetic ability of grinds, the ease of landing from stunts and the inaccuracy of collisions with the surrounding environment. Physics in general lacks credibility and this remains a big mole that has not been eliminated or at least improved. Dave is among us....and it shows! The levels are large and covered with well-made textures, any ~pop up~ effect is really imperceptible. The bikers' models have been vastly improved, adding a great sense of diversity to the collection of daredevil cyclists. These are also better animated, allowing stunts to be performed with much more smoothness and fluidity. However, the title suffers from occasional slowdowns and the virtual room sometimes gets stuck in the most hidden corners of the levels, leaving the gamer confused and confused. The soundtrack is suited to the upbeat, dynamic spirit of any sports-action game: pop-funk-style songs by the likes of Sum 41, Methods of Mayhem, Rage Against the Machine, Sublime and Fenix TX work well as background noise. background to the performances of the unleashed bikers. What do I do... buy it? Even if Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 suffers from some unhealed wounds compared to the previous versions, I would recommend it to anyone of you looking for a fun and immediately playable title, even if we are certainly not facing the maximum virtual expression of this sport.Pro: Graphically good Lots of tricks Soundtrack to scream! Cons: Poor controls Awkward virtual camera Limited interactivity with scenarios Did you want the bicycle... Acclaim was the first to enter BMX territory on the Playstation with Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX and the title was quite successful at the time thanks to its immediacy and simplicity. A ~remixed~ version of the game is also released, containing new levelsand a more intuitive and effective trick system. Now the American softco has decided to transport its reckless BMX biker on the black Sony monolith and the transition to the ~next generation~ hardware has positively benefited the title in many aspects.", "date": "2001-12-03", "grade": null}
