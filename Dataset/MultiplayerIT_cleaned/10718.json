{"name": "Braid", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/giocando-con-la-tessitura-del-tempo.html", "text": "Braid studies time and declines it in all its possible ramifications, giving the player the possibility of manipulating its flow and making it the pivot around which all the other game mechanics revolve. What could apparently be dismissed as a simple two-dimensional platform / puzzle game, manages to compress into a single product the many experiments that have followed one another over the years, in the mainstream scene as well as in the indie one, to give the player greater control on the fourth dimension. Immersed in a surreal world, it is necessary to conceive space in relation to time, exploiting the different powers available to the character in order to collect the pieces of the puzzle of what seems to be the story of her life, more than the classic tale of the princess from to save. At the beginning it seems to be faced with a classic platform game with the possibility of rewinding time, a kind of two-dimensional Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and with some aesthetic ambition in the composition of the backdrops, all rather refined and studied by the purely pictorial point of view. It is only after the first, simple phases that one begins to understand the greatness of the game and its immense genius. Braid apparently says little, but slowly pervades the player with a warm melancholy that does not leave him until the surprise ending. The character himself, a sort of clerk complete with a white shirt and red tie, looks like a fish out of water in a fairytale world saturated with fantasy and color. Why choose an insignificant and mediocre little man as the protagonist? The explanation, if we want to call it that, comes at the end (which we won't reveal to you even if we would like to spoil the surprise for you... sadists). Time waits for no one Speaking of more purely playful issues, it must be said that Braid is divided into six worlds, in each of which twelve puzzle tiles must be collected and reassembled to form an image of the level. The challenge lies precisely in being able to reach them because, apart from the first ones, they are usually positioned in points of the map that are inaccessible to reach. To do this, one must exploit the peculiarities of the passage of time of the specific world, crossing them with the always available ability to rewind the same. it is only after the first, simple phases that one begins to understand the greatness of the game and its immense genius For example, in the fourth world the moving elements that make up the scenario follow the movements of the character on a pre-established timeline and to overcome the various puzzles you have to carefully study their movements, while in the fifth world, to give another example, you have a sphere that slows down the movements of any element that comes into contact with it, including the protagonist. What amazes about Braid is the naturalness of the puzzles, or rather their being perfectly logical and never forced. Once you understand a power, you just need to be able to apply it. Of course, for many it will not be easy to complete it because some levels are quite complicated, but the game is worth the candle, even if only to admire the overall artistic direction, which includes the visual aspect and the well-blended use of music and sounds with different powers. Perhaps it may make you smile that one of the best titles published for this technological generation of video games, made up of multibillion-dollar productions that require you to sell a disproportionate amount of copies to break even, is a poor 2D platformer programmed by a single person, but so far, considering even the 360 version, as valid as the PC one, seems to be the case. Never as in this case has the word masterpiece been used more appropriately.", "date": "2009-05-19", "grade": "9.4"}
