{"name": "Death Stranding", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/death-stranding-recensione-pc.html", "text": "A couple of weeks ago we went back to talking about Death Stranding, giving a little taste of what it meant for us to re-immerse ourselves in Kojma's imagination with both hands. As the days went by we went deeper, we also dug into those PCist details so dear to the category and put the game under pressure from a technical point of view. As for the latter aspect, we refer you to a next dedicated special; in the meantime, let's try to sum up this highly anticipated port, perhaps the most awaited in recent years, through the review of Death Stranding for PC. We advise you to also retrieve the analysis of the PlayStation 4 version for an even more complete overview of the title. while we try to tell you why Death Stranding is really a great experience. A story of death, a story of life Death Stranding is about death. Death Stranding is about life. Two opposites, two irreconcilable realities, but also two inescapable truths. Last November we told you how the hope enclosed in the tragedy of this story represents a great declaration of love to humanity by Kojima. Able to make and unmake, create and destroy. However, it is certainly also an accusation, which puts our faults and lack of attention towards our neighbor as well as the world in which we live on the plate. It was our community that ran aground and in this cold and aseptic environment it was the figure of the couriers, mocked for years and then confirmed, who represented the only glimmer of humanity in a divided and irreconcilable world. What is truly surprising is the irony with which the real world then hit anyone who had a big laugh, putting us a few months after the release in front of a reality fortunately not so tragic, but absurdly damned close to the one narrated in Death Stranding. The psycho-physical need to get back to connecting ourselves with others has been a prevailing sensation in the past months of our lives and, precisely those couriers that we took for granted in everyday life, have turned into an anchor of salvation, even if only from a psychological point of view. It makes you smile to analyze the journey of Sam, the protagonist played by Norman Reedus, because a few months after the first release and after sterile and inconsistent controversies, the world itself has confronted us with the great need for the role of the courier, the connection it is able to carry. On the other hand, it is true that what the work of Kojima Productions tries to do is to make us reflect on what we take for granted, on a communicability that has reached its peak today but which, looking closely, is not reflected in the right sharing of intent. We want to avoid ruining the narrative implications for those who will experience their journey for the first time, but if you intend to really delve into some of the themes and symbolisms of Death Stranding, we refer you to the special we had dedicated precisely to this purpose. Sam's journey is filled with despair, fleeting encounters, death and a number of questions certainly higher than that of answers. It is not a perfect narrative and, even today, it does not transform Kojima into the perfect screenwriter, but it is undeniable that it is one of the most powerful experiences of recent years and, as such, it is right to treat it. If what you are looking for is a reflection deep, philosophical, almost abstract in some details, but damn true of what we have been and are becoming as humanity, Death Stranding is the one for you. If you are able, months later, to grasp the elements that have brought the imaginary of Death Stranding even closer to our daily lives, the perception of the reflection and of the message will be equally powerful, that note of admonition and hope which is the spark that moves the whole work. I like it Death Stranding, in full Kojimian style, also brings with it some ingenious touches that have always characterized the work of the Japanese game designer and which have divided users for an equally long time by the tones and dissonance they create in the gameplay. The latest work is no exception and, among the various particular elements, the asynchronous multiplayer mechanics inserted in the game world certainly appear. Connecting Knot Cities, fulfillment centers and various preppers around America also means increasing your reputation and collecting ~likes~. The social yardstick of the twenty-first century becomes the great currency of exchange of Death Stranding, allowing you to raise your deeds and be talked about both among the NPCs and among the other players. traveland for the game map it means crossing an immoderate amount of structures, elements of equipment, signs, roads, etc. built by other players and to which we could leave our liking, as well as receive it in turn. The increase in likes turns into the growth of our reputation and the increase of our ~courier level~, but details that are ends in themselves. If normally this would be considered a bad thing, it is evident that the will is precisely to avoid giving the impression of a progression towards objectives. The like is a small token of thanks within something much bigger: your help in reconnecting the human race. Simulation Too often the term simulator is used in a negative sense. Especially from a slice of the public, that console, not used to the genre and easily attacked by the boredom of lack of action. Death Stranding has always been a perfect title for the PC because it refers to that type of user and manages to digest, in addition to its crazy story, a widely criticized gameplay. What is true and incontrovertible is that Death Stranding is a simulator of deliveries. Not extremely realistic, not attentive to every single detail, not one of those who want you to feel ready to start your own shipping company. The whole idea of game design starts from the concept of putting ourselves in the shoes of a lonely man, unable to communicate, physically unable to contact and with a nebulous and obscure past. Although these elements may represent the prerequisite for a negative character, on the contrary Sam dedicates his life to the good of humanity, to ideally connect people through his hand deliveries, taking risks as few others could do. From here, dozens and dozens of hours of staid gameplay extend, declined in long walks through desolate lands and few encounters, characterized by the growth of one's skills and the discovery of new technologies that can facilitate our travels but which, at the same time, make us lead us to collide with an increasingly impervious American territory. Collecting loads and taking them to their destination, between small logistics centers and what remains of the large cities of the western continent, is also and above all equivalent to allowing us to reactivate the chiral network: a tool halfway between the technology of our world is something unknowable, the only energy tool at our disposal and closely linked to the appearance of the dead. The union of the two worlds meant that chiralium took over all the rest, initially only as a threat and then, thanks to its large energy load, known and exploited by man to his own advantage. This is how we are able to print each object in a few moments, or to reconstruct suspended roads where the old highways connected places and people in record time. Death Stranding is totally attributable to a great metaphor and the resulting gameplay, managed with maniacal attention to detail, does nothing but constantly develop at the service of this metaphor declined in Sam's journey. Next to outings on foot or aboard a few vehicles from 'energy reduced, there are few (fortunately) moments of action that undoubtedly do not shine for achievement. During Sam's journey you will be called upon to confront different factions, whether they are the Donkeys (people affected by a particular pathology, based on delivery addiction, which drives them to theft of loads), or on the contrary the terrorists led by one of the main (and among the best) characters in history or even within the most imaginative sections of the production and which we will not tell you about. Certainly the CA (stranded creatures) cannot be missing, the physical and tangible manifestation of the union of our world with that of the dead. The clashes with them go from the stealth sections that require not to be identified, to the open-faced skirmish, which however never convinces in its structure, simple and shallow. In the light of their presence it is impossible not to highlight their paucity. If it is true that fortunately we are talking about rare and sporadic moments, some of these represent such important narrative junctions that it makes one angry to see the reluctance with which they were made, left aside with will and stuffed with TPS mechanics that are really too basic not to consider them mediocre. Exactly as we said last November, we are talking about a few handfuls of minutes in a journey capable of lasting between 35 and 70 hours only on its first passage. What we advise you is to take your time and investigate, as well ason a few other occasions we were allowed to do so. On the other hand, the rain is there, to remind us how fast time passes and we should make the most of it. Unedited content The wait was long, but Kojima Production has tried to repay the trust and patience of PC users with some interesting additions. The collaboration with Valve, which has led to the creation of six new quests dedicated to Half-Life and Portal, certainly does not revolutionize a structure that remains mostly the same but which, alongside the new cosmetic items, also includes some gadgets and certainly interesting means of transport. We don't want to reveal what it is and perhaps the most savvy could get there thinking of the reference franchises, but even if we talk about small trifles, we appreciated the choice and we recognize its goodness. Death Stranding on PC We have already told you and we confirm it again: Death Stranding on PC is splendid. The possibility of seeing the devastated and natural world that characterizes the imagery of the game with an even higher level of detail and the unlocked frame rate is truly a feast for the eyes. The graphic options that can be modified are not many, but this does not mean that the title is not very scalable. The awareness of already having an extraordinary console base - thanks also to a crazy Decima Engine which bodes well for the porting of Horizon: Zero Dawn - prompted the Japanese developer not to dare on the increase in detail, but rather to push on the post processing, on the general cleaning, on the increase of the visual horizon and on the fluidity, all details that will allow a vast array of configurations to enjoy the game to its full potential. In confirmation of the excellent work carried out on the conversion, we can not mention the mouse and keyboard support, which are confirmed as the best control tool for a title based on the management of the menus and the arrangement of various objects and elements. The reworked mapping regarding the weight of the load, this time delegated to the two main mouse keys, does not allow the sensitivity of a trigger stroke to be adopted, but remains functional and well elaborated, also avoiding tiring the player too much.", "date": "2020-07-13", "grade": "9.2"}
