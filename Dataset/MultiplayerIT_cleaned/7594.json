It is certainly a title that has been able to change the perception of mobile gaming, especially in terms of numbers and commercial success, and which over the years has enjoyed the continuous support of the developers, who have released several free level packs. The latest interpretation of the franchise is precisely the one that sees the angry birds take on the role of the protagonists of Star Wars and acquire their peculiar abilities. After the first chapter based on the classic trilogy, Angry Birds Star Wars II arrives on the App Store, Google Play and Windows Phone Marketplace, which instead starts from the most recent films of the saga, or the prequels that tell the evolution of Anakin Skywalker and his gradual transition to the dark side. This aspect is emphasized in the game through a campaign with a double meaning, currently made up of two scenarios (~Naboo Invasion~ and ~Escape to Tatooine~) plus one extra which will soon be supported by new missions and which, unlike the first Angry Birds Star Wars, do not include the annoying obligation to shell out an additional amount in order to access the offer in its entirety. Once you have purchased the product, therefore, you will not be asked to put your wallet back; unless you want to resort to traditional in-app purchases at all costs, which allow you to unlock additional birds to solve the advanced stages more easily. A fortunately optional practice, which can be done without, but which for the occasion is accompanied by the introduction of the Telepods, or a line of toys produced by Hasbro which, in Skylanders style, must be placed on the camera of our terminal so that they can project its in-game character. Angry Birds Star Wars II is fun, immediate and full of characters, but without substantial novelties The ghost brood We were talking about the dual value of the campaign, which in Angry Birds Star Wars II puts us first on the ~good~ side, on the light side of the Force, then on the ~bad~ side, on the Pork Side, doubling by made the initial offer but lacking the goal of an innovation that instead appeared expected and necessary by fans of the series. Let us try to explain ourselves better: the high number of characters included in this episode undoubtedly increases the variety of the action, even if there is no shortage of birds with skills that are a bit too similar to each other, but the opportunity to be able to use the faction wicked was better exploited, inserting different mechanics rather than opting for the simplest and most comfortable solution, or the re-proposition of the same gameplay with reversed parts. Because this is precisely what happens in the game: the levels of the Pig Side are structurally identical to those of the Light Side. Rovio was not asked to dust off the excellent work done with Bad Piggies (which we strongly hope will have a sequel) and therefore to reshuffle the cards on the table so much, it is clear, but it was certainly reasonable to expect some significant innovations compared to what stands as the most traditional of the ~more of the same~, amusing as usual but unable to surprise. Angry Birds Star Wars II therefore corresponds to a ~homework~ with some good ideas for the characters (see Anakin in the ~racing~ version, or the interesting ~elastic~ of the equivalent of Jar Jar Binks), a good technical realization and a precise and reliable touch control system.", "date": "2013-09-30", "grade": "7.8"}
