The Sudden Strike series is distinguished by the total lack of resource collection, a decidedly refined troop micromanagement and above all a certain realism during the battles. This has made the series rather particular and suitable for a well-defined and respectable slice of players. Sudden Strike 3: Arms for Victory compared to previous chapters, offers a 3D game engine that allows you to zoom, but not rotate the shot. The zoom does not allow you to bring the camera closer to view the individual units and in certain situations you really feel the need, given that it is not easy to distinguish between the many armored units and above all to recognize the infantry. Motto: never send units into disarray Sudden Strike 3 offers classic campaign modes (even 5) and multiplayer. Each of the campaigns puts the player in command of as many armies such as: Allies, Axis, USSR, United States and Japan. Each army has many different units and prototypes, even if overall there is not a great differentiation between the deployments, but since it is a rather realistic title and not a work of fantasy, it is a plausible aspect. After the indispensable tutorial, the first missions project the player into the battlefield, where the units, commanded by an artificial intelligence known as Smart AI, tend to launch themselves somewhat rashly towards the enemy defenses, decimating themselves with extreme ease. Compared to several other strategic ones, the best tactic to disrupt the enemy's trenches consists (very realistically anyway) in performing outflanking maneuvers or in using the available units with maximum effectiveness. In fact, having almost always numerous armies does not mean that it is enough to send them into danger to ensure victory, and knowing how to manage the individual units is also an important aspect. The campaign maps are notable for their size, reaching in some cases even for 8 kilometers in length and width. The multiplayer allows you to play the classic 1v1 and 2v2 battles in which you will have to defeat the opposing troops. A battle of this type begins with the arrival of a well-defined number of units, to be directed prudently towards the enemy. Moving troops presents some problems as they have a tendency not to group together, making these phases decidedly cumbersome.

Comment Sudden Strike 3: Arms for Victory is a real-time strategy that takes time to master as it deserves, but once tamed it gives great satisfaction. The large number of levels and the particularly large scenarios promise to give fans several hours of entertainment. Too bad only for the absence of more difficulty levels, but the still interesting price with which the game will arrive in stores represents an aspect to take into consideration. Pros Huge levels Great tactical depth Very long-lived Cons Poorly updated graphics Steep learning curve", "date": "2007-11-21", "grade": null}
