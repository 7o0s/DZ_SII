After recording one last save from about fifty hours of gameplay and seeing practically everything we could see, we admit we still didn't understand if Magnolia was referring to our courage... or that of the developer, Silicon Studio. After all, the series had started as an experiment: Bravely Default wanted to be an attempt to rejuvenate the JRPG genre without distorting it, and he had succeeded perfectly, proposing the best possible incarnation of the Square Enix tradition - here only as publisher - which in the experimental Final Fantasy of the last few years it was lost. Bravely Default, three years ago, was very well received especially for some brilliant ideas that perhaps did not make everyone agree, but which certainly displaced many veterans of the genre. In short, considering the success of the predecessor and some important departures in the staff, Bravely Second: End Layer has become one of the most anticipated and feared sequels of recent times. When we started playing, we couldn't help but wonder: will the guys from Silicon Studio be able to amaze us again? But above all: how many times will we have to defeat the same bosses in this new adventure? Bravely Second takes us back to Luxendarc between old friends and new enemies, but will it be another masterpiece? The long journey of the avenger It will be very difficult to describe and evaluate the plot of Bravely Second without falling into the trap of easy anticipation, but we will try anyway. If you have never played Bravely Default, keep in mind that even just watching a promotional film of the sequel could spoil some surprises for you, but logically we have to start from the beginning, and this means that only two years have passed since the ending of Bravely Default and half. The former vestal Agns Oblige is now popess of Orthodoxy and is conducting a policy of peace that some do not look kindly on: it is Kaiser Oblivion, a mysterious masked sovereign who gets rid of the royal guard in an instant and kidnaps Agns, imprisoning her in his flying fortress. One of the few survivors, the incurable optimist Yew Geneolgia, decides to pursue the Kaiser to save Agns, crossing the paths of an old acquaintance, the feisty Edea Lee, and a brand new heroine, Magnolia Arch. The latter arrives directly from the Moon to hunt down a monstrous creature, the Ba'al, which happens to be related to the Kaiser, so he decides to help Edea and Yew in their attempt to awaken the only person who could help them save Agns: Tiz Arrior, the protagonist of Bravely Default mysteriously ended up in a coma and remained there for two years. And this, mind you, is only the prologue. Composed of six chapters, the story of Bravely Second, written by the producer himself Tomoya Asano who replaces the screenplay Naotaka Hayashi, takes us for a walk around the world of Luxendarc in a mix of old and new cities and settings. Here, in a certain sense, the donkey falls, and we need to begin to specify some small but important details. Bravely Second is a direct sequel, so it would be absurd to expect a completely new and different world: Silicon Studio has added more or less a city and a dungeon to the continent, slightly retouching the old locations which will immediately appear identical to how we left them in Bravely Default. The plot, on the other hand, does not linger on the already explored scenarios, concentrating the most important events in the unpublished cities and areas. Unlike the prequel, the narrative plot in Bravely Second wants to be more sophisticated, but it only succeeds in part due to the simple fact that the player who has already completed the previous episode already expects certain plot twists; the effectiveness of some twists inevitably comes out reduced, and perhaps this is why the screenplay at a certain point begins to produce one deus ex machina after another. In short, if the story wants to go the extra mile without succeeding one hundred percent, the characterization of the characters and above all of the adorable protagonists remains monumental: all built around their interactions and their dialogues, it moved and entertained us again thanks also to the absolutely superlative Italian adaptation which does not hesitate to distort some dialogues in search of puns, gags and more effective quotations in our language. Bravely Second, even more than its predecessor, is a riot of sibylline quotes and references tocomics, cartoons and video games; even in Star Wars. The player can choose at any time whether to set the audio in Japanese or in English to better enjoy the dialogues, but in both cases the dubbing is over the top and, in this case, the western localization deserves applause for the simple effective adaptation of the lunar language of Magnolia, which speaks in English in the Japanese version... and in French with the western audio. The result is not only hilarious, but perfectly fitting. An asterisk yes, an asterisk no From time to time, blue balloons marked with an exclamation point will appear on the map: they suggest that a secondary mission is available in the area that we can tackle at any time and that every time it will put us in front of a complicated dilemma. Bravely Second, a bit like Bravely Default but much less subtly, also makes a kind of social commentary, often pilloriing the corporate, political and economic culture of our world in a sort of grotesque fantasy metaphor. Edea will therefore have to decide whether to support a social security system or not, whether to allow the opening of a mixed school in what Minister Inetta Deleg (sic!) defines as the ~gender era~ even in Luxendarc, whether to help the slimy Profiteur evict a old man and his grandson to build a holiday village in the place of their hovel. Yes, because the side missions always bring back the old dungeons and bosses faced in Bravely Default - the so-called asterisk keepers - and by choosing to support one of them we will have to fight another, unlocking the presiding class. This means that, substantially, beyond ethics, we will have to decide from time to time which class to unlock. Monk or Valkyrie? Thief or Red Wizard? Pirate or Artist? The decision will affect our game, obviously, but not until the end. Once again we skim the spoiler, but it seems right to warn interested parties that even in Bravely Second, at a certain point, there is a... situation, let's call it that, similar to the one that caused Bravely Default players to discuss so much. In this case, however, it is greatly scaled down and simply allows us to repeat the secondary missions, in much shorter and more concise versions, to also unlock the classes they had apparently given up on. Once again we are faced with a complete recycling of assets, albeit marginal, but fortunately it is a less marked expedient. Not that up to that point the variety has been lacking, mind you. Indeed, in this sense Bravely Second sports a sample of new classes that is simply amazing in terms of inventiveness and tactics. Although we weren't entirely convinced by some of them (this is the case of the Pastry Chef and the Catmancer, original but a little too focused on consumables) we were instead surprised by the mechanics of some new classes such as the Magician, which unlike the Black Magician draws on different types of spells per school of magic, or the amazing Exorcist, able to literally rewind time and undo the actions of enemies. In total, between the twelve new classes and the eighteen old ones, Bravely Second offers thirty classes and a hundred new skills with which to customize the four protagonists. Given the almost infinite number of possible combinations, Silicon Studio has managed the difficult task of balancing the old and new bosses so that players can draw on the pool of spells, weapons, special attacks and abilities to devise any type of strategy. The difficulty curve has lowered only in appearance: the bosses are generally less tough, while normal enemies can give you a hard time if you take them lightly. On the other hand, in addition to being able to adjust the frequency of random fights and the actual difficulty level, the best players can take advantage of the new chain fight mechanic to progressively gain more experience points and accelerate the growth of the party. As usual, everything revolves around the simple but ingenious idea of the Brave and the Default: if you defend yourself, you ~keep~ a turn which you can then download at any time to take advantage of the corresponding extra action during a normal turn. Not only can you also act ~on credit~, downloading the shifts not yet accumulated at the cost of remaining helpless later, but you also have to deal with enemies capable of manipulating the same dynamics, transforming some clashes into a sophisticated search for the moment right in which to attack or in which to defend. While it has hardly changed at all, the combat system of Bravely Second remains one of the best of its kind. The 3D effect As happened for Bravely Default, we can only advise you to keep the stereoscopic effect active: the main feature of the Nintendo 3DS adds nothing in terms of gameplay, but it is masterfully implemented and makes every sequence of the game even more spectacular. Rebuild Fort-lune In Bravely Second there is a lot of fighting and a lot of reading, so much so that the developer has well thought of implementing an automated combat system complete with action presets for ~grind~ lovers and the possibility of pressing a simple key to immediately skip the narrative sequences, and then perhaps review them more calmly thanks to Yew's travel diary. Bravely Second, like its predecessor, always comes towards the player. Indeed, to the players, because all the features already implemented in Bravely Default return, such as the possibility of ~sending~ one's attacks to other players in the friends list and downloading the inhabitants of Fort-lune via StreetPass or SpotPass. Fort-lune replaces Norende, Tiz's home village, as a timed mini-game where you have to rebuild the various structures razed by the Ba'al, while unlocking new special attacks for each weapon and related modifiers. Again, Fort-lune will be attacked from time to time by particularly challenging bosses that we will be able to weaken with our spaceships and those of our friends, before facing them directly in combat. Anyone who has played Bravely Default will immediately feel at home, more or less, even if we are sure that the guys from Silicon Studio could have come up with something better than another timed social network minigame. Even the other minigame has left us quite perplexed: it's called Morscraft and has very little interactive. It's simply a matter of watching our pets build puppets called Bites on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS. The only thing the player can do is buy power-ups that improve the production process and feed the protagonists so that they gain a performance boost and craft even rarer and faster Bitescones. When you are satisfied, close the package and collect the money from the sale: once certain goals have been reached, new melodies are also unlocked to listen to during the minigame, a pity that you cannot keep the Nintendo 3DS closed to exploit Morscraft as a portable jukebox. It must be said that the soundtrack of Bravely Second is far from unforgettable compared to that composed for the prequel, which fortunately re-emerges in the form of some old songs especially when facing the old bosses or dungeons of Bravely Default. The new tracks by ryo, musician of Supercell, are listened to with pleasure but unfortunately they don't have the same intensity and instrumental variety as those composed by Revo, even if fortunately they recover in the crucial moments of the story to give a more than spot on accompaniment. To close our review on the technical sector, we must necessarily talk about the graphics, but in reality there isn't much to say: Bravely Second is Bravely Default as it is, even if a careful look will see many evolutions within the margins of the new contents . The new cities and the new dungeons are games of illustrations and parallaxes that surprise for colors and details especially when the stereoscopic effect is active, as in the case of the forest of Sagitta or the city of Gathelatio, but it is clear that Silicon Studio has limited itself to recycle pretty much everything else in Luxendarc. Perhaps it was inevitable, the fact remains that the sense of dj vu is suffocating if you go from Bravely Default to Bravely Second in a matter of days.", "date": "2016-02-18", "grade": "8.8"}
