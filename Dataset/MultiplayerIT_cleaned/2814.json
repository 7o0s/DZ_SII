Its sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, took a long time to wait, but when it arrived several months ago almost everyone agreed on its extraordinary quality. Some time later and aware of the love of many enthusiasts, the team decided to work hard on a patch that didn't limit itself and clean up here and there what they had to leave behind previously. On the contrary, this update substantially overturns the technical aspect of the game, with a customized patch based on the platform. Let's see the news in the review of Ori and the Will of the Wisps on Xbox Series X. A great adventure Ori has always stunned everyone with its atmosphere. The stylistic figure with which each single element is inserted and moved on stage, as well as the emotion it is able to convey thanks to a simple but impactful direction, are two of the elements that have made a work great. Alongside these considerations, however, there is always the purely playful part and it is impossible to separate the two elements, especially when it comes to metroidvania. This particular genre, one of the longest-lived and most successful in history, is experiencing a second youth in recent years. Thanks to the immediate but profound mechanics, the sense of progression and discovery that it is capable of generating in players and the possibility of putting works that are often two-dimensional but with a very strong aesthetic research on the screen. If the first Ori tipped the balance more on its artistic value than on the quality and variety of gameplay, the second chapter allowed the Moon Studio kids to learn and grow, polishing their child and making it much more rhythmic and balanced. We're still far from the levels of Hollow Knight in terms of complexity and metroidvania structure, but it's impossible to deny that the quality of the game is extraordinarily high overall. Xbox Series X We come to the core of this analysis, or the changes made to Ori with this patch (almost) entirely dedicated to consoles now in the pipeline. The first and most important factor, especially when it comes to a title of this genre, is that relating to the frame rate. On Xbox Series X the game finally runs in the way that is most congenial to it, reaching a splendid 4K and 120fps which automatically makes it one of the most avant-garde titles ever to arrive on consoles. The mix of incredible fluidity and out-of-scale resolution are elements that make Ori and the Will of the Wisps no longer a rough diamond, but a precious stone of inestimable value and worked with the best known techniques. For those who want to exaggerate, it is even possible to arrive for the very first time on consoles to push the game towards an internal 6K rendering which will then be re-proposed in output thanks to supersampling with an obviously higher quality 4K 60fps signal. In short, this means that the game will work to actually produce 6K images, which however through an intermediate process will be reduced to a very high quality 4K, capable of bringing a graphic level to the screen that defining ~exaggerated~ is probably an understatement. Exclusively on Series X, additional graphic effects have also been added between the various settings and we know well how the possibility of scaling and managing the settings is something strongly desired, especially by a certain type of console user who is more savvy and attentive to these details . To conclude with what are the best main ones, the reduced input lag (never underestimated) and the revised and corrected uploads take care of it. We're talking about a halving of the time between checkpoint loading of a match on Xbox Series X compared to its direct ancestor One X. An achievement that brings Ori's loading times, already fast enough anyway, to be almost completely reset. To all these upgrades are added a series of details that can be found through official patches and which involve all versions, including Xbox One and PC. Xbox Series S Ori and the Will of the Wisps not only improves on the Microsoft flagship, but also on Xbox Series S. The possibility of unlocking this element and reaching up to 120 frames per second here too, represents a pleasure for the eyes and for the mind that it only felt like a mirage until a few days ago on consoles. This is a real revolution, which will obviously need to be understood to what extent and how it will be able to maintain itself over time, but which deserves to be exploited and lived as long as we have the power. If we arrive at these figures in terms of fps is not in your perspective and if you are among those who still prefer the graphic aspect to the improvement of the experience in general, then you will be happy to know that even a 4K and 60fps version is still available on Series S as well. Strange but true , considering the willingness repeatedly expressed to keep 1440p as a resolution target for the small Microsoft company.", "date": "2020-11-08", "grade": "9.1"}
