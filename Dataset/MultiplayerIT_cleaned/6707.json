{"name": "Ringraziando Romero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/141698-wickland-ringraziando-romero.html", "text": "The latest variations on the classic gameplay introduced by Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, namely the double jump and the ability to make the dash - which the evil ones associate with a trivial imitation of Titanfall - have taken the series to another level of frenzy in the fights . These very fast actions uproot from the ~slowness~ of real life and have a remote origin... they have their roots in a videogame era in which everything went even faster. Even before competitive multiplayer in first person shooters also required a tactical study of upgrades, with unlockable perks and reaching a certain level, there were them: Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament. Despite the noble origins of these titles and those that followed, primarily due to the will of John Romero who, together with Carmack, brought to light the first games signed by id Software, it must be admitted that this genre has now almost disappeared. Or at least that's what we thought until we got our hands on Wickland... Wickland is a blast from the past of competitive first-person shooters Unreal inside and out Wickland is powered by the muscular Unreal Engine, which gives life to characters who seem to have escaped from Halloween night, equipped with bizarre weapons - whose effects are no less than the more classic fire-breathing ones - and in movements within arenas created for get slaughtered among themselves and entertain ourselves. Currently there are only three maps: Ursus Fort, Ixi Jail and Houzo Grounds. The style, as per tradition, is the gothic one of a medieval metalhead setting, designed by a mad architect inside a castle. None of the three shines for particular or noteworthy elements, as happened for Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament, they are only a pretext to favor the meeting / clash between players. There is no shortage of teleportation zones and ~trampolines~ to reach certain areas more quickly. The bonuses could not be missing and are distributed within the maps: they include armor upgrades, increased defense... but also the funniest part and if we want the pinch of originality of this title. In fact, when you start the fight we all have the appearance of a medieval knight, equipped with a crossbow - with a much faster fire than the real counterpart - but we will soon be given the opportunity to take on the appearance of other characters, each equipped with a weapon customized. The names are not indicated, but they easily recall famous characters taken from the world of cinema. The bestiary boasts: the monster of the lagoon, equipped with an electric ray; an overgrown crustacean that fires a slow but deadly single shot; the demon who throws balls of acid to the despair of his enemies; a gorillon that fires a cluster of shotgun-style bullets; a giant turkey holding flaming skulls ready to be hurled; and finally the wolf man, who squeezes silver spheres (the law of retaliation) and uses them as time-delay bombs. This is essentially Wickland - written in the font of the first Quake - and anyone who wants such a title should know that this is probably the time to try their hand at the enterprise. The experience offered by Wickland allowed us to relive the excitement offered by the arena shooters of the 90s. Mad Ram Software's title came out of Steam Greenlight with the grit of those who don't want to come to terms with today's titles. In the hope that the servers can slowly fill up with players, or at least that the bots still being worked on are equipped with good artificial intelligence, one can only reward the work done to satisfy a demanding and passionate niche of fans.", "date": "2014-12-04", "grade": null}
