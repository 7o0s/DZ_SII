{"name": "Stranger - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stranger-recensione.html", "text": "Soldiers of doom Kront's is a harsh world, but luckily a tutorial doesn't refuse even to outcasts, although the system devised by Fireglow is so complicated that not even a few initial lessons really prepare you for the task that awaits us a little further on. It takes almost five completed missions before you can get a comprehensive idea of the possibilities offered by Stranger. However, everything revolves around the hero of the moment, who moves on maps similar to those of an RTS. They may vary in size, but the obligatory nature of the paths distances Stranger considerably from the idea of an exploratory RPG. An interesting novelty consists instead in the presence of an underground world, which however resolves itself into a dungeon accessible from some points on the map, whose entrance is often linked to the completion of one or more secondary missions. From here on, the classic structure of real-time strategy commands attention. In order to complete the mission it will in fact be necessary to recruit troops among the different races present on the map, starting a system of alliances that allows you to make friends with some tribes by offering them magic stones or bribing them with small favors. Once this is done, a small army of randomly assorted fantasy creatures gathers like at the Rio Carnival. It's not like a lizard hero followed by a gnoll and a goblin is the typical bunch of good guys you meet in pubs. Soldiers of doom However, with the formation of the merry brigade the first disagreements arrive, because the game interface becomes almost unmanageable to navigate, especially during combat sessions. The control of the units is on the one hand identical to that of a classic RTS, with the weight, however, of a micromanagement inspired by RPGs, which makes the supervision of the interfaces hell. The menus begin to overlap on the map until a considerable portion of it disappears. In fact, each creature can be armed and upgraded with experience points, but being able to manipulate them in real time during a battle is frankly utopian. We end up trying to prepare the units for the worst, then adjusting the tactics by dint of loading, until we find the most suitable combination to face the enemy. It should also be emphasized that the clashes are those that one would expect from an MMORPG like World of WarCraft, where all that remains is to stand by and watch as the troops carry out the actions given, stationary in place and completely autonomous. In Stranger, however, even the casting of spells takes place without the user's intervention, who has no choice but to run away if he sees that the situation is about to escalate. It goes without saying that it is a deadly bore, destined to procrastinate one level after another. What's the point of complicating the gameplay so much if you can't do anything but observe, remains a mystery. It is true that to defeat certain adversaries one can resort to petty tricks such as retreating and finishing them with blows from a distance, or climbing a hill from which to obtain a tactical advantage, but these are small expedients and the absolute flattening of actions leaves a bad taste in the mouth. For money, not for vocation Unfortunately Stranger suffers from poor game balance. If the menus are already a nightmare to navigate and certain actions are absolutely incomprehensible in their difficulty, the AI certainly does not spare the player time, who, like a loving father, must take care of every single unit of his army. First of all, the boys move with an embarrassing slowness. It is unacceptable that you stand by and watch your group which, as if it were at a summer camp, takes two minutes to cross the map. Not to mention that if all the selected units do not fit in the point where you click with the mouse, only some will follow the indication. It would be logical to expect that the others will crowd behind the first ones where possible, while instead there will be nothing left to do but select them one at a time. One can imagine what will happen to the last ones in line during an escape. Once in position, not much can be expected from a group of marksmen attacking the enemy at close range. It's a shame that these flaws take away from what would also be a varied and interesting world, with an enviable assortment of monsters and characters. In fact, there is no shortage of good ideas, such as forging weapons and magical springs, called criterion. the menus are a nightmare to navigate For money, not for vocation Even here, however, the lack of common sense is perplexing. In fact, to use a structure, we will first have to tear it down andthen repair it, which leads to another big dose of avoidable tedium. Once you have taken possession of a forge, the typical possibilities of a RPG still come to light, since with the accumulated magic stones it is possible to forge weapons and make them unique by associating them with certain spells, with a vast potential of modified war tools. However, it would have been interesting to have troops that know what they are doing in combat, with greater credibility in leveling enemies. Sometimes seeing a level 15 mercenary struggle to hold his own against level 3 wyverns is quite depressing. Similarly, the game throws enemies of an insurmountable level for the party, with the result of having to backtrack for whole minutes to recruit new troops or level up existing ones. This can be tolerated in an MMORPG, and even there it would be objectionable, but let alone if a player starts farming in Stranger. Developers have a duty to build immersive and fulfilling gameplay. Having fun is a right when playing. It is the wand and not the wizard that does the magic So let's come to the magic, the beating heart that feeds every periphery of Stranger's gameplay. This is a very interesting aspect of the game that deserves special attention. The whole world of Kron has magical sources, the criterions. Green, blue and red gems act as a bargaining chip to recruit mercenaries or forge alliances. However, much more can be done, even if the mechanics that regulate the use of magical resources is the most cumbersome of the entire system. In fact, gems have the power to feed the spells that descend from a certain color (there are not only the basic ones, but also their derivatives) and the simple possession of a certain type of gem makes the unit less vulnerable to some enemies. If this is fine when it comes to your hero, the idea becomes crazy as soon as you pass the tenth level, when you have to put your hand to substantial armies. It is absolutely not possible to distribute the gems among all the units, considering that they also serve as money and have the characteristic of being able to be melted down to create weapons or to enchant them. the game mechanics are static and not very involving It is the wand and not the wizard that does the magic Comment Stranger goes the extra mile in proposing excessively elaborate gameplay, a real jumble of gimmicks and references, which however turns out to be a house of cards at the first gust of wind. This doesn't want to be a snub, on the contrary, because the path taken by Fireglow is the right one, and a mix between RTS and GDR can prove successful in the sequels that are already in the pipeline. Unfortunately boredom is the number one enemy of this game, which together with a hellish menu system to navigate contributes to sinking the fun. In spite of the many creatures available and an advanced level of unit customization, the game mechanics are static and not very engaging. Fortunately, the ability to compete between eight players online keeps the morale of the most ardent fan high, who may still find the experience offered by Stranger interesting. However, in the absence of a specific interest, it is better to focus on other products.

To conceive a video game like Stranger you need to have a vision and bring out some courage. Creating a two-faced videogame Janus, with an RPG and an RTS face, is undoubtedly a refreshing idea for a market stingy with originality, but there is a real risk that the creature will escape the control of its creators, and that is which happened with the game developed by Fireglow Games. Strengthened by the experience gained with the Sudden Strike series, the boys thought of expanding the concept of real-time strategy by mixing a touch of Baldur's Gate and a few drops of Spellforce in the blender, with the result that the ideas born are many and stimulating. but the final product is difficult to digest. Let's start at the beginning, because the learning curve is steep and the tangled gameplay makes it difficult to explain. Let's start with the fact that for wanting to be an RPG fanasy, the script is certainly not exciting. In a remote holiday residence for magicians, someone breaks a rule on the use of the dark arts and since the culprit does not turn up, three pranksters are punished at random, according to the fascist custom in vogue in those parts. The three unfortunates are therefore forced to cross the threshold of Kront, falling into a world from which it seems there is no way back. These unfortunates will be the three heroes that we will then have to control during the 30 missions made available, and each of them will show off particular skills, in an attempt not to succumb to the punishment inflicted on them. Unfortunately, the narration is entrusted to a series of static comic-style screens, drawn without inspiration and visually mediocre. Patience, it's not the end of the world, let's rather see what to do with Steigar, Mordlok and Kagar, the three merry sorcerers who had to abandon the parties based on pink magic and young elves.", "date": "2007-12-19", "grade": null}
