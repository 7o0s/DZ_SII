Anyone anxious to return to the Baker house for a little longer can in fact buy Confidential Films Vol.1 for a few days, provided however that they have a PlayStation 4. The DLC has in fact landed on the Sony-branded console exclusively storm, before seeing the light also on PC and Xbox One on February 21st. It is also the first of the three contents included in the Season Pass, together with Confidential Films Vol.2, arriving soon, and another package on which, however, not much is known at the moment. A little over a week after the release of the game, we therefore regained our soul and courage, going to Dulvey to continue facing Mycomorphs and going to dinner with dear Marguerite. Let's find out together how it went! Endless dinner with Marguerite and Mycomorphs in Resident Evil 7 Confidential Footage Vol.1, DLC Waiting for dawn As the name of the package suggests, the contents of Confidential Footage Vol.1 are presented in the form of VHS video tapes, similar to those collected by Ethan Winters in the main mode of Resident Evil 7. In both cases, however, the protagonist of the game is put part to put us in the shoes of Clancy, the cameraman of the television show ~Sewer Gators~ already known on other occasions. So let's learn a few more fragments of what happened before Ethan's arrival in Louisiana, starting with the first mode of Confidential Films Vol.1 entitled Nightmare. The setting is the basement of the Baker house, also already seen in Resident Evil 7, where the protagonist is called to make his way through waves of enemies, waiting for dawn to come. It is therefore a mode purely devoted to action, derived from the ~Horde~ typology and specifically marked by the passing of hours inside the basement. Ever faster and stronger mycomorphs take turns to hunt down Clancy, who for his part can count on an arsenal made up of a large part of the weapons seen in Resident Evil 7, plus some upgrades that can allow him to assert himself against a number of opponents so fed. To buy items of equipment, however, you must collect the materials that are distributed by the compactors in the area, thus forcing the player to move between the rooms of the map instead of standing still in one place waiting for the enemies to arrive. Traps, turrets and other elements come to our aid as we try to accomplish the feat, facing an undoubtedly satisfying gameplay. The desire to clash against other Mycomorphs was in fact among the sensations that we had left after completing Resident Evil 7 in the review phase, and from this point of view Nightmare falls like cheese on macaroni. Between limited resources, claustrophobic environments and enemies in droves, this mode can also be seen as an answer offered to those who had accused the game of being too easy in normal mode, given the hard time it is able to give even the most navigated. The level of longevity is also good. The porridge is ready The second videocassette that is offered to us by Filmati Confidenziali Vol.1 is entitled The room. With it you totally jump from one post to another compared to Incubo, going to face a completely opposite gaming experience to the one described in the previous paragraph. In this case, in fact, we find ourselves tied to one of the Bakers' beds, to witness shortly after Marguerite enters the room to offer us one of her delicious delicacies based on unidentified offal. Once the woman has left the room, the protagonist will be able to free himself from the grip that tightens his wrist, thus trying to escape from the clutches of the family. Not being able to do it from the front door, Clancy will have to invent something to find a secondary exit, in a type of game that is particularly reminiscent of the escape rooms present in the real world. In fact, to escape from the bedroom you have to solve a series of puzzles, completely in line with the style and setting of Resident Evil 7. Without spoiling the pleasure of solving all the puzzles by yourself, we limit ourselves to telling you that some of the actions carried out in the room they will end up making noise and thus calling Marguerite, who will enter the room to check that everything is in the initial conditions. After having attracted Marguerite's attention, it is therefore necessary to restore everything to its initial state, while a countdown indicates how much is left at the entranceof the woman. By succeeding in this task he manages to avoid unleashing Marguerite's ire, only to resume her attempt to escape once she has gone away. To enjoy this second part of Confidential Films Vol.1 will therefore be above all those who have appreciated the distressing atmosphere of the main chapter, in particular the famous initial dinner and in general the early stages of the game. Ethan has to die In a certain way, the first two parts of Confidential Movies Vol.1 show us pieces of the story of Resident Evil 7, unlike the third mode included in the DLC. It is called Ethan must die, and puts us in the shoes of the protagonist of the main adventure in a mini-game, intended to put our patience to the test. Starting from the Baker house garden, we need to complete the objectives that are proposed to us, but the problem is that we can count on very few inventory items. The enemies, on the other hand, are enhanced and able to kill us even with a single blow, while the field of vision is further reduced to ensure that whoever is in front of the screen proceeds with a level of safety close to zero. The title of the minigame therefore derives from the cyclical way in which you end up dying over and over again: with each attempt it is possible to count on different elements, obtained by breaking the crates that are around. When we are lucky we can find a firearm with which to move with greater confidence, but it can also happen that we find ourselves in hand with a medical herb, thus being forced to slalom among the Mycomorphs in order not to get killed. The only objection we feel to making against Confidential Films Vol.1 is that some of its elements could perhaps have been included by Capcom in the base package of Resident Evil 7, as an extra. Putting this consideration aside, it is undoubtedly a very good value DLC, especially if purchased as part of the Season Pass to which it is linked. The different gaming experiences offered by the three modes included in the package allow you to spend a few more ~pleasant~ hours in the company of the Bakers and the creatures that populate their home, waiting to find out what the next additional content will reserve for us.", "date": "2017-02-04", "grade": null}
