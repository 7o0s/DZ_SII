Despite the poor performance in cinemas, however, George Miller's dancing penguins have not missed the traditional appointment with the video game for home and portable consoles, so that even this Christmas film fans can have fun impersonating the merry clique of Mambo and Co. . With Christmas just around the corner, we decided to try the game to find out if it's worth adding an extra gift box under the tree. Watch where you step! Happy Feet 2: The Video Game is clearly a product aimed at an audience of very young people, while not disdaining a good level of graphic design all in all. The penguin models are pleasant and detailed, as is the suggestive Antarctic setting, with its thousand icebergs and frozen islands which, if you have a suitable screen, you can also appreciate in stereoscopic 3D. Visually, in short, the game tries hard not to look like a product for kids sold at a budget price, although the shortcomings are to be found elsewhere. Happy Feet 2 is an extremely simple, almost trivial platformer, which predictably focuses a large part of its ideas on the musical component and on the protagonists' ability to dance. When one of the cubs of the penguin family has disappeared, Mambo sets off on his search by scouring far and wide every corner of the island, sliding along the icy slopes and being followed by other friends he meets along the way: the purpose of each level is in fact to to find all the penguins scattered around, convince them to follow and proceed overcoming the few obstacles along the way. The challenge is mainly represented by the fact that some areas are accessible only after having found a certain number of penguins, who must be convinced to join us through a small mini-game in which to press a key with the right rhythm. A dash of variety is added from a few more advanced levels, through a series of sliding competitions or a handful of challenges in which you perform dances by pressing the right keys at the right time. Despite the attempt to add meat to the fire, unfortunately, Happy Feet 2 risks proving slow and monotonous even for a child: in the exploratory phases there is no challenge or big danger that adds bite to the experience, and most of the time one simply wanders around the room collecting all the notes scattered here and there while continuing to dance non-stop. Between jumps, QTEs and sudden changes of direction, the sliding races are certainly the most frenetic, although the excessive duration and lack of variety mean that the player is already tired halfway through the descent. It is also inexplicable how, in an adventure centered entirely on the love of music and the pleasure of dancing from morning to night, the sound component is one of the most questionable aspects: exactly like that of the film, the soundtrack ranges from hip songs -hop to funk pieces, from samba to Jamaican reggae, and those who have appreciated the music in the cinema will have nothing to say about those present in the game. The real problem, however, is represented by the way in which very short sound clips repeat themselves continuously from the beginning to the end of the level, enticing the player to quickly reach the end of the level or, more simply, to turn down the TV volume. In short, Happy Feet 2 is a title recommended only and only to an audience of very young people who are extremely fond of the cinematographic film, who, in order to impersonate their favorites and launch themselves into bizarre tap-dancing between frozen plains, let the the general monotony of the game. Comment Visually pleasing A nice gift for super-fans of the movie... ...but a bad gift for everyone else Very superficial gameplay Very repetitive musical accompaniment", "date": "2011-12-22", "grade": null}
