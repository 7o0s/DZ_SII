Let's talk about the planet, of course (better to specify). At least this is what Offworld Trading Company suggests, the new title by Soren Johnson, lead designer of Civilization IV, now at work for Stardock, which fields an economic war between multinationals, fought on the surface of the red planet, made up of economic assessments , stock exchange lists and low blows... very low. Mars has six resources to exploit, which are randomly distributed across the maps as they spawn at the start of each game. Once our base of operations has been positioned, possibly in the vicinity of the resources most useful to our strategy, we need to choose what to start extracting, building the appropriate infrastructure. The base itself has five levels of growth, which involve a greater exploitation of resources and, above all, the possibility of occupying more boxes, thus being able to increase the volume of business (but also the need for energy, oxygen, water and food) . The construction and management system is overall very simple and direct, given that a couple of clicks are enough to erect a building, while the information needed by the player is all clearly visible on the screen: on the left side there is the resource column, with relative market values, on the right there are the competing companies (upper part) and the various illegal actions that can be carried out (lower part). The latter are used to slow down the opponents, but also to get some bonuses in an unorthodox way. We will talk about it in a dedicated paragraph. Even the map itself is easily readable and does not present particular difficulties of interpretation. Everything is immediate. In the advanced stages of the game you can build special buildings, such as a patent office to exploit the rights to some discoveries, or a recreation center to improve your financial situation, or even a black market to make greater profits with sales. Basic resources are used to create more complex goods, such as electronics, chemicals, and so on. In short, apparently Offworld Trading Company does not seem to be very different from the other strategic ones, in truth it has elements that make it unique. How do multinationals fight each other while simultaneously pretending to respect the rules? Before we find out, let's delve into the game a bit. Sabotages and takeovers in the review of Offworld Trading Company, management for PC Game mode Offworld Trading Company offers several game modes. Our first steps are guided by a rich tutorial, which explains the rudiments and illustrates the differences between the (generally productive) factions through not exactly exceptional dialogues. The other modes are single player campaign, classic AI skirmishes and online skirmishes. It will seem strange, but the focus of the game is not the campaign, but the skirmish mode. In fact, the campaign itself provides some variations to the victory conditions, which are illustrated from mission to mission, but does not offer anything that alters the basic game scheme too much. Above all, it offers nothing more in terms of the overall experience. Offworld Trading Company is clearly intended as a quick play title. A skirmish lasts a maximum of thirty minutes. For this reason it does not foresee major complications in terms of production and resource management. In the time of a game, our company must be founded, after having scanned the surface of the map to look for the best place to place it, and developed to the maximum. In the next game you start from scratch. A similar structure, very light for the genre, does not suit the campaign mode, which instead provides a link between the various missions and a kind of story to follow. You don't lose much by not playing it. Mohawk Games has completely changed the pace of a usually slow genre. The technical part of the title itself seems to reflect this approach: the surface of Mars is graphically essential, as are the buildings, which pay off when viewed from a certain distance, but are obviously not meant to be admired up close. They're not ugly, but it's clear that the developers were more interested in their functionality than in making them amazing. Play dirty Let's say one of our opponents is making a lot of money from geothermal energy production. Good for him? Not exactly. Our goal, at least during a skirmish, is for rivals' shares to lose value, so that we can buy shares of them and finally assimilate them completely, turning their companies intoour subsidiaries. So why not go for some serious sabotage to block energy production? In doing so, the victim will have to turn to the market to meet his energy needs, increasing his debt. Its shares will be weakened and it will be easier to buy them. What we have done is just one of many feasible examples of disruption. In short, Offworld Trading Company, beyond the management part, is a race to see who does it dirtiest, identifying weaknesses in the rivals' production chain and investing in targeted attacks. But let's take another example. One of the purchasable special buildings is a hacking tower that allows you to send false information to the market by influencing it for a short time. What is it for? Let's say, for example, that we want to increase the price of a good of which we have large stocks, in order to sell them with the maximum profit: it will be enough to make believe that there is a shortage of them to see the price skyrocket. Or we can do exactly the opposite, that is to say that there is a surplus of availability of a certain good, perhaps one on which the production of a rival is focused, so as to see its price collapse. There would be many more feasible examples, but we believe they will be enough. Suffice it to say that between EMP attacks, paid revolts, goods sold on the black market, resources exploited despite not having rights to a certain territory and so on, the advanced phases of Offworld Trading Company are a continuous aiming under the fence trying to do the most bad as possible, working at the same time to limit the damage caused by equally ambitious and unfair opponents. Obviously the difficult thing is to understand how and where to intervene, in order not to carry out empty attacks. To do this, you need to learn to observe your opponents and evaluate their economic performance. The advice is to initially play against the CPU to develop a good overview that allows you to quickly identify the characteristics of the opposing companies. Sure, it's not the same as challenging other humans, but when you're still immature, the single player offers the great advantage of the pause button, which allows you to examine the map in peace. Moreover, it must be said that by selecting the higher difficulty levels, the challenge is still exciting, especially when all the available factions have been unlocked.", "date": "2016-05-03", "grade": "8.0"}
