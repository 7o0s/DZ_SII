The ~Friendly~ is nothing more than the evolution of the previous mode where we will be able to choose between different options, namely: level of difficulty, duration of the match, presence or absence of extra time, which teams will participate in the match and even the stadium where we will go to collide with the opposing team. The ~Penalties~ mode is a pleasant diversion that allows you to train both in the execution and in the 'parade' of the classic eleven-meter shots in case, in crucial matches, we should run into this decisive session for the outcome of many matches . The remaining modes give access to the most famous tournaments and championships by choosing our favorite team from a large list of national and international teams. Does it seem to be there? The completion and eventual victory of a specific championship will allow us to raise the relative trophy to the sky, there are seven prizes that we will have to win, which will make a fine show on our virtual bulletin board accessible from the options menu on the screen main of the game. The number of teams available is also very large, i.e. 72 of which 32 are international and 16 are club teams with a further 24 teams that will be unlocked as we win the various titles up for grabs. As already mentioned, our virtual players will have the same names as their real-life counterparts; for example, in the case of Juventus, we will have to deal with the various Buffon, Nedved, Emerson, etc., obviously all with peculiar characteristics, both technical and physical such as attack, defense, speed, technique and agility, such as to make them the most close to reality as possible. The individual characteristics can then always be kept under control, during the match, thanks to an arrow-shaped icon placed next to the name of the selected player which, through direction and color, will indicate the position and physical condition of the player in question, in this way you can act tactically and if he gets injured or is simply tired, replace him with whoever is currently on the bench. shooting in the stands! controls are, at least at the beginning, a bit difficult but the learning curve is not the steepest and after a while you can easily master the movements of our favorites. We can move diagonally using the 1,3,7 and 9 keys while with 2, 8, 4 and 6 we will move in the classic four cardinal directions, with the 5 key we will make a pass if we are in possession of the ball, or a tackle against an opponent in the immediate vicinity if he will have the ball, the 0 button is associated with the cross while the # button is associated with the shot. The latter is certainly not among the simplest operations to perform because, in addition to the difficulty due to dribbling towards the goal of the opposing team, we will be asked to take a look at the aim bar, located at the bottom left of the screen, which will be activated at the moment of the shot and which must be stopped in the orange zone to be able to give the ball an effective trajectory and therefore direct it towards the mirror, gratified by a replay sequence in the event of a goal.
