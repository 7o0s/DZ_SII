This Vita da Recruta is of the first case, which for 29 offers 19 mini-games with a (humorous) military background for one to four players. It is possible to challenge each other both together using four controllers, and to play alternating with the commands of a single Wiimote / Nunchuk pair. The game is represented with a rather nice cartoon graphic when clearly dedicated to the little ones, just as the dialogues, all in Italian, of the sergeant who will take charge of our training are suitable for them. Sergeant who, to forge real soldiers, will engage the players with push-ups, in the kitchen peeling potatoes or washing the dishes, or outdoors and even in space in guerrilla action. However, everything that is represented is in line with what one might see in a children's cartoon and is absolutely harmless. We were saying that the count of mini-games reaches nineteen, and they can be played both in free mode and in war mode, where in a sort of risk, the player who wins a game gains control of a territory until the final count which will decree the winner of the match, and finally into campaign mode, where a single player will take on challenge after challenge until they become a model soldier. All these modes share the recording of scores which will form a ranking for each game. Sinist-dest, forward march! The minigames almost always require the use of the Wiimote and Nunchuck coupling and confront us with different types of use. From pointing to the screen to target enemies, to driving military vehicles, to miming the required poses, up to the frantic and restless shaking of the same. Although there are nineteen games in all, many of them repeat themselves in the use of controls, making them very similar to each other. Also considering that most of these are very elementary both in terms of objective and as a control, we find ourselves with the sense of always performing the same actions without drawing great interest and enjoyment from them. Although the game is intended for children, its creation is all too simple, and leaving out the very fluid and colorful graphics and the humor that accompanies the game, the rest appears rather approximate, from the game modes, to the extreme simplicity of the challenges. In fact, the various games are rather unrelated to each other and there is no reason to play them. Playing the campaign or playing in free mode makes no difference, except in the possibility of unlocking items that we can use to customize our character. Among the options there is the possibility of increasing the difficulty level but also in this case the level of challenge remains rather low and suitable only for the little ones. The market is crowded with this type of games and even looking at Ubisoft it is easy to find something more complete, and one of the reasons why Vita da Recruta could be preferred to the others is given by the fact that all players can participate using only one pair of controllers, an option that however is often also supported by other games.", "date": "2010-03-05", "grade": null}
