The first Subnautica arrived in 2018, taking video game enthusiasts by surprise. Up until that moment, we had in fact seen very, very few games set in the deep sea, and in any case none with a rich and multifaceted gameplay like the one that supports the adventure packaged by Unknown Worlds Entertainment, an American development team that was born in 2001 developing mods for the immortal Half-Life. An unexpected success Subnautica: Below Zero: this new chapter of the game will also push us out of the water, allowing us to face new and no less exciting challenges Subnautica quickly became a huge success, one of the most loved games among the independent productions of which it is clearly a part, reaching six million copies sold at the beginning of 2020. But the players who have ventured into the alien seas of the game are actually many more: Subnautica was one of the most appreciated games given away by the Epic Store, and one of the most downloaded through the Play At Home program of PlayStation. The game in question takes advantage of all the most popular indie trends: there is a lot of exploration, you have to survive looking for materials and food to build increasingly complex and decisive equipment, and for those who love a more permanent approach it is also possible to build more or less complex submarine bases. The peculiarity, in fact, is that everything takes place underwater, but it is not the only one: Subnautica is also a great science fiction game with a mysterious, captivating plot. Welcome back to 4546B Subnautica: Below Zero: Welcome back to 4546B, but this time in a much more rugged region than the ones we learned about in the previous game. From 2018 to today, Unknown Worlds Entertainment has worked on three different fronts: perfecting and refining Subnautica itself, building the foundations for the new project known as Future Perfect and developing this Subnautica: Below Zero. We are not faced with a real sequel, but with what today we could define as a standalone expansion. To enjoy Below Zero, it is therefore not necessary to own or have installed the first Subnautica or have played it, although previous experience greatly facilitates things. In any case, this new adventure set in the Arctic region of the same planet as Subnautica, the mysterious and fascinating 4546B, is one that leaves its mark. A mobile base Subnautica: Below Zero: no, combat is certainly not a central element in Subnautica, don't expect machine guns and sniper rifles... The experience is more limited than the classic Subnautica: the map is less vast even if it will take time to get to its edges, while the renewed verticality tries to rebalance the spaces for the new formula. Even the advancement, technological and narrative, has become tighter and less dispersive than previously, although even in Subnautica: Below Zero that indispensable exploration remains to make us feel alone and in danger on an alien planet. It takes much less time to build the first electronic marvels that will make our survival more comfortable, while also allowing us to broaden our range. The turning point will come when we have finally built the Seatruck: the most tempting novelty of Below Zero is in all respects a mobile base from which it is possible to release the cockpit for safer and more effective exploration. Freezing cold Subnautica: Below Zero: The new biomes are a sight to explore, and not just because they are actually beautiful to look at Subnautica: Below Zero also introduces another factor to keep an eye on constantly: body temperature, which will go alongside the usual indicators that show the level of hunger, thirst and oxygen available to the protagonist. In the water, the temperature is almost never a problem, but it will become so when we have to venture into the snow-covered territories that this region of the planet offers and to which, sooner or later, we will have to extend our exploration. To overcome this problem, we will have to make sure we stay indoors long enough to get rid of the cold, use the ecosystem to our advantage by discovering and learning how to exploit the different heat sources present on 4546B. Subnautica: Below Zero: not only is the planet's ecosystem full of extraordinary plants, minerals and creatures, but each of these elements is associated with a rich description that will make the exploration of 4546B always very interesting As in the first game, Subnautica: Below Zero doesn't really have m'sisions to follow: the direction will be suggested to us by audio files, radio messages and documents that will silently show us the way forward which most of the time will take us deeper and deeper, from the ocean to the compelling narrative plot. And as we venture into the icy waters of Below Zero, its astonishing ecosystem will also get more exciting, introducing creatures that are stranger, bigger and more terrifying than you would expect. Horror veins that will have to be faced more with intelligence than with brute force, given the absence of a real war arsenal. Polygons and waves Subnautica: Below Zero: are you looking for completely new emotions? This is the game for you The adventure would not be so exciting if Subnautica, the original and even more so this Subnautica: Below Zero were not so fascinating also from an artistic point of view. The work done in creating the game space is once again exceptional, for the sake of those who still think that independent games are created with five colors and as many polygons. One flaw, in truth, both Subnautica have: a pop-up that will often bring up elements of the scenario with a certain annoying lack of grace. But it's a single barb in a sea of constant wonder.", "date": "2021-05-18", "grade": "8.5"}
