The situation of these first months of 2017 has not gone unnoticed by the owners of the peripheral, who with a hint of concern have begun to wonder about Sony's plans for it. PlayStation VR is therefore now at a crucial point in its existence, with the big names limited to the excellent Resident Evil 7, while titles like Farpoint and Star Trek: Bridge Crew are still a few weeks away from us. A phase in which it is essential to keep interest in the viewer alive, even through projects that on paper may be considered minor, but from which pleasant surprises can always arrive: this is precisely the hope of WhiteMoon Dreams, the independent team that developed Starblood Arena exclusively for PlayStation VR. As we are about to see, it is a shooter characterized by total freedom of movement. Starblood Arena can be fun, but it lacks the means to be interesting in the long run Blood and sand Starblood Arena aims straight at its shooter soul, completely giving up the attempt to provide players with a plot: the only sketch we have in this sense sounds more like an excuse to beat each other up. Apparently, in the future, television viewers will like to continue sprawling on the sofa as they do now, but instead of watching a football match, they will prefer to admire spaceships piloted by various types of creatures, busy shooting each other with different types of weapons. Given the genre to which it belongs, the effort of WhiteMoon Dreams obviously leverages the main multiplayer mode, within which it is possible to find a set of game types that starts from the inevitable single or team deathmatch. Instead, the inspiration for the Gridiron mode comes directly from Rocket League, in which you have to throw the ball into the opponent's area to accumulate points: also in this case there are explosions, but the type of game requires at least on paper the development of a different strategy than the frantic shooting. The last mode is the cooperative one proposed by Invasion, in which players are called to face waves of enemies. The various options dedicated to multiplayer can actually also be played in single player, thanks to the presence of bots controlled by artificial intelligence: however, it seems superfluous to say that the single player should only be seen as a training step, before making its debut online to discover all the potential of Starblood Arena. The only problem in this sense, at least for now, is the matchmaking: in the first days after the launch of the game it happened to wait even several minutes before being able to find a match. The situation hasn't improved much at the moment, given that several days after the release of Starblood Arena it also takes a few moments too long to find a game. The WhiteMoon Dreams guys have already said they are working to make matchmaking more satisfactory, which at present, however, proves to be well below the sufficiency also due to what seems to be a not exactly excellent diffusion of the game. Playstation 4 trophies The diehards of completion at all costs can find bread for their teeth, given that Starblood Arena has the beauty of 55 trophies divided between 1 platinum, 1 gold, 11 silver and 42 bronze. The objectives are linked to all aspects of the game, starting from the performance in online ranked matches in the various modes up to the use of certain characters or weapons for a certain number of times. Rewarded even those who decide to kill themselves spontaneously. In all directions In terms of pure game mechanics, Starblood Arena picks up the baton left by EVE: Valkyrie and RIGS at the launch of PlayStation VR. Compared to these two titles, the game created by WhiteMoon Dreams tries to leverage the concept of ~six degrees of freedom~, found in past games such as Descent and Forsaken. Put simply, the spacecraft we control has the ability to move in three-dimensional space, floating through the three different axes that make it up. In addition to going forward or backward, right or left, it is in fact possible to go up or down with the spacecraft using the controller's back buttons, possibly pressing them in combination to control the inclination of your vehicle. The aim is taken with the movements of the head, which then act as a pointer to direct the fire thatis fired from its own ship's arsenal. A series of elements that would seem capable of giving serious headaches in terms of motion sickness, which however surprisingly does not make itself felt as much as one might fear. Even if we are aware of the subjectivity of this type of problems related to virtual reality, as people particularly predisposed to suffer from motion sickness we can say that we have passed the initial adaptation phase unscathed, getting used to the movements made within Starblood Arena quickly enough. A sign that developers are learning to manage this aspect of virtual reality games even when they belong to more lively genres, and this can only please us. However, the decision to reduce the duration of the games to a few minutes is also wise, to allow players not to get excessively tired in a single session that is too long. Once inside the ship, Starblood Arena obviously gives its best: the waved six-degree freedom is reflected in a control system that requires a little exercise at the beginning, subsequently giving great satisfaction in engaging against enemies . Good diversification between the characteristics of the various characters, linked to classic figures such as sniper, tank and so on. For a few hours, Starblood Arena undoubtedly manages to be fun, but it is in the long run that the situation becomes a little more problematic. From the point of view of content, as already described, after removing the two deathmatch modes and the other two ~surrounding~ modes, there is very little left, with the feeling of having already seen everything in a short time ready to arrive inexorably. A problem that also afflicts Starblood Arena from a stylistic point of view, obviously inspired by Overwatch without however being able to touch the distinctive peaks of the Blizzard home title. Just as the characters are not particularly memorable, the same can also be said of the maps, theoretically in good number since there are twelve in total, but rather depressing in terms of design and variety. A good possibility of personalization for the characters intervenes to improve the fate, which however fails to overshadow the more obvious problems.", "date": "2017-04-21", "grade": "6.5"}
