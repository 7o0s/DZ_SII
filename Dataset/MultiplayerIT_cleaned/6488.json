There are two factors that weigh the most on what is proposed by NdCUBE and more generally on this type of software: the richness of the proposed package and the recommended selling price. We focus on this last element because it will help you to assimilate and digest much better the points in favor but especially the criticisms encountered. Mario Party 10 has an average list price of only 39.90, exactly like Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. With such an aggressive policy, the intention is clearly to favor the attach-rate and keep the software alive in the long term; however, there is a marked difference between the two exponents of the budget line. Although a complete and absolutely classy product, Captain Toad is more like a prized spin-off, a little jewel that makes quality and ideas the center of its brief experience; Mario Party 10, on the other hand, is an official chapter on the home console, so the choice to make it even more horizontal than it already is by nature is welcome. And now let's untangle the festive skein. Mario Party 10 comes to Wii U with ideas and mini-games, but it's quantity that trumps quality Sliced board Finally reaching the goal of double digits, Mario Party is divided into three, a characteristic that at least reflects a certain maturity achieved by the team. NdCUBE chooses a well-defined approach, separating the rules right from the start, helping to bring clear expectations out of each modality, which can be shaped according to the social situation of the moment. This is also the juncture in which we introduce you to the first revision of amiibo: the new series made up of figurines from the Mario Party series - to be clear, those with a red base and boardgame poses - was developed to complement our already full amiibo crammed with Smash Bros data, other blank models, then free to be filled with Mario Party advances. The above takes us to the amiibo Party mode, the true incarnation of the historical soul of the saga, in which four characters collide for the domination of the coins with which to buy the stars; yes, it seems incredible but the 20-year spirit is right here. Operation is simple but fun, albeit limited in ambition: the board is nothing more than a square made up of angled quadrants, in which well-known boxes alternate such as gain and loss of coins, pipes for moving, unforeseen events, specific events and other. Objective? Earn as many coins as possible to buy stars and win the game; as per tradition, at the end of each round a minigame will make the contenders collide. To distance the specter of vintage, two inextricably linked components burst in: amiibo and tokens. The former are necessary to collect the latter, the latter guarantee that extra something to move the bridge: the skills range from simple jumping to the space containing the star up to modifying the dials based on the character/token in one's possession. It will not be uncommon to start a board in one mode and find it completely modified at the end of the game; a gimmick that continuously swaps the cards and colors each quadrant with uniqueness. The problem is that the differences are not exactly overwhelming: we would have appreciated a greater emphasis on characterizing them in a punitive way with traps, obstacles, particularities that would make the passage more difficult and satisfying, increasing the importance of the mini-games. NdCUBE, on the other hand, kept a low profile, focusing more on the aesthetic fan-service rather than purely playful, condensed in what has already been exposed. You will find many tokens and the search for collectibles will make you return over and over again; pity only for a barely graceful mode which, given the ideas in the field, could truly become epochal with a little more effort on the level design side. Furthermore, the practice of continuously placing the figurine on the NFC chip to roll the dice, register and finally use the token is forced in the long run: you pass the sensation of a moving pawn - certainly festive at the beginning - but at least the option to filter the routine could be inserted. A consideration on compatibility: there are nine amiibo that can be used as characters and as unlock-dials, all the others will guarantee a sort of scratch card that can be used once a day, with points up for grabs to spend in the shop. Better than nothing. Dragon on the hunt More than two years have passed since the timid peep of Wii U in the mercsati, a certainly difficult period in which the EAD Kyoto offices were unable to make us attach as much as we would have liked to a key accessory such as the GamePad. Are we therefore facing the desired turning point? Not yet; those of Mario Party 10 are shy little steps forward and although the path is the right one, we would have expected a greater focus. But let's go in order. The Bowser Party mode is self-explanatory: three boards of increasing length and complexity in which the dragon, controllable with the GamePad by a possible fifth player, has the objective of reaching the party of four from turn to turn, who in turn they will have to do everything to escape and keep enough hearts to get to the star. Let's start immediately on a positive note: the game is absolutely balanced and fun even in single. During the various sessions, in the face of a good general knowledge of the challenges, the intelligent management of the dice allowed the party to always reach the final stages, sometimes winning; a practical demonstration of a luck factor on the dashboard which, although present, manages to keep a discrete slice and not the entirety of the cake. Unexpectedly, it is precisely the games that partially betray the expectation: only 10 are in fact exclusive to the mode with Bowser as the protagonist - those capable of making sense of the GamePad - but just half of them are valid enough to entertain in the medium term. Considering the absolute goodness of the idea of making Bowser a controllable character, we believe the narrow range of choice as well as a gameplay design that is not sufficiently based on skill on the pad were missed opportunities; the brand will hardly be able to return to the playful glories of the past if the team continues to stuff an already limited package with clearly minor ideas or sometimes based on luck, which have always been universally recognized as fillers of dubious identity. There is the possibility to try your hand at games at will, combined with a sort of competition in which to compete for the heart collection record by making them all in a row. Gamepads This time, off-screen play is not supported. It is not possible to play by looking exclusively at the small screen of the Wii U as most of the modes will require the use of the television and Wiimote; the Bowser Party mode uses it only in minigames while amiibo Party in the management of tokens. Four jumps Let's leave new technologies aside and go back to the apex of the Wiimote revolution. The Mario Party mode has its roots in the historic board race in which four players compete for the highest number of stars, obtainable inside and outside the challenges. The team opts to increase the number of courses to five, with a design of increasing quality; the competition once again engages in battles of all against all, two against two or one against the rest, this time with dozens of mini-games available, shared with the amiibo Party mode. The statistics help: the choice is abundantly above the qualitative average, with arcade-style fun entrusted to the directional cross and some less successful ideas, in which pointing and movement sensors are disturbed with almost ten years on the shoulders. There's not much new under the sun: boss fights, battle access rules, events and scoreboard modification triggers follow well-known standard dictates but soiled by a main problem. Deprived of the automatic mini-game at the end of the round, the playful fulcrum is entrusted to the randomness of the path, the dice and the hope of ending up in the right VS square, with a rather heavy impact on the actual perceived gain in fun. Due to unfortunate coincidences, some sessions have reached negative peaks of 3-4 challenges in about 25 minutes of play; very few, imperceptible in the economy of a game. Representing the soul of every Mario Party, we do not share the algorithm that currently regulates its functioning and incidence rate. There is no shortage of free challenges and tournaments; to increase the lot also intervenes the inclusion of some very simple external pastimes. NdCUBE closes the circle by inserting some well-known extras: a shop where you can spend the Mario Party points you have accumulated, a photo section of the models and a player of the purchased music.", "date": "2015-03-16", "grade": "7.0"}
