{"name": "Imperator: Rome", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/imperator-rome-recensione.html", "text": "Imperator: Rome, whose review you are reading, is one of those strategists who initially crush you. Observing it, you recognize the 4X structure, but at the same time you realize that its forest of menus hides much more than you could have dreamed of. Paradox Interactive has decided to continue on the path that made it great and has created an uncompromising title that honors classics such as Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis. In reality we are faced with a game that tries to take the good things done by its predecessors by mixing everything in the most effective way possible. Let's clarify one point right away: describing every single function of Imperator: Rome is practically impossible. The interface is made up of so many menus, in turn filled with so many buttons, that it can leave you bewildered. The same happened with the other Paradox strategy games, but here even fans will need some time to acclimatize with all the new features. There's actually a tutorial that cleverly doesn't waste time explaining individual buttons, but sets goals to achieve and explains how to do it. Unfortunately it is not very complete and many important information is lost along the way, which must be deduced by playing. After all, the problem with similar titles, at least for the average player, is not so much understanding that from the religion menu it is possible to make sacrifices to the gods, but understanding how the different sectors influence each other and how each of our actions ends up producing effects on the internal governance and relations with neighboring countries. Unfortunately it would have been practically impossible to create a tutorial that included every possible game situation, so in a certain sense we have to be satisfied and start Imperator: Rome aware that before starting to play with full awareness of what is happening on the screen you have to dedicate more than a few hours to it . 304 BC Games of Imperator: Rome start in 304 BC. Unlike other strategic, it does not allow you to select only some of the factions on the map, with the others as a contour, but one of all the populations of the time included in a geographical area that extends from Europe to India . Obviously there are some countries recommended because they are more structured, such as Rome or Egypt, but if you want you can select the Tsang region in Tibet and start from there. Part of the difficulty level of a game is determined precisely by the chosen nation: Rome, for example, immediately has excellent resources, a fairly large territory and an advanced form of government, while Boras, to name another nation, has less population, a smaller army and a more primitive political organization, as well as fewer technologies available. The game map is fully 3D and much more dynamic than that seen in other Paradox titles, including Europa Universalis IV. Depending on the zoom level and the selected view type, it provides valuable information about our and other countries by eye. The player's goal is simple: expand. How to do it is up to us and here, so to speak, the fun begins. The matches of Imperator: Rome change enormously depending on the selected nation. For example, a monarchy offers very different internal issues than a republic. Take the descent into war: a monarchy offers a much more direct approach, since it is the ruler who decides. At the very least, too much aggression can cause discontent in the population, but for example, there is no need for a vote in the Senate to decide whether or not to attack someone. A republic, on the other hand, requires a much more lateral approach. For example, before declaring war on someone, it is always better to artificially create reasons for discontent so as to have a strong casus belli to use to obtain the positive vote of the Senate. The type of government also greatly changes internal and external power relations, such as those with the families of potentates who form the ruling class of our nation. All these aspects, to which are added many not mentioned such as the possibility of researching new technologies, that of managing the creed of the population, and the immense diplomatic side (to which we will dedicate a few more words in a subsequent paragraph) make every game of Imperator : Rome is a challenge in itself, which can go on for dozens of hours and which always offers new stimuli to the player. Fight After the initial run-in, Imperator: Rome is able to give great satisfaction. In particular, the military side has been treated very much and offers a series of unprecedented options for the genre. Armies can be made up of different units, whether they are foot infantryi or on horseback, chariots, elephants, camels, and so on, and can take formations that give them advantages and disadvantages on the battlefield. This translates into the possibility of seeing large armies beaten or decimated by numerically much inferior teams. Also, depending on the troops, the CPU will tend to use different tactics. For this reason, before fighting, especially against the strongest nations, it becomes very important to know the enemy by sending scouts for reconnaissance. The type of region in which you will go to fight and the conformation of the map itself should also be taken into consideration. For example, Lazio does not present negative modifiers in terms of climate compared to the territories of Northern Europe, while the high mountain areas of mountain ranges such as the Alps create real funnels, such as the terrible one of Ambisontia, which can lead to massacres on large scale. In any case, the military side is much more than it can be expressed in words, also because it intertwines in a systemic way with the rest of the game. Apart from armies, for example, we need to consider the game of alliances between populations, which can lead to significant problems in strategic terms. For example, in a game at the helm of Rome we proved to be too aggressive with the neighboring populations by expanding rapidly, but without paying too much attention to diplomacy. So the other tribes ganged up on us and started making trouble for us, especially on the borders, slowing down our run towards empire. The battles started to get tougher, with more casualties in our ranks. Surprise attacks have multiplied, forcing us to spend more resources to upgrade our defenses. Obviously the population was not happy about it and productivity dropped quite a bit. The senate itself, initially all in our favor, began to require greater efforts to be convinced to vote for our manoeuvres, to the point of having received votes against. Our slowdown was to the full advantage of the adversaries who strengthened and managed to retake some border territories, where our defenses were less aggressive. To bargain We have therefore decided to halt the expansion for a few years (in terms of playing time), focusing on internal issues and trying to reconnect with some of the rival nations. By spending resources on gifts, spying, religious activities and research we have therefore managed to return in strength. In the meantime we limited ourselves to defending the borders and patrolling the seas with triremes, so as to avoid sudden ambushes, manipulating possible rivals with often even excessive displays of benevolence. In all of this, as you will have understood, diplomacy has played a fundamental role. From this point of view Imperator: Rome is the best game on the market, not much to say. What you don't get on the battlefield, you can get by convincing, bribing, allying with the right nations or spending to support rebel forces who want to overthrow incumbent governments. Even the army can be used in a diplomatic sense, for example by attacking a rival nation of another with which we are interested in establishing relations, or by creating alliances between nations that have a common enemy. At the beginning, one is almost bewildered by the number of possibilities offered, but when one understands the differences and potential, it is impossible not to get involved. We really struggle to remember such a complete strategy from a diplomatic point of view in which the choices made by the player have logical and, if you like, historically consistent consequences, without appearing to be entrusted to arbitrary factors that immediately reveal the artificial nature of the system itself. It should also be noted that the artificial intelligence manages to manage diplomacy in a sensible way even where the player has no role. Other Imperator: Rome is much more than what we have described. As you should have understood, the numerous systems from which it is composed work together to create a coherent gameplay which, once the interface has been internalized, tells the evolution of the guided nation and the neighboring territories in a very effective way. To back everything up there are also a series of events and choices relating to the micromanagement of the population that make the games even more interesting. For example, how to deal with slavery? Slaves improve our productivity, make propertied families happy, but at the same time they lower the nation's level of happiness and can cause public order problems. Focusing on slavery also increases expansionary hunger, because to keep the slave population high, new territories must always be conquered. What about religion? Favoring the beliefs of the people is important to keep them good, but at the same time some cults can conflict with certain choices made. In short, you will surely have understood that we are dealing with a title of rare complexity, not suitable for everyone, but precisely for this reason capable of offering more than most competitors, especially in the long run. The only flaws of Imperator: Rome are the lack of a few more information screens, with access to some data that is more complicated than it should be, and the management of tribal nations, worse than all other types of government because it is less thorough and lacking in uniqueness. Probably both problems will be fixed with updates and expansions, which the developers will not miss (just think of the post-launch support of their other titles such as Stellaris to be sure). One last note: unlike many other Paradox strategy games, Imperator: Rome has not shown major problems in terms of stability. In particular, it never crashed. It will seem strange to many to see this underlined, but those who know some of Paradox's previous titles know that it is no small achievement.", "date": "2019-04-25", "grade": "9.0"}
