Not even the time to realize what's happening that an incredible scene appears before the eyes: the spin doctor Cybill running down the street, chased by a huge red triangle inside which you notice a strange spiral. When, recovered from the shock and having laughed at a couple of apt jokes from Max, it becomes known that that strange geometric shape is none other than the legendary danger of Bermuda. A first part therefore still takes place within the usual neighborhood, just long enough to understand how serious the situation is and renew the knowledge of the usual suspects: a muted Bosco, dedicated as he is to the creation of a bunker, the little mouse now impresario also thanks to the giant robot previously shot down and, of course, the nice owner of the revived Stinky's Diner. After the first real enigma and with the relative move to Easter Island, the real beginning of adversity will occur, immediately becoming aware of the difficult mission assigned: to appease the boiling spirits of a volcano - and its divinity -, saving those present and trying to understand how this event can untie the other nodes of a well-constructed and pleasant plot. In general, the almost four hours of adventure slip away smoothly and without pause, thanks to non-revolutionary but rather varied puzzles adhering to narrative developments. The difficulty of the same cannot certainly be said to be high, leaving anyone with good margins of success without having to resort to particular expedients. The arcade sessions - first inserted and then continuously removed over the months - are now enhanced with the return of car racing, repeatable to obtain futile but fun decals, and with a couple of small skill tests, one of which is a really apt background music. The usual investigations with a twist Comment Sam & Max: Moai Better Blues manages not to disappoint expectations, confirming itself at the level of the previous chapter and repeating its quality. Where Ice Station Santa towered thanks to the continuous reference to Christmas traditions, in an irreverent and irreverent way, this still finds a charismatic setting albeit less linked to the collective imagination, completing it with some tasty variations and an interesting plot. As with all of TellTale's episodes to date, there's very little reason not to buy it.

After the Christmas holidays, the time has come to get back to work hard for the guys at Telltale Games who, after a break of a couple of months, are preparing to release the four missing episodes of this Sam & Max: Season 2 on a monthly basis. To inaugurate the new year is Moai Better Blues, an exotic and bizarre adventure that confirms the renewed globe-trotting soul of the detective duo, this time grappling with a mysterious entity out and about in the Pacific Ocean, more precisely on the fascinating Easter Island. The idea of giving variety by moving a large part of each episode within a larger and immediately recognizable setting has therefore been wisely maintained, relying in this case on the charm that the Chilean island has always been able to arouse, especially in relation to the huge stone heads  the moai, in fact  that populate the surface in hundreds of pieces. The screenplay therefore makes use of many references often associated with the legends that revolve around the Pacific seas, turning them in a comic key and bringing them to excesses, resulting in one of the funniest and light-hearted stories written for this new Sam & Max course.", "date": "2008-01-10", "grade": null}
