As we have already written, Touch! generations ~. Names such as Tetris DS, Nintendogs, Electroplankton, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Trauma Center are already part of it, all games with mechanics suitable for casual gamers, but absolutely attractive also for those who grew up on bread and consoles. A mix that has often characterized Nintendo productions, and that the Kyoto house is right to underline in a period in which greater technical potential seems to want to go hand in hand with greater game complexity. The latest title Touch! Generations to land on our shores is therefore this Brain Training, digital transposition of a best-selling book in Japan written precisely by Dr. Kawashima. The Japanese luminary, a great expert on the study of the brain, has in fact had the excellent idea of publishing a volume based on a collection of 60 exercises to train and improve one's brain capacity. Nintendo has understood its potential, and has therefore created a product for DS in collaboration with Kawashima himself that cannot be inserted in the category of ~games~; Brain Training is in fact rather a collection of exercises to train one's brain and thus make it, at least in the intentions of the programmers, increasingly fresh, reactive and young. All this through a dozen tests, mostly mathematical or mnemonic based, to be performed as often as possible on a daily basis to then evaluate one's progress using special ad hoc graphs. There are, for example, ~calculation 20~ and ~calculation 100~, in which it is required to perform 20 or 100 simple mathematical operations (addition, subtraction and multiplication); in the end, the ranking is drawn up on the basis of the speed with which you have reached the end, possibly without errors that determine additional penalties. Or again ~flash memory~, where an ever-increasing group of boxes with numbers inside them is represented for a very few seconds; through photographic memory you must then touch the boxes in the ascending order of the numbers that were inside them. In ~syllable counter~, as the name suggests, it is required to indicate the number of syllables that make up a sentence; ~contagent~ instead displays a small house in which a series of people enter and leave, increasingly rapidly, and in the end it is necessary to write how many of these are left inside the house. ~Distinguish colors~ is undoubtedly among the most embarrassing, in the sense that it is capable of making one's mental abilities questioned in the face of an apparently so simple concept: in practice, it is a question of saying the name of the color aloud with which a color is written. For example, ~BLUE~ may appear but written in yellow, and in this case ~yellow~ must be said into the microphone. Easy? Try it yourself before you say it... I feel smarter The interface obviously relies entirely on the touch screen and the stylus; however, atypically, Brain Training requires you to rotate the DS by 90 degrees, thus playing vertically. All the exercises are based on the writing of numbers or letters, or at most on vocal recognition, without requiring the pressing of any key. It is precisely the speech and handwriting recognition that can create some problems, requiring you to spell words accurately or change your style. There are basically two game modes, namely training and brain age test; the first allows you to tackle the exercises individually to improve your performance, while the second allows you to perform 3 different tests indicating at the end - based on the results - the brain age of the user. The best corresponds to 20 years, gradually getting worse; in relation to the personal data entered in the personal profile, Dr. Kawashima spares no comments on the basis of the relationship between brain age and chronological age. In addition, the nice luminary dispenses advice here and there on exercises to do during normal life, to keep training even beyond the title program for DS. Alongside the classic tests, a well-reproduced sudoku has also been added, which will delight lovers of this pastime while leaving its detractors totally indifferent. Finally, from a technical point of view, Brain Training certainly cannot be evaluated in an artistic key, given that it uses an absolutely stylized and minimalist style which is nonetheless functional and pleasant. Sound aihistoric lows. Comment Brain Training is not a game, and should be kept in mind before any purchase. That said, the end result is a stimulating product that takes up the ~philosophy~ of Nintendogs, ie that of 15-20 minute sessions a day, however proving to be decidedly rewarding and offering a level of challenge and a sense of progression that represents its main quality. Provided you don't viscerally hate the type of exercises offered by Nintendo production, Brain Training therefore represents an original, fun and truly accessible experiment for every member of the family. A dozen more establishments would have increased the overall variety and longevity, but even so one cannot complain overall, even in the face of the reduced selling price. Pros Original and stimulating Immediately accessible There is sudoku, for those who love it Cons Speech recognition and handwriting not flawless Graphics and sound all too minimalist A few more exercises were not a bad thing Even before coming out on the market with Wii, the console openly aimed at those who have always had little or nothing to do with video games, Nintendo is already preparing its approach to the world of ~non-gamers~ through the enormous success of Nintendo DS, and more specifically thanks to the series of games Touch! Generations. One of these responds to the interminable name of Doctor Kawashima's Brain Training: how old is your brain?, and is actually the ideal product to involve girlfriends, mothers and grandmothers in the dangerous and diabolical world of electronic devilry.", "date": "2006-06-12", "grade": null}
