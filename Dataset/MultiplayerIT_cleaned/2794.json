The fighting game for iOS and Android devices was in fact initially linked to the graphic device of the ~silhouettes~, which gave meaning to the very name of the game: a fight between shadows. With the third episode, released exactly three years ago, the however, the franchise has adopted a different approach, proposing characters not only ~in the clear~ but also very well made and diverting the discourse of the shadows towards their possible powers. In this last chapter, however, the narrative cue is different and tells of the advent of a dark lord, with the various fighters engaged in facing each other to establish who will have to challenge him. Gameplay If we were to identify a source of inspiration for the gameplay of Shadow Fight Arena it would probably be Mortal Kombat: the two titles make use of a similar combat system, although the mobile game doesn't even remotely dare to play the card of blood and mutilations, remaining decidedly chaste from this point of view. Certainly the mechanics that regulate the clashes are not flattened by limiting the use of buttons and directions as happens in many gestural fighting games, but refer to a traditional type interface, with a virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen to move the character and parry, as well as a series of buttons on the right side that allow you to strike with any equipped weapon, kick, shoot a dart and use special powers. The latter activates a sort of alternative dimension made up of shadows, assigning the combinations of directions and keys special moves that are as spectacular as they are effective, capable of causing considerable damage to the opponent if he does not respond promptly to the maneuver, defusing its effects. In short, there is a great emphasis on precision and strategy, just a pity that the impacts of the shots have not been valued more. Strengthened by an extremely rich and well-finished set of animations, Shadow Fight Arena gives life to decidedly interesting and multifaceted duels, with teams of three characters and an elimination context in The King of Fighters style, a fairly rich roster but above all a single mode main that is based exclusively on online multiplayer matches. Structure Compared to Shadow Fight 3, the developers have understood that suffocating users right from the start with a limiting freemium model is a counterproductive choice, and so Shadow Fight Arena proves to be rather permissive, without action energy to determine our ability to play and with a fast and efficient matchmaking, capable of finding an opponent within seconds and holding the fight without episodes of excessive latency. The unlocking of new warriors and the strengthening of those already in our possession takes place on the basis of the cards collected, along the lines of Clash Royale, while two different currencies (gold and crystals) characterize the microtransaction system. Spending real money can make us progress faster and upgrade our fighters, that's true, but the system seems to carefully match users based on their strength level. Technical realization In terms of technical realization, Shadow Fight Arena certainly stands as the best episode of the series. The steps forward compared to the third chapter are notable for character detail and animation quality, and it is a pity that the scenarios are not more numerous, since they too have excellent care and a large amount of background elements that enrich visually the location. We have already talked about the matchmaking and touch controls, they are both excellent, while the sound accompaniment unfortunately turns out to be a bit limited, with music that tends to repeat itself a little too often and fails in any way to stand out compared to other aspects of the game.", "date": "2020-11-14", "grade": "8.0"}
