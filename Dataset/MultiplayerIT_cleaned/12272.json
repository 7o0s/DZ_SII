{"name": "Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/command-amp-conquer-3-tiberium-wars.html", "text": "Let's spoil Period of great revolutions for the RTS: without getting lost in history, it is simply worth remembering the very recent Supreme Commander, who has managed to bring a breath of fresh air into a genre that has been stale for too many years: a genre which, it is good remember it, saw its peak with the brand created by Westwood, that Command & Conquer recently purchased by EA. After the little success Generals, even disowned by fans of the series, there was a little lack of the dear and old NOD fraternity and the always upright and just GDI, their skirmishes and the colossal Mammoths. So, after years of long waiting, here is finally the true sequel of the series, called Tiberium Wars, which really wants to bring the nostalgics back to 1995 and, why not, emulate the exploits of the first chapter, trying to become the new milestone for future generations. ~Ambitious project~ Never like that of the disillusioned Kane ... The plot sees you return in the role of an anonymous Commander in the distant 2047, when by now the NOD brotherhood was definitively defeated during the Second Tiberium War and the world reigns total peace. Peace destined to last very little, when a sudden NOD attack reopens the old disputes to the sound of Ion Cannons and Nuclear Warheads: so far the classic plot of the series, but unexpectedly a new faction appears on the war scenario, the Scrin , unsociable aliens who have come from who knows where to bring about (coincidentally) the destruction of Humanity. One might wonder why these extraterrestrials hate the Earth to such an extent that they face a journey through the space of tens and tens of light years and endless queues at the toll booths, only to be eliminated anyway: Tiberium Wars does not provide us with answers to these interesting questions , but it limits itself to bringing a new playable faction into the videogame duo, to the delight of all fans. It must be admitted that the plot is certainly not something exciting, but the interludes shot using flesh and blood actors make their reappearance: EA, for the occasion, has enlisted an exceptional cast, including Michael Ironside , already seen in Top Gun, and Jennifer Morrison, the beautiful assistant of the sympathetic Doctor House: needless to say that for the over 90 minutes of videos shot in high resolution you will have the impression of being in front of a film, which while not shining for scripting , undoubtedly allows for greater involvement and manages to convey that peculiar taste that made the fortune of the first Command & Conquer. Hollywood If the former Top Gun Jester isn't enough for you, nor Doctor House's assistant Cameron, here are some other stars hired by EA for this game with dollars: we find again Joe Kucan, always the interpreter of the charismatic boss NOD , the beautiful Tricia Helfer and the shady Josh Holloway, already seen in Lost; in the GDI faction you will meet Billy Dee Williams, primary actor in Lost and in Star Wars: Episode 5 as Lando Calrissian and Grace Park, command officer in the successful series Battlestar Galactica. Even the eye wants its Ion Cannon If seeing Dr. Cameron as head of GDI intelligence wasn't enough, you certainly won't be less impressed by admiring the decent quality of Tiberium Wars graphics. All clashes have good particle effects, debris thrown into the air by violent explosions and distortions caused by our ion weapons: a gratifying aspect, which will transform the battlefield into something colorful and really pleasant to see, as well as giving you a little satisfaction personal when you see entire buildings collapse under the mighty blows of your army. It's just a pity that, with the precise intention of keeping the classic feeling of the series intact, the minimum zoom is too little ~minimum~. That is, it happens on several occasions to feel embarrassed due to the impossibility of having a vision of the playing area from a greater distance. The same care in the effects has been placed only in part in the modeling: the units are indeed made with care but at the highest zoom level, you will notice imperfect details and also textures that are not exactly of great quality; however there are some ~goodies~, for example by taking off your jet planes, you cannot fail to notice the subtle heat trails of the engines, which slightly distort the surrounding area with an excellent blur effect, or the dust in the air after a strong explosion. The control system is the real keystone of the game made in EA; centered on the A key, which will always act as a ~selector~, it is used in correlation with the bumpers and back triggers allowing us to perform all kinds of mbones expected in an RTS, from the management of troops and buildings, to the movements to arrive at the formation of groups of units. The control of the view is entrusted to the two analog sticks that will allow us to rotate and zoom the camera to our liking. We have to admit that the invention of the American developers is excellent, certainly at the beginning it is a bit difficult to remember all the controls and the risk of getting confused is present, but after having done a little practice we will be able to grow and prosper our army. Speed is perhaps the only thing missing from a joypad-based control and the only real aspect in which the mouse-keyboard combination is missing. As we will explain in the next paragraph, the speed of the game has been increased and consequently the speed of execution of our decisions will be fundamental: we will no longer be able to make a mistake in a move, on pain of bitter defeat. Back to the Past But the graphics are not the strength of an RTS: in terms of gameplay, this third chapter limits itself to re-proposing the same, identical game mechanics of its 1995 forerunner, without making any relevant introduction. It may seem like an unwise choice on the part of EA, especially in the light of the innovations brought about by recent strategists, but simplicity, if it doesn't fall into banality, isn't necessarily a bad thing: in the first place, a frenetic gameplay is reintroduced, which will hardly leave you rest for more than a few minutes, making game sessions truly adrenaline-pumping, especially if set to a high level of difficulty. Among other things, the missions will hardly reach the hour of duration, very often settling on 30 minutes and this makes the gameplay very tasty and immediate in its fun. In fact, do not think that C&C3 is a trivial ~gather resources, amass troops and rusha~, but you will be asked to carefully meditate on your tactical choices: victory will not be achieved by simply building the most powerful unit, because even an entire platoon of these can be blown away without much difficulty; then the tried and tested system of the Chinese morra is taken up and improved, which for years has been the backbone of any real-time strategy; you will therefore have to have in mind the primary objective of your mission and only after a quick intelligence work will you be able to choose the best composition for your army: the worst situation is to find yourself with dozens of expensive Mammoth tanks, quickly made pieces from enemy aviation... The more astute could already think of the evergreen ~mixed army~, but also in this case the developers have put a substantial brake: the resources of Tiberium, the only resource present in the game, are limited, although they have a slow regeneration coefficient, closing the possibility of amassing hundreds of units to face any possible situation.?To demolish the last playstyle (after that of the rush and the storer), in C&C3 you won't even be able to armor behind a base full of defenses: first of all because you will need numerous and indispensable energy plants, terribly fragile to any attack, and secondly because super weapons cannot be blocked (as instead happened in Supreme Commander): ~turtle~ behind dozens and dozens of missile launchers is therefore a dangerously double-edged sword: just destroy your plants to bring the entire base to its knees, leaving it at the mercy of your opponents. The will of the developers is evident: to avoid, as far as possible, that the user gets stuck on a single style of play, allowing him to get out of any situation by always and only resorting to a certain strategy: and it is precisely this insecurity that makes each of the 35 extremely adrenaline-pumping missions. Too smart these computers... Too smart these computers... Too smart these computers... Too smart these computers... If the gameplay has not undergone changes over the last 12 years, a different story applies to Artificial Intelligence, on which EA programmers have particularly focused: while during the single player campaign this appears decidedly fluctuating, sometimes showing a unparalleled wit (luring your troops into some ambushes or looking for an unprotected entrance to your base), other times instead it shows real drops in style, behaving in a clearly irrational way: it is, on closer inspection, a flaw not excessively relevant, given that most of the time the AI will keep a fairly coherent behavior, also favored by the fact that it will always start with an advantage (with advanced bases already developed and several unitsavailable), while you will have to play self-made man and build your Rome in less than 1 hour. So don't delude yourself that you have an easy life: you will often think you are foolish when you fall into traps cleverly constructed by the computer. On the other hand, the situation for skirmish games is different: if after a few hours of play you feel tired of always having the upper hand, in this new chapter you will have the option to specify ~how~ you intend the AI to behave and which strategies it will have to adopt: setting it , for example, on the ~Attendant~ mode, the Artificial Intelligence will structure and build a truly impenetrable base, with many defenses and focusing solely on this aspect, waiting for the most profitable moment to launch its attack. If, on the other hand, you prefer the ~Destroyer~ mode, get ready to be literally submerged by a continuous flow of enemy units, always in greater numbers and more and more powerful: it is, ultimately, a nice introduction that allows you to further diversify your sessions skirmish, allowing you to set up to 8 opponents all with their own particular behavior, giving rise to clashes that closely resemble multiplayer games. We certainly cannot forget the multiplayer mode, whose only flaw is that it is relegated only to Xbox Live without any system link or split screen function. In Live the Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars works very well, the game engine responds well never suffering frame drops due to signal delay, in the same way the player lobbies also work very well. Excellent and welcome support for the Xbox 360 Live Vision which allows you to see your challengers in the face and which inserts a further element of novelty that we hope will soon become a standard, there is nothing more beautiful than seeing the reactions to our attacks on the faces of opponents. The Xbox 360 version has also been enriched by four new multiplayer modes: Capture the flag, King of the hill, Capture and hold and the brand new Siege. In Siege, in practice, each challenge will begin with all the contenders surrounded by an impenetrable barrier for an established time, thus being able to develop by thoroughly pondering each choice, certain that once the time is up, the destruction will start more ferocious than ever. Xbox 360 goals The game is divided into 22 objectives, 2 of which are secret, for a total of 1000 points available; they range from the most classic, such as finishing the various campaigns with a certain type of evaluation (gold, silver or bronze) or finishing the training and the entire game, to the more difficult to achieve, such as playing multiplayer for 100 hours or reaching 100,000 units of Tiberium always in online matches. Getting all 1000 points will be challenging to say the least. Comment Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars hits the mark perfectly, following the path already traced by LOTR2 and proposing the excellent playability that has always characterized the series. A classicism that could scare many, it is true, but which instead manages to be perfectly integrated and blended into the gameplay offered by the entire project. This third chapter looks like a frenetic RTS, where your every strategy can easily be put into crisis by the evolution of the missions: the Artificial Intelligence will give you a hard time, while the engine undoubtedly lends itself to giving different emotions without however, maximizing the visual experience with some tone drop in some details and certain textures. The excellent modes on Xbox Live and full support for Xbox 360 Live Vision are the icing on a certainly rich cake that will make more than a few detractors of RTS on consoles change their minds. Pros Fast-paced and addictive gameplay Excellent quality interludes (Cameron from Dr. House not included!) Excellent online structure Well structured AI Cons Technically only fair No innovations in the series When we tested Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-earth 2 last year we immediately had a strange sensation, in fact we didn't know until then whether to trust what was stated by the EA developers, who defiantly declared that they had created a control based on the Xbox 360 joypad that does not make you regret the mouse-keyboard combination, the fundamental combination to enjoy every RTS. The test, as everyone knows by now, went more than well and LOTR2 proved to be an excellent game, built to perfection around the new control method. With Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars EA tries again, bringing to Xbox 360 a project born and raised specifically on the Microsoft console, perfecting where possible the work done previously and above all making us always p", "date": "2007-05-17", "grade": null}
