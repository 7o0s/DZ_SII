However, it is also true that the Call of Duty publisher has amply demonstrated that it is not the most careful of producers when it comes to remasters, and the recent Biohazard Bundle dedicated to Prototype is clear proof of this. That of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is undoubtedly the generation of ~remastered editions~; it is for various reasons, first of all the economic factor, but this has not prevented certain development teams from creating high quality remasters. Without wanting to bother with reference points in this sense, such as Gears of War: Ultimate Edition or Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection, we have had the opportunity to see re-editions made with care and a certain degree of attention, sold at more than reasonable prices. All elements that are sensationally missing in Marvel: The Great Alliance. Marvel: The Great Alliance is still a pleasant and fun title today, but the port disappoints a lot Ineluctable Destiny Before analyzing the characteristics of this reissue, let's take a step back ten years to understand what kind of game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is. Originally developed by Raven Software (the remaster was instead edited by those unfortunate Zoe Mode), the tie-in takes up the mechanisms previously seen in X-Men Legends, thus proposing a cooperative-based action RPG in which you freely control four different characters, switching between them at any time by pressing the d-pad. Counting on a rather large roster, which obviously does not lack heavyweights such as the aforementioned Iron Man, Spider-Man and Thor - with the addition of Captain America, Wolverine and even outsiders such as Ghost Rider and Doctor Strange, for a total of over twenty-four heroes - the game sees the ~good guys~ faction backing up Nick Fury as S.H.I.E.L.D. he is attacked by Doctor Doom's drones. Thus a ~grand alliance~ is created which goes beyond the composition of the classic super groups, but which rewards the setups that recall really existing teams with effectiveness bonuses. The RPG aspect is identified not only with these small details, but also with the visual representation of the numerical damage inflicted by the attacks, with a view to a repertoire that includes the typical maneuvers of every superhero: Iron Man can open fire with his repulsor beams, Spider-Man throws his webs, the Thing creates shock waves by clapping his hands, the Human Torch hurls flames at enemies, Captain America uses his shield and so on. All skills can be upgraded using the points earned on the field, while the coins collected allow you to flesh out the passive characteristics of each character. The mission structure itself starts from the aforementioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. to then take us to the inevitable Stark Tower, which acts as a hub for subsequent shipments, with the possibility of unlocking secondary objectives by communicating with the supporting actors that we find around the building. On the other side there are of course armies of soldiers, androids and a large number of bosses who draw on the ranks of Marvel villains, and who must be defeated with a minimum of strategy rather than charging head on; all from the point of view of a campaign that requires something like fourteen or fifteen hours to complete, and which naturally gives its best when faced in cooperative multiplayer. The ~remaster~ From the trailers and the first images of Marvel: The Great Alliance we expected a remaster at the ~minimum wage~, adapted in terms of resolution and frame rate (respectively 1080p and 60 frames per second fixed on the test PC, with very few graphic adjustments) to modern gaming systems, therefore not a job comparable to the best HD reissues released so far, far from it. And this is precisely what we have seen, albeit under a layer of sensational oversights and with a sale price that is completely out of this world. The first impact with the game, controller in hand, is in fact disconcerting: the buttons are not mapped correctly, the tangled situation even prevents us from switching from one character to another and even continuing in the campaign when we are simply asked to activate two switches at the same time.Thankfully a user on Steam has found an effective solution to the problem that uses the XinputPlus software to reassign the keys, but again: it is baffling that the developers have not even tested the game with a controller before giving the green light to publication. Secondly there is the question of the price, which we believe is exaggerated to say the least for one simple reason: the work done to bring Marvel: Ultimate Alliance on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was purely for adaptation, as the assets have remained identical to the original versions for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Ten years on, while running at 1080p and sixty frames per second, the game is inevitably showing its age, due to dated effects and cutscenes, a just discreet set of animations and a general repetitiveness in the design of the scenarios. On the gameplay front, we still have fun, this is undeniable, but the ~slipperiness~ of the collisions does not help to give the shots the necessary yield to increase the involvement during the often confusing fights. All aspects to which we would have gladly turned a blind eye if the sale price had been half (or less) of that decided by Activision for this re-release, which not surprisingly led to a shower of refund requests on Steam.", "date": "2016-07-29", "grade": "4.5"}
