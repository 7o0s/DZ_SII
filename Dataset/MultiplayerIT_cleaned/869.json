You know when you approach something cautiously, guided by a basic distrust, and then hours go by without realizing it? Velan Studios' new competitive multiplayer has left us like this, with a dodgeball in hand and the unanswered question of how, in a market saturated beyond the limit, it was so difficult to break away from it: it could just be the underlying simplicity, that ~easy to learn, hard to master~, the lever that has raised not a world but at least our initial doubts. Or his very light-hearted tone, the games that don't take more than a few minutes, the adrenaline that inevitably rises when it comes to competing and manages to stay at stable levels precisely because of the constant attention that the game requires. In short, clearly Knockout City is not a game that will make your head explode, nor the definitive experience that redesigns online competition, but starting from an idea that cannot be more common (dodgeball, in fact, or dodge ball if you prefer) has put feet a captivating experience, not without subtleties, inspired and mechanical that are not exhausted at first glance but must be thoroughly understood to master them. It is no coincidence that here we are not talking about dodgeball but about dodgebrawl, because real street fights come out at the end of which it is probable that the count of virtually lost teeth exceeds that of accumulated points. Clearly, like any new online experience that tries to elbow its way through the crowd, it will need both the support of the developers and above all of the public: for this very reason the first few weeks are fundamental in determining the rise or decline of a game that has shown to have good cards. It's all about knowing how to exploit them properly, despite the shadow of a free to play monetization system not going in your favor. Find out if there's stuff to spare and the prospect of a bright future in the Knockout City review. It's Knockout City, baby The first positive factor that immediately caught the eye is how much the game is centered around the pure and simple skill of the player: no skills or competences to unlock, which implies the absence of a tedious grinding phase to develop the character; no object that can benefit navigated users over new ones; total absence of RNG elements that can tip the balance to one side or the other. In short, Knockout City has nothing to hide and shows itself for what it is. We all start on equal terms regardless of the amount of hours accumulated; the only difference is in the experience of the individual and in his own skill. This made us breathe a sigh of relief, avoiding the danger of the ~pay to win~ to put us in front of the evidence that practice makes perfect: the diversification of the maps, designed to resemble the classic arena shooters, clarifies how an in-depth knowledge of the same gives advantage in the management of matches that could not be simpler in their objective. Accumulate the right points (or in any case be ahead within the time limit) to win a round, within a best-of-three match: two victories lead to success, just like two are the lives our character has before being knocked out Each hit with the ball consumes a notch of health, which cannot be restored in any way and will therefore lead to playing with greater caution by relying on teammates. Speaking of the latter, like any team multiplayer, it is essential to remember that union makes strength: it seems obvious to write it but you know well that, as long as you don't play with friends, the tendency to mind your own business in the game is high. Collaborating is key to not being overwhelmed, especially in light of the adrenaline-pumping nature of the game, the fact that all characters are on an equal footing, identical in terms of hitboxes and stat values, and that in this tooth-busting tussle where it's nearly impossible to predefine a strategy the true tactical aspect lies in the intelligent use of passing - as the power of the shot increases even when passing the ball multiple times, not just by charging the launch by holding down the corresponding button. dodgebrawl! Knockout City, me and the boys ready for a match Having made the due overview, how to play Knockout City and what are the subtleties we have mentioned? If you want to practice, the Tutorial missions are obviously ideal for starting out: they are structured by objectives, in such a way as to explain the mechanics step by step and make you aware not only of the moves but also of the points of interest of the various maps, as well as of the dangerswhich could distinguish them. The first and erroneous impression that the game gives is that of an experience reduced to throwing and blocking the ball. Undeniably this is the basic concept, after all it is always about dodgeball, however if it were so simple we would not be here talking about it. These two mechanics alone enjoy a stratification that makes them more than they are: the parry, for example, cannot be performed repeatedly in the hope of hitting the right moment but has an animation ready to leave us discovered in the moment in which we should get the timing wrong; it can be ~good~ or ~perfect~, an evaluation that determines the level of charge of the ball when it is intercepted; finally there is a slight recoil as soon as a volley is caught which could be fatal if we were one step away from the void, which forces us to be aware of where we are and act accordingly, perhaps leading us to prefer a risky dodging an announced fall. As for the launch, however, the question is even more subtle. Basically, the targeting of the opponent is automatic so as to keep all the concentration on the movement, but if you think that it is enough to charge your power more or less as you like and throw balls as if there were no tomorrow, you are off the road. After all, the maps are full of obstacles for this too, it is not enough to automatically target a player so that the ball reaches him ignoring any obstacle on the way; not to mention that such predictable throws are perfect for giving the other the opportunity for a save with all that goes with it. It is therefore possible to perform vertical or curved spin shots to catch the opponent by surprise, or feint the launch itself so as to push him to uncover himself with an empty parry: in the first case you will have to combine the launch or with a forward aerial somersault ( vertical spin shot) or with a lateral pirouette (curveball), actions that make it incredibly difficult to predict where the ball will come from and consequently to intercept it. This is because, of course, you can't block anything unless you're facing the direction the shot is coming from. The parade in Knockout City is all about timing As you can see it's not just about throwing and parrying. There is a logic and a stratification behind two seemingly simple gestures that require more effort than you think, to which the concepts of passing and dodging are then linked. To all this is added the presence of different types of balls, capable of turning the game around in their own way: bomb-ball, cage-ball, moon-ball, multi-ball, sniper ball, each one is distinguished by a peculiarity around which a strategy can very well be built. Except for a specific game mode where they are all usable at the same time, there is only one type of special ball randomly chosen from the game and which can be found in their respective spawn points. It goes without saying, again, that knowledge of the maps is essential to take advantage of and know where to find them. However, that's not all, because there is an even more advanced mechanic linked to the fact that players can in turn become ~weapons~ thanks to in command Mutapalla: this allows you to become, to all intents and purposes, a ball and be picked up by your teammates (but also by your opponents!) to take its place if there are none around. However, it is not a question of becoming a simple ball, otherwise there would be no taste: the transformation has pros and cons. The former reside in the possibility of executing an area attack that causes a knockout. instantaneous to anyone in the area of effect, the latter concern the fact of having one less teammate anyway and being very exposed if you are interrupted in the throw - the sprint in fact turns into a shove when it impacts against a player , making him lose the ball in case he has one but above all by throwing him away with the risk, or the advantage based on the point of view, of making him fall. Having all these ball variables is a great idea to add spice to the challenge, especially since having only one random type available per match leads to constant adaptation to take advantage of them. Every match in Knockout City becomes an unpredictable street brawl Earlier we mentioned the presence of different modes, which then represent the true heart of Knockout City as a competitive multiplayer: at launch, Team KO 3v3, Team KO Party 3v3, Diamond Dash 3v3 and Duel 1v1 will be available. The first two are really similar to each other: the aim is to score ten knockouts. before the opponents so as to win a round and take home two to win the game. Team KO Party provides only special balls to play and it is the only difference with basic Team KO. In Diamond Dash you will have to collect diamonds from defeated opponents and prevent any precious stones lost by a partner from ending up in enemy hands: thirty diamonds for one round, two rounds for the game but do not hope to cheat by committing suicide, in case of a critical situation, to save the diamonds - falling on deaf ears gives diamonds to the opposing team, so accept defeat for what it is. The 1v1 Duel needs no explanation, however we specify that there are no special balls and that the on-screen warning of the arrival of an enemy attack is rightly deactivated. Starting from May 25th the interesting Mutaball Brawl mode will be introduced which, as the name might suggest, it is based on the total absence of balls in play and on the players' need to transform in order to be able to attack: it will be a 4v4 mode and fifteen knockouts will be needed. to win a round, in a best-of-three match as usual. The ability to cross-play with users from any platform (PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch) and the included voice chat make Knockout City a rich shared experience accessible to anyone. The monetization system Knockout City, a dodgebrawler ready for battle Let us now address the thorny issue of cosmetics. In itself the character editor has convinced us a lot, since the beginning it has a valid amount of elements to customize our dodgebrawler, with a surprising care for inclusiveness that allows us to shape avatars of different kinds not only from the simple point of view of the accessories but also of the appearance: for example you can have a female build but masculine features and vice versa, choosing between different faces and hairstyles to find the one that suits you best. Despite the initial availability and the presence of a League mode - as opposed to the Street mode which is for a more casual approach - in which to compete with the aim of achieving the coveted Chrome quality rewards before the end of the current season, Knockout City there is also an internal store that aims to monetize aesthetic customizations: an element not only identical to all those seen so far (daily rotation of objects, internal currency that can be purchased with real currency to speed everything up) but particularly out of tune for a game that is not free to play but a game sold at a limited price. Sure, it's included in the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or EA Play at launch, it also offers a ten-day free trial until May 30th to see if it's right for you, but this doesn't mean that we are talking about a title sold at the basic price of 19.99 euros or in the Deluxe version at 29.99 euros for those who do not have the above subscriptions: the idea of flanking it with an internal store, instead of focusing on something more original, could have the boomerang effect on a game that has pleasantly impressed us and much more than we thought. After all, even just the idea of creating a crew so as to allow groups of friends to play together from any platform, also tying specific objectives to them thanks to weekly contracts, is excellent and we see no reason to introduce a redundant monetization system and annoying that it could only do damage.", "date": "2021-05-21", "grade": "7.5"}
