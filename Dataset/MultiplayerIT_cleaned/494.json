{"name": "Football Manager 2006 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-2006-recensione-2.html", "text": "You broke my core The first thing that catches the eye when picking up the Football Manager case is the icon with the writing ~hard disc required~, it is the first time that the storage device, inserted by Microsoft only in the full version of its console and not in that Core, it becomes necessary. Except for the final fantasy online XI demo that had to be installed on the hard drive, no other game has, in fact, so far made use of this possibility. The device therefore becomes a must for those who want to enjoy the game published by Sega, it must be said that this installation is not regretted and, thanks to this procedure, the game always travels very fast with almost instantaneous loading, perhaps better of a high-end PC. The game is practically the perfect transposition of what we have seen on PC, and after choosing a team we will have full control of it, at all times and in all things, being able to count on thousands of statistics and many options. We can, for example, impose press blackout to players who play little or who don't like our methods and we will also be able to contact the other coaches expressing a judgment towards them. Obviously the possibility of customizing training and tactics has remained unchanged and, as always, very thorough, with the possibility of varying every smallest parameter. As always, it will be possible to find young talents to make their debut in our team, thus transforming them into little stars of the ~balloon~ firmament. As always, it will be possible to find new talents and make them emerge until they become real stars You broke my core Hours with the pad in hand will literally fly by, and in the game at the same time probably many days will have passed thanks to the Tardis system, thanks to which the minutes played correspond to several hours in the game universe. This is how the summer friendlies will pass, the first tournaments at the beginning of the season and the championship will finally begin. The learning curve of the game is actually quite steep, at the beginning we will have to learn how to make the most of the control system, and then we will have to ~scroll through~ the options to find the function we are interested in activating. During our tests more than a few times we lost several minutes because we didn't remember where the option we needed was. Likewise, towards the end of the tests we became aware of other possibilities that we had not exploited until then. A flood of windows in which the unwary navigator risks getting lost easily. All these complications, let's face it, are also what the player-manager wants the most, absolute and total control over millions of parameters. Control The control system initially left us dumbfounded but then proved to be very functional for the purpose for which it was created. The developers of Sport Interactive have in fact created a system that is not based on the canonical cursor, which is very uncomfortable on consoles, to be moved with the analog sticks, but a management of the windows based almost exclusively on pressing the joypad keys. Let's try to explain better. The classic Xbox and Xbox 360 user is accustomed that with the A key he confirms his actions, with the B or at most the Y he goes back canceling them. In Football Manager this is not the case. With the back triggers we will go back and forth in the game screens, with the ~bumpers~ we will open the multiple submenus while the four front buttons will be ~context sensitive~ throughout the game, i.e. they will change function as a result of what we are viewing. Like Ronaldinho Technically the game is flawless, in fact thanks to the installation and in any case practically always showing static screens obviously it doesn't put the Microsoft hardware under pressure, which in any case reacts very quickly to all our requests. The developers could have made the most of the hdtv support, since the screen space could have been better optimized, exploiting all the available width. This consequently allows you to enjoy the title even on a very normal 14'' in low res. A big incentive to play the Sega title for a long time is the scoring system, integrated into the Xbox 360 dashboard, and which gives reward points every time we reach certain objectives. The first objectives will be simple but will gradually become more and more difficult, such as buying players with very high salaries, winning twenty competitions or participating in thirty championships. Earning all the thousand points up for grabs will be really tough. The challenge system via Xbox Live was then very well integrated into the game, in fact it will be possiblele create real online tournaments and challenge your friends, moreover it will be possible to use the team created with so much effort in the offline game without problems. Online leagues will either be ranked or not, and will contain up to sixteen players. Comment Football Manager is certainly the best football management game out there, and it is also confirmed at the same level in its version on Xbox 360. After having learned to move between the many screens, and to use a control system that is not the most simple, they will find themselves at ease and pleasantly lose themselves in the vast amount of data available. The implementation of the reward system and the possibility of playing online in leagues for up to sixteen players are also excellent. If you want to control your favorite team in every aspect, don't miss the game published by Sega. Pros Thousands of options and stats Very fast loading Online game and high longevity Cons Steep learning curve Control system not so immediate Requires hard disc It is said that in Italy there are millions of coaches, anyone, the slightest football fan, thinks he can decide the fate of his favorite team, and above all believes he can do much better than the professional coaches now on those benches. We can only agree with this statement but we don't want to stop here, what's the best way to turn this passion into reality? They have found it for years at Sport Interactive, to create a strategic-management game that allows us to experience, and follow the events of our favorite team in detail. Football Manager 06, from us Scudetto 06, has in fact been the best football-based management game for years. This year it arrives directly on Xbox 360, ready to glue us to the screen for hours and hours; Was the transition from PC to console painless?", "date": "2006-05-25", "grade": null}
