Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. With the release of Real Racing 3 and the recent 2K Drive, driving games with a simulation approach for iOS and Android devices have made an undoubted leap in quality and made life rather difficult for any competitors. Gameloft, however, is not a team that lets itself be intimidated, and so after the spectacular arcade racer Asphalt 8: Airborne, the French house is ready to take up the challenge of realism with the sequel to a game released in 2010. We are of course talking about GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience, a name that says it all and which promises, in no uncertain terms, to deliver an experience of a certain thickness to enthusiasts. Let's start immediately with the numbers: no less than sixty-seven real cars, belonging to over thirty brands, which set a record in the mobile sector; thirteen tracks, also really existing, which can be covered in four different climatic situations; a single player campaign that counts something like fourteen hundred events, distributed within seven categories related to performance and the type of cars in our possession. In fact, they range from compacts to ordinary cars, from sports cars to grand tourers, from super sports cars to custom-built cars, finally passing through legends such as the Dodge Charger, the Ford Mustang Boss 302 and the Renault Alpine A110. To this we must add the many weekly challenges, which give us the opportunity to win large amounts of coins and even premium cars; and finally the online multiplayer modes, which work through a convenient asynchronous system and even include an option to create a team together with friends or users of a community. Engines on the track The initial endowment allows us to buy at least two cars (one using the virtual currency, coins, the other using the real one, dollars) and try our hand at a series of races that draw liberally from the classic repertoire: simple races, elimination, head-to-head, time trials, and so on. The interesting thing is the absence of an artificial intelligence proper for our opponents on the track, which in fact turn out to be quite unpredictable since they reflect the performance of real players. Yes, more or less like Forza Motorsport 5 with the much talked about ~cloud gaming~. We were very curious to verify the driving model, so as to understand whether or not Gameloft's claims were founded (see the title), and we liked what we found. In practice GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience stands as a cross between arcade and simulation, a game in which you necessarily have to brake before tackling a hairpin bend and where trajectory and precision count a lot. The gameplay offers a fair degree of customization, given that there are four different layouts for the controls (tilt with touch brake, tilt with touch accelerator and brake, touch screen with virtual steering wheel or simple touch screen) and as many visuals. The close external one seemed a little too ~low~ to us, which entails some problems with visibility of the track. The developers have also included a sort of zoom when the car brakes: the visual effect is pleasant, but definitely takes aback compared to the control of the vehicle. Using the internal view allows you to avoid these drawbacks, but in this case any impacts will ruin the windshield and limit - here too - our visual capacity. GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience is really rich and beautiful to look at, too bad about the balance It's not all gold... Continuing the discussion on the driving model, unfortunately we notice a couple of quite annoying problems compared to the solutions adopted by Gameloft: first of all, the impacts with the opposing cars clearly favor the latter, which seem not to lose their starting point where instead our car struggles to recover speed; secondly, the vehicles seem almost glued to the ground, and even if rammed they do not lose their rear end. However, the most relevant issue is another and revolves around the freemium nature of the experience, which makes use of rather invasive mechanisms (mandatory upgrades, the mechanics to be hired to be able to assemble them in more or less time, etc.) and already forces after very few races to repeat the events to collect the money needed for the upgrades, without which there is very little chance ofbring home the victory. Considering the huge number of races in the game, we would have expected a much softer progression system instead of immediately slamming our faces against the dreaded ~paywall~. It's really a pity and we hope that with the next updates the situation will be balanced, because also from a graphic point of view an amazing job has been done, with detailed and convincing polygonal models, reflection effects, the aforementioned variable climate and very populated scenarios sometimes even spectacular in their richness of detail. Everything on the iPhone 5s runs very smoothly and with very few uncertainties, even if we have heard of slowdowns and lag on previous generation devices. The sound is also good, thanks to a signed soundtrack (although not too varied) and convincing effects.", "date": "2013-11-16", "grade": "8.4"}
