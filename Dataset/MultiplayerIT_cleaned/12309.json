{"name": "Thrillville - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/thrillville-recensione.html", "text": "The amusement park! Immediately after having created our virtual alter ego, we will be able to instantly immerse ourselves in the world of amusement parks, thanks also to a small tutorial that will introduce us to the basics of the game. The main objective will be to manage and build the various attractions, in order to improve the quality of the park and increase profits, so as to make all visitors happy. The game is divided into missions, each of which is divided into sub-categories that identify the objective, there are for example the challenge missions, in which we will have to try our hand at the various mini-games to reach a certain score, or the guest missions, in which we will have to making sure our customers are satisfied with the service, plus there are the construction, maintenance and business missions. Regardless of the missions, we will have to manage our park in order to improve it to increase its value and profits: this is possible using a management menu through which we will have various research, construction and management options available. There are so many options available to us: we will be able to build new rides, kiosks and toilets, we will be able to lower the price of tickets as needed, or start an advertising campaign, apply for a loan, start research for new attractions, hire and fire staff in short, you can indulge yourself in various ways. Thrillville's park management, while offering various possibilities, is somewhat limited compared to that of a more complex management game like RollerCoasters, and a high-level management structure is not to be expected. The attractions: the heart of the playground The strength of Thrillville, however, lies above all in the presence of some mini-games designed to break the monotony of the menus, in which it is possible to participate by building new structures. For example, by building the Shootzone, it will be possible to participate in a real FPS in which the objective is to eliminate robots, or by building the Event Horizon we will be put at the controls of a ship in an old-fashioned 2D shooter. There are so many other attractions to try, including mini golf, a Micromachines-style car race and a futuristic car race, all of which are fun and well done. Other mini-games include the work of the technicians, in which we will have to fix electronic boards in a puzzle game style, the work of the street cleaners, who will go around the park to clean it from children's litter and vomit, and that of the entertainers, who BustAGrove-style ballets are expected to keep visitors' morale up. It is also possible to buy a ticket for common rides such as the mechanical arm and the roller coaster, but in this case we cannot speak of real mini-games since our actions are limited to changing the view and nothing else. The vast choice of mini-games makes this videogame experience very interesting, which however is in turn limited by the quality of the same: each game is fun at the beginning, but the more time passes, the more we realize that we are faced with a something simple and trivial: for example Shootzone can't be even remotely compared to a classy FPS, while the minigames of street sweepers and technicians are really stupid and boring. So, once we've tried all the minigames both single and multi with our friends, and brought our parks to their full splendour, we'll hardly find the will to keep playing them. Graphics and sound The realization of the graphic and sound sector is at a decent level if we take into consideration the type of game, but there is not much to expect given the purely technical aspect does not hold the comparison with the giants for Playstation 2. There are different types park aesthetics that make the panorama of this virtual ~world~ varied, in which there are a good number of attractions with the most bizarre shapes and the most flashy colors. Going more specifically, we will be able to notice how the models of the characters and visitors of the park are very minimalist, built with polygons necessary only to give them a human shape; the park and the rides, on the other hand, are very aesthetically cared for, and have been created in detail with a good dose of imagination and originality, even if the quality of the textures leaves something to be desired. The minigames are graphically very different from each other, since they range from a FPS made in 3D to a shoot'em up made in simple 2D ... but in any case, and without too many pretensions, they manage to be qualitatively satisfactory. Despite having quite catchy effects and music, the sound aspect of thrillville is decidedly weak. Surely it could have been fare much more for the soundtrack, since the audio tracks, although quite varied in genre (mainly rock, pop and techno), are still uninspired and boring, making the gaming experience a bit bland. Comment Ultimately Thrillville offers a kind of minigames collection surrounded by a rather limited management section, a mix that may not be very stimulating for those who prefer to use their brain rather than their reflexes. The mini-games are many and very different from each other, but as we have already seen, some of these are practically useless, while others are overly trivial ... boring the player right away. We are therefore faced with a title that focuses on quantity rather than quality. However, while not free from defects, Thrillville has trump cards that manage to keep the interest high for a long time, especially if we manage to involve some friends in multiplayer games. But it must be emphasized that Thrillville aims at a young target, and that more ~mature from a videogame point of view~ people looking for a more serious and demanding game, could be disappointed and get tired after a few hours of play ... Pros: Good number of minigames Well thought out hybrid structure Cons: Very simple managerial section Non-record technical aspect Not all minigames are worthy of note One of every child's dreams is surely to have a personal playground where they can have endless fun on roller coasters, crash cars and torn castles! Thrillville, born from Frontier Development, was born to fulfill this dream, and allows us to build and manage our own personal playground even if obviously with some limits. Frontier Development is probably a name that is familiar to those who have already had the opportunity to try their hand at RollerCoaster Tycoon, a real ~park~ simulator for PC from which Thrillville takes its cue, in which the managerial aspect is undoubtedly the most important component. Unlike Roller, Thrillville aims more at immediacy and ~pure~ fun, rather than using gray matter to manage one's playground, and it must be said that it does so in a more than dignified way, thanks to the inclusion of various types of mini-games in which you can also try your hand with your friends. So Thrillville can be considered a simplified managerial game, in which the management phase has been reduced to the bare minimum to leave more room for light-hearted mini-games, in which our reflexes and our manual dexterity are the only masters ... but let's see better in the details", "date": "2007-05-07", "grade": null}
