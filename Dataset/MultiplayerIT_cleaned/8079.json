Titles like Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana or Xenogears, to name another success, were surrounded by an aura of mystery and solemnity; they were the games that many wanted but could not have, and over time we ended up remembering their merits more often than their defects. Now that the JRPG has been cleared until it becomes mass, it was only a matter of time before Square Enix decided to remaster this pearl of the past as well. But what is this Radical Dreamers they have chosen as a subtitle? And what does the legendary Chrono Trigger have to do with it? Continue reading our review of Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition if you want to know more and, above all, if this remastered is worth buying. Chrono Trigger doesn't fit Chrono Cross has a very strange genesis that we can only fully understand now that Square Enix has localized - in Italian, moreover - also Radical Dreamers. Accessible from the main menu by choosing the Radical Dreamers - Le Trsor Interdit item, this interactive text adventure dates back to 1996 and to the will of Masato Kato, who had written the story of Chrono Trigger, to resolve some subplots left unfinished in the legendary JRPG for SNES. Released only on Satellaview (a peripheral for SNES confined to Japan only) this strange narrative experiment tells a much darker and more mature story that relates to Chrono Trigger as the player is called to make some choices to continue reading to the tune of Yasunori Mitsuda . The unprecedented Italian localization, smooth and modern, translates the original Japanese prose that tells the adventures of a trio of thieves grappling with an artifact that is linked to the narrative of Chrono Trigger. The script Kato titled Radical Dreamers prompted Square to finance a new title set in the Chrono Trigger universe. There was one problem, however, and that was that most of the original creators - including Yoshinori Kitase, Hironobu Sakaguchi, Yuji Horii and Nobuo Uematsu - weren't interested in the project. It was therefore decided to carry it forward from a different perspective, that is to say as a transversal sequel: the story is linked to Chrono Trigger, but stands on its own legs and focuses on a completely new cast of protagonists. The new script contradicts Radical Dreamers in several places, which is why Kato resigned himself to branding the title for Satellaview as a ~what if~ story set in an alternate universe. In fact, Radical Dreamers - Le Trsor Interdit is useless. It is a gem that Square Enix has fished out but which adds practically nothing to the package, and which perhaps would have been better replaced with Chrono Trigger in a potential compilation. Does this mean you have to play Chrono Trigger to understand the narrative of Chrono Cross? Absolutely not, but it helps. Kato, in fact, takes up the protagonists of Radical Dreamers - Serge and Kid - and builds a longer and more articulated story around them which, while remaining deeply in touch with that of Chrono Trigger, maintains its autonomy. Only this time it's not about time travel, it's about alternate realities. Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, the text adventure Radical Dreamers came out for Satellaview in 1996 Unfortunately, not everything goes smoothly, because Chrono Cross supports its narrative with a game dynamic that allows you to recruit more than forty playable characters. It follows that only some find sufficient characterization space: the narrative focuses the spotlight on the main protagonists, who also do not shine for charisma, sacrificing the numerous supporting actors. Chrono Cross is above all an unbalanced title in terms of tones and atmospheres. Chrono Trigger was certainly more carefree, also thanks to the character design entrusted to Dragon Ball's Akira Toriyama, who in Chrono Cross is replaced by Nobuteru Yuki. In Chrono Cross the gags often appear forced and do not help build a bond with the many characters. Fortunately, the story reaches very high peaks in memorable scenes, but even there the merit is found above all in the exceptional soundtrack by Yasunori Mitsuda, beautifully rearranged in this The Radical Dreamers Edition. The Italian localization, which passes directly from Japanese, greatly improves a script which, in the English translation of 2000, was perhaps too cold and detached, but certainly cannot solve the problems upstream. Oddities and remasters Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, the combat system exploits the elements Chrono Cross is a rather ordinary JRPG in structure, which alternates exploration and interaction with NPCs with the canonical Final Fantasy-style turn-based combat. The combat system is quite particular and not exactly intuitive. Basically, each character is associated with a color that represents the natural elements, but the elements are also spells and combat techniques, skills that must be found or learned and then housed in individual grids. The composition of these grids determines the inclinations of each character and the synergy between the power of an element and the position that we attribute to it in the grid guarantees an interesting diversity that pushes us to experiment with the various characters without becoming stuck on a particular team. It's an interesting system, but a bit convoluted, and it doesn't assimilate as quickly as it should, also because a series of variables intervene - such as the field effect, which affects the power of the skills, or the normal attacks, defined for intensity and precision - to complicate everything. Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, the 3D models have been significantly improved It is therefore not surprising that Square Enix has implemented a series of concessions in this The Radical Dreamers Edition. Firstly, it is possible to completely defuse the fights: the enemies appear on the screen, but by enabling this function they do not switch to the fight even if they come into contact with them. It makes strange sense, because in fact Chrono Cross doesn't follow a traditional progression pattern; there are no experience points or levels, and the parameters increase randomly at the end of the fights, but within certain limits that are unlocked by defeating the various bosses. In this way, it is the progression itself that contains the players, who can arrive at the challenging clashes more or less prepared, but never in clear superiority. For good measure, the remastered also offers a function that further facilitates battles for those who only want to enjoy the story without wasting too much time behind the combat system. Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, you can choose between new and old portraits These are concessions that players who have already purchased Square Enix remasters should know quite well. In this sense, Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition is a fairly ordinary work: we have a decent variety of display options, auto-save, a function that speeds up or slows down the speed of the game at will, as well as the ability to reset the graphics original. We must admit that Square Enix has worked better than some of its previous remasters - going to retouch not only the definition of the polygonal models, but also their structure and animations, a bit like what happened with Final Fantasy VIII Remastered. Characters and monsters are now much more pleasing to the eye, although the fluidity remains roughly the same as in the original version, and it is even possible to choose between the original portraits and the brand new ones, which are softer and better defined. The problems are instead the usual ones: a discrete gap between the high-definition 3D models and the beautiful scenarios - which, however, is largely resolved with a filter that spreads the colors, making the effect much less alienating - and the unfortunate resolution of the old computer graphics kinematics.", "date": "2022-04-07", "grade": "7.8"}
