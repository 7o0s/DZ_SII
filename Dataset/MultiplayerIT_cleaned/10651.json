{"name": "Remake del remake", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68746-resident-evil-archives-remake-del-remake.html", "text": "There is no doubt that, at the present time, Wii is the console of remakes par excellence: a huge number of titles that first appeared on hardware a generation or even two ago have been conveniently re-released on the Nintendo machine, in the hope of catching even just a small slice of its huge user base. Products that undergo this process can go in search of the fortune they lacked when they first came out, or conversely try to repeat the success achieved on a previous console. Resident Evil Archives belongs more to the first category, being the reissue of a title which at the time - albeit qualitatively excellent - was forced to settle for little visibility, due to the low commercial penetration of the Gamecube. Practice to archive For those who are a bit confused, here is a very brief history: the original Resident Evil was released on PlayStation in 1996, while the exclusive remake for Gamecube (entitled Resident Evil Rebirth) in 2002: this Resident Evil Archives is a sort of reprint, given that the differences with the reference title are too few to be able to define it as a real remake. History and setting have obviously remained unchanged: by choosing to play one of the S.T.A.R.S. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, the user must solve the mystery that revolves around a Raccoon City overrun by zombies, exploring a mansion inhabited by all kinds of monstrosities. Although the Capcom series has never stood out for the originality of its narrative component (as evidenced by the recent fifth chapter), the passing of the years has definitely made itself felt on this front, making the dialogues and situations proposed by Resident Evil Archives quite sterile compared to the complexity of the best current productions. The technical component, on the other hand, still manages to have its say, although it is linked to now largely outdated solutions such as the use of polygonal characters on two-dimensional backdrops. The quality of the 2D scenarios is excellent, and the various rooms of the house of horrors denote great attention to detail, although the non-exceptional resolution of the Wii prevents you from fully enjoying all these little precious things. Even the three-dimensional models are still quite nice to look at, despite Chris and Jill's extremely dated clothing and certain animations with an old-time woodiness. The sound accompaniment remains equally atmospheric, with music that well punctuates the moments of tension accompanied by well-made effects: the spoken English resolves itself as usual into a B-movie recitation, which, depending of the user's tastes, it can appear as extremely evocative or terribly degrading. Hard and pure Where Resident Evil Archives makes one's nose turn up a bit is in the slavish fidelity to the original Gamecube release: although almost seven years have passed, Capcom has been careful not to add new meat to the fire, not even in terms of the control system . Let's forget phantom implementations of the Wii Remote or various preciosities, Chris and Jill always control each other in the same way, which is not exactly a compliment given that already in 2002 this solution already seemed terribly antiquated. Moving the analog stick left or right rotates the character on the screen, pushing up causes him to walk forward, and moving the stick down causes him to move backwards. Whether you use the Remote + Nunchuck combo, a Classic Controller or the old Gamecube pad, little changes: Resident Evil Archives still looks like a dinosaur in this respect. Still on the subject of anachronisms, the odious save system remains which forces you to use typewriters with the appropriate ink ribbons in order to record progress: a nice slap in the face to the casual public. One of the very few innovations concerns the introduction of a defensive weapon for each of the two protagonists (a taser for Jill and a special grenade for Chris), which can be activated via a dedicated key, but anyone would have gladly traded this feature for a more up-to-date control system. Moving on, there is little to say about Resident Evil Archives that hasn't already been said at the time of its release on the Gamecube: the game remains a milestone, and still today it is capable of engaging and frightening, even if obviously with less force than its first release. Even if it is undoubtedly alienating to fall back into certain playful mechanics after having experienced the last two chapters of the series (remember that Resident Evil 4 wasalso re-released on Wii), the progenitor of the saga still has its charm, which is saying something.", "date": "2009-07-07", "grade": "7.3"}
