{"name": "Corsa a intermittenza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-unleashed-recensione.html", "text": "At the time of Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast, speaking of the debut in three dimensions to journalists, Yuji Naka, father of the hedgehog, said that, having created this huge - for 1998 - polygonal world to traverse at full speed, they were looking for a way to use those same maps for exploratory gameplay that would allow the player to enjoy them more calmly. From there, the other protagonists of that episode were born, each with their own different style of play. Since then, in the Sonic 3d that have come out, this tension seems to recur often for the search for the best way to combine the deeds of the protagonist, ever faster, with supporting actors that allow for the use in an alternative way of those backdrops which, otherwise, would last the space of a blink of an eye. This time it's the turn of the Werhog, or the werewolf version of Sonic, into which he transforms after being infected by the evil substance that springs from Dark Gaia, the monster Eggman wants to use to tear apart the earth and dominate it. At night, Sonic becomes a werewolf and uses his kicks and punches to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds, and to push the continents back into place in an attempt to stop his nemesis. Beautiful by day In Unleashed the earth is divided into continents, each with a different theme ranging from the tropical village, to the Chinese wall, passing through the inevitable stop at the North Pole in the midst of perennial ice. Each region has a capital in which Sonic, with his faithful companion Chip - a fluttering creature who has lost his memory - must go to collect clues and medals with the symbols of the sun and the moon, which are used to gain access to the levels necessary to get to the end of the game and that are scattered everywhere. Cities are also places to buy items, complete sub-quests, and figure out where to go to continue the story. After the first moments of bewilderment, it is possible to identify the key characters to contact to quickly know which areas to move to in order to advance: the price to pay is that of having to put up with dozens of dialogues, until you have learned how the progression of events works in Sonic Unleashed, which often involves going to talk to the same NPCs multiple times. Each area can be visited both day and night, thus giving access to different submissions and different levels, divided into two types of gameplay, the classic one at breakneck speed, collecting rings and jumping on enemies' heads, and the one in from werewolf. As the sun goes down, the game becomes a sort of scrolling beat'em up with extended platform sections, given that, with this appearance, Sonic can stretch his arms to cling to ledges, poles and special handholds scattered almost everywhere in the seabed . In both cases, in addition to collecting the rings that serve as a bargaining chip to buy items and to restore vital energy, you have to collect the diamonds that arise from the destruction of each eliminated enemy. These represent the accumulated experience, which can be spent to enhance the speed or the amount of turbo usable by Sonic, or to increase the Werhog's strength and combat statistics, which learns increasingly powerful and effective combos. The structure in both modes is the same, with the player advancing from one checkpoint to another until reaching the end of the level or the fight with one of the bosses, really spectacular. The difference is that if, using Sonic, it takes seconds to get back to where you died, the same cannot be said for when you play the werewolf. A wrong jump, a poorly managed fight or any other accident can lead to the repetition of long (sometimes very long) sequences of jumps, levers to pull and monsters to kill, and several times in a row in cases where several difficult passages follow one another , which are gradually assimilated before being able to leave them behind. Which wouldn't be a bad thing in itself, except that these accidents often happen due to problems related to the controls, some bugs and the (non) management of the camera. Which brings us to the most controversial point of the whole game. Xbox 360 goals Completing the game, upgrading the werewolf, and accomplishing some of the sub-quest objectives helps get between 450 and 500 points out of the 1000 available. This however means playing Unleashed for many hours. Either for the beautiful longevity of the game, or for the difficulty. To get to the full score you have to do all the timed challenges and buy all the items in the shops scattered around the city. Speed, cameras and rage! When Unleashed works, and it often does in sections where you command Sonic, it doesand to delude that this time things will all go the right way and that the Sonic Team has once again taken the high road. Thus it happens to run on the surface of the water, between mountains, in the savannah, in evocative panoramas at speeds unimaginable until recently, only to then get stuck in some element of the seabed or discover that the automatic lock, which allows the porcupine to jump leading rows of enemies to overcome bottomless abyss, sometimes misfires and does not lock on to the target (but that's just one example). At that point, all that remains is to watch helplessly as our hero falls into the void at full speed. However, the fact remains that this phase of the game can be said to be partly successful. When you move on to the night sections, however, things get complicated. The internships lengthen out of all proportion, even up to 40 minutes, all spent throwing hands and making millimeter leaps, hampered by imprecise controls, because they are afflicted by a slight delay that makes itself felt, and by a camera that is often not orientable and that does not allow you to understand exactly what to do. As if that weren't enough, this changes shot in an absolutely autonomous and inevitable way in the middle of the passage on bridges or pipes suspended over the lava, leading to a change in the control scheme and making some sequences a real headache. Then you have to resort to stratagems, to memorize the camera movements to anticipate the moment in which, in order to advance, you have to change the direction to give to the stick. But it is clear that these are things that only true Sonic fans, never domi in the face of an objectively difficult game, will be willing to face in a Christmas so crowded with good quality games. For them, the satisfaction will be great, but you have to be ready to face things like the final stage that you go through in almost 90 minutes of continuous play, and only when you have partially learned how to overcome the most difficult parts, taming the rage that rises inexorably faced with the umpteenth game over that forces you to repeat everything all over again. Hedgehog Engine Sonic's rebirth was entrusted to a proprietary engine, called the Hedgehog Engine. Soft Shadows, self shadows, lights and Blur are just some of the effects that make a fine show of themselves, in what would have the potential to be a first response to the accusations of inadequacy addressed to Japanese programmers in this next gen, as well as a very colorful and undoubtedly pleasant to look at. The problem is that the game often seems to ask too much of the code, ending up the victim of dramatic drops in frame rates and some uncertainties which are a clear sign of the need for a polishing phase that was interrupted ahead of time. Even here, however, a small light is sown that makes us look positively towards the future of the series. The music is all excellently done, and some of it is really pleasant to listen to, and we should be happy with it, given how long one is forced to ~enjoy~ the more tangled levels.", "date": "2008-12-11", "grade": "6.5"}
