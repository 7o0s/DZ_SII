The protagonist of the game is a special team made up exclusively of girls: Holiday, who we will control during the adventure, is a professional assassin who prefers vehicular combat aboard Hyperion, her ultra-technological motorcycle; Valentina, Holiday's best friend, who in the early stages of the adventure is hit by a grenade and transformed into a sort of automaton due to the insertion of nanomachines capable of keeping her alive; Amelia, a scientist capable of performing elaborate hacks and controlling devices remotely; and finally Minuete, a rigid and severe commander, equipped with bionic grafts that make her faster and more responsive than normal human beings. The group is sent aboard an orbital platform that has been attacked by an army of Snow Leopards, heavily armed cyborg soldiers capable only of grunting. Once on board, Holiday and her colleagues will have to face a series of fights, confront a mysterious threat and with a whole series of events and twists. Revolution 60 is undoubtedly an interesting and different title, even if poor in gameplay Real revolution? As written at the beginning, the plot of Revolution 60 is intriguing and pleasant, and undoubtedly represents the greatest strength of this original production. The characters are in fact well characterized, boast some fairly original traits and it is possible to ~frame~ them after a few minutes, undoubtedly thanks to a well-developed script. The problem with interactive films is precisely interactivity, however, and in this sense the game fails to do that much, inserting a large number of quick time events to make us participate in some way in what is being told on the screen. Sometimes it's about drawing lines, circles or squares, sometimes touching an indicator at the right moment or putting several fingers on the screen in a particular order, the fact remains that this aspect of the adventure is certainly not the one that shines the most. Just as the exploratory phase does not shine, very linear and devoid of acute points, in which it is simply necessary to indicate areas of the screen for the character to reach them, thus making sure that the story goes on to the sound of Mass Effect-style dialogues, or in response multiple, the outcome of which will lead to alternative endings that constitute a valid incentive for replayability. The fights with the Snow Leopards, on the other hand, deserve a separate discussion, given that they introduce quite interesting action mechanisms, with a subdivision into boxes that is RPG-like and, in the same way, a time to reload the weapons that forces you to seize the moment and carefully plan your maneuvers before sinking the blow. Once an energy bar is filled, the special attack then becomes decisive, or a combo of projectiles and martial arts whose execution is once again determined by the completion of some QTEs. The problem is that most of the clashes turn out to be simple and banal, without bite. In short, it can be said that in terms of playful content, the offer is a bit too poor, and on closer inspection, the design of the characters and locations also leaves something to be desired: the polygonal modeling is quite ~old-gen~, the animations accordingly they appear particularly woody (albeit fluid) and the choice of colors and textures, with all that purple and green, don't exactly match our idea of sci-fi. However, the fact remains that titles of this kind are really rare to find on mobile, so those looking for something different from the usual could give us a little thought.", "date": "2014-08-28", "grade": "7.0"}
