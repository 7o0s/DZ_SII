{"name": "Rayman: Raving Rabbids", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids_b.html", "text": "Rabbit everywhere Believe it or not, these are the premises of Rayman: Raving Rabbids, declared first party game for Wii, a console that for obvious reasons promises to be the queen platform of products of the genre. The declared objective of the developers was in fact to try to create a good amount of mini-games (there are over 70 in total) that knew how to take advantage of the characteristics of Nunchuck and Wiimote and exploit them properly. A mission that can be said to have been successfully completed, but not without some reservations. Of the previous Rayman titles, Raving Rabbids retains only the protagonist: no platform sections and the like, therefore, but only and exclusively minigames, which can be faced in a story mode intended for a single user or in multiplayer in the scoring mode. As it is easy to imagine, the single player section is little more than a gimmick to unlock the various stages and make them available for free use, but everything works very well: the narrow but still present plot keeps the progress of the action alive through some nice cutscenes, while the various mini-games follow one another with good rhythm and variety. Of the previous Rayman titles, Raving Rabbids retains only the protagonist: no platform sections and the like, therefore, but only and exclusively minigames Rabbit everywhere The adventure is divided into blocks, each of which consists of four stages, but it is enough to complete three of them to be able to move on to the following fraction. As we said, there are about seventy minigames, a decidedly considerable amount especially in relation to the general good workmanship and variety of the same: despite some inevitable repetition of mechanics, the work of the Ubisoft developers is certainly commendable, as well as that of the designers for having given birth to such adorable and at the same time delusional creatures such as the Rabbids who populate every single scenario. Giving an idea of the various mini-games of the product is not easy, considering how they differ significantly from each other in gameplay and in the way in which they exploit the control system. It is therefore necessary to proceed by giving some examples: the player will therefore find himself running to deliver an explosive package by shaking Nunchuck and Wiimote alternately; again, it could happen that you have to spray the Rabbids with carrot juice, waving the Nunchuck and aiming the targets with the Wiimote; the latter is then used alone on the screen to trace the silhouette of a particular food to be fed to a rabbit, or rotated like a lasso in a variant of hammer throwing where the instrument is made up of a tethered cow to a chain; again, both controllers will have to be shaken to the beat of the music in some stages loosely inspired by products such as Dance Dance Revolution. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of a multitude of minigames that are amusing in their mechanics but absolutely hilarious due to the presence of the Rabbids, who with their vacant looks and their senseless screams manage to elicit more than a few healthy laughs. To crown it all, there are the special stages placed at the end of each block, mainly of two types: authentic (and very fun) shooter-style sections with light guns a la Time Crisis, in which you shoot plungers at the Rabbids aiming with the Wiimote and reloading with a shake of the Nunchuck; or bizarre warthog horseback riding and so on, managed directly by the Nunchuck's analog stick. Entertainment > Graphics Original, fun and capable of making good use of the peculiar Wii control system, Rayman: Raving Rabbids will certainly not be remembered for its graphics though. Although stylistically the Ubisoft work is worthy of praise (as already mentioned, the Rabbids are truly anthology), on a purely technical level the title does not differ much from a mid-range production for Gamecube, with all that follows . Certainly also the daughter of the multi-platform nature of the product, Rayman's cosmetics: Raving Rabbids still find it difficult to forgive obvious limitations such as the absence of progressive scan, the flatness of the light effects and the lack of definition of the textures. Fortunately, the situation is resolved by the goodness of most of the animations and the never too praised humorous charge of the Rabbids. The psychotic rabbits are the real stars of the game, with their syncopated movements and delirious clothing: whole hordes of Rabbids run around the screen dressed as divers, cowboys, aliens, even Sam Fisher, throwing plungers at the player and screaming continuously and often for no reason. Precisely in this regard, another note of meritThe highlight of the game is the sound sector, not only for the hilarious cries of the rabbits, but also for the spot-on musical selection (among many, there are versions of ~La Bamba~, ~Misirlou~ and ~Girls Just Wanna Have Fun~ ), which serves as a great accompaniment to the fast-paced gameplay. Multi-rabbit Contrary to what might be expected, the multiplayer part of Rayman: Raving Rabbids is not particularly elaborate, and indeed would have definitely deserved some more attention. First of all, it is not possible to engage in tournaments or similar activities, but only and exclusively to face the mini-games one by one, choosing them through menus which are not always very clear. Furthermore, not all stages are oriented towards the action of several players simultaneously: some are limited to two users, while others must be used in turns, causing a slight drop in the fun factor due to the absence of direct competition. That said, Rayman: Raving Rabbids still remains a good multiplayer title, perhaps a little incomplete but certainly capable of giving anyone moments of healthy fun, thanks to the great simplicity of almost all minigames. And then, who has never wanted to make a fool of himself in front of friends by frantically moving a Nunchuck and a Wiimote? Comment Rayman: Raving Rabbids is paradoxically a party game that shows a few more limits in the multiplayer environment, while remaining on good levels and ensuring a high fun factor. A goal achieved thanks to the excellent use of Nunchuk and Wiimote, the considerable quantity and variety of mini-games and - last but not least - the hilarious psychosis of the rabbits who are the protagonists of the game. Although technically not quite up to par, Rayman: Raving Rabbids is therefore a fun and original product, which every Wii user should take into serious consideration. Pros Original and fun Nunchuck and Wiimote exploited properly Rabbids absolutely hilarious Cons Technically questionable Multiplayer not very elaborate Minigames are repeated in the long run After years and years of honorable career spent saving the world, Rayman can finally enjoy some peace, and think well of organizing a nice picnic with his little Globox friends. Suddenly, however, the earth shakes under their feet and bizarre rabbits emerge from the subsoil, making Rayman's snack companions disappear one by one. Without even time to react, our hero is kidnapped and thrown into an arena, from which there is only one way to escape: by completing a series of minigames...", "date": "2006-12-19", "grade": null}
