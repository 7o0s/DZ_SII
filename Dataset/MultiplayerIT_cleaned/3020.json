{"name": "Trackmania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trackmania-recensione-nuovo-racing-nadeo.html", "text": "The Trackmania review takes us back to the stadium of Nations, one of the most successful editions of the series, but in this new chapter the space available is greater and there is no shortage of refinements to enhance very precise gameplay based on saving millimeters and preserving the inertia to earn trophies and climb the leaderboards. In fact, each Trackmania challenge awards points despite the fact that the experience is always playable in asynchronous multiplayer, challenging ghosts and trying to decipher tracks that can get decidedly complex. But those who want company can also face the classic mode of the game together with dozens of players, with a time limit to reach the best time, and also in local multiplayer, up to a maximum of 8 in hotseat mode, another arrow in the bow of an experience that includes interface changes, important stylistic refinements and an enhanced social infrastructure that aims to enhance the core of Trackmania Nations, made up of leaderboards that start from the individual regions and arrive at the international scene, with the support of the creative drive of a community that has now 16 years on its shoulders. How to access and contents of a title that looks to the future starting from the past Trackmania, the name itself says, is a return to the past, a new starting point that does not revolutionize anything but wants to enhance an experience that in terms of gameplay is already close to perfection and continues to be among the most immediate and fun in absolute. This is why Nadeo has decided to focus on infrastructure and content, with the aim of satisfying everyone also in terms of price. Available on Uplay and Epic Games Store, Trackmania offers three different levels of experience starting from the free to play mode which includes the 25 seasonal tracks created by Nadeo, a basic version editor but sufficient to create any type of challenge and the ability to climb the 10 levels of ranking by getting points from practically every activity available. The basic version of the game, which is free, includes the official Trackmania Nations League competition, saving replays, local multiplayer and the ability to join other servers. But to get a more complete and content-rich experience it is necessary to shell out 9.99 euros a year for the Standard edition, undoubtedly affordable, which includes advanced track editor, the possibility to participate in the daily official competitions, to try out the maps loaded on the test server and to upload one's own map to the test server to let others try it, access to races of the day and access to public events and races organized by Clubs. The latter can in fact create entire campaigns that add to the races of the day, created by the players but evaluated and refined by Nadeo, in a title that aims to enhance the activities of the community, also offering a special access dedicated to the Club dimension. In fact, to be part of a Club it is necessary to pay 29.99 euros a year, or 59.99 for three years, thus obtaining access to private rooms, the creation of campaigns, maps shared by other Clubs, ghost Clubs VIP complete with a dedicated play time attack, internal clan challenges, internal club ranking, dedicated Nadeo servers and a customization system that includes the ability to change textures and models. A small universe therefore that offers tangible privileges, most of which are designed to enhance a higher-level competitive dimension. But as we said, the bulk of the experience is available with the Standard subscription which, upon expiry, will still allow us to maintain access to the advanced editor and the maps of the day published during the paid period. We are therefore talking about 465 maps with a one-year subscription during which we also have access to the ghost system which, an important element of Trackmania's asynchronous competitive multiplayer, allows players to measure themselves against the records obtained by other players close in the standings and with whom got the best scores of a track. Gameplay, adds and perspectives The lack of the ghost system is the only thing that makes us turn up our noses in the face of the free access mode, deprived of an important piece for a title in which unthinkable shortcuts and millimeter calculations, easier to find by observing the games of others players, can shorten the times drastically. But to get by in all situations it is undoubtedly more important to get to master the different competition terrains, taking a fundamental step along the road that leads to regional, national or even world placements. This is also why Nadeo has decided not to betrayand long-time players, maintaining dynamics similar to previous titles to limit themselves to changes that look almost exclusively to the aesthetic dimension. The base terrain is the concrete one, surrounded by grass, which recalls Formula 1 for the look and behavior of the car. However, it improves in the refraction of the lights, making the bodywork of the car more pleasant and realistic. The mud has instead become clay clay, aligning with the style of the Trackmania stadium all made of synthetic elements. For ice, on the other hand, the look recalls bobsleigh tracks while the convex terrain evokes indoor racing, both in terms of aesthetics and vehicle behaviour, and can be difficult to deal with if alternated in rapid succession with other terrains, with machine control changes radically and any modifiers that can make some surfaces even more pernicious to deal with. Capable of transforming a linear track into a hellish circle to traverse on four wheels, modifiers include turbo, loop-the-loops, slow-mo, engine deactivation and steering lock, turning inertia into a vital resource and making a small difference in level a potential trap capable of projecting us off the track at breakneck speeds. A real arsenal of pitfalls that can put our patience to the test, but can also enhance our skills. On the other hand, we have the classic immediate control system of the series on our side which, playing on the vehicle's high reactivity and on the possibility of gliding, allows us to tackle mileage-long jumps, parabolic curves, obstacles and extreme passages, while we hone the reflexes essential to tackle a title in which the slightest distraction can irreparably compromise the performance of life. To help keep our attention on the vehicle, Nadeo moved the car's odometer to the license plate, while also making the extent of braking apparent with light indicators placed on the front wheels. Apparently minor adjustments, but in practice useful changes to increase the visibility of data that can help improve timing even further. What the new checkpoint management also aims for with the player who respawns maintains the speed he had when he crossed it. In this way, restarting does not necessarily compromise a test, even if aiming for gold, races and records, every millisecond counts and often it is still necessary to start from scratch and learn a track by heart. For the rest, the changes are all aesthetic, with the bulk of the work done on the lights and assets of the stadium which, partly taken from the work of the modders, try to combine a look made of deliberately synthetic elements, sometimes capable of recalling the blockbusters era between cacti and billboards, with a more realistic rendering. On the other hand, in the background there are the waving flags, symbols of a title that from the menus to the music aims to make everything welcoming, lively and joyful, perfect for short sessions and also ideal for spending entire nights chasing a record. Among other things, it already includes several extra maps in addition to the 25 summer ones created by the developers and the subscription is, according to the authors, a way to ensure the arrival of new features and the continuous evolution of what wants to be the new starting point for the competitive soul of the series.", "date": "2020-06-30", "grade": "8.8"}
