Just to mention Bastion and Transistor, little shivers run down your spine and when the American company announced that it was working on a new title, the fans literally went crazy. However, Pyre remained hidden in the shadows practically until the launch and the information leaked in recent months had failed to dispel the aura of mystery that hovered around the title. We were expecting a different role-playing game than usual, this is true, but we never expected to find ourselves a title that behind its almost mystical aura could hide a soul of a sports title, a game where skill with the mouse and keyboard and reflexes matter much more than the moral choices made in the course of the adventure. Pyre therefore turns out to be a very personal title and therefore extremely difficult to judge, so let's go and open Pandora's box together. Welcome, dear reader The Commonwealth is a nation born from the ashes of a fallen empire, which the stories paint as a heavenly place where all creatures live in peace with each other, in a multi-ethnic society that welcomes all forms of life with open arms. However, wandering in the Commonwealth can also mean being exiled forever to the Downside, a land full of pitfalls and fierce enemies. This is how we wake up without memory in this land, lost in search of a way to regain our freedom. The situation comes to a head when Hedwin, Jodariel and a talking dog named Rukey (with a splendid mustache!) approach with their caravan and show us the only way to escape from this nightmare. The rescue is not accidental nor an act of pure charity: the three see some special qualities in the protagonist, for example the possibility of reading ancient texts and accessing the rituals of passage, the only known way to purify one's soul and return to the Commonwealth. United by common interests, the four thus set out on their way to the stars, crossing a single world, expertly outlined and able to amaze with colors and settings, designed in two dimensions but not for this poor or stingy with memorable panoramas. Thus we move along a rather simplified map, choosing from time to time which crossroads or roads to take, satisfying the wishes of one of our travel companions. The narrative part of Pyre is structured like a game book, where every single choice of the player could lead to obtaining an increase in the trust of one's companions, a certain reward or more simply trade goods. The idea is good, if not particularly original, but perhaps this element is too little explored throughout the campaign, giving the feeling that the decisions of the ~Reader~ are never particularly significant. Certainly they can give some advantage in some circumstances but the feeling is that of not having full control of events, irrelevant pawns in a story that already has a clear path. Basket! As you get to know the characters, as you grow fond of the stories of each of the protagonists, the game reveals its true essence and you are overwhelmed by a surge of surprise. In fact, Pyre does not present white weapon fights or magic clashes but offers players something very different, we would say almost unique for role-playing games. The fulcrum of Pyre's action is hidden in the rites of passage, three-on-three challenges in a sort of fantasy basketball with a thousand peculiarities. At the edge of the field, instead of baskets, there are two pyres and the player's ultimate goal will be to grab a ball and throw it inside them until they are consumed. The basic mechanics are extremely simple but various factors intervene to enrich the gameplay, mainly based on the different abilities of the characters. Our task during these rites will therefore be to guide the Nightwings to victory, in a succession of games that make the adventure a sort of galactic championship between hostile factions. Explaining the game mechanics is quite complex, given the immense amount of variables. Each character emits an aura of different sizes and which can be thrown at enemies in an attempt to temporarily ban them from the match. In addition to this basic ability that all players have, teleports, jumps, the ability to fly and to perform blocks in mid-air but also special summoning abilities also intervene. All questhe variety obviously does not come from just our three companions but, continuing with the adventure, the Nightwing team will gradually welcome new members by expanding its ranks and giving the Reader a great variety of deployment options. Without going further into the specifics of the gameplay, know that the games are always a lot of fun, thanks also to the various and changing arenas that require adaptation and intelligence to get around the obstacles that are proposed from time to time. If all this works very well, it is the artificial intelligence that raises some doubts, often too passive and rarely able to trouble the player. For example, we finished the campaign in about eight hours without ever losing a single fight, a sign that in terms of balancing, something didn't work properly. However, the extremely low difficulty curve can be modified in the second part of the adventure when the reader will be given the option to activate a whole series of extra constellations to increase the difficulty in the game. Some increase the hit points of the pyres, others give more speed to opponents and so on, a solution already seen and adopted by Halo, just to name one. However, don't be afraid to experiment and push your limits, defeat is expected and game over is not contemplated. Knight worms and flying dogs Like any good self-respecting role-playing game, the members of our group then gain experience at the end of each match, they can be equipped with special talismans that modify their abilities passively and also possess eight talents that slightly modify their characteristics. From this point of view, SuperGiant Games could have done much more and the feeling you get during the evolution of the Nightwings is that there is never a real growth of the team, but rather imperceptible tweaks that only superficially change the general experience . Yet Pyre has his enchanting moments, he hides them well but knows how to give them to those who appreciate a deeper type of story, which must be discovered by reading the various notes scattered in the dialogues, which must be deepened by interacting with every single element on the screen and which hides many of his ideas to an inattentive and superficial eye. Unfortunately, when the story is about to explode and could get off to a great start (after about five hours from the beginning), everything flattens out, becoming a mere run-up to the next duel in a cyclical nature that is absolutely not good for the production and that also tires the most devoted enthusiast. On the other hand, the music is exceptional as always, with a perfect soundtrack to listen to over and over again, as well as the animations and colors that paint fascinating and wonderful pictures to observe. Pyre from an artistic point of view is therefore exceptional, but something more in terms of gameplay was to be expected. We can't talk about a missed opportunity but we come very, very close.", "date": "2017-07-24", "grade": "7.5"}
