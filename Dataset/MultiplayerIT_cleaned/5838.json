{"name": "CLANNAD", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/160377-clannad-la-regina-delle-visual-novel.html", "text": "Each videogame genre has its most representative titles, those that are mentioned in every discussion on the subject and are offered to non-enthusiasts as the best you can try to evaluate what they don't know. We can consider them real business cards, works with such a profound impact that they manage to give an identity to the genre itself, becoming an object of comparison and, in perspective, points of reference for future products. It is a phenomenon that has always occurred with all forms of expression, but which in an era in which communicating has become much easier, appears even more marked. Some might argue that such a dynamic carries with it the poison of conformity, but that is, as they say, another story. When it comes to visual novels it is easy to identify which are the most loved titles, at least here in the West. Among these we certainly find The Fruit of Grisaia, Steins;Gate, Fate/Stay Night and Clannad, the subject of this review (there are also other names, of course, but we cannot mention them all). Developed by Key, to whom we also owe other titles of great interest such as Kanon, Little Busters! and Rewrite, Clannad was first published in Japan in 2004. Recently the very active publisher Sekai Project has translated it into English (actually there was an amateur translation, but it's not the same thing) thanks to a Kickstarter campaign of great success, finally offering fans a version of the work worthy of the name it bears, which can be easily purchased on Steam, even if at a not exactly negligible price. For the sake of video game history, it should be remembered that there are versions of Clannad for consoles as well: PlayStation 2, PSP, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita; all strictly in Japanese and never officially arrived here. As has happened with other successful productions of the genre, an anime was also made from Clannad. We reviewed Clannad, one of the best visual novels ever made Branches The visual novel itself has a classic structure and no big frills. The viewer reads the texts and from time to time is called upon to make choices between two or three possibilities, choices that make the story branch off in different directions. There are of course all the most popular supplementary options for the genre, such as fast forward, the possibility of hiding the interface to admire the drawings, a real encyclopedia, called Dangopedia, to consult to know the meaning of the more exotic terms who meet. If desired, there is also the possibility of advancing the texts automatically, limiting the intervention of the user to the choices, excellent if you want to immerse yourself in reading without worrying about anything else. Obviously, speaking of visual novels, fans don't expect much else from the interaction mechanics. What they expect, however, is a long and articulated story, as exciting as possible. From this point of view Clannad is a truly excellent title from every point of view. Before talking about the plot, it is right to give some numbers. To see all the branches of the plot of Key's title, one can spend eighty to three hundred hours, which amply justifies the purchase price. Don't worry, it's not as absurd a gap as it seems. When we talk about seeing everything, we mean reading every possible narrative twist. If you don't follow a guide, an operation that we strongly recommend (for a visual novel it is not blasphemy to do so), the times of use end up considerably lengthening, because some contents are unlocked by reading the story several times. Some even require you to face events in a certain order to reveal yourself. The choices made influence part of the events of subsequent readings and enrich the general narrative picture, which has become increasingly profound. To really finish Clannad, i.e. to unlock the true ending, you have to conclude all the narrative arcs, collecting the thirteen spheres of light of the characters you interact with. At first they seem less, but Key's work is much more complex and articulated than it seems at first glance. Stories Clannad is divided into two distinct narrative segments. The first, dedicated to school years (School Life), tells the life of Tomoya Okazaki, a slightly moved high school student, who has to interact and help some people in his last year of high school. Among these Nagisa Furukawa, the other protagonist. Tomoya is a problematic character, with big family problems, caused by his alcoholic father. When he meets Nagisa, he gets involved in the refounding of the school's drama club. From here arise a series of situations invery braided that lead to the second narrative arc, which takes place in the post-school years. Forgive us if we remain too vague, but we prefer not to reveal anything about the plot, since it is the cornerstone of the title. Just know that it includes nuances of all kinds, with romantic moments, others strongly dramatic, still others comedians. In fact, having to indicate what the true beauty of Clannad is, we don't have too many doubts: the human richness represented by its characters, i.e. the ability demonstrated by Key to tell stories, tragic, delicate and significant, making them evolve naturally without getting lost in clichs. We are not revealing anything about the second narrative segment, because by talking about it we should give you big advances. We can only tell you that it is the natural evolution of the story told in the first part. Another field in which Clannad excels is that of drawings. Key's artists have not only done a great job in making the characters and settings, but also from that of the characterization. In fact, the dialogues are rich in expressions of the characters and there are many tables dedicated to specific moments that further enrich the narrative. Fortunately, given the tone of the story, eccentric choices have been avoided. In short, despite the obvious anime style, the likelihood dominates. Obviously in the lighter moments there are changes of register, with the use of the typical techniques used by Japanese artists to underline some situations. But they are always appropriate to the overall style of the game and never transcend it into the absurd.", "date": "2015-12-09", "grade": "9.2"}
