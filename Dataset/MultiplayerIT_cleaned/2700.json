The developers of Gust Studio took advantage of the period of time available to them (therefore from September - October 2019, when the first Atelier Ryza arrived in the West) to develop a real sequel to the franchise, which normally has never re-proposed the same protagonist for two episodes in a row. But there is always a first time, and in this time the love of the fans has not asked, but directly demanded, the return of Ryza. Let's try to understand why, but above all let's dissect this sequel thoroughly, trying to analyze the various innovations in great detail within a context that already appears very, very conservative at first glance. And that despite everything - balancing pros and cons - also takes the series to new levels. The plot: where were we? Three years have now passed since the adventures of Ryza, Tao, Lent and company on Kurken Island: apparently (and quantitatively) three years may seem few, very short; yet they can also change everything. And so the player grappling with the plot of Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy has to come to terms with some truths: Ryza has remained more or less the same as always, with her spontaneity and ingenuity, but also a great desire to roll up your sleeves and go on an adventure. The others don't. The narrative takes hold with the arrival of the protagonist near the capital of the kingdom, Ashra-am Baird; as we will see later, if something exists and you need it, this is where you will find it. Two reasons push Ryza to travel: a letter from Tao (now a prestigious academic, who needs to talk to her) and a mysterious object entrusted to her by Bos's father. In reality, it will turn out to be nothing less than an egg (all of which was obvious at first glance), from which Fi will be born, in a certain sense the ~secret fairy~ of the title, as well as a little creature present in all the posters available today. As you may have understood, having played the previous episode is certainly a good prerequisite, but not a fundamental one; anyway here is the review of Atelier Ryza Ever Darkness And The Secret Hideout. From the capital onwards, the adventures of Ryza, Tao and all the others (old and new characters, welcome returns and unexpected surprises) will be marked by an alternation (not always very effective) between the exploration of the dungeons, which are located around the city, and tasks related to city life. Guts Studio has however tried to tell a deeper story, closer to the psychology of the protagonist and her social relationships with all the other characters, supporting and secondary: this is one of the main novelties of the sequel. But what does the ~lost legends~ have to do with all this? The progression We must try to make the idea of the new progression proposed by Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy. You will once again find yourself grappling with a very vast game world (but not open world: the areas connected to each other by invisible paths return), all freely explorable, also by exploiting new mechanics related to the gameplay. But at the same time Ryza's life in the capital will have to be kept an eye on, and her events with all the characters present: therefore you will not simply alternate between the dungeons to continue the plot. Between one dungeon and another, but also within the progression of the same dungeon, Ryza will have to continually return to her atelier in Ashra-am Baird. Only here (real main hub) will it be possible to modify the objects equipped by the characters, send the Puni, the pet, on a mission, furnish the house but above all else dedicate oneself to alchemy through the large pot kindly granted by the good old Tao. Gradually Ryza will unlock new areas scattered around the capital, the Ruins of the ancient world: the progression within these areas will still be linked to returns to the city, even if only to talk to other characters who could provide useful information. Luckily all this has become very fast: just a few actions in the game map menu, cleaned up and improved, to directly access individual city areas, or return to a precise level of an equally specific dungeon. Beyond the main plot, then, Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy offers a myriad of ultra-fast side missions, to be accepted through the notice board in the Cafe, or real ~series~ quests, to be unlocked by speakingor with NPCs scattered around the city. This enriches the context of production, already in itself rich in stimuli; however, at least in terms of content, we are at other levels compared to the first Atelier Ryza. The gameplay From the moment Tao reveals to Ryza the existence of ancient legends, with annexed ruins to explore, the protagonists' lives will never be the same. In fact, with each new area, the girl will discover the existence of more or less sophisticated devices, which introduce significant innovations in terms of gameplay, but not even as exceptional as we would have expected. Let's take for example the ~magic tie~, a kind of energy liana that allows you to cross overhangs: it is a situational object. You will not be able to use it all the time, but only in the presence of certain platforms; a mechanic as ~old~ as Rayman's Viola Lums. Similar and partly different speech applies to the other tools, beyond the objects with which to obtain resources for crafting (shovels, hoes, hatchets, and so on): there are, for example, candies to make you breathe underwater, which they will prove to be essential to proceed towards another submerged dungeon. Very often the game is not particularly generous with information, you will have to understand for yourself what is needed at a given moment; the English language, the only one present, will not help every type of player, although its level of difficulty is certainly not that of university. However, we are talking about a title that makes texts its mainstay. Still with regard to the gameplay, Guts Studio had spoken of environments developed vertically, complete with the possibility for the protagonist to climb. This is also partially true, just find that sort of ivy / creeper that since the beginning of the world marks the areas where it is possible to climb by clinging to the surfaces. But here too everything is very situational; how situational is ~walking sideways~ along certain areas of dungeons, ~pretending~ that you are in danger of falling off. All this only partially modifies the use of the environments in terms of level design, making it a little more dynamic. A bit'. Improved alchemy and encounters However, it is undeniable how much Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy has improved or made the use of entire aspects of the gameplay more accessible. Alchemy, for example, still remains a cumbersome activity for professionals: yet there is no shortage of guides, suggestions, or even buttons for self-production. And if you really can't find that log of wood you need for an ax, there is the local market outside the house: take out those coins accumulated with side missions. It goes without saying that alchemy now allows you to create many more objects and tools, which is part of the general deepening of the mechanics mentioned above. The clashes against monsters, in dungeons and not, have also been revised, even changing the names of what are now the Support Mode and the Aggresive Mode (in the latter the various party members will also be able to use the tools offensive, because whoever strikes first strikes twice). Also from this point of view we have tried to improve the dynamism of the encounters: the player can quickly switch from the control of one character to that of any other, structure his strategies well, combine basic and special attacks with each other, obviously taking into account the ~points~ that can be spent both for skills and for the use of secondary objects (the ~core items~). Everything has a cost in Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy: you have to do the math well to win the fights, it's not enough to own the weapon with the best stats. Playstation 4 trophies Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy, like its predecessor, allows players to unlock the coveted Platinum Trophy; moreover, it seems that it is not about anything too complex, given that missable trophies seem to be absent. The difficulty, then, is nothing really insurmountable: arm yourself with patience and dedicate yourself to alchemy, the rest will come by itself. Technical compartment We had the opportunity to test the PlayStation 4 version of Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy, but by running it on PlayStation 5: however, the real version optimized for the new Sony console will only be available when the embargo expires, therefore we will eventually come back to you at a later time. Basically we had to ~settle~ for a compatible mode, which is truly remarkable. Even so, in fact, the game loads (necessary in passing from any area to another) are practically non-existent (2-3 timed seconds). The general glance is more than satisfactory, even if the technical sector aought to need some more refinement in certain elements of the game: the city stairs, for example, always show a strange white patina, seen from a distance. But in truth here the matter is another: and that is that productions of this type would need a new game engine, to see their individual objects redesigned from scratch instead of reusing the previous assets to the bitter end. The frame rate didn't show a flicker, but we're not sure if it's pegged at 60fps.", "date": "2021-01-26", "grade": "8.2"}
