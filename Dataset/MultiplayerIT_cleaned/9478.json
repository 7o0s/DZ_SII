You will probably remember above all the anime series, broadcast in our country during 2001, and divided into two very pleasant seasons. You will hardly know, however, that the entire franchise began not with the cartoon, but with an extremely prolific series of video games, which boasts fourteen titles to date. Now, the first Monster Rancher for PlayStation 1 in Italy didn't even get there: Monster Rancher 2 instead yes, thanks to a wise commercial operation that brought it closer to the animated series. In the shops, between 2000 and 2003, it was also easy to find themed toys. Since we live in an era marked by the ~nostalgia factor~, could a nice Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX be missing, considering among other things the first twenty-five candles blown out by Genki and company? The package including the two remastered titles is now available on PC, Nintendo Switch, Android, iPhone and iPad. Let's find out how they fared in the review of Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX. Collecting monsters Here is your Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX ranch The main purpose of Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX is to collect monsters, which has always led players to associate this series with various Pokmon and Digimon. In reality, the comparison makes more sense with the latter than with the former, because on closer inspection the game methods and strategies turn out to be profoundly different from those of Game Freak's little monsters. It is true that in Monster Rancher, regardless of the chapter of the saga, it is satisfying to discover all the specimens hidden by the developers, and to have each of them on your ranch at least once. Then, however, you also have to take care of it, as in an extremely more complex and varied version of the classic Tamagochi. There is even a plot, as anime lovers will well know. Monsters have coexisted with humans since relatively recently. Many centuries ago a series of disasters devastated the supercontinent, before the latter separated into the current ones: men asked God for help. The latter - no one knows why - created new forms of life to help men: monsters , precisely. Except that eventually the monsters got into a lot of trouble and wars too, and then God, justifiably impatient, sealed them in circular stone discs. Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX fights look like this After years and years, in which even the memory of these events had been lost, men have found the stone disks, discovered their functioning and brought the monsters back to life, organized farms, farms and tournaments based on them. The player's aim therefore is above all to obtain a new monster, raise it within his own, brand new ranch, then follow him in his debut in the official competitions held at certain times of the month. The long-term goal is to obtain all the monsters, especially the most powerful ones, and to triumph in the four most prestigious and difficult tournaments in the world, thus becoming the breeder par excellence. Certainly not an easy undertaking, but - as always - the journey is more important than the goal. Gameplay: rags to riches From the ranch of Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX it is possible to access a series of secondary activities (limited) The path proposed by Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX is that from rags to riches: train your monsters, initially unknown and very weak, to then make them become real champions, powerful and known to the general public. The management of the ranch, which consists of most of the gameplay, is entrusted to decisions taking into account the passage of time: each week of each month can be ~occupied~ with a single task. You can force your monster to participate in specific training sessions, make it rest, reward it with food, or take it directly to the arena. The important thing is to remember that every time we choose one of these actions, a week passes. In all of this, activities have costs and can reward you with a certain amount of money: therefore it is good to keep an eye on your finances constantly. Obviously the choice of one activity instead of another must be motivated. Each monster has parameters (attack, defense, skills, health, power, and so on), which can be increased (or decreased) by dedicating yourself to particular tasks. Go toworking in one way or helping the postmen of the city with deliveries increase, respectively, different parameters, which must be studied always keeping in mind the specific monster available. And of course, don't stress your partner too much, because she could get sick or depressed and end up in the hospital (which means losing several weeks in a row). Tournaments are, today as then, one of the most interesting moments of Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX. Excelling is not easy at all, even at the lowest levels of category (E); in themselves, moreover, the battles also represent the most dynamic offer of the production. In fact, in just a few seconds you have to decide whether to attack or defend yourself, whether to approach or move away from the enemy, within a 3D environment with very limited movements (the monsters move along a horizontal line). The time factor is not negligible either: if the timer expires, the monster with the most health at that given moment wins. Winning a tournament means accumulating money and fame, thus favoring the progression of your partner. A somewhat subdued return Understand well that in Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX, visually, we are stuck in the PlayStation 1 era The return of Monster Rancher 1 & 2 within the Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX pack immediately appears a bit subdued. Basically, the developers have taken up the titles published in the late nineties on the first PlayStation, enriching some textures here and there, revising the resolution a bit within the arena and strung everything with a sprinkle of high definition. On balance, the work turns out to be extremely lazy and conservative: qualitatively we find ourselves almost dealing with the exact same titles as twenty-five years ago. We gladly overlook the movies, grainy and ugly because left completely to themselves, and the language of the game, exclusively English; a minimal adaptation, even if amateurish, certainly would not have brought the publisher to bankruptcy. Naturally Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX was never presented as a remake and therefore it was absurd to expect both games to be redone from scratch: apart from the unpublished menus and almost zero loading times, current or modern there is very little else to note . Completely absent, for obvious reasons, also the mechanics of obtaining monsters linked to the use of CDs and DVDs. In fact, you will remember how in the first Monster Ranchers it was possible to use CDs to be inserted manually into the console, to then unlock different monsters, simulating a bit the mechanics of stone monster discs. Today CDs are hardly used anymore and certainly not used on Steam, Nintendo Switch, iPhone and iPad; it's a shame that the manual entry system of record titles and song authors isn't equally satisfying. All that remains is to buy, where possible, the monsters at the city market of the main city, or combine those already in our possession to obtain more powerful ones.", "date": "2021-12-08", "grade": "6.5"}
