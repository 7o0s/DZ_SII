{"name": "Giulia scende in corsia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/67239-giulia-passione-dottoressa-giulia-scende-in-corsia.html", "text": "Simplicity Even the most inexperienced players will be able to try their hand at the clinical cases presented. Each operation is always preceded by an explanatory, concise and clear guide, and even in the moment of the action, arrows and signals will be able to accompany beginners in the intricate meanders of medicine! Even the interface is characterized by extreme simplicity: a single key with a large arrow allows you to proceed step by step in the cases presented to the surgery and an intuitive system of symbols helps to understand the accuracy of the clinical choices made ( a green tick if the choice proved to be correct, a red X if not). Act in first person One of the funniest aspects of Giulia Passione Dottoressa is the interactivity that distinguishes some clinical tests. To examine a sore throat, for example, you need to yell into your DS microphone, just as if the player were inviting the patient to open their mouth and do the same. Or again, after having disinfected a wound, just blow on the microphone to dry it! Specialize Engine of the game is undoubtedly the variety of diagnostic tools that can be collected during the various chapters. We start from simple things, such as ointments for bruises or sphygmomanometers to measure blood pressure, but as we grind clinical cases and refine our skills, we approach the specialist field; in this way various special tools are acquired: the X-Ray machine, the allergy test, the eye test board and many others. It would make you want to play just to unlock them all. For the most charming Giulia has a passion for medicine...but not only that! In fact, in the game there is the possibility of dealing with various ~extra-ambulatory~ aspects, first of all the decoration of one's apartment. Thanks to the experience with patients, Giulia increases her personal score, which can be spent to buy knick-knacks and objects to beautify the house. Clothing can also undergo changes: six different shades can color Giulia's dress and even her coat. And finally, a real treat: for patients, heart-shaped plasters! If that's not being coquettish... Repetita... taediant If it is true that in many cases repeating helps to learn, it is also true that too much repetitiveness inexorably leads to boredom. The main defect of Giulia Passione Dottoressa is precisely this: despite the various tools that the player has at his disposal, the solutions to the clinical cases presented are reduced to a few game schemes. An example above all: whether the patient has terrible food poisoning, or whether you find yourself in a trivial case of heartburn, the path to follow is always the same. Same exams, same drugs, same lines uttered by the characters. When we say ~the world is beautiful because it is varied~... Little autonomy In Giulia Passione Dottoressa one never gets to have complete autonomy on the cases presented. If in the first chapters arrows and indications to do one's job are a useful tool to get to the heart of the game, after a while they become even annoying. In this way the experience is reduced to a mere execution of pre-established actions; two above all: to test the pressure it is sufficient to push the arrow in pre-established areas (the same for all patients) or to prescribe a drug it is sufficient to complete a pre-compiled prescription. A pinch of autonomy more would not be spoiled.", "date": "2009-05-06", "grade": null}
