This is Hoth, an ice planet on which ~there's no life to even fill a space cruiser,~ Commander Han Solo would say. A desolate and silent stage like a tomb, on which one of the most epic battles in the Star Wars saga took place, as well as one of the most exciting and dramatic sequences in science fiction cinema. Between the advance of the indomitable AT-ATs, the improvised aerial battles and the resistance of the trench infantry, it was almost obvious that the crushing defeat of the Rebels that opens The Empire Strikes Back was being portrayed within some video game. Thus, after the various Battlefront, Rogue Squadron and, albeit in a revised version, The Force Unleashed, the war event was also disturbed by THQ Wireless, which re-proposed it to iPhone and iPod Touch owners in a whole new sauce. Star Wars: the battle of Hoth, this is the name, is a tower defense of the classic ones, which clearly borrows some ideas and mechanics already defined by titles for Apple devices such as Star Defense or the more famous Fieldrunners. Those who are already accustomed to the genre take a few moments to become familiar with the game interface: the aim, as everyone would expect, is to place units on the battlefield and block the advance of the Imperial Troops towards the now doomed Base Echo. Jedi to whom? Unless you suffer from a pathological aversion to tower defense, The Battle of Hoth has more or less all the ingredients to attract, like bees with honey, the numerous fans of the Lucasian saga. Between the Rebel troops and those of the Empire there are almost twenty different units, which it is possible to deploy in battle as you progress through the levels; each of these provides a certain number of enemy waves to block, where land and air units alternate on the field. While turrets and infantry units try to stop soldiers, probe droids and AT-STs, Empire fighters and rebel X-wings battle overhead. Each unit has weaknesses and strengths, but as in Fieldrunners it is possible to spend ~command points~ to enhance its characteristics; moreover, this resource is collected by eliminating the opposing troops, and is indispensable for deploying new forces. However, the attempt to insert elements that are not too fashionable in tower defense is commendable, starting from the possibility of giving precise instructions to one's soldiers: one can order a unit to concentrate fire on the closest enemy or on the weakest one, attack only land units or only air units. A very interesting idea that finds meaning and usefulness especially in the more advanced levels, when there won't be a Luke Skywalker to shoot down a gigantic AT-AT by himself. The conformation of the terrain, with inaccessible hills and narrow canyons, makes it much more difficult and chaotic to structure one's own formation in the field, but in doing so it pushes to ponder each positioning and to dig trenches capable of slowing down the enemy advance and divert its path; too bad that selecting and disposing of your troops is less intuitive than you expect, due to tiny icons and an imprecise interface. The battle of Hoth does not bother to accompany the player by the hand, and becoming familiar with the different units and their characteristics requires both a few levels of apprenticeship and a careful reading of the short in-game guide. But the biggest regret concerns the technical sector, torn apart by the bad animations of the soldiers and, incredible but true, by a soundtrack that is not up to par, which leaves John Williams' historical themes at home and replaces them with repetitive and not very engaging music . A real shame, if not downright drama, as the audiovisual component has always been an important element for the franchise.
