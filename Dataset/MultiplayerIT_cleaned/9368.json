Considering the sad fate that often await spin-offs and above all the not always edifying history of the adaptations of the flagship Ubisoft brands on Nintendo consoles, it was all too easy to predict a priori existence for the product on the margins of the initial 3DS line-up . Nothing could be more wrong: although it represents the least impressive showcase for the three-dimensional potential of the Nintendo portable, Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars is at the same time one of the most valid games currently available for the system. Let's find out why. Ghost VS Borat As mentioned at the beginning, Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars is a turn-based strategy that conceptually is closer to a Fire Emblem rather than an Advance Wars, even if the most suitable parallel would be another: the game designer of the game is in fact Julian Gollop , a name that perhaps won't say anything to most but behind which lurks none other than the author of UFO: Enemy Unknown, an authentic masterpiece of the genre dated 1994. And the good Julian's hand can be seen, given that Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars succeeds in the difficult task of being sufficiently immediate from the start but without sacrificing anything in terms of complexity and general depth. But let's go in order. The story - approximate and not at all engaging - sees a group of six members of the special Ghost unit sent to Kazakhstan to foil the usual destructive military project of the usual power-hungry Russian politician. A mere pretext, narrated mostly through static cutscenes characterized by soporific dialogues, to catapult the user into thirty-seven scenarios that make up a rather demanding campaign, which can take well over twenty hours to complete. Each mission can be tackled by selecting three different levels of difficulty, and all are distinguished by a commendable search for variety as regards the objectives to be achieved in order to win victory: one passes from the mere annihilation of the opposing forces to the safeguarding of certain units up to even tasty variants in which it is required to occupy strategic positions to accumulate more points than the enemies in a limited number of rounds. The assortment of the six protagonists of the game in terms of combat skills is another winning aspect of Ubisoft production: being able to count on a team made up of a commando, a sniper, a gunner, a doctor, an engineer and a raider guarantees all user ample room for maneuver to set up their own attacks. Each Ghost has unique skills and equipment - which can be upgraded at the end of each stage by spending the stars obtained for each objective achieved - as well as real special shots to be released after loading a special indicator: just to get an idea of what you find for the hands, the gunner can move a few squares but his minigun is capable of devastating damage, the engineer is the only one able to place turrets, the raider is equipped with a stealth system and so on. The 3D effect As mentioned in the review, Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars does not exactly represent the best advertisement for the three-dimensional characteristics of the Nintendo console, also due to a bird's eye view which helps to flatten the scenarios. The 3D effect is appreciable for landforms and objects of a certain size, such as buildings or tanks, and also applies to text screens that ~detach~ from the seabed. Tactically flawless What makes Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars such a pleasant strategy to play is its extraordinary tactical richness, which however reveals itself to the user in small doses, revealing new facets of the combat system step by step. The movement of the units through the inevitable colored boxes is just the tip of the iceberg, but a few missions are enough to realize all the numerous variations that come into play in the clashes: from the range of the different weapons to the bonuses/malus related to the terrain , from the dynamics that regulate the counterattacks to the effectiveness of the various covers behind which it is possible to take cover, Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars puts on the plate a quantity of content unknown to many other similar titles. The touchscreen of the Nintendo 3DS, responsible for displaying various maps and statistics, is in this sense a precious ally, even if it must be said that the various menus do not always shine for their clarity and ease of consultation. Again, such structural abundance sometimes even seems wasted when artificial intelligenceimpeccable analysis of the opponents allows you to get rid of them without too many worries even with a barely sketched tactical planning. And while we're at it, we count among the (few) defects of the Ubisoft title also a technical realization that is only sufficient, with functional but rather poor graphics and a decidedly repetitive sound sector especially as regards the music. In any case, marginal aspects for a strategic one, which in fact weigh little on the evaluation of a complete product even as regards the secondary methods. Once the campaign is over, in fact, it is possible to try your hand at the so-called Skirmishes, or twenty scenarios with specific starting conditions and objectives, or in a multiplayer section confined to use only for two users in hotseat, but which still works just fine.", "date": "2011-04-06", "grade": "8.3"}
