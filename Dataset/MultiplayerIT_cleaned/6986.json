It's hard to think that behind a remake, sometimes, there is something more than statistics and cold numbers. Fortunately, this is not the case with Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!, a title that - we feel like saying - was made with the heart, respecting an original that has left its mark and has become an object of worship. The first Oddworld, subtitled Abe's Oddysee, dates back to 1997: appreciated for its originality, it was a little less so for the brutal difficulty that characterized certain passages of the game. The original developer, Oddworld Inhabitants, conceived three sequels with the idea of turning the franchise into a pentalogy, but eventually problems with the publishers stopped the developer's run. After many adventures and a silence that lasted years, it was the collaboration with Just Add Water - and the encouragement of Lorne Lanning fans, biological father of Oddworld - to lay the foundations for what is a very welcome return. We return to Oddworld with a remake that updates one of the most difficult games ever with class! Mudokon-based diet Although it appears almost as a pretext, the plot of Oddworld is quite interesting and original: in fact, it tells the adventures of Abe, a Mudokon employed (of the year!) as an orderly in the RuptureFarms, a factory complex governed by the alien Molluck who deals with producing canned foods. Foods that, needless to say, are made of other aliens. The problem arises when the raw material begins to run out (basically, the alien species have become extinct) and the management decides to grind the enslaved Mudokons to produce fantastic ice lollies. Unfortunately Abe discovers everything and decides to run away from the factory, taking away as many friends as possible: and this is where we come into play. We will control poor Abe in what is a kind of platformer with a strong puzzle component in a series of levels divided into horizontal and vertical scrolling macrosections. Abe can run, jump and roll, but also resort to a trance that allows him to mentally control factory guards and other enemies, unless - as often happens - a drone is present that prevents him from using his mental powers . The many pitfalls scattered throughout the levels are almost always double-edged: the trapdoors risk swallowing Abe, but they can be opened at the right time to let an unwary enemy fall inside, just as it is possible to resort to millstones, laser barriers and other traps that often they are not only obstacles but crucial elements of the current puzzle. Abe, however, is a very fragile little creature and it doesn't take much to kill him; the guards are terribly vigilant and in order not to get noticed you have to walk on tiptoe and take advantage of the shadows and puffs of smoke to blend in with the environment. The scenario, in fact, is almost always our best ally, but at times it also manages to be our worst enemy due to the complexity and the high level of detail that sometimes confuses ideas: Oddworld, of course, has been redesigned by zero, and the result is a visually splendid title with a great atmosphere, but also a little confusing in which the solution to the current puzzle is not always very clear, especially if linked to the setting. In any case, the work done by Just Add Water is extraordinary not only in the remodeling of the characters, animated from scratch and full of even more personality, but also in the use of colours, effects and plays of light and shadow. Once you leave the RuptureFarms, you are amazed not so much by the starry sky overlooking Abe, but by the sensitivity with which the developer plays on distances, profiles and shadows to give a special flavor to many shots. Playstation 4 trophies The thirty-six trophies - divided into twenty-two bronze, nine silver, five gold - which belong to platinum are unlocked in a fairly obvious way: you have to save all the Mudokons, complete the game and find all the secret levels, but c There is also room for slightly strange challenges, such as the one that requires you to ride the Elum for two hundred meters without ever stopping. Abe's Odyssey Our protagonist, for his part, finds himself on his hands a difficult task: not only to save his own skin, fleeing from the alien meat factory, but also that of his fellow men, reduced to slavery and forced to wax, day and night, while huge billboards affect us in real time how many of them are still alive and how many died from coours. Compared to the original Abe's Oddysee, Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty! allows you to ~control~ several Mudokons at the same time: Abe can in fact attract their attention and indicate what to do through four commands linked to the directional cross, suggesting for example to wait or to follow him. Which, however, does not make the rescue operation any easier. Mudokons are rather stupid and to prevent them from waking up sleeping enemies or from facing certain death, you need to alternate orders carefully and, perhaps, with a little timing, even use them as bait. It should be noted that to complete the game it is not necessary to save even a Mudokon, but Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty! it has two endings just like the original, tied to the number of slaves rescued by the end of the adventure. Considering that practically every level hides a secret portal that leads to an extra stage and the replayed levels do not count the Mudokons saved the first time, it is clear that the most persistent will find in one hundred percent of Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty! the proverbial bread for their teeth, especially if we consider the high difficulty of the adventure, exacerbated by an improved control system, compared to the mediocre one of 1997, but still rather woody and imprecise. It is not clear whether it was a choice of Just Add Water to put his hand on Abe's clumsiness, the fact is that sometimes even making a simple jump can be tricky, especially if we are running at breakneck speed between mines and motion detectors. Fortunately we are met with two exponential improvements over the unforgiving difficulty of the very first Oddworld. The first concerns the revised and corrected level design, in which the levels, while offering more or less the same puzzles, have been enlarged and framed by the camera in order to reveal the threats well in advance. This new design not only allows you to better study the environment and think about what to do more calmly, but also makes the scene spectacular with dynamic and wide-ranging shots. The other brand new feature is the quick save option, combined with a generous spread of checkpoints. Simply press the DualShock 4's touch pad to save your location and hold it down to instantly reload, checkpoint nearby or not. An option which, despite being optional, will perhaps make franchise or vintage purists turn up their noses, but which to us seemed like a real godsend, especially in the most frustrating moments, which, moreover, definitely abound already after the 'introduction. In short, the rejuvenation operation worked more than well also from the point of view of difficulty, still calibrated upwards but acceptable thanks to the quicksave compromise; on the other hand, Oddworld still appears to be a title from the past in some ways, with a rather embarrassing co-op mode, based simply on passing the joypad to control Abe in turn. And was there really a need to call it that?", "date": "2014-07-25", "grade": "8.4"}
