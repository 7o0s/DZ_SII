{"name": "Altered Beast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/altered-beast.html", "text": "Project Altered Beast abandons the archaic settings of Ancient Greece in favor of a story that takes place in the present day. Due to a mysterious toxic gas leak, the city of Foret is placed under quarantine by the authorities and the Secretary of State, Ramirez, orders the immediate evacuation of the area. Meanwhile, in the skies of the area, a military transport helicopter is attacked and destroyed by a huge winged monster. Once crashed near a wood, a large box marked U.S.G.R. is thrown out of the burning aircraft. (United States Gene Research), from which, a moment later, we see a mysterious individual emerge who seems to have lost his memory, Ruke Custard, or rather us. And here the real game begins. Right from the start, in fact, you will be projected into the middle of the action and you will find yourself surrounded by a group of mutated creatures determined to make you a party. From a narrative point of view, PAB therefore does not propose anything really new. The gameplay is the simplest one can expect from a similar title and brings to mind not only its predecessor, but also the old Nightmare Creatures for Psx: one advances, without interruption, beating and slicing everything that comes within range in the attempt to make their way to the next scenario, after a final level fight with the boss on duty. Although the main mode of the game is called ~Story~ (there are other unlockable modes such as the timed Boss Battle), the player is not given much opportunity to fully explore the scenarios to collect information useful for the development of the plot or items along the way except that for some Power-Ups in ~energetic~ form which we will discuss in detail shortly, not so much for lack of freedom of movement within the scenarios, but rather because, apart from some hidden levels, there is not much, precisely to look for. The same elements that make up the leitmotif of the story are revealed only thanks to some CG footage (perhaps the best-crafted component of the entire game) which lay the foundations for subsequent actions or to partially unravel some aspects of the plot. With the Square key it is possible to perform a whole series of attack moves, which in Beast mode can be combined with the pressure of other keys to create absolutely terrifying combos, while with the Triangle key it is possible to perform a super move that sweeps enemies. When the main protagonist is in human form, with the same button, after having stunned an opponent with a volley of fists, it is possible to pierce him with one hand and lift him from behind, sucking out all the vital energy simply by repeatedly pressing the command. The energy sucked from the opponents, either in this way or simply by walking on their torn remains (they lie on a green light) fills a special energy bar which, once it reaches its peak, allows Ruke to transform into a Beast by pressing the Circle key. In this case you will see a small menu similar to a pop-up appear on the screen where you will be shown a grid depicting the various creatures you can transform into. These creatures (there are ten in all that can be activated during the adventure) will have different powers depending on the type, and will be able to count on a whole series of customizable combos, as we mentioned earlier when talking about ~Power-Ups~, simply by collecting additional elements called Geomi from some monsters, which can be acquired, as was the case in Legacy of Kain, by killing particular types of enemies. In Beast mode there will obviously be no shortage of combos and special moves other than the ~human~ ones, which can also be performed by pressing the Triangle key. In the form of a wolf, for example, it will be possible to perform a long horizontal attack that will sweep everything on the road, while transformed into a Dragon we will be able to perform a devastating breath of fire. Furthermore, these transformations will also have other functions than the ~simple~ increase of combat skills, such as those of allowing the overcoming of otherwise insurmountable obstacles. Even from an aesthetic point of view, the SEGA title certainly does not make one cry out for a miracle. If on the one hand we have a fairly good frame rate that allows the presence of many enemies on the screen without weighing too much on the fluidity, on the other hand the game suffers from the usual problems typical of some themed productions, such as a camera that is not always close and focused on the action (unless you manage it yourself with the Right Analog Stick, but it's awkward during fights) and overall poor texture quality. While it is true that often such problems are related todouble thread to the hardware limitations of the Ps2, it is also true that other softcto have managed to overcome these problems for some time, offering us titles with stunning graphics such as the various Jak & Dexter or Onimusha 3. It was therefore legitimate to expect something better from SEGA, because so PAB looks like a first generation title. All in all, the very settings of the various scenarios seem anonymous and at times repetitive, as well as the characterization of the enemies, certainly not at the level of those of DMC3 for example, except for some Bosses and for the main creatures into which you can transform yourself, realized with an all in all convincing design. The same thing goes for the music, without infamy and without praise. Conclusions If SEGA focuses on titles like this to relaunch itself at the top of videogame productions, then we really believe that Sonic's house managers do better to review their strategies. If AB had come out a couple of years ago, perhaps it could have been evaluated differently and it would have aroused more interest on our part, but in the light of the most recent productions to which the SEGA title is unfortunately inevitably related, the game unfortunately fails. At this point I think it is legitimate to ask why the Japanese software continues to insist on these productions when it could and should focus on other leading titles of the recent past, winning brands to be launched on the market such as the highly anticipated Shenmue 3 (and possible sequels) or the immortal Sonic.. Self harm? Unfortunately we will never know Pros: Localization in Italian. 50/60Hz selector. A good dose of splatter. Cons: Technical realization far from excellent. Cameras not always on the action. Gameplay sometimes repetitive and not very varied. With the reorganization of the development teams and with a new marketing project announced in recent months, SEGA hopes to get out of a crisis that has unfortunately been gripping it for five years now. The idea behind the change wanted primarily by the president Hisao Oguchi is to work multi-platform and to rely, for the games, on famous names, dusting off those old classics that at the time of the 16Bit consoles and before that of bar cabinets quickly brought it to success, perhaps to the detriment of those more recent titles, read Shenmue, which, in our opinion, would probably allow it to return more quickly to the levels of quality and audience success that it deserves. In this sense, projects such as Shinobi or this Altered Beast should therefore be seen, one of the most famous games of the 80s and a flagship title, at least at the beginning, even of the Mega Drive in whose packaging it was often offered in a bundle. The original AB was a two-dimensional horizontal scrolling beat em'up with no frills, whose main feature lay in the possibility for the protagonists (you could play in two) to transform into more or less mythological creatures with which to face hordes of enemies , ranging from zombies to genetic aberrations of all kinds, across five breathtaking levels. The PS2 version keeps this feature unchanged, limiting itself in principle to updating the graphics engine to a full 3d, thanks to the work done by the guys from Wow Entertainment, already authors of House of the Dead, and to increase thanks to the third dimension some action elements with the addition of a strong splatter component.", "date": "2005-03-01", "grade": null}
