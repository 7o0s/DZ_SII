More than seven months have passed since then, the game has proved to be an extraordinary success and has seen the introduction of new content, in particular the stand-alone Battle Royale module, downloadable for free. It is interesting, we said, for several reasons: the first is the genesis of the game, which has been in the pipeline for so long that it was feared its cancellation, rather than a launch even in Early Access; the second is that the offer has actually changed a lot, and where the initial numbers did not arrive, the Battle Royale mode took care of it, which pushed the popularity of the game to unexpected peaks, with over forty million players detected just a few weeks ago . So let's try to understand if and how much Fortnite has improved since its inception in our updated review. Save the world! The original portion of Fortnite, with the Save the World! mode, is still in place and undoubtedly constitutes the core of the experience, its thickest element, as well as that part of the game that most makes us reflect on the free-to nature -play of a production which, however, is not yet downloadable for free and must be paid for a minimum of 39.99 euros: not exactly a popular price, if we consider what's in the package. Thinking a few months after the launch, in fact, the structure of the Epic Games title suggests everything except a premium connotation: to buy new characters you need hard currency, and in the same way to speed up the progression you need to pay or grind. You should know the gameplay mechanisms well by now: extricating ourselves within a still rather complicated interface between one stage and another, we will have to find objects and survivors, complete side quests and above all activate devices which, once started, will attract hordes of enemies. Our task will be to welcome them with all the weapons at our disposal until the end of the last wave, but also and above all to switch to the creation mode (Circle button) and build walls, ramps, stakeouts and traps that can allow us to defend the machine from fury of the zombies. The scenarios of the Save the World mode appear unchanged, as does the approach to the missions: in order to proceed between the various locations, we will have to complete objectives that do not necessarily have to do with completing the battle. This type of approach lends itself very well to the experience that the developers wanted to develop, a sort of huge sandbox in which to often and willingly find themselves exploring the same maps but with different tasks, so as to obtain the greatest possible duration without having to stuffing the game with new content: this is also a free-to-play style solution. The balancing of the difficulty follows this philosophy hand in hand, increasing the number and resistance of enemies as we get closer to unlocking new achievements. Well, how did Fortnite's PvE mode look a few months after its launch? Still quite funny in some situations, but at the same time stingy with substantial novelties, given that evidently Epic Games' effort has moved on to the most successful mode of the game, namely the ... Battle royal Launched for some time now, the Royal Battle has made a huge difference in terms of popularity for Fortnite, projecting the title into the Olympus of the most popular PvP experiences ever. The formula on which this module is based is really simple: after choosing whether to play alone, in pairs or in a team of four people, you are catapulted onto a large island with the aim of eliminating all other users and survive to the end. Once we get to the ground after the parachute jump, we will have to sneak into the closest urban agglomerations and look for weapons and objects that will make up our equipment, therefore in a completely random way: we could be lucky and immediately catch a powerful rocket launcher or a rifle precision, or be satisfied with a pistol or a small machine gun. Once we have recovered some weapons, we will be able to choose to use an unscrupulous or conservative approach, going in search of other players on the map to eliminate them or hiding while waiting for the ranks of our potential opponents to thin out and thus aim for one of the first positions in the final ranking. Naturally the game will not allow us to ~camp~, and so after a few minutes we will see the sky shrink due to the well-known stormstays purple, which will push us to converge towards a specific area of the scenario and there to deal with who is left in the game. At first the combat system leaves something to be desired, after all we are talking about a simplified third person shooter, without covers and mechanics of a certain thickness; but the more you go on, the more you realize the strategies that the Battaglia Reale allows you to put in place, possibly also resorting to the creation mode to generate shelters and avoid remaining too exposed to enemy fire. However, the incredible speed of matchmaking makes the difference, which allows you to ring matches (and therefore progress rather quickly, unless it is a sequence of game overs without any killings made) one after the other, without breaks or waiting times. Thanks to a solid infrastructure, undoubtedly, but also to the huge number of online players: a virtuous circle that is undoubtedly the best value of Fortnite. Playstation 4 trophies There are forty-six Trophies that can be unlocked with Fortnite: many are obtained by performing certain actions for the first time, for example building a weapon or a structure, while others are linked to the completion of groups of missions for each specific scenario. In any case, you have to devote quite a few hours to the game if you want to get everything. The inevitable progress There is no doubt that since its launch Fortnite has improved in many respects, primarily the technical one. The uncertainties of the beginnings are a distant memory, the cartoonish style of the characters and settings remains very convincing and a sixty frames per second mode has also been added for the Royal Battle module, which uses a dynamic resolution and which on PlayStation 4 Pro ( the platform we tested on) works very well. From the point of view of the contents, in truth, we haven't seen a lot: considering the fact that many users have not yet completed all the PvE missions, Epic Games wanted to avoid enriching that part of the experience except through the addition of elements second-rate, using its own resources for the creation of the Battle Royal mode and everything that revolves around it. This means that the combat system has also remained unchanged, with all its critical issues; in particular the extreme slipperiness of melee attacks and the lack of emphasis on impacts, which sadly makes landing one's strikes much less satisfying, whether it's a cooperative or competitive situation. The very intricate interface that is accessed between one mission and another is also unchanged, the one where it is possible to select the character, assign support units to the various teams, manage the projects related to the equipment and assign them to our avatar , as well as unlock new abilities using points earned on missions. A streamlining of these mechanisms could lead to a further leap in quality for the Epic Games title, perhaps together with some tricks on the front of melee clashes.", "date": "2018-03-07", "grade": "8.0"}
