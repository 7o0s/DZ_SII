The operation carried out by FoxNext Games therefore appears brilliant: to exploit the official license of the house of ideas to bring to iOS and Android devices a strategic RPG structurally identical to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, but equipped with a less limiting freemium system and a very substantial content package. The narrative device sees in this case the arrival of Ultimus, a Kree conqueror who travels from dimension to dimension to subjugate parallel planets and galaxies. In the course of his sorties, the powerful villain has bent the will of various ~alternative~ heroes and villains, with the aim of exploiting their strength to carry out his own attack on our Earth. Will the Shield, the Avengers and the other superheroes be able to foil his plan? We will find out in five different campaigns (the last of which is not yet available, actually), each divided into a series of levels with increasing degrees of difficulty. Having created a team with the characters at our disposal, we will have to defeat groups of opponents in the perspective of turn-based combat with a moderate strategic depth; all while reminding us to upgrade and train team members so that they can face increasingly tough and resistant enemies, among which we will also find ~evil~ versions of the greatest heroes of the Marvel universe. Hit and run Marvel Strike Force's mechanics are very simple and it is quite evident from the very beginning what connotation the developers have given to this experience. Being a freemium production, we expected to hit a paywall already after a couple of hours, and in fact halfway through the first campaign it clearly becomes necessary to retrace paths already traveled to carry out a little grinding and obtain the necessary power to be able to defeat the toughest bosses. In short, an aspect that breaks in a little too quickly, even if it must be said that the action energy indicator, which is consumed by a few units with each mission, practically never empties and therefore avoids having to wait minutes or even hours to be able to continue playing. The characters have a set of spectacular moves in line with their characteristics, with special abilities that recharge with each turn and allow for example to draw enemy fire, heal one's companions, carry out area attacks and so on. Street. The Punisher, for example, fires a grenade at a target, while Luke Cage becomes a magnet for the shots of the opponents, or Spider-Man creates a combo of punches, kicks and webs that damages multiple enemies at once. Understanding what to do and against whom to do it soon becomes a key to winning. We found the progression very accurate, with many new features that are unlocked as you level up (including clashes in asynchronous multiplayer or the many special prize events) and a large set of achievements to enliven the situation. The system works very well and is supported by a well-made technical sector, with convincing polygonal models but sometimes mediocre animations (see above all the ~launches~) and fairly varied but often generic scenarios. Not much to say about the touch control system, which is perfect for this kind of game, while the music accompanies the action with the right amount of epicness.", "date": "2018-04-06", "grade": "7.5"}
