With even 2 spin offs, with different casts of characters/actors and different locations, Miami and New York, it has become so popular as to encourage many students to want to pursue careers as laboratory technicians and scientific analysts in Italy as well. The series has now reached its tenth season and does not seem to feel the passing of the years and the excessive repetitiveness of the cases to be solved, also thanks to a new character who also arrives in the Ubisoft video game, CSI: Deadly Intent. New tv series After a few incarnations also released on consoles, this chapter, connected to the ninth series of the saga created by Zuicher, returns to Xbox 360 after CSI: Crushing Evidence and as usual sees the player looking for evidence to connect the crimes to the suspects. This seventh episode called Deadly Intent and published by Ubisoft sees us as protagonists alongside Ray Langston (who is the virtual counterpart of Lawrence Fishburne, who replaced the now legendary Gil Grissom and Riley Adams (actress Lauren Lee Smith), in addition to ~historians~ Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders. Las Vegas is obviously the scenario in which the CSI team moves and with its lascivious soul it easily lends itself to investigations that seem without solution. Five very different murder cases with situations bordering on the bearable for ordinary citizens, but not for the inhabitants of the city of sin. Alongside Nick Stokes you face ~Broken Hearts~, to solve the murder of a woman dressed as a bride. Following along with Greg Sanders we need to understand what happened to a Wrestling referee found dead strangled by a telephone cable. In ~the last breath~ together with Raymond Langston you have to analyze the death of a V.I.P. in the recovery home. In the fourth case, ~Extinct~, the other new entry in the series, Riley Adams, joins in what is perhaps the most difficult and contouring case, the death of a ~fire eater~ due to carbon monoxide. In the latest adventure together with the beautiful Catherine Willows you have to find out what's behind the death of a transvestite. Xbox 360 goals The canonical 1000 points are divided into 28 objectives, it is enough to finish the game to get almost all of them. Completing cases with high rating percentages is done. An excellent title to increase the score of your gamercard. All detectives CSI: Deadly Pursuit closely resembles old-fashioned point-and-click games, and crime scenes must be thoroughly analyzed to piece together the available details. Together with the other agents of the team, after visiting the places of the crimes and trying to roughly reconstruct what happened, we move on to questioning the suspects and analyzing the evidence. Captain Jim Brass, another historical member of the series, helps us in the investigation by providing ideas and trying to reconstruct the events and providing new elements on which to base the reasoning and thus approach the solution of the story. The help in the investigation actually comes from the whole group and after each chat with the different elements of the team we have new ideas to follow and new tracks to analyze. This dynamic adventure, which in reality does not differ at all from the previous video games inspired by the series, requires that all the elements recovered must be analyzed, and to do this the developers have equipped the protagonist with all kinds of valid tools for this task. Not only the classic latex gloves used to manipulate all the clues, but also tiny evidence tweezers that go into classification envelopes, and the ever-present duct tape ideal for collecting a sample of dust. In addition to these classic elements, it is possible to use an advanced PDA that acts as a portable laboratory together with an indispensable toolbox, complete with adhesive pad, luminol, fingerprint powder and LCV. The real laboratory is obviously present in the police station and in this place the protagonist can not only analyze the various samples taken, but above all discover the new fundamental elements to move forward in the investigation. Crime scene analysis is actually always quite simple and very guided, it is not possible to go wrong with the tools to analyze the evidence and the clues are never too hidden. The mini games present for comparing DNA, fingerprints and other elements are by no means an insurmountable obstacle. The analysis of the results and the way in which the indizi is essential to proceed with the investigation, once you have provided the right links between the evidence to Captain Brass, this will issue an arrest warrant. Depending on the ability to combine the tests you are evaluated on the basis of 3 different levels: skill, cunning and precision. The skill measures the number of attempts required for the confrontation, cunning measures the number of warrants obtained compared to the requests made to Brass, and precision measures how many times it was necessary to visit the site of the murders. That's why you shouldn't advance in the game at random, not only to not spoil the atmosphere but also to get the highest scores. Once a path to follow has been identified, thanks to the right analysis of the results, it is possible to summon the suspects thanks to the complicity of Brass, and subject them to interrogation. During these scenes, the alleged criminals can be put under pressure and possibly refute their alibis by showing the collected evidence. It is possible to choose the topic of conversation and much of the new information collected is recorded in the dossier which can be consulted via the palmtop. During the interrogations we will be helped not only by the I.A. of the game which, using our partner, provides us with various indications or warnings, but also by the structure of the interrogations themselves which will sometimes begin without our intervention along a very specific guideline. From a technical point of view, this new Ubisoft title certainly does not cry out for a miracle, it matters little that we are probably in the presence of the game that best represents the TV series to date. The environments are only partially explorable and the entire settings are completely three-dimensional but quite bare, above all the exploration is too guided and limited to predetermined areas. On each scene it is possible to zoom on the elements without moving the character but only his observation angle. The polygonal models of the characters are sufficiently well done and the features closely resemble the American actors. Too bad that the voices of the voice actors were not used for the Italian version of the game but the subtitles were introduced while maintaining the voices of the American protagonists. There is no online mode and at the moment we are not aware of any additional content downloadable from Xbox Live.", "date": "2009-11-26", "grade": "6.0"}
