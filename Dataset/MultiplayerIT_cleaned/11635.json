{"name": "Scudetto 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scudetto-2008-recensione.html", "text": "Let's face it, after the abandonment of the Championship Manager brand by SI Games - the software house founded by the Collyer brothers, the creators of the Brand - to reunite with Sega and give life to the titles of the Football Manager series, almost all the fans they jumped the boat, without even giving half a chance to the successors Beautiful Game Studios. And not even without too many wrongs, actually. It took three years for the BGS boys to make sense of the series again and, with Championship Manager 2007, someone finally began to see a title capable of at least participating in the same championship as Football Manager. It is not without an extra veil of hope that we are therefore preparing to get our hands on the last chapter (the eleventh) of the manager that many in Italy know simply by the name of the Scudetto. The theorists of the BiZona For those who have never had to deal with titles of this type - that of football management, we can simply summarize the genre with a simple description: football game where you can't see the ball even with binoculars. Okay. We overdid it. But that's the meaning. Unlike the normal football titles that made the fortune of the console market in the old world, such as the FIFA series, Pro Evolution Soccer or the forerunners Player Manager and Sensible World of Soccer, in Championship Manager 2008 (henceforth Scudetto) the player will never enter the playing field in first person but will ~limit~ to take care of the organization of his team. From the signing campaign, to training management up to the selection of the starting eleven and game tactics. In practice, it is like if, simultaneously and without interruption, the roles covered - in reality - by characters such as Galliani and Ancellotti were covered. In short, for fans of Fantasy Football and the regulars of the Gazzettone on Mondays, a real videogame Grail. Power is nothing without ProZone After the parenthesis bignami, let's get right into the heart of the game with some statistics: teams, players and competitions updated to the August 2007 transfer market, database increased by 25% compared to the previous edition (and playing, you ~feel~) , 27 selectable leagues. Although we cannot verify the fidelity of the database with certainty, taking a couple of championships and nations as a sample, we feel like saying that even if the Scudetto is unmatched in terms of numbers, in terms of updating and depth of statistics, the scepter still remains with the scouts of home Sports Interactive. Yet, even on this front the distance seems to have shortened and, finally, appreciable only by true digital football maniacs. Constantly mentioning the work of Si Games in comparison might seem thankless and above all unfair towards Scudetto, yet anyone who has played both titles cannot help but notice more or less intentional similarities both in terms of interface setting and purely (audio)graphic feeling. Where Scudetto seems to stand out in a more than positive way is the match engine and the tactics management interface. First of all, although it is possible to set fewer commands at a team and individual level (which, let's face it, how many of you have ever bothered to use them all?) the virtual blackboard where you can set movements (and direction of the passes!) appears less schematic and with more freedom in the position of the pawns, no longer entangled in a grid with too large meshes. For each role it is possible to choose different degrees of position (both in depth and in width) and there is no shortage of goodies such as the indicator of where to start applying the offside line. Once on the field then, we will still be welcomed by a match engine that strives to give the player a realistic feeling and able to literally give life to the actions thanks to the use of the three dimensions. The ability to customize the game to the maximum pace and the different triggers that activate the highlights, together with the amount of statistics and real-time information made available by the game, manage to give the virtual coach immersion and a sense of control over the game and the course truly unique events. As if that weren't enough, the post-match analysis tool, the notorious ProZone, has been made even more direct and user friendly with the introduction of a series of comments capable of quickly and schematically summarizing a mass of information that would otherwise be difficult to analyze and therefore not very useful. truly unparalleled immersion and sense of control over the game and the course of events Power is nothing without ProZone At the end of each meeting,we will then be offered a photograph of our team's performance (winning departments, key players, uncovered area of the field) and, once we enter the ProZone, they will be highlighted (through a sort of 2D replay that highlights players, movements and position of the ball) actions capable of denoting rather deficient strengths. We will thus be able to dissect every action of the match and understand what did not work and why. So far the positive notes, just to curb your enthusiasm, we point out some bugs in the management of the AI of the players on the field (however poor a C1 player may be, sporadically it can happen to witness a defender who instead of closing on the only attacker on the run with the ball decides to go and have a chat with the linesman or to admire the tips of his spiked shoes) and the possibility of witnessing rather similar actions. These are minor problems, but certainly not negligible for the maniacs of the genre. Another interesting novelty of this latest Scudetto is undoubtedly the introduction of player attitudes. Thanks to a range of 32 different characteristics it will be possible to deal with players with unique personalities and unrelated to the cold numbers of statistics. Through the training sessions, it will also be possible to shape our young hopefuls to direct them towards different ways of playing: from leader on the field, to champion of fair play, rather than gritty retriever of balls. It all works a bit like in RPGs and applies perfectly to the genre. Unfortunately, the whole part of the interaction between the player and the simulated world is still only sufficient. And even if there is a timid, but in any case well done, attempt to manage the human relationship with one's locker room, there is a lack of all that series of possibilities and game actions that in other titles (ahem, coff, coff) allow to establish plausible relationships with management, fans, other coaches and even the press. On balance, the only other criticism that we feel like making the Scudetto is the implementation of the graphical interface. Starting from some technical and aesthetic details, such as the lack of the possibility of being able to set the game resolution or the use of a font that is not very pleasant for the eyes, up to real information management problems. More than once it happens not to be able to immediately understand where to click to get to the desired information and - even worse - to forget it the next time... it will be possible to become City of any national team from the beginning of the game As a partial resolution of the problem, the developers made it up to you with the introduction of a (retractable) shortcut bar, totally configurable by the user and a series of tool-tips that appear on the screen by positioning, for example, the mouse on a player's name and concisely display additional information. The speed performances are more than appreciable. Using the recommended settings in the set-up phase (and perhaps something more) regarding the number of simulated competitions and the size of the database, we found ourselves reading messages and managing the team in an agile and reactive way, while in the background events, matches and so on were grinded non-stop and, above all, without interfering with the player's actions. So much so that more than once we were amazed because the new round of the championship had already arrived. For the more lazy, it will now be possible to become City of any national team from the beginning of the game, without following the proverbial apprenticeship started on the provincial fields. We are not ashamed to write it: it was about time. Comment Surprisingly, but not too much given the penultimate chapter, Scudetto 2008 proves to be an enjoyable and well-finished title. Whether you are a fan of the genre looking for something different, or you are a novice player, Scudetto 2008 could prove to be a purchase to seriously consider. Both the engine that brings games to life and the evolution of the ProZone tool alone could be worth the price of admission. Certainly, it is not yet able to boast the palm of the best title on the square, but at least it tries to differentiate itself in an acute and intelligent way. We are still far from the glories of the past, but now they no longer seem unattainable.
