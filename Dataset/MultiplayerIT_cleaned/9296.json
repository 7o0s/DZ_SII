{"name": "Difesa estrema", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87946-sanctum-difesa-estrema.html", "text": "Sanctum is a tower defense first-person shooter which, not content with being part of the set of FPSTDs, that is to force poor editors to tie their tongues in the groin to pronounce it, also claims to have a plot: Skye is a soldier of elite sent to defend their homeland from an alien onslaught. The problem is, she has to do it all by herself. This wasn't enough to give us the idea of the importance in the galactic chessboard of the homeland of Skye, christened Elysion One by some joker, it must be added that ours must also build all the defensive structures of the beloved homeland and collect the resources to spend all You need to sweep away the enemy waves. Are you still not convinced that the production of depilatory creams for whales doesn't make you have a key role among the greats of the universe? Then we add that Skye immediately has three weakened weapons, stuff that would make Renaissance arquebuses pale in terms of power, rate of fire and general performance. Will our heroine be able to win her war, much like a simulator of galactic misogyny? With turrets, rifles and bases Sanctum is a near-zero cost project born out of a group of UDK-trained students who managed to make the leap. There are other noble examples of important titles born with similar production assumptions, such as Portal, The Ball or Giovent Riba... ahem, no, the latter really not. The game is easier to play than to explain. Choosing one of the three selectable maps, you have to build the blocks of the defensive structures (machine guns, laser turrets, mortars and so on) on the buildable boxes. The aim is to prevent groups of aliens from reaching the energy core located at the opposite end from their landing areas. Finished building, you move on to the next phase, i.e. the actual action, with the player called to participate directly in the conflict as in a classic FPS, holding one of the three weapons available right away: a machine gun/grenade launcher, a sniper rifle and a freeze gun, all three of which can be upgraded multiple times. Each built or upgraded structure costs resources, resources that can otherwise be used to upgrade weapons. At the beginning you have few credits, which you accumulate by repelling enemy waves, so you have to choose well what to build and set up what will then be the strategy for the whole level. A few defeats are enough to understand that brute force is not everything and that, if you want to have acceptable results, you need to learn how to position turrets in a useful way. Eliminating enemies is the purpose, but slowing them down is more important. How, where, when! Basically, the defenses must be built in such a way as to make the path that divides the areas of arrival of the enemy from the nucleus as intricate as possible. In this way the aliens will stay on the map for longer and you will be able to hit them from different positions for longer. In short, it is useless to have fully upgraded structures if the enemy takes a few moments to overcome them, just as it is equally useless to have improved weapons if you don't have the time to make them sing. The only rule to follow when building is not to close all the passages leading to the core. In the event of an error in the arrangement of some structure, it is possible to retrace one's steps by reselling it, even if all the spent credits are not recovered. Incidentally, it is better to have a good initial project rather than improvise during construction. The aliens are quite silly and are only aggressive towards the core. Apart from standing directly in their way, Skye runs no risk of being attacked, just as the structures are not at risk of suffering any damage. Unfortunately there are different types of aliens and you have to learn to vary your defensive style at each opportunity. For example, flying enemies are better stopped by crossing anti-aircraft emplacements with the use of the sniper rifle boosted by at least two levels, while armored aliens simply require to be slowed down to give them more time to fill them with lead. As the difficulty level increases, everything becomes more hectic and complicated. With a partner, it goes further If desired, it is possible to replay the three maps of Sanctum also online in cooperative mode, which is the real fulcrum of the game and where most of the hours are spent. Online doesn't change much compared to playing alone, with the actions to be taken remaining the same. Only, you have to coordinate with the other players in the construction of the structures and, above all, take into consideration the greater general difficulty compared to the single player, even at a casual level, and the mino amount of resources available, plus the fact that everything is unlocked. From a technical point of view, the title is without infamy and without praise. The use of colors is nice, which is somewhat reminiscent of the vitality of Bulletstorm's scenarios and in general the three maps are well done, but there isn't a lot of stuff and some enemies struggle to stand out in the design. The same goes for the soundtrack side, functional and nothing more, apart from the splendid chat that samples the written sentences transforming the coop games into a surreal experience. A final note deserves the promise of the developers to continue supporting the game with new weapons and free maps that will be released soon.", "date": "2011-05-09", "grade": "7.5"}
