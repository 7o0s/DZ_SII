{"name": "Diner Dash - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diner-dash-recensione.html", "text": "Lunch is served The story behind the game couldn't be simpler: young Flo, tired of the stressful life of an office worker, decides to change her life and open her own restaurant. Maybe, the girl doesn't realize that being able to keep this business going can be just as tiring, but she'll find out in a short time. Basically, it's about managing the restaurant in real time, trying to seat all the customers, get them to eat and then immediately clear the table to make room for the next customers. The basic actions, which can all be implemented by pressing the stylus on the touch screen in the corresponding points or dragging the objects, are as follows: take (literally) the customers and place them at the tables, collect the orders, bring the orders to the counter, bring the dishes to their respective customers and then bring the bill and clear the table to make room for others. To these basic movements are then added more complex elements and additional actions to be performed. For example, customers are each characterized by a particular color: if we manage to seat the customer in a seat marked by the same color as him, we will get an additional bonus. Or, later on, the elements to keep an eye on will increase: the restaurant can get dirty and we will have to take care of wiping it down as quickly as possible; families with children will come to whose tables a high chair must be promptly brought, in order to calm down the little ones who could otherwise start crying and disturb the other customers; the coffee machine will periodically prepare steaming cups, which we can take to the tables to try to cheer up the patrons. Like any good waiter, Flo too will be able to perform multiple actions at a time, and having two arms available, she will be able to take two orders at a time, serve two tables in rapid succession and likewise clear two in sequence. By chaining actions in this way, you can get extra points. The progression takes place in a perfectly cadenced manner, making the player slowly enter the dynamics of the game Lunch is served The whole game is based on customer satisfaction, represented in a stylized way by a heart imprinted on each of them: this can fill or empty, depending on the morale of the characters. It will obviously be our care to try to keep them at the highest possible level, since satisfaction leads to a greater number of points earned, while growing dissatisfaction can lead to the loss of the customer, who could leave the restaurant angrily, representing a loss in the budget of end of level. There are a large number of elements and variations to keep under control, and they grow exponentially as the levels progress: the tables, for example, are of different types, and can accommodate a different number of customers. It is therefore essential to manage the seats in the restaurant in such a way as not to waste them and to ensure that new customers wait at the entrance as little as possible. As the game progresses, different types of customers will then appear, each with their own needs to satisfy: the journalist about to write a review of the restaurant, who will obviously have to be given special consideration, the busy business woman who needs quick service to get back rushing to work, are just two examples of the varied fauna that will frequent our restaurant. At the end of each level, if we have achieved the set objectives, we will continue to the next one, and the money earned can be reinvested to improve and beautify the restaurant, which will gradually become larger and more luxurious. One striking aspect of playing Diner Dash is the smoothness of the difficulty curve. The progression takes place in a perfectly cadenced manner, letting the player slowly enter the dynamics of the game, introducing new variables and elements to be managed gradually, giving time to keep everything under control, up to the most difficult levels. In the slightest terms The aesthetic aspect is certainly not the element on which the game is based. The graphics are pleasant but stylized to a minimum, with a sort of pseudo-Japanese look to make everything a bit cartoony and colorful, but the realization is undoubtedly poor. However, it is confirmed as functional, and decidedly not very decisive in a game that bases everything on immediate gameplay: in fact, PlayFirst could have easily put static icons and numbers in place of the sprites on the screen, and the evaluation of the title would have changed little. Certainly, a little more style would not have hurt, because the simil-manghe deployed by the developers at times seems a bit too rough and botched, sometimes making the action a bit confusing. The lack of attention to the technical aspect is also confirmed for what concerns the audio sector: rather boring tunes form the backdrop to the game action, while sketchy sound effects highlight the arrival of new customers, the dissatisfaction of some, the success found with others. After all, everything recreates the confusion of a crowded restaurant quite well, but the effect is far from pleasant (and on the other hand, perhaps, it shouldn't be either). Diner Dash clearly shows the caual game budget matrix from which it starts, and the reference to that Flash Cake Mania which had great success on PC browsers is also clear for the technical aspect. Of course, a little more complexity can be seen in the general structure of the game, but the idea is that the work done is not up to the current productions for Nintendo DS sold in the higher price range, to which it also belongs this Play First/Eidos product. Comment Diner Dash does not look very inviting, it is easy to agree on this, however, just try it to realize that there is interesting potential. The game is perfectly balanced as regards the level of difficulty, with an excellent balance between the level of challenge and the satisfaction of succeeding, and a perfect progressive integration of new elements that make the action more and more complex. Immediate and engaging gameplay is the cornerstone of Diner Dash, with a game structure based entirely on rapid stylus touches on the touch screen, a real exercise in observation skills and hand-eye coordination. Ultimately, the game is immediately enjoyable and fun, engaging at least for the duration of the entire career. The problems are given by the extremely poor technical realization, which hardly justifies the price, if you think that products of this kind can also be played for free or almost on the internet, and the repetitiveness that characterizes the structure of the game itself. Furthermore, the addition of new modes, such as multiplayer or the ~infinite round~, present little incentive to return to play once they are finished. Ultimately, Diner Dash proves to be suitable for those looking for an enjoyable pastime, at the level of mobile games or products for ~casual~ users, with the advantages and disadvantages that follow from this condition. Pros: Immediate and addictive gameplay Excellent balance of difficulty Perfect use of the touch screen interface Cons: Rather poor technical realization Repetitive in the long run Little incentive to resume it once the Career is over Anyone who has, or has had to deal with, the job of a waiter knows how hard this can be, but others too can get an idea of it by trying this Diner Dash. It is curious to note how often games of this type, i.e. strategic-management to a minimum, based above all on the frenzied rhythm of clicks on the screen, are based on the culinary setting. From the old Root Beer Tapper, via Burger Time to the recent Cake Mania, it seems that the ancient art of catering represents an ideal scenario for simulating basically chaotic situations to be solved with a spirit of organization and speed of execution. This new PlayFirst product, published by Eidos, actually has a lot in common with the flash game Cake Mania, which was later also converted for portable consoles by Majesco. It is essentially about managing a restaurant, but not focusing on the strategic-economic aspects of high-level management, but rather working as a low-skilled man, running around the tables and trying to satisfy all customer requests. Diner Dash therefore relies more on skill, reflexes and fast action, than on the ability to rationally manage resources, as in a real strategic game. After all, this game is practically a puzzle game: scratching under the surface, the PlayFirst title plays on the primary videogame instinct to combine objects on the screen and make them disappear, to put order within a tendentially entropic situation, and it does it in an excellent way, managing to satisfy rather than frustrate, achieving that balance necessary to keep the players attached to the console.", "date": "2007-06-18", "grade": null}
