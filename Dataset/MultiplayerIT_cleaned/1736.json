The title is already a clear reference to the change of setting: Myths of the Eastern Kingdom in fact takes us to China, partially re-proposing some of the atmospheres and problems experienced in the original plot. The adventure, which will take you between five and ten hours based on how much you want to complete the events in full, retraces the same stylistic features as the original, sometimes even exaggerating and bringing about a certain sense of deja -vu. Let's go into a little more detail in the review of Immortals Fenyx Rising: Myths of the Eastern Kingdom. From China with ardor Immortals Fenyx Rising: Myths of the Eastern Kingdom: The Isle in its glory Ku is the default protagonist of this adventure. Unlike Fenyx, which the player shapes to his liking and whose gender he also decides, Ku has a predetermined appearance by the development team. Unlike the original and the first DLC, this Myths of the Eastern Kingdom is made by Ubisoft Chengdu, who carried out the development simultaneously with the guys from Ubisoft Quebc. Waking up on the island of Peng Lai, Ku finds himself as the sole survivor of some force that has petrified all other human beings, recalled by a song that brings him to the presence of the goddess Nuwa, the creator of humanity. The two will join forces to be able to mend the tear in the sky that has opened a gash towards the Tian. If you seem to feel a strange itch don't worry, you don't have fleas, simply Myths of the Eastern Kingdom represents an almost slavish re-proposition of the Fenyx experience, however translated into an oriental environment, with a less light-hearted tone and with a duration well more than halved. Immortals Fenyx Rising: Eastern Kingdom Myths: Ku awakens as the sole survivor All these aspects would be enough to scuttle any title, were it not for the fact that Immortals Fenyx Rising is so delightful that we enjoyed it again this time, happy to go back to completing simple but interesting puzzles, collide with mythological creatures - oriental of course - and try to solve a cosmological damage of gigantic proportions. What unfortunately works less and suggests the different narrative capacity of the two teams, is precisely the tone of the story. Last December we got excited and laughed out loud, always aware of the scope of the product, but still surprised by the ability to create really fun little pictures. Myths of the Eastern Kingdom, on the other hand, is much milder, limited in irony and aimed at taking itself too seriously, an element that we did not really appreciate and which led us not to get attached to the protagonists of the story as we would have liked, also due to the poor longevity. Gameplay unchanged Immortals Fenyx Rising: Eastern Kingdom Myths: Ku meets Nuwa As far as the gameplay is concerned, Myths of the Eastern Kingdom does not invent anything, at most it adapts some elements to the change of setting, but leaving everything very similar to itself, even in the approach and in the events. During your tour for the island you will be able to find some original ideas, perhaps a couple of types of unpublished puzzles (one of which is still very similar to the old mosaic) and different creatures necessarily different. But what you will feel is always the same sense of repetition, lack of originality and a change of team that seems to have done more harm than good. Immortals Fenyx Rising: Myths of the Eastern Kingdom: China and its atmospheres The combat system returns again as the flagship of the production. Never too difficult, not even by dramatically raising the level of difficulty and putting us again in front of a series of usable divine powers. These take up the stylistic features of the past, also bringing back from the original the possibility of using consumables, which disappeared with the first DLC for reasons of balancing the experience. The opponents, albeit modified in appearance, represent the same archetypes of the creatures we have already known, replacing gorgons, minotaurs, harpies and all the other various amenities with other figures that are better suited to the change of setting. To tell the truth, there is a totally new mechanic, which is nothing more than a classic fury bar that will charge during the fights and which can be released by greatly enhancing our divine powers. It will take a few minutes for Ku to get his wings and its powers, so as to burn time and allow the player to familiarize himself in a very short time with an already known gameplay. This detail certainly helps digest a structture so damn similar to the past, giving free rein to exploration and limiting tutorials and the growth of one's skills to the bare minimum. However, there is also a forge that acts as the main hub and through which to return to enhance life, resistance, potions and one's equipment, spending objects and collecting stones that replace those of the Hellenic land. Nothing new under the sun therefore, with all the good and bad that this detail can bring.", "date": "2021-04-04", "grade": "7.5"}
