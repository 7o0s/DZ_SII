{"name": "The Sims 2 Castaway", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-castaway.html", "text": "The Sims 2 Castaway opens with a sequence that inserts the user into the narrative framework that forms the background to the game: caught in a storm in the middle of a peaceful boat trip, a handful of Sims manage to save themselves by landing on a tropical islet completely untouched by humans. The player's task will obviously be to make his character survive in this difficult scenario, getting him food and trying to satisfy all his more or less primary needs. Unlike many other occasions, The Sims 2 Castaway on mobile offers almost the same amount of playful elements as the other portable versions (in this case those for Nintendo DS and PSP), proving to be a rather rich product, even if less different from the other episodes of than one would be led to believe. In short, the factors of the operation change, but the final result remains substantially unchanged, with the needs of one's Sim that will only be met in a formally different way. To keep the level of hygiene acceptable, it will therefore be necessary to take a shower by placing oneself under a waterfall, to feed oneself it will be necessary to shake some trees in search of fruit or to go fishing, to sleep it will be enough to crouch in one's own hut, while for having a minimum of entertainment it will be sufficient have conversations with the other castaways on the island. With regard to the location, it must be said that initially only a handful of areas are accessible, with others blocked by various obstacles to be removed thanks to some peculiar objects, which can be obtained by completing the quests offered by one's companions in (mis)fortune : this turns out to be the fundamental node of the gameplay of The Sims 2 Castaway, that is the pivot on which the vast majority of actions performed by the user will revolve. However, the mechanics are not perfectly oiled: in particular, it annoys the developers' decision to make certain essential objects available only at certain times of the day, which can lead to frustration when the goal is not achieved for one reason or another . The control system, inspired by point-and-click adventures, is instead functional, even if not exactly agile: everything therefore passes through the movement of a cursor on the screen, which highlights the elements with which it is possible to interact (however, be careful to various traps such as quicksand, holes and the like). Graphically, however, The Sims 2 Castaway turns out to be more than good, showing off a 2D cosmetic of remarkable quality, both as regards the scenarios - at the same time extensive and cared for down to the smallest details - and as regards the sprites of the characters, appreciable also for various and well-crafted animations. Finally, the sound is a bit monotonous, but this on mobile phones is now a sad habit. PRO Graphically remarkable Long lasting and quite deep Extended scenario AGAINST It tends to get monotonous Not too different from other Sims titles", "date": "2008-02-04", "grade": "S.V."}
