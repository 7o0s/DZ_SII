However, since we are required to write a few thousand more jokes to bring home the loaf of bread, it seems right to elaborate on the concept for a moment. For example, if you're new to Mega Man, we'd love to know where you've lived up to now, because we're pretty sure Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster have played it as well. The first NES title dates back to 1987 and since then Capcom has developed more than fifty games for practically every console, including sequels and spin-offs, but in general we consider the first six, originally released for Nintendo's 8-bit console , the cornerstones of the entire franchise. The compilation developed by Digital Eclipse brings back those six Mega Man, in their most authentic vintage splendor, without retouching, modifications or alterations of any kind. Whether that's good or bad, we're about to tell you. Spoiler alert: it's good. If you've never played a Mega Man in your life, the Legacy Collection is for you Many, many weapons For those who really don't know Mega Man - I mean, do you really exist? - it is worth explaining that it is a horizontal and vertical scrolling platformer in which you control the protagonist android of the same name (Rockman, in Japan) and jump from one platform to another, shooting enemies along the way with a cannon comfortably installed in our arm. Generally, even when it would not seem, Mega Man's goal is to stop the conquest of the evil Dr. Wily, a mad scientist rival of Mega Man's ~father~, Dr. Light: to do this, you must first face his Robot Masters , androids like Mega Man who preside over the various stages. The player can face the stages in any order, and the choice offers him an exponential advantage since, once the boss of the moment is defeated, Mega Man conquers his weapon and each weapon is more effective against at least one other Robot Master or boss. making our life easier if we hit the right order, since we will inflict more damage and close the final fights earlier. In fact, the latter are the flagship of the whole series, a historic example of game design that still today we try to imitate: each boss follows a specific pattern of attacks and movements, and the player must memorize them to dodge shots with pinpoint accuracy and return fire at the right moment. Not surprisingly, the Legacy Collection also includes a kind of training mode that allows you to face only the Robot Masters without first going through their stages, in order to learn the patterns before trying your hand at the real game. This is just one of the little extras that Digital Eclipse has implemented without distorting the six emulated titles, which veterans can happily ignore to dive into any of the six Mega Man and rediscover it in all its wonderful antiquity, perhaps by selecting the option to visualize the graphics as if we were in front of a cathode: the developer has even reproduced the flickering of the sprites and the slowdowns that occurred when the game pushed the hardware capabilities of the NES to the maximum, in an almost perfect replica of the original experience. Which means that you have to come to terms with a decidedly above average difficulty, by today's platform standards, balanced by an absolutely brilliant level design, which marks the clear difference between a difficult challenge and a frustrating obstacle. The save system implemented in the Legacy Collection is a welcome little change in this sense, replacing the impractical and boring passwords of the time, but other than that every Mega Man remains a compilation of vanishing platforms, studded floors and ceilings, enemies that are better dodged than faced and multiple paths that drastically change the way you play certain stages. Although it is possible to choose which Mega Man to play, we are sure that new players would do better to start with the first one and work their way up to the top, discovering the small improvements that evolved the series between 1987 and 1993, such as the implementation of the slide or the Mega Buster - the loading cannon - not to mention the addition of Mega Man's mechanical companions, especially the very famous dog Rush. At that point, everyone will be able to decide which is their favorite Mega Man, based on the design of the levels, on the beautiful and futuristic soundtracks (such as the legendary Wily's Castle from Mega Man II, which entered the history of the media by right) or on the Robot Masters on duty. Though generally considered to be Mega ManIII as the high point of the series, each episode has something to say and the Legacy Collection also includes a comprehensive encyclopedia of annotations, preparatory sketches, illustrations and data that further deepen our knowledge of the six episodes. Finally, the circle is closed by the Challenge mode conceived for the compilation: it is a series of battles with the bosses or levels made up of the pieces of the stages belonging to the different episodes that offer a whole new challenge to be faced by fighting against time. It goes without saying that the best results end up directly online, in a leaderboard that will make ~speedrun~ lovers happy.", "date": "2015-08-30", "grade": "8.8"}
