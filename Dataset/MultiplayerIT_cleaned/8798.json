{"name": "Il Barry White dei videogiochi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98116-fingle-il-barry-white-dei-videogiochi.html", "text": "For many years, the ancient art of pick-up has always been seen as a complex and unapproachable activity for the classic archetype of the nerd, a sociopathic individual whose lack of sex appeal was proportional to his computer skills. For some time now things have changed a lot, the fairer sex plays a lot more and lately ~being geek~ has also become fashionable. Although the combination of video games and girls is a taboo now almost debunked, it still seems unlikely that a game in sweet company can turn into an intimate moment, yet five minutes with Fingle together with a person of the opposite sex is enough and it is immediately clear why the Dutch team Game Oven called him ~The Barry White of video games~. Physical contact Openly inspired by the famous Twister, Hasbro's board game that became a cult in the second half of the last century, Fingle takes advantage of the large iPad touchscreen to create an unprecedented feeling between two players. Placed facing each other, the two partners must use their fingers to drag colored squares within the corresponding spaces on the screen: the aim is to collaborate so that all the squares remain in their spaces for a few seconds , but the goal is complicated by the fact that the target points rotate and move back and forth across the playing area. As if that weren't enough, players are asked to always use only one hand, a handicap that will weigh more and more when the levels get more difficult, often forcing them to reposition their hands or change their strategy until both have found the right solution . Some might find the precision required by their fingers or the fact that their hands often obstruct the view almost frustrating, but that too is part of the fun, with players trying to look at the tablet from different angles or waving each other's fingers away because they get in the way. your own movements. In trying to get to the bottom of each challenge, the two partners will often end up touching their hands, accidentally rubbing them and intertwining them, and here the game comes to life: like it or not, an intimacy is created between the participants that is more unique than rare in a video game, triggering moments of embarrassment and tantalizing situations. Unlike many other games, Fingle exploits eroticism in an extremely apt way, managing to be sexy but never vulgar, a feature that allowed him to earn a place in the final at the Independent Games Festival 2012 in the most innovative projects category. Perfect for melting the ice on a first date, Game Oven's game also manages to explore the ambiguity and emotional power of touch between same-sex players, and it's interesting to discover how one can go from an uncomfortable state to one of fun depending on the bond you have with a particular person. Right from the start the game tries to create the right atmosphere through winking musical accompaniment, ambiguous sound effects and dubious text lines, while the graphic style is coherent and colorful but minimalist enough not to distract partners' attention from their fingers. As if that weren't enough, a large portion of the fifty levels encourage players to touch each other's hands, while offering clever puzzles that sometimes require crazy solutions. New challenges will come with the next updates of the application, but if you really wanted to find a shortcoming in Fingle, this would be the inability to offer an experience that is always different, random and unpredictable even when playing with the same people, a feature that has contributed to the Twister success. It must be said that if Game Oven's game works so well it is precisely because its levels are very guided, but we wouldn't mind if the developers added a more casual mode in the near future that works and is just as fun.
