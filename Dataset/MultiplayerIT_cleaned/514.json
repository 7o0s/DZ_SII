The authors of Cabela and Rapala, a Bucharest-based software house, have in fact decided to try to shift the focus towards a hybrid open world concept that includes survival game elements mixed with the classic elements of hunting games. What came out of it is a conceptually interesting work, but in practice rather lame. Find out our final verdict in our Open Country review. Three biomes and one wilderness Open Country: wild nature Open Country is a concentrate of gameplay, a survival excursion through suggestive settings where survival rhymes with getting food. You will be immersed in a fascinating environment, three biomes linked to three different seasons: summer, autumn and winter which characterize the gaming experience and stand as the true strength of Open Country. The first impact is unsettling: a vast map that welcomes you hard and raw, full of charm and mystery as only nature can be. Here you will learn the basic mechanics, how to survive, how to move from place to place to look for new animals, how to manage vital signs, etc. However, what will always remain in the background is an oppressive, suffocating setting that leaves you no respite and does not forgive mistakes. From this point of view, the work done by FunLabs on the scenarios is convincing (also considering the competitive price of 14.99 euros at which the game is sold). All three biomes are well characterized and are beautiful to explore and admire. Unfortunately, however, alongside this aspect there are a number of neuralgic points that make the playful experience rather lame. A problematic loop Open Country: hunting is not just about weapons We could essentially divide the playful experience of Open Country into two macro sections: a management phase and a hunting phase, where the first includes both the management of vital parameters and the crafting and construction of tools and shelter phase, while the second represents the actual action. In both parts the game has flaws despite the excellent ideas behind it. Let's see them in detail. The management phase is a key point of the Open Country experience: always being healthy, not being too hungry and not feeling sleepy, are essential aspects that cannot be overlooked, on pain of a series of penalties that push the your experience to extreme peaks that bring the game to a game over stalemate. As in any self-respecting survival game, therefore, or in any game that incorporates some mechanics, the management of vital parameters is not negligible. In Open Country, to keep yourself at a stable level you will have to carry out a series of actions that bring with them various problems, but the very conception of the vital parameters seemed clearly unbalanced to us. In fact, sleep and hunger often act too quickly, leaving the player very little time to do actions other than cooking and/or sleeping. Open Country: meeting a bear Thus forcing the player to always have materials available to build a shelter and that he can cook / eat often. Although the idea is not wrong, the practice is often frustrating, there are in fact moments in which by force of circumstances it is not possible to give a remedy to the aforementioned needs and the malus obtained (obfuscation of aim, weakness, etc.) immediately overwhelm player. What seemed unbalanced to us is therefore the progression curve of the malus which is not gradual, but immediately extremely impervious. In addition to this there are problems in the management of the camps, which in our view are too crucial (more than the hunt itself) and require too many resources. What often happened to us was not being able to build something due to a lack of resources, being unable to recover them due to too much weakness caused by not being able to sleep due to hunger in turn caused by the impossibility of cooking. The loop created is one of the hardest to break, above all because it is caused by an imbalance in the amount of resources requested and in the effective possibility of recovering them. Finally the hunt. FunLabs' expertise in this branch has guaranteed Open Country to have an excellent setting in terms of weapon feeling and variety of weapons. So also from this point of view we are satisfied: sniper rifles, bows, shotguns plus melee ones, are pleasant to use and offer an excellent feeling. Problems in the hunting phases arise due to problems related to vital parameters. Every jokein fact, hunting must take into account the environment in which we are, the climatic conditions, our visual trajectory towards the prey, but also the prey towards us. We should also consider the possibility that smells and noises alert the animal. All this guarantees an excellent sensation of immersion, but remains neutered by the impossibility of acting at its best if not in excellent conditions. Blurred vision and instability of aiming, inability to have super sniffing, weakness problems, greater likelihood of making noise, all this due to the precarious conditions brought about by the absence of food. The loop in this case too is decidedly too impervious, preventing the player from having time to create effective countermeasures to the difficulties of the survival nature of the game. Added to this are the imperfect driving system and the difficult management of the hunting dog, which must be pampered and fed to make it perform at its best, but which is almost harmful if not taken care of.", "date": "2021-06-10", "grade": "6.0"}
