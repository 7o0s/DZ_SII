Today the situation is very different, with a respectable installed base, and the large commercial potential that follows, it was right to honor Xbox 360 users by offering them the opportunity to enjoy yet another exclusive console of weight. Important first work of Respawn Entertainment, this version of Titanfall was entrusted to the hands of Bluepoint Games, a Texan studio with good experience in porting operations, just remember the high definition collections of God of War, Metal Gear Solid and Ico . Titanfall for Xbox 360 manages not to disfigure in the face of the more performing machine versions 360 degree warfare Since this is a mirror version in terms of content to those for PC and Xbox One, we refer you to the excellent analysis made in the review for the new console from the Redmond house. Titanfall as everyone knows by now is an exclusively multiplayer product complete with dedicated servers to improve the gaming experience. The feature that made the latest effort by the creators of Call of Duty famous is the double face of the gameplay, declined on the one hand in dynamic firefights between soldiers equipped with jetpacks, which give unusual agility to the avatars, on the other the ability to summon mighty heavily armed armored robots to the field that elevates the battle to a titanic dimension. We immediately notice how these two components blend perfectly with each other, creating an unprecedented mix of situations that may already be known in other videogame fields. In general, the bar of the action always remains at high levels: the playability is always characterized by a frenzy that at first can displace the player more accustomed to the classic dynamics of the shooter panorama, but in a short time you learn that the classic approach seems too limiting. Knowing how to exploit the verticality of the maps, all characterized by a refined and never banal design, exponentially expands the possibilities of managing the fights and gives great satisfaction in the exploration of the scenarios. Also on Xbox 360 the number of players has remained identical to the editions released on more performing machines, we also have matches here of 6 against 6 human players accompanied by 12 bots per team, which also confirm on these shores their peculiar ~artificial stupidity~ which makes them little more than digital cannon fodder. Xbox 360 goals Titanfall is giving away the canonical 1000 points divided by 35 objectives, of which only three are those dedicated to the campaign. Others require the execution of certain maneuvers on foot or aboard the Titans and reaching level 50. Unlocking and mastering all the available weapons, as well as for the objectives helps to advance in the numerous challenges within the fundamental game to always obtain new accessories. Frontier War Among the game playlists in Titanfall, the presence of a Campaign mode immediately stands out which, indeed, consists merely of a series of nine games in conquest or attrition mode (the classic team deathmatch) linked together by a slender but not very incisive narrative thread. This sort of story set in the Frontier, a corner of the universe formed by numerous human colonies, can be played by impersonating both factions: the Militia or the Imc and manages to keep the player busy for no more than three or four hours. This campaign does not excite in terms of involvement and originality and therefore appears an all in all superfluous filler that fails to have the specific weight of a mode with a narrative worthy of the name. The only incentive to complete this short list of games is the possibility of unlocking two different Titan frames, essential for customizing and differentiating the classes of our mechs. The heart of Titanfall undoubtedly lies in the classic game playlists including: team deathmatch, capture the flag, conquer territories and the brand new Titan Survival mode where players start the battle directly aboard their metal giants and whoever destroys wins all enemy mechs, all with no respawn availability. There is also a ~variety~ playlist where all the aforementioned modes alternate randomly, for those who never want to stick to the same game scheme but don't want to waste time changing lobbies all the time. How understandableand the offer of game modes does not shine for its vastness and originality and perhaps another couple of more peculiar scenarios and sewn on the unprecedented gameplay such as Survival would certainly have contributed to giving greater depth to the general offer. Reduced to the bone, as already found on Xbox One, are also the management options of the lobbies, also being absent the possibility of creating private rooms and personalized games. However, it remains undeniable that the albeit few modes are all well balanced and go more than well with the heterogeneity of the gameplay offered by Titanfall, we just have to trust in future updates that can expand the number of playlists and options available. Aging with dignity The substantial differences, and in many ways the only ones, of the Xbox 360 version obviously concern the graphics side. Based on the same engine of Valve, the now old Source Engine, albeit suitably modified, the difference that most catches the eye compared to the previously released versions is the resolution. Being limited to a sub-hd equal to 1040x600p, the general cleaning of the image and the definition of the textures are affected, far from the well-defined surfaces appreciated on the PC. A little economy has also been made on the effects that embellish the action, but they are shortcomings that can only be noticed with a comparative and that in the frenzy of the game they are not felt that much. There is also a widespread but not too invasive aliasing while the polygonal mass has remained substantially almost unchanged so that we can appreciate the characteristic modeling of the Titans. On the other hand, the frame rate remains stable, while never reaching 60fps the game remains fluid even in the heaviest situations. Selecting the 30hz option blocks the number of frames per second at a ceiling of 30, only partially sacrificing the dynamism of the action, but in this way the annoying screen tearing effect that cuts the image on the screen disappears. Overall, the work done by Bluepoint Games is really more than enjoyable and, albeit with some inevitable and predictable differences, the Titanfall experience on Xbox 360 remains excellent and not distorted at all.", "date": "2014-04-18", "grade": "8.5"}
