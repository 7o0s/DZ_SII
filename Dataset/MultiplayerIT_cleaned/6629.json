These were titles that did not yet use real polygonal graphics, therefore all the more reason they demonstrated how a team of capable developers could carry out projects that seemed impossible on paper, especially then. In the case of the 3D Realms masterpiece, capable of selling over 3.5 million copies on debut (and we are talking about the 1996 market), the engine boasted unprecedented features such as the ability to interact with the environment, destroy objects , use sliding doors and take advantage of levels that often also developed vertically. Elements that can make you smile today, but which at the time were able to break into the scene to create new situations and give the product its own specific personality, rather than the simple clone label. And then there was him, Duke Nukem, star of a two-dimensional action platform created by Apogee Software in 1992, an Arnold Schwarzenegger of the poor who, thanks to the new context, between machismo and catchphrases, managed to quickly gain popularity and established himself as one of the most famous video game characters ever. Challenging and caciarone, Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition is a welcome blast from the past for nostalgics Gentlemen, we have a Megaton In short, Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition represents a substantial piece of gaming history, although the publication of this compilation took place on the PlayStation Store almost two years later than Steam, moreover at the same price (9.99 euros). However, the package supports cross-buy (which means that whoever buys it can use it without distinction on PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita) and is part of the Instant Game Collection reserved for PlayStation Plus subscribers in January, who will therefore be able to proceed with the download in completely free way and get some culture on the origins of FPS, or kill some anthropomorphic pigs remembering the good old days. The package includes the original Duke Nukem 3D campaign, three single player expansions (Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach, Duke It Out in D.C. and Duke: Nuclear Winter) and online multiplayer for up to eight players, with four different modes ( One-on-one, Free-for-all, Dukematch, and Co-op) split between ranked and unranked matches. Unfortunately, during our tests we didn't have great luck: there seem to be few online users at the moment and we came across really embarrassing episodes of lag. We hope that this aspect of the experience will be fixed soon, so as to take advantage of the player boost due to the free PlayStation Plus to organize some good matches. However, it is the single player that represents the fulcrum of the offer, thanks to a total of over fifty stages distributed in the various episodes and a degree of difficulty that is anything but trivial, indeed much greater than what Call of Duty fans or Battlefield can be used to. With a nice arsenal, moreover, which alternates pistols, rifles, machine guns, missile launchers, remotely controlled grenades and other delicious instruments of death. To overcome the inevitable frustration of yet another game over, the developers responsible for this edition have seen fit to insert a sort of ~rewind~ similar to the one present in some driving games, which allows you to resume the game from a precise moment instead of start all over the mission. Playstation 3 trophies The fifteen Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition Trophies can be obtained in a fairly linear way, therefore by completing the missions and completing a series of particular actions, such as killing a certain number of enemies in a certain way. Some Trophies are also unlocked by playing in cooperative mode, while others depend on our online performance, drawing the picture of a fairly complete achievement package. Old chicken makes good soup? Tested on both PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition undoubtedly has the charm of the great classics, but at the same time the graphics, made up of 2D sprites ~smeared~ in the scenario, are extremely old-fashioned. Some things have been fixed, such as the distortion of the perspective when we look up or down, but at the same time the vertical aim remains an accessory element, since it is enough to shoot in line with an opponent who is higher or lower of us to center it anyway. The initial loads on PlayStation 3 are frankly too long and in some moments the game suffers from a ~scattor~ annoying (when Duke picks up a card, for example), but the DualShock's reliability is undoubtedly greater than the tiny analog sticks of PlayStation Vita, which you need to get used to, especially in vertical movements. 'handheld Sony is used to change weapons and works very well, while on PlayStation 3 are the back buttons L2 and R2 to perform the same task, with a pressure of the left stick on its axis to activate or deactivate the run (on PlayStation Vita you need press down on the d-pad). Defects and merits of an adaptation which, as mentioned, technically remained that of 1996 (upscaling and widescreen aside) but on the gameplay front it still has something to say, with its intricate level design ( no one will tell you where to go, you'll have to get there by yourself), the puzzles based on the switches and the many ~desperate~ situations we'll find ourselves in during the campaign, with enemies literally standing still waiting for us around the corner and an energy system that doesn't recharges automatically but requires traditional medical kits. Speaking of reloading, it is useless to try to reload the starting pistol, whose ammunition must necessarily be exhausted for Duke to change his magazine: a ~limit~ that is part of the balance of experience, and which is also applied to other weapons.", "date": "2015-01-14", "grade": "7.0"}
