Reviving historical titles with a simple graphic upgrade on our computers didn't seem to make much sense, given that often with patches, modifications or services such as GOG, nostalgics have not had any particular problems up to now in enjoying their favorite titles. However, Microsoft Studios has decided to tempt the fans with a high definition re-edition of the classic Age of Empires II. It was worth it? A timeless classic The original is even dated 1999, which means geological eras in the videogame field. Age of Empires II represented one of the high points of the genre at the time, thanks to Ensamble Studios' ability to blend real-time strategy mechanics with a historical setting and exceptional depth. A title that entered the hearts of fans like few others, so much so that not too long ago updates, add-ons and even mods were released that refined its aesthetic component, ideal for enjoying the experience on our 16:9 monitors. Think of Forgotten Empires, for example, which a few months ago gave new life to the original with unpublished units, campaigns and technical updates. After the limited success of the free-to-play chapter, Microsoft has decided to take matters into their own hands and entrust Hidden Path, those of CounterStrike: Global Offensive, this Age of Empires II HD. The skill with which the developers managed to revive the most famous competitive shooter ever boded well for the success of this new project, which unfortunately left us somewhat disappointed. There are not many innovations, considering that the graphic up-scaling and the rearrangement of the soundtrack are the most evident. Unfortunately, Hidden Path was unable to work with the original content to render all the units again, but still took care to update the terrain, further embellished with well-made effects such as water and fire. The update also introduces support for higher resolutions and multiple monitors. The same treatment has been reserved for the graphic interface, which has been completely revised from an aesthetic point of view. In general, the work done is appreciable, capable of making a painting that is faithful to the original and at the same time suitable for today's needs pleasant. We could go so far as to compare the aesthetic sector of Age of Empires II HD to a classic painting, still beautiful to see today but which does not hide the passage of time. However, it must be said that if ~shot~ at high resolutions, the engine shows all its old age; for example the units are a bit small and we would have appreciated the possibility of bringing the view closer to the ground to get more into the heart of the action. The soundtrack was instead completely remixed, making it enjoyable and able to evoke the right atmosphere during long game sessions. Welcome Steam The technological update did not stop at the graphics and sound sector, however, given the total integration with Steam. To benefit from it is the multiplayer component, renewed to the bone. The single player campaign is limited to repeating what has already been seen in the original with the addition of the expansion The Conqueros, also released years ago. In this respect, considering the sale price, something more could certainly have been done. As far as gameplay is concerned, the only real novelty should be noted, such as the increase in the population which can now reach 500 units. Too bad that this addition was not followed by a refinement of the management component, still limited by the possibility of selecting only 20 elements at a time. Also missing is an option to call up multiple groups at the same time, a factor that inexorably highlights the age of the original title and the lack of initiative with which the remake was tackled. If you then count that the game has suffered from some annoying bugs since launch, especially online, you understand the reason for our bad mood. After several game sessions in the company of Age of Empires II HD we found ourselves wondering who might be interested in the Hidden Path work. In fact, fans of the original title will have already stripped it off at the time and the HD version could attract them thanks to the revived online component and support for Steam Workshop. On the other hand, novices could be discouraged by gameplay that still shows its age and by an improved aesthetic sector, but certainly not in step with the times. The considerations expressed and the evaluation obviously apply to the remake, which as you will have understood left us a little disappointed. Even the implementation of the Steam Workshop service ifIt seems almost a palliative inserted to give a sop to the community which will now be able to release new content more easily.", "date": "2013-04-12", "grade": "6.5"}
