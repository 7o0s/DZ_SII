{"name": "The Bourne Conspiracy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-bourne-conspiracy_a.html", "text": "Many action movie enthusiasts know the film trilogy dedicated to Jason Bourne, which moreover should be enriched with a new chapter in 2010. What they may not know is that the character played by Matt Damon was created recently, but back in 1980, from the writer Robert Ludlum. Ludlum wrote ~The Bourne Identity,~ ~The Bourne Supremacy,~ and ~The Bourne Ultimatum~ over a ten-year span, from 1980 to 1990, and began writing a fourth episode of the series shortly before his death in 2001. If the character of Jason Bourne is proposed for the first time on consoles with The Bourne Conspiracy, the same cannot be said of mobile gaming, which saw the release of the tie-in The Bourne Ultimatum, again by Vivendi Games Mobile. In that case it was a mediocre product, a horizontal scrolling action game without depth and with a modest technical realization. But now things seem to have changed a lot... The Bourne Conspiracy tells the entire Jason Bourne trilogy in one high-quality action game. In the role of the protagonist, we will have to face a series of stages and eliminate all the enemies inside them, drawing on a repertoire of moves that knows no equal in the mobile sector: Bourne can produce deadly combos of kicks and punches, grab his opponents to throat and clench, grappling with two enemies at the same time, stepping on the hands of those grabbing ledges, running kicks and flying strikes, somersaulting up from a floor below, climbing all over the place, rolling over, grabbing objects of various types (including firearms) and, finally, perform combined maneuvers whose complexity and degree of effectiveness depend on a bar located at the bottom of the screen. The game draws on classics such as Flashback and Prince of Persia for its platform setting, a choice that fits perfectly into this genre of titles. The action is always fast and engaging, in each location there is a large number of opponents to face and there is no shortage of bosses, more resistant and cunning. The normal sections are accompanied by very simple driving phases, which do not hold up to the qualitative comparison but which have the great merit of being short. Between one level and another we will see our character enhance their skills and acquire new special moves: the bar mentioned above, in fact, is divided into three parts and each one must be ~unlocked~. The graphics of the game are exceptional, certainly at the top of the mobile action game. The locations show a good level of detail and a quality of design in general, with a profound diversification of the stages from every point of view and a good interactivity, in the form of objects that Bourne can collect to use them against enemies. But it is above all on the sprites that the guys from Vivendi Games Mobile have done an extraordinary job: the protagonist boasts an incredible number of moves, can do practically everything and the quality of the animations is always excellent. The sound sector manages the arduous task of not disfiguring too much, with a good mix of MIDI music and sampled effects (the latter, unfortunately, can cause slowdowns on certain terminals). The control system is also absolutely excellent: the character moves using the joystick and attacks by pressing the 5 key. But there are also some interesting combinations: pressing the joystick up normally makes a jump, while doing it near a enemy activates a necklock. PRO Technically outstanding Great combat system Rich in thickness AGAINST Sound effects can cause slowdowns Mediocre driving sections Maybe a little easy", "date": "2008-07-07", "grade": "S.V."}
