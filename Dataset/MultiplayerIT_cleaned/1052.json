As already mentioned in the introduction, EA is intent on obliterating the competition. With the even partial acquisition of UbiSoft, it would seriously endanger the development of the entire Street Hoops series, which would otherwise compete with the internal NBAStreets. It is also news from a week ago that EA itself attempted to buy the exclusivity of the rights to exploit the NBA brand, thus trying to exclude SEGA from the games. Fortunately, it seems that the American basketball league has rejected the offer of the colossus EA as removing the rights to many other games in production would mean greatly reducing revenues. Let's start talking about the game itself, however, which this year will surely be talked about, both for the budget price and for the breath of fresh air it brings. But is this good or bad for a game already very close to perfection? Attack and defense Since its first appearances on the Dreamcast, SEGA's 2K series has always stood out for a peculiar feature: being able to combine perfect playability with spectacular and engaging graphics. The infinite amount of options and modes has always been a rich and tasty side dish for a game that is almost perfect in all its incarnations. Unfortunately this year, for the first time, the trend seems to be reversing. Despite the numerous innovations presented, in fact, it seems that the game has gotten worse. Surely in this 2005 the NBA series is the weakest link in the SEGA sports triptych, right behind the NFL and MLB which, despite everything, are still improving. The comparison with the direct rival NBA Live is inevitable. Any self-respecting basketball fan will not struggle to notice that the simulation of Electronic Arts, this year, seems the most complete and profound. On the other hand, SEGA's ESPN, which for the first time moves away from being the ~perfect simulation~, is still a very enjoyable game, even if it is no longer ~realistic~. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly makes you lose points against the noble rival. Anyone who has had the opportunity to take a look at NBA Live will have felt like being able to control every arm and every leg of the controlled player, like being able to decide exactly how much to jump and some force to give to the ball. Perhaps the playability is thus too cumbersome and less intuitive, but it certainly makes ~basketball~ breathe from every pore. ESPN in its 2005 version is instead much more Arcade, fast, immediate as always, but much more approximate and unrealistic. It remains spectacular and entertaining as always, and this is perhaps the most important thing. Surely in this 2005 the NBA series is the weakest link in the SEGA sports triptych, right behind the NFL and MLB which, despite everything, have improved further Attack and defense The game setting is extremely offensive. The attack phase is much more varied and well-finished than the defensive one, where the options are very few. The amount of actions, movements and animations possible in front of the basket are instead varied. For example, the post play attack is managed very well, with the possibility of sneaking left or right, feigning a shot and slipping into the box, turning around and shooting, passing with a no-look, unloading behind and so on. On the contrary, the defensive post gives no other possibility than to play against the opponent, often causing a foul. Iso-movements One of the novelties presented this year is IsoMotion2, and the whole game seems to hinge on this controversial feature of ESPN. Depending on the technical characteristics of the controlled player, it will be possible to perform new moves and unpublished animations with the analog stick, just like combos in a fighting game. Air IsoMotion is the natural extension of the concept, but re-proposed in the air, during a jump or a dunk. In this case it will be possible to ~arrange~ the ball at will by passing it from the left to the right hand or vice versa, or make a hook or anything else necessary to free oneself from an opponent's block. The amount of stunts available is very large. In defense, on the other hand, the use of the ~double team~ has been inserted, i.e. the classic ~doubling~, called in football terms, by simply pressing the left trigger. In defense, however, the use of the ~double team~ has been inserted, or the classic ~doubling~, called in football terms Iso-movements The use of IsoMotion2 is undoubtedly innovative and appreciable, if only that it was inserted without an appropriate refinement of the animations and the fixica of the ball, which is often unrealistic. It would almost seem that with the help of IsoMotion we find ourselves directly controlling the ball, and the animation of the player's arms are a direct consequence of the movement of the ball, rather than the other way around. In any case, IsoMotion needs a lot of practice to be refined, after which it can also give some satisfaction. Artificial intelligence There is no doubt that some steps have been taken in the management of artificial intelligence. In the intentions of the Visual Concepts developers there was the inclusion of a different one for each player. In addition to the ~team~ intelligence, which dictates the general game, there is therefore a ~personal~ intelligence which varies from player to player and which allows everyone to perform different strokes and personal actions depending on the case. In reality, on balance, all this is practically invisible, showing a general flatness in the management of the enemy AI. Perhaps in an excess of innovative will, VC has created a sort of Frankenstein of Artificial Intelligence that is no longer fish or meat, on the contrary, whose routines are not so well defined and refined. In addition to ~team~ intelligence, which dictates the general game, there is therefore a ~personal~ intelligence that varies from player to player Artificial intelligence For example, it is inexplicable the reason that pushes the enemy AI to try the three-point shot continuously, much more than what is seen in a normal match on television. A zoom called ~post zoom camera~ was then inserted, which comes into action whenever you are near the basket and brings the game view closer. Although this option is very spectacular and beautiful to look at, it actually makes it impossible to understand if one of our teammates is free just outside the three-point area, or if someone is inserting himself at that moment and is free for a pass. Fortunately, the ~post zoom camera~ can be deactivated from the options, and it is strongly recommended to do it initially. The association Association is the name given this year to the old ~franchise mode~, the game mode through which you can buy, exchange or hire players in your team. Not only that, from this year the psychological motivations given to the players will be fundamental for the general morale of the team. In fact, every week some players will be able to come and talk to you and ask you questions, depending on what motivations or answers we give them, they and the team will react differently. The ~Full Authority~ is perhaps the most popular innovation from this year, and will certainly be an option used in all future games in the sports series of SEGA. Practically the name already suggests something. Being the coach of the team we will be called to decide everything, from technical choices to substitutions. We will decide who will have to shoot from three, who will be able to try some penetrations, who to mark, through the time out call lasting a few seconds in which we will have to decide everything very quickly, just like a coach in a match. Once our wishes have been dictated, the game restarts automatically and we will see how our choices will affect the game. This gives the manager game a thick layer similar to the strategy of a chess game. Slam Dunks! ESPN NBA 2005 is, visually speaking, at the top. Basketball had never been so beautiful to see. The polygonal models of the players are extremely accurate, both in the faces and in the fluid and convincing body animations. The school of Visual Concepts is also ancient and by now this aspect could only improve further. The muscles of the body are covered by a beautiful wet effect, which makes both ~Slam Dunk~ (where the protagonists were perpetually dripping with sweat) and lucidity of the skin. The audience is as always divinely animated and reacts to the events on the pitch. The cut scenes inserted at the beginning and at the end of the game are TV-like, just as the ~ESPN~ brand suggests. Courtside interviews, player introductions, and anything else you might find in a real basketball game with the stars and stripes, is also in the game. The PlayStation2 version, very similar to the Xbox one, is inevitably slightly inferior, although still very good. The cut scenes inserted at the beginning and at the end of the game are TV-like, just as the ~ESPN~ brand suggests Slam Dunks! The polygonal models used for both versions are identical. The only difference would seem to be the lack of some light effects and poorer video cleaning. Some ladders (never forgotten) and some make a fine show of themselvestextures not quite up to par (the public for example), which on Xbox are perfect. How not to mention the online game, which is heavily supported by the good Xbox Live in a positive way: the game goes smoothly and quickly, without a hitch. The menus have been improved and a juicy online ~League~ mode has been included which brings together the best teams from around the world. Comment ESPN NBA 2005 presents itself to the public with many innovations, not always well integrated into the fabric of the game though. The use of IsoMotion is appreciable but unmanageable and the physics of the ball in these cases needs to be improved. The CPU AI is on all difficulty levels, apart from the very low ~Very Hard~, and enemy players often opt for questionable choices such as always shooting from three. The naked simulation leaves room for the spectacularization of the game and the general setting of ESPN is purely offensive, while the whole defensive part should be improved and further diversified. Having said that, it must be said that, as usual, made in SEGA Basketball is always the funniest and most spectacular, with always brilliant and highly rewarding cosmetics. In multiplayer it is the most fun you can ask for in a sports game, not to mention the ~internet~ option, very captivating and which gives an almost infinite longevity to the title. A transitional ESPN therefore, which brings novelties but which at the same time are still not very refined. A good starting point for SEGA and T2, but certainly the 2K series loses its most important quality: perfection. Pros: Fun gameplay Visually top Online mode Cons: AI to review Defensive part IsoMotion The ruthless commercial competition of Electronic Arts and their NBA Live had forced SEGA to take cover by offering their new ~ESPN~ brand at a budget price since its first appearance. The public greeted the initiative warmly, making it clear again how much the SEGA basketball game is loved on American soil. In fact, the NBA Live opponent has become increasingly threatening in recent years, from two points of view. The purely economic one, after the departure of the house of the Blue hedgehog, and from the point of view of the raw gameplay, increasingly realistic and well-finished. SEGA had to react with this edition to propose something new from both sides. Defending against EA both on the market, with the game's release price, and with some innovations that will find space in this edition of ESPN 2005.", "date": "2005-01-23", "grade": null}
