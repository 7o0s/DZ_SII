{"name": "Falcon Age", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/falcon-age-recensione.html", "text": "Not unlike what has been happening for some time in the mobile panorama, the market for virtual reality titles is decidedly ~democratic~: established studios or absolute newcomers have more or less the same chances of emerging, and it is for this reason that often gladly one can come across products made by practically unknown teams that for quality and ideas have nothing to envy to competitors with higher budgets and more savvy developers behind them. The Falcon Age present here presents on paper all the characteristics of the successful outsider: novice authors, peculiar premises, a characteristic graphic style and a gameplay that seems to take advantage of PlayStation VR in a reasoned way. So let's find out in our review if it is a real sleeper hit. A falcon for a friend The protagonist of the game is Ara, a girl locked up in a labor camp who manages to escape thanks to the intervention of a hawk who sacrifices himself to eliminate one of his robot jailers: before leaving, our heroine takes the baby bird with her orphaned, forging a bond with the animal that forms the foundation of both the story and the gameplay of Falcon Age. After a training period that also serves as a tutorial for the basic game mechanics, Ara and her partner (who has become an adult in the meantime) set off on an adventure that will see them both involved in an attempt to drive away the evil invaders of their planet. It must be said that, although the title is completely usable even with the Dual Shock 4 and even in TV mode without wearing PlayStation VR, facing Falcon Age without the helmet and the Move controllers is equivalent to enjoying an experience unable to express its full potential. Certainly you have to pay the price of a teleportation-based movement system (effective and reactive in this case, but never remotely comparable to the convenience of an analog stick), but it is a compromise that is gladly accepted due to the immersiveness and possibilities of interaction guaranteed by the PlayStation VR and Move combo. The adventure develops as a mixture of exploration, simple environmental puzzles, some action phases and a pinch of survival element that never hurts: in essence, you find yourself wandering around the (not boundless) game map solving quests , freeing enemy outposts from the presence of robots and collecting resources for the livelihood of the duo of protagonists and for the allies who will meet along the way. Thanks to the Moves, the actions to be performed by Ara can be simulated in a decidedly intuitive and credible way: it is therefore possible to pick up, throw and handle objects, slash with the weapon supplied (an electrified stick that can also act as a whip) and especially interacting with your faithful winged companion. This is undoubtedly the distinctive element of Falcon Age, managed with extreme skill by the developers of Outerloop Games. Bringing the left Move close to the mouth and pressing the trigger draws the attention of the falcon, and it will be sufficient to extend the arm forward to make the bird land on it: from here you can feed the bird, equip it with embellishments various, entrust him with objects or collect those he has recovered, remove any enemy darts that may have injured him or even just pet him and play with him a bit, appreciating his excellent modeling and behavior similar to that of a real specimen. It's hard not to feel sincere empathy for this virtual companion, also for its key role in the game economy: the falcon is indispensable for hunting animals, stunning or distracting enemies, destroying small structures and so on, all by simply holding down a key and aiming the left Move at the desired target. Technically everything works properly, and the developers have been good at sipping the news during the adventure to always let the user discover new ways to interact with his feathered friend. However, Falcon Age is not without flaws that affect its final evaluation: the adventure is short (five hours are enough to see the end credits), the story fails to excite, the rhythms are bland and punctuated by a too much backtracking and the challenge rate is practically non-existent. Even the audiovisual sector does not make you cry out for a miracle, with modest scenarios, a somewhat monotonous color palette and a decidedly lackluster sound.", "date": "2019-04-18", "grade": "7.5"}
