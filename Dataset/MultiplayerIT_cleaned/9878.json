The formula appears unchanged, but there are some novelties in terms of gameplay and controls (unfortunately only touch), two large maps and a smaller one for team deathmatches, all declined to the future. The new battle takes place in 2051, but the rules are always the same: we explain them to you in the PUBG: New State review. Mode PUBG: New State, a sequence from the Deathmatch mode Let's start with the contents, because PUBG: New State does not want to limit itself to reproposing only the battle royale mechanics that we know well, but also to try the more conventional path of team deathmatches. There is a specific map for this mode, it is called Station and it is available in beta version, which means that it will be substantially improved based on player feedback, but for the moment it has not impressed us. Returning to the traditional concept, the scenarios the largest available are two: Troi and Erangel 2051. Apparently they are two sides of the same futuristic coin: in the first case a city with some modern and evocative glimpses, in the second case a predominantly desolate, almost post-apocalyptic wasteland, in which the Erangel we knew fell apart. Once again we will be able to travel through the settings more quickly thanks to a series of abandoned vehicles, two of which are new: the Volta electric car and the Vulture motorcycle. Naturally, the goal is always the same: one hundred players parachute into the scenario (visually represented from above with large writings indicating the various districts) and, once on the ground, they must obtain weapons and armor useful for eliminating all the other users , playing alone or in teams. The options are certainly overwhelming: ranging from the ability to select the third or first person view, adjust the graphics options to obtain a higher quality and frame rate on high-end devices ( but on iPhone 12 Pro the maximum settings cause the temperature to rise rapidly) or customize the experience in various ways by modifying the controls and the many icons that appear on the screen by default. Gameplay PUBG: New State, eliminated enemies leave the usual backpack that we can loot In terms of gameplay, PUBG: New State appears fundamentally identical to its ~prequel~ (here is the review of PUBG Mobile, by the way), so no great progress has been made in the rendering of the firefights, equally inconsistent and approximate , but it has been seen fit to add a couple of new actions. It is in fact possible to lean to the right or to the left, using the appropriate buttons, or perform a somersault by quickly tapping the icon twice to duck, a maneuver that can come in handy during close range fighting. The Drone Shop has also been introduced, which allows you to buy items at any time, using the money collected around, and have them delivered wherever you want. The default interface appears extremely chaotic, full of icons on the screen, a bit like in oriental MMORPGs, and it often happens that actions are triggered involuntarily. Fortunately, from the options it is possible to modify the layout in many different ways and free up useful space for maneuvers, thus obtaining a more accessible basic system. For what it's worth, you can easily give up the ability to lean in order to have a better layout of the controls. After which there are other new elements, such as the possibility of saving a downed opponent and asking him to join our team, replacing any eliminated companions, or the aforementioned instantaneous switch between first or third person view, even if as an FPS the shooting experience is even less solid. Many small additions which however do not give the idea of a completely new product, but rather of a simple spin-off which is hard to distinguish from PUBG Mobile. Graphics and sound PUBG: New State, the usual dynamic of camping in a strategic point Even on a technical level, PUBG: New State is a decidedly unoriginal project, which takes the bulk of the assets from the previous version of the battle royale and tries in a very bland way to apply a style to the graphics that somehow gives the idea of a futuristic world, that of 2051: a goal that unfortunately is only achieved in a few situations. Beyond a decidedly average audio sectorcre, characterized by far from realistic sound effects, the visual rendering of the scenarios moves between ups and downs: the extension is there and is managed discreetly, albeit with some pop-ups on the shadows, and the d The lighting has been improved, but the geometries of the buildings remain rather simple and the counterpart in terms of performance did not seem adequate to us: setting the quality and frame rate to maximum, the game quickly heats up an iPhone 12 Pro.", "date": "2021-11-17", "grade": "7.0"}
