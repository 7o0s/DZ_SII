The game is a new chapter in the series that started with Reigns and continued with Reigns: Her Majesty and subsequent spin-offs, fully recovering the well-established structure of the previous chapters but moving the setting, characters and story into a completely different area, from the medieval reworking to the craziest and most humorous science fiction. On the other hand, the strange structure can adapt to practically any script, as long as it focuses on largely binary choices and interactions with colorful characters, but in this case it seems that Devolver Digital has really gone to great lengths of creativity to stage a theater of the absurd that closely resembles the science fiction The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Instead of playing a king, in this case we are a spaceship captain who is however also an improvised rock star, and this already represents another important element of distinction for the game structure: in addition to the narrative part which also hides managerial elements in the style classic of the series, Reigns Beyond also introduces a musical game mechanic that transforms it into a sort of rhythm game. This can be confusing and in fact it is probably the effect also sought by the developers, but let us try to briefly explain this strange story. The first character we have to deal with is the peevish on-board computer of the Sandman, the mysterious and highly advanced spaceship in which we wake up, apparently as the only living member of the crew and therefore automatically in the role of captain, except I realize I'm falling head over heels. Crashed to the ground, we find ourselves recruiting a crew of astronauts who are also members of a rock band, which we join after demonstrating our guitar skills in an improvised solo (as well as the fact that, crashing with ship, we also crushed the group's ex-original guitarist). From here on our adventure in space starts, with the possibility of gradually setting the route through various routes to choose based on the vague information on the map, among the more or less dangerous or promising ones in terms of threats and possible gains, meeting new characters, making constant choices and occasionally performing in concerts. Between stars and rock The characterizing element of the gameplay is the game interface: we proceed mainly for static screens, leafing through a deck of cards that represent the various characters we can interact with. With a swipe to the right or left you choose the answer to give, which also determines the action to be performed and therefore has an effect on the continuation of the story. These binary choices can lead to different consequences and affect the four parameters that must be constantly monitored and on which our destiny depends: energy, oxygen, crew and spacecraft. It may seem like a stretch, but the simple choices left to the player, which are often limited to a ~yes~ or ~no~ to the questions of the characters, influence these four parameters in different ways and in the end can make the difference between the glory in the interstellar musical universe or a premature end in space. With the possibility then to restart as in the classic mechanics of roguelikes, with the result of the matches which is measured, in this case, by the light years covered by the same captain. After setting the course we can dedicate ourselves to the crew or the ship, interacting with the band members and complying with their (often crazy) requests, which most often lead to a little too much partying or excessive oxygen consumption for their own amusement, or maintaining tighter control over their actions in order to better manage resources but also losing a bit of charisma and attraction among adventure companions and also as a spatial influencer, given that here too it is important to have a certain amount of followers on ~Stargram~. In addition to trivial issues such as survival in space, other elements are grafted into the adventure to make the experience richer and more profound: by making the right choices and balancing the actions between resourcefulness and prudence at the right time, it is possible to trigger evespecial nts and find rare guitars to add to the collection, furthermore within the story apparently entirely set on music and space travel there is also the narrative sub-track on the mysterious origins of the Sandman and on the strange behavior that the on-board computer often tends to manifest, with a story that is also complex and extremely lively but all built on blows and answers to be given simply by leafing through the cards on one side or the other, all perfectly translated into Italian. The rhythm game-style sections also fit into all this: when we find ourselves having to perform musical performances, the game transforms into something similar to Sayonara Wild Hearts or Thumper in terms of structure, albeit very simplified. You simply have to move a guitar along a pre-set path trying to touch all the hearts that appear on the screen, somewhat following the rhythm of the music that accompanies the action. It is a fun diversion at first but all too elementary and poorly structured to represent an effective enrichment of the gameplay.", "date": "2020-11-18", "grade": "8.0"}
