All these elements were the backbone of the original Shadow Warrior, they made the fortune of the all-three-dimensional reboot by Flying Wild Hog and are also at the center of this sequel which welcomes us with the inevitable eighties introduction, we don't miss the inevitable ravenous rabbits and pushes the accelerator by bringing into play more than seventy customizable weapons combined with a more refined and complex system of upgrades. Shadow Warrior 2 faces some important changes but does not betray its origins One Wang is no longer enough The main elements of the gameplay are the same as in the first chapter even if Shadow Warrior 2 does not let us miss news related to spells, skills and the possibility of evolution of the main character who, thanks to a vast choice of upgrades, can become ever faster, more robust and dangerous regardless of the weapon in hand. The novelties include more important upgrades, such as the one that allows you to hold two weapons, but they do not distort gameplay which, while admitting specialization in a specific type of combat, is designed to combine lead bullets, missiles, lasers and edged weapons. In short, swords once again represent a central element, a resource that becomes fundamental when projectiles are scarce and is enhanced by a gameplay that allows you to alternate ranged and melee attacks. And this is precisely the beating heart of Shadow Warrior 2, the same heart that made us fall in love with its predecessor and that allows us to cast spells, skewer enemies and shoot in profusion without ever stopping, darting everywhere, making prodigious leaps and making rapid changes of direction which are often the only way to avoid hordes of rapidly moving enemies. In short, the spirit is what we are used to even if the novelties have weight and are combined with important changes such as the elemental effects for weapons and the new technological threat that inserts itself between demons, ninjas and Yakuza henchmen, putting us facing huge robots and futuristic maps. But the real novelty concerns the structure of the experience that changes thanks to non-linear maps, rather large and procedurally generated, which can be reached with a click from an area populated by merchants and characters thanks to which we can buy and build upgrades. To do this you obviously need money which, like the experience necessary to enhance skills, is obtained by completing the missions and this is where the possibility of choosing whether to face the side missions and in which order to do it comes into play. Once satisfied with the evolution of the character, all that remains is to face the tasks related to the main story which, once completed, make the side missions not yet completed inaccessible but unlock new ones. In all of this Wang's main objective is to save a damsel in distress thus obtaining the only thing that really interests him: a large payment. To collect the money it is necessary to face a lot of new enemies who, as usual, arrive in increasingly numerous waves, initially easy to manage given the far from surprising artificial intelligence but capable of creating more than one problem for us in advanced missions, even on normal difficulty level. Some bosses also scourge Wang with real bombings that are not always easy to avoid and severely punish any distraction. The difficulty, however, is significantly scaled down once you understand the importance of the peculiarities of the weapons, fella fury which is charged by collecting skulls, of the elemental effects such as electricity which can paralyze enemies and of the relative power-ups which include energy absorption magical and vital as well as allowing you to increase specific types of damage, speed and other determining factors. Precisely for this reason, we find the real challenge only by tackling the two highest difficulty levels, which also represent good training to make a good impression in the new four-player online cooperative. And it is in function of this modality that the decision to opt for the introduction of a new loot box system, procedural maps and a hub full of merchants that recall the typical setting of titles such as Diablo or Borderland makes complete sense. In the case of Shadow Warrior 2, however, players are not free to move independentlyand are bound by the decisions of the host. Furthermore, the complexity of the inventory and the upgrade system forces long breaks that do not go well with the online formula. But playing in company and collaborating to face the most difficult challenges is still a more than pleasant addition and is a possible starting point for a further evolution of the series. Among other things, a substantial update released over the weekend has fixed some major problems of the netcode which now seems to suffer only from the intrinsic flaws of the Shadow Warrior 2 engine. The collisions, in fact, are rather coarse and, thanks to the enemies' eagerness to jump on us , cause quite a bit of visual chaos that makes it difficult to make the most of Wang's movements. The problems, however, are more than bearable and are partially compensated by pleasant extras such as the new loot collection system, the photographic mode, the now usual oversampling and goodies such as the ability to customize the field of view on the vertical axis. Repossessed Again in this sequel a recalcitrant Lo Wang is forced to house a soul in his body and this time it's that of the feisty daughter of a Yakuza boss. During a sort of experiment, the remains of the attractive girl became the home of a demon who must be evicted in order to free Wang from his new spiritual burden. A burden that, like the previous one, speaks, interacts and becomes an important component of a narrative dimension which, although light-hearted and unpretentious, still manages to be effective thanks to the dated but effective jokes in outlining Wang. And this is the other encumbrance with which our mercenary has to deal with, an identity as an eternal ~caciarone~ hero - like Deadpool, to be clear - which puts a big brake on narrative depth but fits perfectly with Bukowski's phrases inserted into the fortune cookies, sprays of blood of every color, grotesque enemies and bloody limbs flying across the screen. And it's a decidedly more pleasant screen to look at than in the past. Amplitude and procedural generation of the new maps are not the only novelties of this sequel which, while maintaining the style of its predecessor, frees itself from the dated legacy of the 1997 Shadow Warrior. This time the graphic effects are not a tool to distract from outdated elements but the icing on a well-optimized engine, an engine full of extras that is decidedly more evolved despite the limits relating to polygonal complexity, texture definition and model quality. Limits that are probably inevitable for a low-budget title that manages to give us delightful oriental towns, fiery sunsets, sci-fi neighborhoods full of neon lights, physics in abundance, enemies that are sliced dynamically, spells, huge creatures, energy shields, enemies showing signs of being attacked, ice clouds, particle explosions and a lot of other effects related to our huge arsenal, new enemies and new weapons they have. Faced with all this, the fact that the procedural generation involves a few glimpses repeated several times takes a back seat and it is in any case difficult to notice it in a title that has its strong point in the variety, even as regards the enemies. Waiting for us along the way there is really everything between robots, insects, demons, shamans, piles of meat, poisonous creatures and henchmen who attack us with energy weapons, swords and machine guns. All these funny guys, among other things, have a lot of skills at their disposal that allow them to become invisible, to explode, to obtain power-ups, to perform stunts and, in the case of the most powerful opponents, to surround themselves with minions who must be defeated in order to harm the creature they are linked to. Finally, there is no shortage of bosses, as always tough to face and big, for an experience that really does not make us miss almost anything, including an excellent quality soundtrack, and which for this reason can boast of being one of the richest shooters around ever. A title that is not perfect and unfortunately completely devoid of adaptation in Italian but which fully justifies the 37 euros of the price also thanks to a respectable longevity. To complete Shadow Warrior 2 on normal difficulty it is easy to reach fifteen hours which can become many more thanks to the secrets, the higher difficulty levels and the cooperative mode.", "date": "2016-10-17", "grade": "8.0"}
