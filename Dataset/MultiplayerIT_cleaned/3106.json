{"name": "Forza Street", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forza-street-recensione.html", "text": "The Forza Street review can only start with a clarification: what has just made its debut on iOS and Android devices is not a traditional driving game, but a drag racer. It is a sub-genre that boasts some famous mobile representatives, above all the CSR Racing series, and which has precise characteristics: the car takes turns automatically, therefore the player's intervention is limited to pressing the accelerator (especially at the start) and changing gears with perfect timing , in accordance with the characteristics of the vehicle we are driving, with the upgrades carried out and with the specifications of our rival. Net of an evidently simplified formula, designed with mobile entertainment in mind that cannot be compromised by external elements (steering via the accelerometer while you are standing in the subway may not be very simple), the drag racer genre hides in any case its thickness. The race must in fact be analyzed segment by segment, so as to understand where our vehicle loses and where it gains, consequently modifying the approach to changing gears and indicating what to boost: the tires for better grip that can give us a cue at the start, the nitro to enjoy a higher final speed where we need it, and so on. Gameplay Forza Street further simplifies the typical formula of drag racers, eliminating the gear change and leaving only the accelerator to our control, to be dosed with precision at the start in order to start the race in the best conditions, but also to let go and press again entering and exiting curves, paying attention to the yellow markers on the route. The timing of our maneuvers determines the starting point that we will be able to obtain compared to the opponent, but it also loads the nitro indicator on the left side of the touch screen, which fills up twice but lends itself to various interpretations in the context of the race : there are situations in which it is better to use it even at half its power to stay in the lead and avoid being overtaken, others in which it is better to wait for the bar to be completely full to take advantage of a powerful reach. The strategic concept typical of this genre of games is therefore maintained, but in a milder form, especially as regards the upgrades. In fact, having obtained the necessary resources to carry them out, the upgrades are generic and go to increase the general value that indicates the power of the car, but they do not go into the details of the components and therefore give up that type of facet. In this sense it is emphasized more the aspect of unlocking new cars (through the classic ~unpacking~), divided into four categories which in turn distinguish between standard, modern, classic and retro vehicles: using certain types is a must depending on the racing restrictions, as well as having to ~repair~ them using the wrenches obtained up to that point. Which leads us to discuss the freemium aspects of the experience, which stand out right from the start due to the fuel that is consumed every time you take a step on the stage board, whether it is a race or a simple collection of objects, and which is restored over time or through the use of top-ups that are only initially free, thus forcing us to wait sometime where they are not available. The same scenario is painted by the abundance of currencies present, which are given with discrete ease by playing but can obviously also be purchased for real money if you want to speed up progression. Technical realization Considering the essentiality of the mechanics, it is clear that a successful drag racer must be able to count on a respectable technical realization, so as to impress the player with the quality of the polygonal models and effects, offering him a show of great visual impact that will be encouraged to review again and again. An aspect that is all the more true in the case of Forza Street, which has to deal with the systematic repetitiveness of its gameplay and with the inevitable repetition of the scenarios within the long single player campaign, set in the streets of a Miami represented almost exclusively at night. Well, net of an aliasing that in some cases becomes quite evident and of a decidedly simplified physics, it certainly cannot be said that the graphics of Forza Street are unpleasant, on the contrary. The many unlockable cars have been faithfully reproduced, it is possible customize them from an aesthetic point of view (albeit in a limited way) and once on the trackthe game often changes the camera to give the idea of absolutely adrenaline-pumping direction, which emphasizes contacts and overtaking (all automatic, in practice) accompanying the two cars from the starting line to the finish line. Also in this case the combinations after a while they run out and the charm diminishes, but the system holds up well and is supported by a sound sector that proves to be functional to the action.", "date": "2020-05-07", "grade": "6.8"}
