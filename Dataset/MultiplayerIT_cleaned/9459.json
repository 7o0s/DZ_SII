All right then? Not at all. Marty is in fact disappearing, and a glance at the newspaper makes it clear to both that the cause is the death of Marty's grandfather, Arthur McFly. The first thing to do is therefore to prevent his departure caused by Kid Tannen's minions, in order to then be able to get to the heart of this second episode. If any of you hoped to change the era and scenery you will be disappointed: everything still takes place in Hill Valley at the time of Prohibition, except for a brief sortie in 1986. The problem is not so much this, but rather the shortage of new areas explorable, if not an actual exploration. If you're a longtime Telltale fan, however, you'll also be used to these apparent slip-ups between episodes. It is not uncommon that after a good chapter, which undoubtedly was the first, It's About Time, a more lax episode follows. This impression derives precisely from the forcing of reviewing the entire saga one piece at a time which should instead be judged as a whole. In fact, in the economy of a story, there may also be a moment in which the threads of the narrative are fleshed out and some secondary event set in motion, only to explode in a thunderous twist a little further on. Waiting to find out if this is the case with Back to the Future - Episode 2: Get Tannen!, or if it prepares the ground for some future climax, let's try to understand first what it does well, and then what it doesn't do so well. The points in favor of this second episode are certainly the plot, which is enriched with many viable paths, and the entry into the scene of new characters, well characterized and interpreted even better by the real actors who lend their voices. It remains only to understand if many possibilities will be exploited properly by the developers. But perhaps we are forgetting someone: the player. Yeah, what happened to it? Read on and you will know. Everything has already been written The big trouble for the player are the puzzles: so easy to solve that often require nothing more than a click on the right answer or the right person. In many cases these are the typical situations to which the Telltales have accustomed us, pseudo moments of action in which you just have to guess the correct sequence of commands; otherwise we are faced with simple puzzles that require only a little attention to words. Unfortunately, and it is not justifiable, the idea of asking the dog Einstein to sniff out a trace from an object, already seen in the first episode, is recycled twice here. Furthermore, there are no real explorations or journeys between one scene and another to find an object and thus unlock a secondary puzzle that allows us to proceed with the main story, just to give an example. In short, everything that could slow down or interrupt the flow of events has been eliminated and simplified as much as possible. On this point we allow ourselves an interpretation: Back to the Future works above all thanks to its ability to tell a story in a cinematic way, involving the player as much as possible in the framing game, keeping the tempo of his actions so that he does not disturb the rhythm with which the story unfolds. It is a precise choice that cannot make everyone happy and that those who love the universe that the Back to the Future films have made known to millions of viewers will especially appreciate. Despite this however, a certain tiredness in the ideas transpires from Back to the Future: Get Tannen!. Let's hope it's a phase and that there's once again an opportunity to laugh, surprise ourselves, but at the same time play. In Italy we call it ~Back to the Future~! You demanded them, you shouted your pain and disappointment in the comments for those bad developers who forgot about our beautiful language, but now, with great peace of the editor who always reads you passionately, patches with Italian subtitles are available of Back to the Future. The excellent team that made them is the same that has already proven its worth with the Italian adaptation of Tales of Monkey Island. For the moment, only the patch of the first episode of Back to the Future is available, but the second one will be online soon. All of course free and ready to download, for PC and Mac. We therefore refer you to the translation team site, where you will find answers to all your questions, as well as obviously patches for the game.", "date": "2011-02-22", "grade": "7.0"}
