The first chapter was born as a bonus given to the backers of the Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night Kickstarter campaign. Koji Igarashi's intention was to serve to enrich the mythology of the game a little, while he completed the development of the spiritual heir of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the main chapter of the new intellectual property. The idea behind Curse of the Moon was to create an ideal sequel to the first chapters of the Castlevania series, those released on the NES, taking up their appearance, especially in the color palette and in the sprites, almost as if to make the pedigree of the new franchise comparable to the original one. Inti Creates, a studio formed by ex-Capcom, did a surprising job, so much so that the game gained its own identity autonomy in the eyes of the public. It sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Given the success, why not repeat? The developers must have said that, for the sequel, however, they wanted to aim higher, while leaving the nostalgic celebratory patina of the entire operation intact. So where Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon was conceived as a light appetizer, with a very affordable level of difficulty, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon 2 has taken the opposite path and does nothing but slap the player from the beginning, approaching so much more to the first Castlevanias. Game mechanics The game tells a new adventure of the samurai Zangetsu, this time busy reaching and destroying a demonic stronghold. There will be six additional characters to accompany him, three already seen in Curse of the Moon and three unpublished, all to be unlocked by completing the game levels. The story is divided into three chapters (actually four, but we won't reveal too much) and is essentially a rich plot concocted to justify one of the best Castlevanias of recent years, with truly remarkable gameplay gimmicks. The most relevant is the possibility of changing characters in real time during the action, thus being able to take advantage of everyone's powers in concert. It is a gimmick that at first alienates a bit, but which we then understand has been exploited in an excellent way by the developers to propose levels with a varied and very elastic design. Basically it is never possible to explore all the maps with a single character, but you have to alternate them. Only in this way is it possible to reach certain objects or see all branches of a single map (replaying it several times). Better yet, this is the only way to get out of some seemingly desperate situations. Yes, because even the positioning of enemies and traps has been studied to favor one or the other character from time to time, with the player being invited to understand who is better used and who is not. To give some direct examples, the exorcist Dominique can use her spear to jump on enemies, so as to reach the highest platforms and, in some cases, not touch the ground, while the dog Hachi can fly his robot over the chasms wider or break lethal spikes by walking on them. The maps are therefore much more dynamic than the apparent linearity suggests at a superficial glance. If we want, this is also an original way to successfully introduce metroidvania elements into a formula anchored in a much more remote past, without distorting it. Gameplay The initial glance of Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon 2 is that of a NES title, between small sprites, clear character outlines, very large pixels and a general feeling of a home video game from the 80s that holds up until the end of the adventure. Despite this Inti Creates has done an excellent job in the characterization of the environments and in the design and animations of enemies and bosses, proving to master the pixel art in a perfect way. Sure, the imagery of the franchise doesn't take half a step forward, but that was certainly not the goal of the game. As we mentioned, we are faced with a title that offers a big challenge (by selecting the Veteran difficulty), where not even the first level goes smoothly if you don't pay due attention to what you are doing. From the second, however, everything gets complicated, with some passes that are very ruthless with the player. After the umpteenth death, one finally realizes that the levels are built to be as bastard as possible, much more than in the first chapter, between lethal traps and chasms that pop up everywhere, self-propelled platforms that are very easy to miss, pools of lava, enemies that they appearwhen one least expects it and whatnot. Worse still are the bosses, which can be described as large beasts with complicated attack patterns, which require very careful study before being defeated, especially from the third map onwards. Skills and flaws To help us there is the already described possibility of using more characters and there are various objects to collect. As in any self-respecting Castlevania-like, also in Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon 2 there are torches to be broken to obtain objects of all kinds, such as flasks that recharge the energy of special attacks, healing hearts, bags that they go to increase the general lives of the group, plus some special items. Every character, apart from Hachi, has a number of skills at their disposal. For example, Zangetsu can use the whip to strike upwards, or he can surround himself with an aura that enhances his blows; Dominique can create healing plants or create typhoons; Hachi can become invincible and so on. Each character can carry one special power at a time, forcing the player to continually choose which is the most useful in any given situation. As you may have understood, despite being a platformer, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon 2 continually asks the player to make assessments and develop strategies to use the resources at his disposal as effectively as possible. The only real flaw of Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon 2 is its being too nostalgic, which leads it to deviate very little from the standard formula of the genre. Perhaps a greater effort could have been made in this sense, even if it is not exactly fair to ask such a small production, sold at a budget price, to do something that not even the biggest publishers allow themselves to do. The title of Inti Creates is designed for a very specific audience with specific expectations. Why disappoint him?", "date": "2020-07-16", "grade": "8.8"}
