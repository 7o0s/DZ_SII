You are our last hope, good luck!~ This is the concise presentation that introduces Journey Below and lets us understand the Spartan spirit that characterizes the entire Ravenous Games game. With such a background, it is not surprising that in this sort of dungeon crawler one must, essentially, only jump and attack enemies with the right timing. The game is in fact a hybrid between the typical characteristics of the roguelike action RPG and the endless runner, or rather a declination of the latter genre within a framework that places it in the context of RPGs, in some way. We must not be betrayed by appearances: Journey Below is simple in terms of concept and mechanics but not simplistic in its implementation. In fact, the intrinsic limitation of a control system that only allows you to jump and attack, while the main character's movement is automatic and changes direction with the collision of any obstacle, actually introduces a rather careful study of level design, in way to create a challenge that can be interesting and demanding but also balanced, in such a basic context. It is this balance that makes Journey Below enjoyable, after all, also derived from the choice not to rely on the random generation of levels - for once - and to provide on the contrary a game experience deliberately limited in its development, with a quantity of schemes to be completed pre-set. In fact, it is a question of proceeding through 12 levels of progressive difficulty by advancing in the exploration of the large cave that is the setting for the action, up to the clash with the aforementioned final monster which represents the conclusion of the game experience, or at least of its main version . Journey Below is an interesting hybridization experiment between roguelike and endless runner Further down The main idea of descending deeper and deeper into the cave at the helm of a character who cannot be stopped partly recalls the concept behind the excellent Downwell, which has become a real cult in the indie and mobile world, but the comparison between the two titles it mostly stops at this ideal point of contact, because the game situations and the gameplay mechanics are then quite different. There are role-playing elements in Journey Below that assume great importance in the game, and are concentrated above all at the end of each level, with the choice offered to the player to evolve the protagonist by acquiring various cumulative perks (more powerful attacks, additional hearts, further accumulation of points, etc.) which substantially modify the knight's efficiency. The problem is that with the death of this, or when you suffer enough damage to reset the heart bar, the game over cancels any progress made up to that moment forcing us to start from scratch. In short, the classic principle of the roguelike, with the game forcing us to try to progress within the 12 levels in a single and intense game until the final battle. It is clearly a limited game in terms of longevity, even if the introduction of the complex points collection system with associated multipliers and the online rankings can keep the attention high even after having concluded the story one or more times, but certainly one must demonstrate a remarkable attachment. To underline the simple and no-frills style also the graphics of Journey Below, which as is now fitting for productions of this type presents the classic characterization stylized in pixels inspired by the games of the 8-bit era, also in this case simple but certainly a positive impact.", "date": "2016-08-22", "grade": "7.4"}
