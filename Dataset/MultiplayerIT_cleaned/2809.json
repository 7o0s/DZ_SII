{"name": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed-valhalla-recensione.html", "text": "The Assassin's Creed Valhalla review describes what we believe is a courageous project, which tries to approach such a famous and iconic franchise by trying to tell a story in a different way, taking all the necessary time to avoid hasty narrative solutions and thus ~wasting~ situations and sequences that could otherwise have easily become part of the collective videogame imagination, as happened previously. In the first ten hours the game suffers from performance anxiety, it wants to put its cards on the table but it does in a chaotic way and thus the great novelty of the choral battles, between sieges and raids, reveals all the limits of a development that has probably gone on in recent months amidst the thousand setbacks of this cursed pandemic, also having to deal with the unexpected and sudden departure of director Ashraf Ismail. After twenty hours the structure of the title appears clear in its connotation divided by sagas, with the protagonist who moves from one area of England to another in search of alliances and gets to know well-characterized characters, lives fascinating adventures and in the meantime grows, acquiring awareness of a deeper combat system than in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which manages stamina almost as if it were a soulslike and actually interprets each build in a different way: better two axes, a sword and a shield or a weapon two hands? After thirty hours the threads of a plot are pulled which finally reveals its links with the historical lore of Assassin's Creed, but despite everything new quests and possibilities continue to open up: journeys to distant lands or even other worlds are envisaged, while the village we have built grows as we feed it with the resources unduly stolen from the English abbeys, carrying out partially sweetened predatory expeditions (in the game the rule of not killing civilians always applies, but the Vikings hardly had these problems ) and, at a certain point, inevitably repetitive. And so, with the map revealed in all its overwhelming enormity, we enter the heart of a courageous project, as we said at the beginning. Because he takes nothing for granted, even narratively justifying the leap of faith. Because it doesn't give itself in a hurry, but lays very solid and precise foundations before taking the road that everyone expected. Why doesn't he throw dozens of weapons and armor at us by filling our inventory with useless photocopies, rather focusing on a smaller number of objects which, however, have a meaning and a progression that is not obvious. And in all of this, it allows itself the luxury of captivating us with some of the most beautiful landscapes ever seen in a video game. History The story of Assassin's Creed Valhalla opens with a background, as has become tradition for the series. We see Eivor as a child who, in the middle of a feast, is sent by his father, a valiant Viking warrior, to deliver to the leader of the Raven Clan a gift that can seal the bond between their two families. The feast, however, is suddenly interrupted by an assault that soon turns into a ruthless massacre. On the verge of being killed, Eivor is saved by the chief's son, Sigurd, who carries him away on his horse. It is the beginning of a brotherhood, rather than a friendship: several years later, the two are finally ready to claim revenge against whoever launched that attack, and they get it at the end of a hard duel which confirms the fighting ability of the protagonist of the game. After meeting two members of the Brotherhood of Assassins, who give him and Eivor the iconic Hidden Blade (but the Viking decides to wear it backwards, so as ~not to make the same mistake~ as his new companions), Sigurd nevertheless decides that his father's excessive composure does not fit him, and so he gathers his men to leave for England and follow in the footsteps of Ragnar Lothbrok and his descendants. Once there, the Clan of the Ravens establish their own settlement, Ravensthorpe : a city that will be our task to grow, recovering some mechanics of the classic Assassin's Creed episodes subordinate, however, to the resources that we will be able to conquer during the various raids. Left alone by Sigurd, who in the meantime leaves with the Assassin Basim in order to forge alliances in southern England, we will have to coordinate our work with that of his wife Randvi. Male or female? As you probably know, it is possible to play Assassin's Creed Valhalla by opting for the male or female version of Eivor. Double DNA comes in somewhereand narratively justified, and it is possible to switch at any time from one sex to another or let the system decide for us, alternating between man and woman. One thing, however, we want to say: since the presentation we had the feeling that in this case the female version of Eivor was a mere concession for variety purposes, and so we almost always played as the male version. But then we had to change our minds: Eivor Donna is not only a beautiful character but is also interpreted on average better in Italian dubbing. Our suggestion, where you don't want to embark on two different playthroughs, is therefore to opt for automatic alternation. Structure It is at this point that the structure of the new episode of the Ubisoft series begins to reveal itself. Having abandoned the Norwegian scenario of the very early stages and having landed in England, we will have to carry out a series of expeditions: on the one hand, as mentioned, to raid the abbeys and return home loaded with gold and resources; on the other, to visit the rulers of nearby regions and somehow secure their support in view of possible wars. After a few dozen hours, the predatory missions inevitably become repetitive, given that the only variables are represented by the degree of challenge and the environmental puzzles that we will have to solve from time to time to find the biggest chests, often hidden behind barred doors or in the darkness of dungeons full of enemy soldiers. Generally, one approaches an abbey, silently eliminates some guards and finally blows the horn which signals the clan to invade the area to begin the raid, facing the local troops head on. The speech of the alliances is quite different, because each of them arises as a mini narrative campaign. In this case our task will not simply be to reach a new area of the map (perhaps after synchronizing the position on the peak of a mountain, a ruined tower or a bell tower) and kill someone in exchange for the favors of the current governor , but we will get to know new characters and get involved in their exciting and well-written stories. This is therefore the innovative formula adopted by the developers of Assassin's Creed Valhalla: a system made up of different sagas, in a clear reference to Norse mythology, which make up the main plot and which are naturally supported by assassination assignments (could they be missing?), by an alternative adventure set in a dream (we do not want to reveal it) and by small pure side subquests, generally short but interesting; despite not being able to count on the lore of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which with its many historical figures had an easy game in stimulating the player's curiosity. Gameplay So let's come to the gameplay, which, as mentioned, pays the price during the first few hours due to a vision that is not perfectly materialized. The combat system of Assassin's Creed Valhalla in fact starts from that of the aforementioned Odyssey and retains its facets, while greatly limiting the special abilities to create clashes that are spectacular but with your feet firmly planted on the ground, without divine interventions or other . The same goes for the crow Synin, which we can call up to look at the area from above but without locking onto the targets as happened previously, so as to maintain a certain level of challenge. There is the interesting novelty of the double weapon: we will be able assign a sword or an ax to the dominant arm and a shield or another cutting weapon to the other, or opt for a tool to be held with two hands. All this creates big differences in the approach to the clashes, for example providing us with greater effectiveness in terms of attacks but limiting the defensive phase to dodges, in turn regulated by a stamina bar that empties so quickly as to remember the soulslike ; or allowing us to add the parry to our repertoire and therefore fighting in a different way. The system works very well in one-on-one, but even here when the opponents (divided into a fair number of types between standard soldiers and tougher commanders, archers and elusive swordsmen, bandits and bosses) increase, confusion arises as a consequence , giving life to very intricate sequences and with approximate interactions, which give back a clear idea of poor finishing. Fortunately, after a few hours things improve substantially, the new system is taken and metabolized, alternating stealth approach and open-faced clashes as in the best Assassin's Creed tradition. It is important to underline how the well-paced rhythms of the narrative progressiona are also reflected in the growth of Eivor, who never really becomes a death machine and can indeed often find himself involved in duels from which he may not come out alive. It is possible to deal with settlements of a higher degree than ours (and even assassinate enemies stronger than us, provided you hit a quick time event or set this condition in the options, however ~breaking~ the balance), but energy management vitality and resistance in general make it quite difficult. The artificial intelligence of the opponents is completely similar to that of Odyssey, both in the action and stealth situations. The controls have been further streamlined, with the hidden blade being used with the same key for the light attack (right dorsal) but in a contextual manner, therefore only if we are catching an enemy off guard. For the rest, as mentioned, the two hands are independent and this creates many new possibilities in battle, you can use the bow by pressing the left trigger and activate the special abilities based on the fury indicator (even the very limited one). overall, Assassin's Creed Valhalla makes you sweat for upgrades and enhancements, assigning two talent points to each successfully completed assignment and allowing you to unlock perks from a very fascinating tree that incorporates the constellations, emphasizing the effectiveness of certain sets of tools, improving health (which can be restored by gathering food, but in a very limited way) and power, and so on. We liked this approach, especially compared to other episodes where you get very strong too quickly. In terms of the system of choices and consequences, a great deal of work has been done, with a series of decisions that translate into narrative crossroads and produce tangible results not only immediately but, above all, in view of the end of a campaign that lasts probably superior to that of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was not completed in less than forty hours but could keep us busy for three times as long. As for the romance element, however, we had the feeling that it was somewhat set aside compared to to the previous episode, with little possibility of approach during the first twenty hours and some concessions later on which, however, we cannot speak of. These are also choices that affect the plot, but we were hoping for a real evolution of this feature rather than a simple sop. Difficulty levels Assassin's Creed Valhalla allows you to tackle the campaign choosing between three different levels of difficulty, one for each central aspect of the experience: exploration, combat and stealth. It is a more multifaceted solution than the one adopted for Odyssey, which in fact regulates these elements and increases the challenge of each of them separately. We will therefore be able to opt for a more realistic exploration, with few icons and indications, but at the same time avoid that the clashes always become deadly; or increase the complexity of the stealth phases with enemies who are more shrewd and able to spot us. Setting There is no doubt that the setting is the true great protagonist of Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Not wanting to think only in terms of cities (in addition to the many small villages, there are three that can be visited: London, York and Winchester), as happened in the classic episodes of the series, the developers have shifted the focus to the English regions and worked hard in order to offer us a glance that in some cases is truly extraordinary. Also from the point of view of the variety of scenarios: we start from the snow-capped mountains and the extremely variable climate of Norway to then arrive in an England with autumnal tones, characterized by wonderful and a rendering of trees, foliage and clouds that on PC with the maximum settings is truly extraordinary. The volumetric clouds, which cast their shadows on the characters and on the territory, make the game sequences surprisingly dynamic, further enhancing the graphic assets and the high-resolution textures used to adorn the various surfaces. Reaching the raised points of the map it is therefore possible to enjoy incredible views and notice even more the difference in terms of lighting. It is almost useless to talk about water: it is since the days of Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag that the Ubisoft developers have reached levels of excellence in the rendering of the sea, and Valhalla is obviously no exception, also in this case giving us extremely suggestive glimpses when the sun is reflected on the waves.
