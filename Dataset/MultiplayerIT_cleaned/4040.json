{"name": "Dragon Ball FighterZ per Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-fighterz-switch-recensione.html", "text": "Not even a year has passed, yet Dragon Ball FighterZ has managed to gain a place in the Olympus of competitive fighting games alongside Street Fighter and Tekken, even going so far as to erase from the face of the earth those Marvel vs Capcom which he was clearly inspired by for the its mechanics. It is certainly not the first fighting game to have captivated fans of the genre in such a short time, but the splendid work of the Arc System has an impressive number of arrows in its quiver, which should allow it to remain relevant for a long period of time: it managed , to say, to unify the American Marvel community and the Japanese/European anime fighters community, giving life to one of the most exceptional and histrionic competitive scene ever seen; brought Dragon Ball characters' moves and attitudes back to the screen like never before, managing to take root even on an audience not necessarily passionate about technical fighting games; and finally also landed on Nintendo Switch, thus becoming available on every modern platform. And today we want to deal with the review of this latest version, because there were many doubts related to the port, and the expectations of the owners of the Nintendo hybrid were very high. I can't see them with the naked eye! Let's quickly review the gameplay, which we have already extensively described in our previous review, but it is always the case to brush up at least in part. The Dragon Ball FighterZ system takes full advantage of the old Marvel VS: it is a fighting game where two players compete for control of a team of three fighters, who can take turns during the battle or help each other with assists of various types. This system already makes the choice of characters rather tactical - because each warrior has specific synergies that make him suitable for a certain position in the team or for certain partners - but it is counterbalanced by a system with a very simplified execution, since the special moves are activated here almost only with quarter moons. Warning, the fact that the skill barrier linked to execution is low does not mean that the title is easy to use: it remains a monstrously technical fighting game, with an infinite number of subtleties and technicalities, and whose very high speed makes it really difficult to manage the everything even for very experienced players. Underestimate its depth, and online they'll mop the floor with your corpse. Nothing has changed on Switch, and the only variation on the theme is actually a platform-related addition: simplified controls. For the record, these are not system automations, but shortcuts designed to allow you to play with a single Joycon (which lacks two back triggers normally essential to perform all the maneuvers). They work for local challenges between friends, but obviously it's not the most functional way to dominate the title, and a pad pro is always the best solution. As for the rest, however, the advantage of those who buy this version lies in having the entire roster immediately available, with the first season of DLC characters completely available... only that you won't get them for free. In fact, unlike what other developers have done with their ports, here the basic version of the game contains only the original warriors and the free novelties (with the two Super Saiyan Blues still to be unlocked, however), while for all the others you will be forced to get a rather expensive full version, or buy the season pass again. A choice that we understand given the relatively young age of the Arc System fighting game, but we don't approve of it: it was a good opportunity to immediately bring all new users up to speed without the need for extra expenses. Krillin owned counter: zero In short, the development team's choice was to bring its baby back to Switch, without any modification, facilitation or sensitive addition (apart from the special commands defined above, and the possibility of competing between neighboring Switches, whose attendance was obvious). It means that as soon as you start the game you will be able to face the new 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 battles or team battles, but also that the mediocre Story Mode - very well written and full of funny scenes, but also incredibly simple and repetitive - is identical to the past, without any refinements whatsoever. However, it must be said that this parity has also remained from the point of view of the technical sector, since the work done by Arc System is absolutely textbook in this difficult field. In the portable version, after all, FighterZ travels at a mostly stable 60 fps (there are dips, but they are rare and hardly affect theclashes, appearing almost only during the most excessive super) and at 720p it is a feast for the eyes. However, the docked version is the one that really amazes, because the Arc Systems have not done their homework, but have managed to keep 60 fps at 1080p, for a result that differs very little from the versions for other platforms. Warning, the work done is not perfect: interface and cutscenes are fixed at 1080, but some game objects are rendered at different resolutions as needed to keep the frame rate stable, so occasionally you notice a drop in detail of the fighters while they shake hands. The result obtained, however, remains extraordinary on Switch. On the other hand, it is more difficult to evaluate the quality of online: there is no shortage of players on the servers at launch, and we have faced several games without problems, yet the situation seemed slightly more unstable than on the other consoles, there were problems in the initial stages, and it is difficult to predict how it will develop. We are optimistic given that currently everything seems pretty solid, but upheavals can always happen in this field.", "date": "2018-09-30", "grade": "9.0"}
