{"name": "N++", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/153786-n-la-via-del-ninja.html", "text": "Similarly to what happens for most of the titles for mobile systems, browser games in Flash are generally considered ~B Series~ products by hardcore users, although there are some exceptions capable of shaking even the most intransigent gamer. Just think of the beautiful Alien Hominid, the spark that made The Behemoth's masterpieces blossom, and N, a title launched in 2004 with a resounding success due to its excellent gameplay and very high difficulty. The game was so appreciated that a few years later it was translated and evolved with additional features in the N+ variant on Xbox 360, which later also landed on PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS. Seven years after the last iteration, welcomed by critics and the public, the Canadian developers of Metanet Software, a small software house based in Toronto made up of only three members (a programmer and two designers), have decided to bring exclusively on PlayStation 4 the definitive vision of your idea, baptized if necessary with the name of N++. Metanet Software brings exclusively to PlayStation 4 the latest iteration of the famous saga N Death traps Ten years of development dedicated basically to the same concept are not at all few for an independent production, yet the idea born by Mare Sheppard and colleagues was so simple and brilliant as to guarantee a rosy and incredibly long-lived future. The secret of the N saga lies in the very fluid gameplay, whose inertial dynamics in combination with a skilful level design have made it one of the standard-bearers of the most ruthless modern hardcore gaming. The general difficulty is in fact extremely high, where manual dexterity, experience and a marked gift for practically instantaneous problem solving are essential skills to get the better of the most difficult levels. Like the excellent Super Meat Boy, N++ is a classic high-precision puzzle/platform game where you control a ninja with an ephemeral life; its accelerated metabolism, the source of exceptional feral reflexes, grants it only one minute and thirty seconds of life, a breath that can be slightly prolonged by just two seconds for each golden piece that can be recovered. The aim of the game, which includes levels embedded in a fixed screen, is to activate the exit door by touching the appropriate switch and reach it before time runs out, perhaps hoarding all the gold scattered on the map. That's right, that's all. But between saying and doing, as the adage indicates, there is a sea in the middle, in this case full of the most ruthless, sneaky and very modern ninja-killing traps that game designers can imagine. The control system is very simple, given that in addition to the direct control over the movements of the character, delegated to the left analog stick of the DualShock 4, there is only the jump button, or the X. You can climb the walls and perform different types of jumps based on the pressure on the button and the inclination of the surface you touch; the only other key involved in the game, beyond the triggers and the backbones useful for managing the various menu tables, is the triangle, dedicated to instant suicide, a necessary feature in case you remain trapped, fail to collect desired gold or for some reason it was impossible to continue. The traps, as specified, in addition to falling into the abyss represent the main obstacle to victory, and among new additions and old acquaintances in N ++ there are many. In fact, we find mines, missile launcher turrets, probes equipped with machine guns and sniper rifles with motion sensor, drones that ~hook~ to the sight and hunt down the character, laser beams and even generators of deadly clones, which replicate the moves made by the player and instantly kill if touched. There is also a whole series of objects with a dual function such as lifts and trampolines, often useful for achieving the objectives but sometimes also implemented as very dangerous traps. By mixing all the ingredients, the Canadian developers have pulled the beauty of 2,360 levels out of the hat (you read that right), an impressive number that can be further enriched thanks to the very practical editor included in the package. Although the game has not yet officially released at the time of writing, there are already many that can be downloaded through the appropriate menu, supported by an effective filter that divides them into categories, such as Best, Top of the week, Most difficult, Made by friends and so on. The levels are divided into so-called episodes, each consisting of five scenarios whose dThe difficulty varies from Easy to Very Very Very Hard for a total of eight nuances, as pointed out by the developers in an interview on the PlayStation Blog. Continuing in the game, new episodes relating to the three available macro grids are gradually unlocked, namely Intro, in which the basic dynamics are introduced, N++, the beating heart of the exclusive PlayStation 4 and Legacy, where there are the best levels translated from various versions of N and N+. There are three game modes in all and they are significantly different from each other: Solo represents the main experience and offers the largest number of levels, while Coop is designed for two-player local multiplayer but can be tackled by up to four, proposing a peculiar vision of puzzles where sometimes it may be necessary to sacrifice one of the players to continue. Finally, Race, which can also be played by up to four, is made up of a series of more fluid stages basically dedicated to speed and elegance in the execution of jumps, where of course the aim is to set the best time and obviously beat one's own opponents. Playstation 4 trophies A total of 27 Trophies are available in N++, divided into 12 bronze, 7 silver, 7 gold and one platinum. Among the basic ones we find objectives such as exploring some menus, watching replays and dying a certain number of times, while the silver ones begin to embrace completing part of the episodes and obtaining certain objectives without dying. The gold Trophies are basically linked to the conquest of the entire columns of episodes (Intro, Legacy and N++) while the Platinum one is related to the unlocking of all the others. Poor art As is the case in many independent titles, the technical sector can play a secondary role, and in N ++, as well as in its predecessors, it is certainly the least sought after aspect. That doesn't mean it's poorly done or sloppy, it just doesn't set out to wow the player, but it's totally meant to be in service of the gameplay. The graphics offer a handful of colors on the screen and the design of platforms and enemies evokes the 8 and 16 bit era, while the animations of the stylized ninja are particularly accurate, who can die in many different ways and with physics applied to the individual parts of the body really delicious. Speaking of the color palette, initially it is possible to use different presets, but as you progress in the game many more are unlocked. It must be said that the basic setting, called Vasquez and oriented towards gray, from our point of view is the best one and the one that tires the eyes less; in fact, there are some, such as the Wizard, with too bright colors that quickly disturb the view and do not help with the dynamics of the gameplay. The soundratck, on the other hand, is good, consisting of about six hours of electronic music perfectly blended with the spirit of the title. Unlike the Xbox 360 version of N+, online multiplayer is missing, removed from the package because, according to the developers, it wouldn't fit perfectly with the game style, where a little lag is enough to significantly ruin the experience. After all, there were several negative feedbacks in this sense precisely for the iteration on the penultimate Microsoft flagship.", "date": "2015-07-28", "grade": "8.5"}
