{"name": "Bomberman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bomberman_a.html", "text": "Who doesn't know Bomberman? It is a very particular puzzle game, in which you put yourself in control of a robot capable of releasing time bombs, which must ~solve~ each stage by eliminating the enemies inside. Over time, the original mechanics have been refined with the addition of upgrades that allow us to increase the range of bombs, the number of bombs that can be placed at the same time but also to use bombs that detonate on command. Very often we have to fight our way through walls and obstacles before meeting opponents, and time well so as not to end up burned by our own weapons! This latest incarnation of the classic Hudson Soft, which is not new to portable reductions, offers us a very faithful version of the original title together with a modern reinterpretation, called ~Bomberman Supreme~. Choosing the first translates a bit into a dive into the past: the game is exactly the same, from the graphics to the speed of movement, and will only delight nostalgics. The Supreme version, on the other hand, differs in a number of elements: the stage does not scroll and fills the screen in its entirety, but above all it is possible to use the collected objects in a more rational way than in the classic Bomberman, depending on the selected difficulty level. The game includes a fun multiplayer mode via bluetooth for two people, which can really create exciting games if both players are fans of the series. The technical implementation of this mobile Bomberman is average. The original game is reproduced quite faithfully in terms of graphics, while the Supreme version is much more colorful, with more detailed sprites and a large number of animated elements. Of course, animation in general is not the strong point of this product, given that the protagonist and his enemies move rather jerkily and slowly. The sound consists of some music that does not shine for variety, while the control system is immediately simple and immediate, with the joystick assigned to the movement of the character and the FIRE button (or the 5 key of the numeric pad) to release the bombs. A note of merit for the multiplayer, which works quite well.
