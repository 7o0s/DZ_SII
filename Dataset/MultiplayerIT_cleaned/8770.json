Perhaps linked to an inferiority complex compared to the big franchises on home and portable consoles, the phenomenon has led on the one hand to an invasion of remakes of old classics, most of the time badly adapted, on the other to the proliferation of games which, despite being unpublished, bring to mind the glories of the past. Some examples may be Final Freeway, a guide title clearly inspired by OutRun, or Minotron: 2112, Jeff Minter's psychedelic shooter based also inspired in the title by the cult Robotron: 2084, but the latest addition is titled Star Marine: Infinite Ammo, scrolling shoot 'em that has earned a warm place in the spotlight for its obvious similarities with the historic Contra. But will it be enough to make a good game out of it? Freemium at heart From the first minutes, GlitchSoft's game presents itself as a carnival of clichs of the sci-fi genre. In fact, the player plays an all-muscle Star Marine, kidnapped and tortured by an army of aliens whose intent is to take control of the human race and conquer the planet Earth. Clearly the sinewy protagonist doesn't fit and decides to flee and exterminate, without any help, all the annoying invaders. It must be said that the development team has clumsily attempted to make the action more believable by staging a rebellion by humans, but unfortunately this boils down to a few seconds encounter with a female character who is totally useless both for the plot and for the gameplay . When it's not trying to boast a clumsy narrative, Star Marine is exactly what you'd expect from a Contra-like shooter, with the player jumping from platform to platform and shooting in 8 directions. As new enemies are introduced, and soon you find yourself facing hordes of aliens, turrets, flying insects and converted humans, a potpourri quite varied but which never really proves capable of offering an interesting challenge. On the other hand, the discussion with the end-of-level bosses is different, not always up to par but still able to break up the action with more or less massive battles. Thanks also to a lively and well-finished graphic component, the flagship of a game that instead limps when, raising the volume of your iPhone, you are bombarded by very lacking sound effects and by guns that emit the same noise as a staple gun. Soon you become familiar with the system of multipliers of your score, which increases as each time you eliminate an enemy, being careful not to spend too much time between one kill and another or, simply, not to be affected. By accumulating points and completing small challenges, you can accumulate gems to spend on a whole series of upgrades, additional lives and weapons, which range from the classic assault rifle to the flamethrower, from an ion cannon to a lightning rifle. Probably in the intentions of the developers, the fair number of firearms and the possibility of upgrading them should have attracted the player's interest and prompted him to replay the same level over and over again, but the truth is that the title is so stingy with gems that it's not unlikely to end the campaign with just one more weapon and a few other upgrades. In fact, after a while it becomes clear how GlitchSoft has tried to exploit and monetize their game in all possible ways, but while you can turn a blind eye to the advertising banner that appears at startup and which refers to another app from the development team, wanting to entice users to use real money to buy new gems is too intrusive a particularity and not very suitable for a game that is already paid for in itself. However, Star Marine's real problem concerns the bad controls, cross of a touchscreen interface that once again finds it difficult to convey the kind of precision and reactivity required by platform sessions: on the small iPhone screen too many times you miss a jump , you shoot empty or are hit by mistake, and in the more advanced levels moments of frustration are not uncommon, it being understood that the game itself remains on levels of difficulty that are never too high.
