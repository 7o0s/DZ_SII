The new production signed by Shu Takumi looks like an action puzzle in which the narrative component is predominant: the player witnesses the unfolding of events, the development of a plot that becomes more mysterious and compelling as new characters appear, so completely passive, as a pure spectator, to then take the reins of the situation and change its development according to need. The protagonist of the game is in fact a ghost with special powers: he can control objects, transfer his ~soul~ inside any shell with a ~nucleus~, travel through telephone lines and, last but not least, control the weather. This last skill of his will be able to make a difference for the characters involved in the story, because thanks to it Sissel (this is the name of the ghost) can interact with the corpses and bring back the time to exactly four minutes before their death. In the eighteen chapters that tell the fascinating plot of Ghost Trick, the mechanism is always the same: we are faced with a mysterious death, we restore time to four minutes before it occurs and we see what chain of events led to that tragic destiny. So we can intervene to avoid it, precisely by moving from one object to another, interacting with the scenario in various ways and triggering situations which, in one way or another, can change the course of fate. Ghost stylus The gameplay of Ghost Trick: Ghost Detective is fundamentally based on two things: the two-dimensional connotation of each scenario, artistically rendered very well, and Sissel's powers. Using the stylus and the touch screen, we can ~drag~ the protagonist's soul from one object to another while we are in ~ghost mode~, i.e. with time completely stopped, to then perform our ~tricks~ (i.e. the control of a certain object) after hand movement is restored. It is clear that we will have four minutes available before the fate of the victim on duty is fulfilled, and we will have to try to make the best use of them. This translates, in some cases, into pure ~trial & error~ sessions to better understand the role of each object in the fate of the characters involved, with ~estimated~ game overs which, however, are only one ~tap~ away from a new attempt. One of the limitations of the game is that there are no different ways to solve the puzzles, but only one; and good old Sissel or whoever will give advice as soon as he sees that we have missed the target a couple of times in a row, a factor which tends to significantly lower the level of challenge. Moving among the inevitable ups and downs of the stages, thus alternating brilliant situations with less brilliant ones, it is however clear that the purpose of the new Capcom production is not at all to put us in difficulty, but to tell us a good story and make us interact in some way with it, until the first light of dawn will not erase a night so full of tragedies and will not clarify the mysteries surrounding Sissel, his friends and his enemies. It's time to resort to some tricks! We can therefore speak of Ghost Trick: Ghost Detective as an ~experience~ that is not necessarily demanding or excessively interactive, but capable of conquering us from the first chapter. Shu Takumi's ability in characterizing his characters and in writing their dialogues (which in the local version are all in Italian) is more unique than rare, and it is no coincidence that it is very reminiscent of the works of Osamu Tezuka, from which the Capcom game designer certainly draws inspiration. The game is therefore pervaded by a sort of ~childish naivety~, and in this sense it is even more effective than Ace Attorney. The downside is inherent in the originality of the gameplay, inevitably limited, not very prone to replayability (like the adventures of Phoenix Wright, after all) and sometimes spoiled by very slow rhythms. However, the artistic component remains extraordinary: the characters enjoy a design worthy of a cartoon, as well as extremely fluid and convincing animations, which blend with the two-dimensional context with great style and with numerous brilliant ideas. The rather numerous settings bring to mind those ~visual puzzles~ in which we need to identify objects in the background, with the difference that in this case the objects can be used to our advantageI. The sound sector, entrusted to Masakazu Sugimori, completes a picture of excellence that enters the ears and ends up remaining there even many hours after the Nintendo DS has been replaced.", "date": "2011-02-02", "grade": "8.4"}
