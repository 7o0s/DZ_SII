We talked about it about a month ago after a test of the almost final version. Let's go back to it now, with the game in stores, to put the pieces together and confirm the good impressions we had on the previous occasion. Divinity 2: Ego Draconis is a solid and entertaining RPG, full of possibilities and strongly action-oriented which, especially on PC, fits into a decidedly rich offer in the last period, not without managing to emerge in some wait. Larian Studios has therefore worked well and, after Risen, Kochmedia manages to bring to Italy a German product that is strong in the Teutonic tradition without adopting its harsher aspects, less sustainable by large users. The Dragon of Rivellon The game world refers to many of the classic canons of fantasy fiction and for complexity, of the premise as well as of its development, it is not approachable to a product like the recent Dragon Age: Origins or even to the already leaner Risen, however managing to intrigue thanks to the controversial relationship that develops with dragons, once able to coexist with humans but today their enemies to the point of making it necessary to found the Dragon Slayers, a group of heroes with mythical powers and strong proximity to their enemies themselves, to the point of being able to take their appearance after a painful process of regression of one's powers and therefore of reacquisition of the same. In short, we start from the end of a journey and return to the world with new perspectives, a particular way of compressing the classic Hero Myth by expanding only its last part. The plot unfolds from these premises and, even without enchantment, manages to maintain itself on more than acceptable standards, very well supported by the possibility of reading non-player characters' minds, at the cost of a given amount of experience, and therefore of learning narrative elements further at times completely ends in themselves, more often aimed at facilitating or deepening the main and secondary quests. Action RPG The experience develops through the usual alternation of missions and growth of one's alter ego, offering a series - indeed not endless - of optional objectives in addition to the mandatory ones; the advice is not to limit yourself to only the tasks necessary to end the adventure, both because the secondary ones are generally well studied and have some crossroads choices - the usual alternation between correct and incorrect behavior - not found elsewhere within of Divinity 2: Ego Draconis, both because a further push in the collection of experience points and therefore in obtaining credits that can be spent to improve oneself, dampens an average difficulty that is not dramatic but still calibrated upwards. The combat system is in real time and uses both the mouse and the classic skill bar, implementing more typically action elements such as dodging and exalting itself thanks to the good variety of different enemies, equipped with a number of different attacks and as many killing methods . The game is fun, is immediate in its basic mechanics and manages to give a certain sense of progression through a classic growth system, which separates the improvement of one's statistics from learning skills. The former cover the usual fields such as strength and dexterity, initially defined through the nice narrated tutorial from which the choice of class also passes, however not binding for subsequent decisions, while the latter refer to the classic canons of the genre, dividing into five branches ranging from learning new offensive and healing spells to techniques with blades and the bow, to which is added a skill-tree of passive skills that reproduces what are the peculiarities of the Dragon Slayers, further improving the statistics of attack or the ability to break into locked chests, just to give two examples. The challenge rate is, as mentioned, high, especially at the beginning, but the sense of progression is well rendered and overall one can be satisfied with the amount of different situations one is faced with, even if the one that is somehow a of the most publicized features, the transformation into a dragon, once achieved is not all that profound; of course, it amuses and offers further variety, but perhaps the good starting point could have been explored further. The right resources The world of Rivellon requires a few tens of hours to be visited in its entirety and is equipped with a good variety of different environments, large independent maps connected by the classic loading and characterized by good care, both for the amount of polygons rendered by Bryo Engine sia for the care taken in giving detail to all surfaces. The beautiful impact, supported by quality lighting and trees well managed by a special middleware, is partially mortified by imperfect optimization, unable with all settings at maximum to keep the frame rate stable at 30 images per second in every situation at 1650x1080, with the test setup, notably requiring lower shadows and anisotropic filtering. There are some bugs, such as a difficult exit from the game and faulty mission triggers, and the interface is not always perfect - especially for the management of markers on the map - highlighting that a little more testing could not have hurt to production. The sound is good but not unforgettable, as is the English dubbing which in the local version is accompanied by fully translated subtitles. On Xbox 360 Divinity 2 is also a nice surprise on Xbox 360, especially since the offer of alternatives is not as vast as on PC. The control system is well adapted, with the 4 main buttons of the pad, to which you can assign magic or white weapon blows, and the digital cross to set the use of potions and various foods. The engine almost never reaches 30fps, but it is always constant, remaining perfectly playable and showing off nice lights and defined textures. The gameplay is reminiscent of classics like Gothic - with a smaller area - and console adventurers are definitely recommended.", "date": "2009-11-18", "grade": "8.0"}
