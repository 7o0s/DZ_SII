This is particularly true as regards the structure, which appears completely unchanged. On the one hand, we have a long and substantial Master League-style career in which we have to face real teams as we build our formation, progressively unlocking new players to assign to various roles replacing the unknown athletes available at the start; on the other a competitive online multiplayer mode for two players, which works well and offers a welcome (as well as necessary!) extra compared to purely single player content. Is the formula still worthy of interest? Surely this is a valid setting, which manages to offer a minimum of challenge right from the start, whereas the aforementioned PES is wrapped up in the need to start from the bottom of the standings, with its asynchronous matches, forcing us to spend a few hours boring victories with tennis scores that there's no way you can skip. However, as mentioned at the beginning, there are no real news and it would have been nice, three years after the last review dedicated to the series, to find some extra modes. Gameplay and technical realization A similar argument can be made with regard to the gameplay: Dream League Soccer 2020 starts from a rather solid base, able to offer good ball physics and guarantee a certain degree of satisfaction when managing to set up an action that closes with a finish to the net, but we had already encountered some limits on which the developers have not worked. There are some blunders in the artificial intelligence, for example, and if certain automatisms go in the right direction (see the snap of the player in control of the ball ), others leave something to be desired (filtering pass) and make the action more cumbersome. The end result remains a valid experience but substantially behind eFootball PES 2020 Mobile, which also remains a better title in terms of touch controls and not a little. It also seems that an attempt has been made to emphasize those freemium mechanisms that aim at monetization: the unlocking new players is a bit slow, coins are needed but above all diamonds, which, however, are only obtained by putting a hand in the wallet. There are some facilities that speed things up, see the advertising trailers, but the problem remains. Dream League Soccer 2020 doesn't support Bluetooth controllers, which is a shame. The touch controls work well on smartphones, less so on tablets: the distance is excessive, the repositioning of the virtual analog stick limited, while the buttons on the right are a bit small. Fortunately, everything works quite well in terms of precision and reactivity, thanks to the presence of light assistances that avoid particular problems in controlling the players. As regards the technical realization, there have been some steps forward but the general aspect of the product does not reaches levels of excellence for detail and animations. The audio sector is always valid, thanks to a fairly varied and well-interpreted commentary in English.", "date": "2020-02-11", "grade": "7.0"}
