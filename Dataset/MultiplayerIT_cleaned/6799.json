And it is this need that drives much independent industry. Many ideas, especially in recent years, have come from small teams whose commitment, in the absence of large technical departments to take care of, has been entirely spent on refining the mechanics, balance and stylistic component. Examples abound on any platform with pearls such as Braid, Faster Than Light and Superbrothers which are flanked by lesser-known but not to be overlooked titles such as Fract OSC and Synapse. All games that, with the help of a suggestive soundtrack, are capable of arousing emotions, activating the player's neurons and generating intense atmospheres despite the obvious limits in terms of economic investment. The same, at least looking at the concept, we can say for Dungeon of the Endless, an interesting hybrid between roguelike and tower defense. Dungeon of the Endless reminds us that colonizing space is no brainer Colonists on the loose The prison vessel Success is bound for the planet Auriga Prime with a cargo of inmates convinced that working in an alien and dangerous world is still preferable to incarceration. But arriving at your destination turns into a nasty surprise. Powerful planetary defenses welcome and bring down the Success whose computer is just in time to release the automatic lifeboats. From the debris of one of these emerge two survivors who find themselves facing an immense maze full of alien automatons. It is an underground structure of the outpost of the Endless, an ancient race that colonized the planet in ancient times and left behind mysteries and fearsome defensive systems. And this is how it all begins, in a half-destroyed escape pod and shot from above, where a large energy crystal, the core of the Dungeon of the Endless gameplay, dimly illuminates the walls. To complete a level the fugitives must carry the energy source towards the exit and in order to do so they must find it. Looking at the escape route, they find themselves exploring various rooms that guarantee resources, automatically stored whenever a door is opened, and items to equip. But in accessing new rooms it is possible to unleash hordes of creatures whose objective is to destroy the crystal, adamant until the identification of the exit, and anyone who prevents him from doing so. Some enemies aim directly at the crystal and can be followed without risk even by less resistant characters, others also aim at human targets and to face them head-on you need resistant characters equipped with powerful weapons. This, in essence, is the backbone of the title signed Amplitude which shakes off the puzzle game look typical of tower defense without giving up turrets and micro management. Exploring the levels, in fact, brings to light alien devices which, thanks to the accumulated resources and the power of the crystal, can be activated and specialized in order to guarantee various types of bonuses. The functions include the protection of the heroes present in the area, bonuses to the resources obtained by exploring the rooms of the level and real attacks as in the case of the turrets of the classic tower defense. In essence, the choices are numerous and all have important strategic implications, but the actual upgrade possibilities are extremely limited and it is good to carefully evaluate each choice, even in the case of characters who, once deceased, are lost until the next game. Food, for example, allows us to quickly heal each of our heroes but it is also necessary to raise their level and, consequently, their combat effectiveness. It is obviously up to the player to find an optimal balance and also evaluate the speed of exploration, another important element of the experience. This is because the activation times of the turret modules are not based on turns or timers but on the number of rooms explored. Three doors open and the turret module activates. But opening too many doors in rapid succession could activate too many enemies and that's not the only detail to keep in mind. The cooldown of characters' special abilities is also measured in terms of doors opened. Once the entire level has been explored, in essence, it is no longer possible to regenerate them and this could be a significant problem during the most demanding attacks. A demanding challenge One of the most important elements to effectively deal with the automatons defending the depths of Endless is the assortment of characters that make up our group. At the beginningio of the game we can choose the first two, unless you have unlocked other rescue ships one of which grants four heroes right away, and they all have different characteristics, skills and equipment. Intelligence gives bonuses to upgrades while physical resistance allows a character to tank. Speed, on the other hand, is essential to move quickly, to run in defense of the crystal in the event of an attack, to carry it with fewer problems and to run to the aid of companions in difficulty. The characters can be moved individually or all together but in this case it is good to take into account the speed with which they move. The runner is hardly the sturdiest or best equipped of the bunch and throwing him into the fray in a room full of enemies could be dangerous. Better to use it individually, perhaps to open the doors and escape before the enemies come under. In this way it is possible to obtain resources quickly to upgrade characters and turrets that await in ambush where enemies will pass by shortly. But this is only one of the many strategic possibilities offered by the title Amplitude. For example, to make the most of turrets and special abilities, it is often advisable to divide the heroes but there are also characters designed to benefit from the coexistence of companions and sometimes it is necessary to mess up the tactics to send someone towards the crystal to intercept the enemies who have managed to pass or have appeared in areas not covered by the team. It goes without saying that when the characters to control become four, managing an enemy attack can become quite complicated. Luckily for us, with the clear aim of making these mechanics more manageable, the developers have implemented the pause that allows you to plan and activate the next move when the game is stopped. Furthermore, the possibilities of interaction with the characters are limited. These can open doors and be sent to the next room but placement and attacking is automatic. Instead the cures are entrusted to us and the same goes for the special attacks which are particularly useful in the escape phase. In fact, once the level exit has been found, one of the two heroes must take charge of the crystal by transporting it to the next area. The object is pretty big and slows down the character who, of course, is being attacked by hordes of enemies. At this juncture, all the choices we made during the game are put under scrutiny in a title that between economy, strategy and action offers us a challenge that is divided into three fronts. For this reason, although the interface and the mechanics are extremely intuitive, it is not surprising that the level of challenge of Dungeon of the Endless is quite demanding, even at the minimum level of difficulty. But the high degree of challenge does not seem to produce excessive frustration provided, of course, that you appreciate the game formula and not be frightened by the hard initial impact. Furthermore, to break the pace it is possible to resort to the online cooperative (unfortunately still malfunctioning) and our senses are constantly satisfied by a delightful artistic sector which, while taking refuge in the safety of the cubic pixel art, features well-kept animations and details in quantity. The result is an intriguing setting, full of rooms to be discovered and enhanced by a soundtrack that oozes sci-fi suggestion from every pore. In all of this, the only factor of the gameplay to raise some small doubts is the balance of the experience which presents some problems. The intuitiveness of the gameplay is not supported by a calibrated learning curve and this factor could discourage many players. Furthermore, the procedural generation of the levels brings the exit closer or further away and places the turrets sometimes in the middle of the action and sometimes in peripheral areas, where the only choice is to assign them to give bonuses to resources. But without randomness, the exploration would lose its edge and we are talking about a factor that plays a fundamental role in keeping the player glued to the screen in the absence of a weighty narrative structure. And it is this last element, which if nothing else makes the lack of the Italian adaptation negligible, that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. In fact, apart from the beginning and the ending, a narrative thread is missing to act as a driving element, that extra piece that would have enhanced the excellent atmosphere of Dungeon of the Endless is missing, transforming an excellent title into a complete title.", "date": "2014-10-29", "grade": "8.2"}
