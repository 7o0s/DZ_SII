It was a shame, of course, because some of Wii U's ideas were truly wondrous and some pieces of the games library very respectable. Fortunately with Nintendo Switch the situation has changed completely and now that the biggest concerns of the fans are aimed solely at a line up that is not very pounding in terms of mere releases, it is the same big N that fishes out of the top hat all those deserving titles that passed on the sly due to poor sales of the previous platform. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is perhaps the most symbolic product of the times, a little jewel born almost as if it were an easter egg and then turned into something capable of walking on its own legs. Today we celebrate again the little anthropomorphic with a mushroom head, which arrives on Switch with very few changes and some interesting extra levels. Let's see how much, and if, this new Captain Toad remains an unmissable title for puzzle game fans. From Super Mario 3D World mini game to real game Born as an offshoot of Super Mario 3D World, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker has managed to carve out its own space, bringing to Wii U around seventy beautifully intricate levels to solve. For those who have never had the good fortune to play Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, however, it is enough to know that in small cubic stages, lasting about five minutes each, the player will have to guide the two protagonists through environmental puzzles, levers to pull and enemies to defeat, ingeniously from time to time to discover the most practical way to collect the three diamonds scattered throughout each level, the optional golden mushrooms and reach the coveted Hyper star. The plot is obviously only a superfluous and negligible side dish but still tries, albeit with very little results, to keep the whole gaming experience connected. Exactly like on Wii U then, the episodic idea of the title emerges, divided into three chapters of increasing difficulty. However, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is not one of those games that will kill you with frustration, finding the secrets is not that impossible and since there are no timers or other elements to put you under pressure, you can devote all the time necessary to exploration and resolution riddles, whether you are comfortably lying on the sofa or sitting on a means of transport taking advantage of the portability of Nintendo Switch. And it is precisely in this capacity that Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker manages to give its best, with quick games that follow one another, with the possibility of pausing at any time and with a flick of the mouse. eye that on the Switch screen enhances colorful and atmospheric settings. As far as longevity is concerned, we can easily guarantee you at least five hours of play which can go up exponentially if you want to complete the title 100% and maybe even unlock the brand new Super Mario Odyssey levels, obtainable at the end of the main adventure or simply by passing an Amiibo dedicated to Odyssey to your Switch. The new stages are truly wonderful and, although short and marginal, continue to keep the essence of the game intact. Unfortunately these levels are not added to the previous bonuses on Wii U dedicated to Super Mario 3D World, replacing them completely and leaving the amount of content substantially unchanged: an extra effort, in this sense, could easily have been made. Pleasant and reasoned gameplay Even the gameplay of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker remains identical to the previous version, with little Toad and the beautiful Toadette unable to jump and therefore dependent on the help of the player, who will have to guide them through the cube levels by constantly rotating the view , discovering not only all the little touches of class present in the settings but also the various secret passages and shortcuts that do not catch the eye at first glance. In the portable version, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker also features some puzzles to be solved through the touch screen, such as the need, for example, to rotate knobs by physically moving your finger on the screen: an anachronistic choice which effectively blocks the view, a particularly annoying situation especially in advanced levels, when the rotation of the platforms will not serve you only and exclusively to move panels or change the direction of some elements of the scenario but will indiexpendable to parry incoming blows. On the other hand, the decision to use the joycon as a pointer to interact and touch certain objects in the docked version is even more uncomfortable, a not exactly perfect solution for a puzzle game that still makes timing its trump card. We also didn't like the choice to always leave the pointer clearly visible on the screen, an otherwise minimalist and extremely clean interface element, which distracts and often ruins the magnificent game frameworks: a trifle if you like, but easily avoidable . Technically, however, the porting work was done very well with the canonical 1080p resolution in dock and 720p resolution in portable mode, for a truly excellent visual result. The effects have been improved and even the shadows made more alive thanks to the passage of the clouds in the outdoor levels which obscure part of the view, without however ever going to annoy the player. All enemies also return refreshed by the facelift given by Switch: you will find wonderful Shy Guys waiting for you, the Bullet Bills ready to kill you while you use them to destroy blocks of brick and there are also Goombas and Martelkoopas, with the appearance in some stages of Draggadon, to be defeated with the classic three-phase combat so dear to fans of Nintendo games. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker does not skimp on variety and each level manages to add something new, some original ideas never seen in previous stages, perhaps adding a new type of platform or reinventing itself as a shooter on rails during the sessions with the trolley, to a variety that can't really fail to excite. Finally, the Switch package is closed by the possibility of playing with a friend, unfortunately without having two characters on the screen but with one of the two players engaged in the movement of Toad and Toadette and the other in moving the camera and interactive objects: another pleasant addition, even if not transcendental, of this version.", "date": "2018-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
