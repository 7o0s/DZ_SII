{"name": "Il Gladiatorino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/182081-tiny-gladiators-il-gladiatorino.html", "text": "Few figures condense the sense of combativeness, the uncertain future and the challenge against extreme odds like the gladiator. Well before Ridley Scott and Russel Crowe, its essence was captured by romantic artists to symbolize precisely that vital force, violence and continuous contrast with death that characterize the character with his chosen setting, that arena built to emphasize the primal struggle for survival. Although it can hardly represent good material for Martial's epigrams, Tiny Gladiators resumes - in a small way, as the title itself suggests - some of the basic characteristics of the gladiator, staging a continuous struggle for survival and a constant progression of the protagonist among a thousand dangers and increasingly combative opponents. As is often the case, the epic is all about family and revenge, with our mysterious hero searching for his missing father, for evidently nothing like blood ties can justify such an epic. We therefore find ourselves accompanying their struggles along four vast settings, in a succession of clashes with increasingly powerful enemies within various arenas that take place as a sort of fighting game. The control over the character is practically direct and allows you to move back and forth on the two-dimensional plane, launch attacks with the weapon or rely on the various special abilities, trying to deplete the opponent's energy, with the need to dose the powers due of the classic expectations of the recharge times that intersperse its use. The control interface takes advantage of the classic virtual keys on the touch screen, therefore the feeling is far from the real classic brawlers, but the heat of the battle is still well reproduced and in any case leads to a considerable identification in the armored warrior's shoes . The long road of the gladiator is also littered with battles in Tiny Gladiators Blood like sand The combat in the arena is one of the two pillars of Tiny Gladiators, but it is then the creation and management of the character that represents the most important long-term element, the one that constitutes the support and the push to return to the game after a few games of trial. On the other hand, the dynamics of the clash is somewhat chaotic, therefore the characterizing element is the construction of the fighter with his specific skills. It is possible to choose between various warrior classes, each characterized by specific weapons and different evolution possibilities based on different skills, weapons and armor to be applied. All this is linked to the classic mechanics of the constant progression of the character, with the relative ~grind~ to justify the continuous return to the arena and to the levels already played to increase the experience and the skill points to be assigned to become stronger and stronger. Being a free-to-play, the monetization system with microtransactions fits perfectly into this mechanism, not excessively expensive but still well present, even in the form of invasive advertising to watch in order to get bonuses in addition to the direct purchase of gems from spend on improvements. Nothing different from what is now well established in the mobile market, but those who fail to appreciate these solutions could find the entire Tiny Gladiators setting decidedly annoying. To overcome the inevitable monotony of life in the arena, the game offers several modes that spice up the experience somewhat, with online multiplayer in the global arena and even a resistance mode in a Survival Tower. The graphic characterization is certainly original in its being so grotesque, but in its somewhat rough style it might not meet the tastes of those looking for more refined solutions.", "date": "2017-04-13", "grade": "7.5"}
