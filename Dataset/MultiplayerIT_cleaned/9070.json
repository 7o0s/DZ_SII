In hindsight, the idea is largely borrowed from other products that have previously appeared in the independent sphere, in particular from Elasto Mania, although in the production of RedLynx the emphasis is placed on a decidedly more realistic application of physical forces. Trials HD was a dazzling success in the digital delivery of Xbox 360, so much so as to make the decided change of course in terms of appearance and user represented by this MotoHeroz almost strange, which instead of proposing a simple more of the same turns out to be quite different, albeit fundamentally similar in structure. While the first is rather simple and rough like a typical independent product entirely based on immediate playability, characterized by a tendentially realistic aspect, this new title for WiiWare appears cured from the point of view of graphic characterization and presentation, complete with all those elements extra-playful that combine to frame the brilliant original concept within an appropriate videogame form. There is a crazy story of challenges between runners and funny characters to discover throughout the many levels, simple narrative traces inserted to make the progression in the game more captivating, but that is enough to compact the experience and enhance that aspect that in Trials HD appeared somewhat lacking, that is the setting, which from aseptic and functional - although not without spectacular factors - managed to implement its evolution towards a more characteristic world, linked to an imaginary in this case decidedly imaginative. The pack of modes itself has expanded, while various sub-tracks have been scattered throughout the levels, in order to add to the exploration beyond simply reaching the finish line in the shortest possible time. Applied physics The game mechanics are basically the same as Trials, but in this case expanded to become a sort of platform game based on speed and precision, jumps and landings between ramps, various mechanisms and platforms, all built on the solid foundations of a basic but efficient physics simulation engine. The imprinted speed and the force of gravity combine to modify the behavior and the attitude of the vehicle, which in order to remain controllable, avoiding ruinous falls or rollovers, must be maneuvered with precision by regulating its inclination and regulating the speed, occasionally using special objects able to provide bonuses such as increased jumps, invisibility or other. In this way we find ourselves crossing complex and intricate levels essentially trying to reach the finish line in the shortest possible time, or exploring all the ravines in search of coins and ~ancestor spirits~, or hidden characters to be inserted into a sort of albums, an expedient that extends the longevity of the game by pushing you to travel the same track even several times. The motorbikes have been replaced by bizarre cars similar to dune buggies, but with an extremely varied shape, along the lines of the karts present in the recent Mario Kart chapters, each characterized by different values in terms of weight, grip and speed, resulting in different behaviors in race. Every single maneuver (the launch speed during a jump, the landing angle, or the choice of one path rather than another within a setting) determines substantial variations in the final travel time, and to achieve optimal results - gold medals in single player mode or good placements in the online rankings - it is necessary to refine the sensitivity to the controls to the maximum and strive for convincing performances, although non-perfectionists may find the general level of challenge quite low. As befits an arcade racing game, the game is full of collectable and unlockable elements, such as the aforementioned spirits and cars to be purchased with the collected coins, which extend its duration in single player. It is also possible to play online by participating in various organized events, available for a limited period of time and constantly updated and changed: in this case you do not face another human opponent directly but you challenge each other only through the completion times of the levels, with the only direct confrontation offered by offline multiplayer with split screen, perhaps the most fun mode dellwhole package but also the notoriously less comfortable and easily exploitable one. Bizarre worlds The characterization chosen by RedLynx, in sharp contrast with the dirty and almost dark realism of Trials HD, is cartoonish and humorous, with bright colors and caricatured characters capable of creating a fascinating and very unrealistic world in which to set an absurd story like that about Gene McQuick and his personal challenge against the evil Spider McRally. It might seem like a product more aimed at the youngest or the so-called ~casual~, but it would be an error of evaluation: MotoHeroz is a serious and demanding game if you play it with the right spirit, which requires an expert player to be fully appreciated . It is true that it can be concluded by an average skilled user without too much difficulty, but the charm of the RedLynx title lies entirely in its ability to capture the player in the net of records and performances pushed to the maximum, a feeling amplified by the possibility of comparing the results online. In any case, the colorful and cartoony graphics are more consistent with the absurdity (in the good sense) of a racing game like this, while the crazy characters and dialogues - moreover well translated into Italian - provide a humorous support that enriches the game of character and charisma, completing - together with the various additional modes inserted in support of the original concept and the various collecting possibilities - that complete videogame framework to which the developers wanted to aim with this title and which they have evidently achieved. The scenarios range between different worlds characterized by various elements such as forests, ice, deserts and more that help to vary the experience within the numerous levels and although the graphics in general are rather simple they always maintain an excellent quality level, also considering the WiiWare standards.", "date": "2011-09-23", "grade": "8.8"}
