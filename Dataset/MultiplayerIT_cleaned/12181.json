{"name": "UNO Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/uno-challenge.html", "text": "The original version of UNO was created by Merle Robbins in 1971 and was later successfully released by Mattel. It is played with special cards distributed among several players, the first and only aim is to finish the cards of one's deck before all the others. We will have 7 available, the others will remain in a distribution group or will create the waste pile. When it's his turn, each participant in the challenge must discard a card that has either the same number or the same color as the one already on the table, in the absence of one of these two types he will have to draw one. When he finds himself with only two cards, when discarding the penultimate one he will have to inform the other players by saying the word UNO. This is the traditional game in a nutshell, which in its version for the mobile phone market faithfully reflects it. With the necessary differences, obviously it will not be necessary to shout UNO but it will be enough to highlight this possibility on our keypad (with key 1). If a player does not call UNO, whoever follows him can in turn challenge him, thus penalizing the first player by 2 cards. Then there are special cards that make the game exciting, by skipping the next opponent's turn, reversing the round of distribution, the joker that allows you to choose the color with which to continue playing or the penalizing one that hits the next competitor with 4 more cards. The title provides the possibility to choose an avatar and play against three other opponents guided by the A.I. or with people of flesh and blood; we can say without fear of denial that unfortunately competing against the computer in games of this genre is quite depressing, since everything that makes the challenges between friends unforgettable is missing, resulting in a fairly monotonous experience. The multiplayer mode is present and is resolved in the simple practice of ~pass the phone~, or the passage of the phone to each of the human players (up to 4). The technical realization, however elementary, is acceptable even if certainly not electrifying, especially as regards the features of the avatars. The screen shows our cards, the other players and their number of aces up their sleeve; nothing to say instead for the interface that does its job in an excellent way, making everything clear and immediately accessible.
