The Jedi Knights, in addition to being a romantic mystical/religious order of guardians of the Republic, exploited some powers of this energy to influence people and join the same cosmic essence becoming more precise than any computer and any weapon. In recent years, also thanks to the changing trends, the Force has become something less and less mystical and more practical, to the point of transforming the Jedi warrior monks into a sort of congregation of Marvel-like superheroes and their Sith antagonists into a host of villains to the X-Men The Last Stand. The powers themselves have become increasingly destructive and pyrotechnic, leading to somewhat ridiculous performances (at least for fans) resulting in the painful pinball of senate seats between Yoda and the Emperor in the final chapter of the second film trilogy. May the effort be with you Star Wars The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition, which arrived on PC at the same time as the ~renewed~ edition for consoles (where it was already released in 2008) seems to treasure the new vision of the Force, revealing itself, based on the points of view, the last action or the first dedicated platformer in the world conceived by George Lucas 32 years ago. As most of you already know, the game puts us in the role of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, committed to completing a series of missions on behalf of the old Black Helmet that will make him contact the newly formed Rebel Alliance, giving the player the possibility of finishing the game in two different ways, one of which will lead the apprentice to defeat Vader (thank goodness he was the supreme chosen one of the Force, beating him now seems like the national sport) and the Emperor. Furthermore, in the Ultimate Sith Edition there are additional levels (let's say that on consoles they are to be considered additional, on PC the game arrived directly like this) among which the reconstruction of the battle of Hoth stands out, complete with a duel against Luke Skywalker! Regardless of the setting, the levels are rather similar in structure excessively linear and will require an excessive use of the Force to be traversed. Also thanks to the implementation of the excellent havock physics engine it is in fact possible to knock down doors (launching energy waves, complete with pose), lower ramps, move objects to create makeshift ~stairs~, or reach levers and buttons out of reach of the player. Once more elements of the scenario have been moved, it will be possible to move on to the phase of jumping between one and the other until reaching the following stage and so on until the end of the game. Enemies obviously abound between one platform and another: their presence however seems accessory, both because we now discover that laser pistol shots do less damage than a fall to the ground, and because of one of the worst AI ever conceived in a video game, which sees opponents (be they imperial, rebels, droids or bandits) launch themselves to massacre without the slightest logic and without even attempting an offensive strategy other than charging a sith head on. However, it cannot be denied that thanks to force and havock it is possible to invent dozens of different ways to exterminate the poor infantrymen: they can be slammed into the walls like pinballs, pushed into precipices, thrown away or hit with any element of the scenario; in fact, it is possible to kill opponents with sheer force, without even drawing the lightsaber. There is no shortage of end-of-level bosses, usually jedy (but also superdroids or assault vehicles) they require a greater number of hits and bumps to be defeated: once reduced close to death, a sequence will activate in which you will need to click on quickly press the superimposed keys to see a short movie that will show the method chosen to end the life of the enemy on duty. It may not look good but it lacks nothing... On the graphic component of The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition it is necessary to say a few words: if from a general point of view this does not disappoint, reproducing excellent environments, both open and closed, overflowing with details (among other things almost all interactable with the use of powers), in the single three-dimensional models there is a terrible basic repetitiveness, since they are reduced to asingle model by type. The animations, decidedly successful, and the special effects, from smoke to explosions, passing through the disintegrated bodies against a laser welder, compensate for the defect. However, the absurd hardware requests (which lead to the ridiculous request for 25GB of hard disk space) are not justified, just as the long loading times and the various slowdowns to which the game was subject at various times during the test are not forgivable. On the other hand, the background music is spot on, drawn with both hands from the original ones of the film saga, while the quality of the dubbing of the voices is revealed to be a bit fluctuating, with recitations that in some cases do not do at all honor to the fame of our country in the field ( it must be said that the characters are so stereotyped that they do not give any stimulus either to those who dub them or to those who listen to them). It is possible to unlock a long series of additional contents, which should, in theory, increase the replay value of the title. Apart from the holocrons, from which you can access new powers and force combos (don't believe the similar RPG system included, the level up is an end in itself, as is the enhancement of powers) the real treasure is represented by dozens of different costumes, which essentially turn out to be real additional models: in fact, it is possible to play as almost all the characters not only of the game, but also of the saga (from Luke to Boba Fett!). The choice is yours whether to take this addition as a good reason to try the title several times; however, there are those who have not managed to finish it just once without getting frustrated first.", "date": "2010-01-04", "grade": "6.2"}
