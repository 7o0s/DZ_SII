{"name": "A proposito di Harry", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108036-pitfall-a-proposito-di-harry.html", "text": "After his debut in 1982, the adventurer Harry Pitfall did not have much luck: the series has established itself as one of the cult of those years, but Activision has not been able to effectively re-propose it in a modern key. The latest incarnation of the franchise dates back to 2004, on PlayStation 2 (maybe take a look at our review to get an idea) and, while presenting many pleasant aspects, it did not boast a thickness and quality comparable to those of the best action adventure for the Sony platform. Eight years later, Pitfall! returns to the gaming market, this time trying the road of the App Store and, therefore, of mobile devices. For the occasion, the publisher has entrusted the development to a new internal team, The Blast Furnace, which has transformed the platform mechanics of the original game into a Temple Run-style running game, therefore with a three-quarter view from above and the character who must jump, slide and move along the path to avoid traps of various types, survive the attack of dangerous predators and cover the greatest possible distance while, behind him, the scenario is devastated by a massive volcanic eruption. The introductory sequences of Pitfall! they recall those of 1982, but as soon as we touch the screen we discover that it is a portable video game with which the adventurer Harry Pitfall is experimenting. Just then, in the distance, the top of a volcano explodes, leaving the character little chance of salvation other than to launch into a furious race through the forest, caves and villages to reach a safe place. The adventure continues At the beginning of each game you have to undergo a sort of short tutorial that shows the action with an unprecedented lateral shot and has the aim of making us quickly become familiar with the gestural controls, which however are the ones we know well: a slide swipe up results in a jump, down in a slide, left or right to change direction at a ~jump~, while tilting the device allows us to run to one side or the other of the path to pick up any items. A small change compared to the traditional Temple Run gameplay is represented by the predators that we occasionally find in our path, and which must be eliminated with a quick tap of the screen: Harry will take out the whip and, with a snap, he will knock them out. Too bad that in this situation the touch is not always understood correctly, which translates into a loss of half of the vital energy (we can resist two assaults, where it is enough to collide against an obstacle to incur the game over), especially when the pace rises and reaction times become essential to survive. The developers have focused a lot on the technical aspect of this remake, in particular on the variety of scenarios that alternate as we run: we will first see a thick forest, then villages with passable wooden structures, then caves full of traps and the traditional ditches to be overcome by attaching ourselves to a liana. Our character ~grows~ as we grind meters between games, leveling up and unlocking upgrades that can help us set new distance records. Finally, by getting hold of some coins, it is also possible to continue a race from where we left off, debunking the taboo of a ~survival~ structure which in fact needs an update. In conclusion, Pitfall!'s graphics are really excellent, with great attention paid to the animations and the aforementioned camera changes, which make the action even more spectacular.", "date": "2012-09-06", "grade": "7.0"}
