Alex ~Horley~ Orlandelli: What's interesting is the difference in how I work when I go from Magic to WarCraft. In the first case, subject to simple guidelines for each illustration, the artist could be very flexible. Blizzard is much more demanding, since it has to maintain consistency with the video game, so you have to find different ways to make something personal. Multiplayer.it: What exactly are the typical indications you receive and how do you rework them in a personal way? Alex ~Horley~ Orlandelli: Typically we are provided with snapshots of the game from various angles and detailed descriptions of the important characters. However, it is up to the artist to find the right combination of elements for the illustration. For example, in one of the unreleased cards I made, the only explicit request was for a druid in panther form. The attention obviously had to focus on the tear caused by his claws, so I chose to insert an Orc as a victim, because thanks to his green skin I would have obtained the best blood contrast. Interview with Alex Horley, alias Alessandro Orlandelli Multiplayer.it: What techniques do you use to work? What formats/materials? Alex ~Horley~ Orlandelli: I only use traditional techniques for drawing and painting, no computer or airbrush. The format is quite variable, depending on the type of illustration, usually smaller than an A4 sheet. The originals you see are painted on cardboard. Multiplayer.it: What did you like most about this collaboration with Blizzard? Alex ~Horley~ Orlandelli: I really love natural subjects, I'm more a fan of fantasy than science fiction. In this sense, I really liked the lush and colorful setting of WarCraft, with its jungles, animals and fantastic creatures. Multiplayer.it: So I guess this will be a long term collaboration! Alex ~Horley~ Orlandelli: Definitely. Not only are we already making cards for future editions of the game, but I've also been commissioned to design the cover for the third expansion box. It should be out in time for San Diego Comic-Con, so this summer. Interview with Alex Horley, alias Alessandro Orlandelli Multiplayer.it: A third set of cards between now and summer 2007? Does that mean we can expect at least four expansions a year for the WarCraft card game? Alex ~Horley~ Orlandelli: I don't know exactly, but it's very likely. From what I've seen we work very much in advance and pay great attention to planning. Multiplayer.it: Are there other Italian artists involved in the making of these cards? Alex ~Horley~ Orlandelli: Yes, other Italian artists participated, such as Luca Zontini and Daniele Orizio. Hail to the dork! Rarely products such as role-playing games and trading cards, which are essential ingredients for the healthy diet of a self-respecting geek, find space on the electronic pages of Multiplayer.it. However, if the latest release of Upper Deck Entertainment (famous for the success of its games dedicated to Yu-Gi-Oh! and Marvel and DC superheroes) affects the world of WarCraft, the question inevitably becomes our competence. During the Leipzig Game Convention we had a very brief look at the TCG (Trading Card Game) dedicated to the famous Blizzard MMORPG. We had obtained a small preview full of impressions that we advise you to read, but about three weeks after the ~official~ release in stores, the time has come to give a slightly more structured judgment. We will try not to be too wordy it was already too difficult to get away from the gaming table and start writing The Tower of Babel In case you're wondering, the World of WarCraft card game speaks English, French and German, while Petrarch's language is not among the languages chosen for the launch of the game. An apparently momentary situation, because at the end of a chat with the Upper Deck staff (concomitant with the greedy interview granted to us by Alex Horley) we discovered that Blizzard itself will not authorize the Italian localization of the card game until there is a ~canonical~ version of the MMORPG itself, original matrix to which every reference of its playful-paper progeny must infallibly and coherently refer. An eventuality that does not seem too distant in time, given that the opinion is that a local version of the TCG will have to come out sooneror later (as vaguely implied by one of the information brochures we received). WoW in Spanish was released a few months ago is Italy next? Inside the box The beautiful starter deck in DVD packaging Let's start with the starter decks, i.e. the essential basic kits from which to start playing. The plural is not accidental: there are several variations, since there are 9 character classes that it is possible to interpret. The selection of the 30 cards included therefore varies greatly, but unfortunately it is not possible to identify the nature of your starter deck from the packaging. since the covers are all identical. For example, our first deck was evidently Alliance-themed and offered us Hero cards such as Hunter, Mage and Warrior, with an optimal choice of cards for the latter. If your intention was to start from a Warlock Undead, therefore, curb the initial enthusiasm and know that your highly specialized choice could cost you a lot of preliminary exchanges and purchases before being put into practice. The two types of booster packs, Horde and Alliance The starter deck also includes two common booster packs to ~unwrap~, each containing 15 cards, for a total of 60, the minimum amount for a ~legal~ deck. It is obvious that once the 30-card ~training~ deck has been set aside, before integrating it with the contents of the included boosters, several others will have to be purchased, without forgetting to proceed with the exchange ritual. Although the high specialization of one's choice of faction and class decidedly limits the quantity of cards for us interested - thus encouraging bartering - on the other hand it means that on a 15-card booster, excluding the neutral ones, it will be difficult to find more than three or four useful for our purposes. In conclusion, building competitive monothematic decks could prove to be a little longer (and expensive) than we are used to doing with Magic, but the prospect of assembling a party of players, each with their own specific class-deck, makes it all seem a decidedly interesting and original flavour. We are obviously referring to the ~Raid~ game mode, which should see the light soon, with the release of the deck dedicated to Onyxia in shops. Very little is known about it, apart from the basic regulation, but it has all the smell of being one of the most radical innovations in this field. We'll see. In addition to the deck and boosters, the starter deck also includes a colorful and explicit instruction manual and three ~jumbo cards~ of three different Heroes. Almost twice the size of a normal card, these are simply optional aesthetic frills, but they are definitely the most worthy way of representing our main character on the table... the respective oversized illustrations make a good impression. Inside the box However, the starter deck packaging itself is perhaps the most captivating element of the entire purchase: made of high quality plastic and with one of the usual splendid artworks on view, it boasts the same dimensions as a DVD case, except being three times larger thick. A solid, heavy and pleasant to hold ~block~, which enhances the purchase and digs an abyss compared to the pathetic cardboard boxes in which competing card games are marketed. Inside then, under a mobile transparent plastic lid inserted on the spine of the package, there are two compartments able to comfortably contain 30 cards each (that is, a legal deck of 60 copies). Unfortunately this only applies to ~loose~ and unwrapped cards, which is in itself a heresy for any enthusiast aware of how cards ~destroy~ after a few shuffling procedures. It is probable that in the end the good old rubber bands and the custom homemade boxes will remain the most popular means of transporting the decks, but the fact remains that the packaging is a gem of absolute first floor, of undoubted value for the collector and setting a new standard for this product category. Distillate of fun Bored? So let's talk about the actual game. Don't expect technical analysis: we're convention players, not tournament players, and our favorite stage is still a friend's table laden with chips. What we want to do is capture the concept of the game and describe it to you in a few lines. One of the characteristic mechanics that we had previously noticed was the total absence (like the previous Upper Deck games that used the Versus System) of the concept of ~Mana Curve~, or Mana Curve: there are no cards specifically dedicated to resource gathering - with the optional Quest exception, utili, however, to the rotation of the deck itself. Any card can be used to gather resources by simply playing it face down and ignoring its contents. Consequently, the dreaded mana flood and mana screw/drought phenomena that have always afflicted Magic clones are nothing more than a distant memory and the classic problem of being able to draw a ~land~ at the right time is replaced by the dilemma of which card to sacrifice as a resource and which card to keep in the hope of being able to play it in the future. Let's sum up Being a practically impeccable product with great attention to every detail, if we had wanted to rate the game, an eight or a nine would have been well deserved. Of course, there was a particular care to design it in such a way as to push the consumer to compulsive buying right from the start (not being able to choose the starter deck of one's favorite class really didn't go down well), but after all, whatever collectible card game inevitably turns into a debt, so we might as well start at a good pace and get used to it immediately. More simply therefore, we prefer to advise you to try it and let yourself be infected, as it will inevitably happen. Enjoy and don't miss our interview with Alex Horley on the following page, an extremely talented and likable artist who it was an honor to meet. After all, statistically equalizing a deck of just fifty cards has never seemed a particularly intelligent or meaningful activity and if on the one hand this ~revolution~ linearizes the game and makes some classic deck building tactics useless, on the other makes the game more immediate, less random and more focused on the planning and combat phase. The ~flesh and blood~ presence of the opposing player's avatar, in fact, adds a whole new tactical dimension: one might wonder, why bother attacking enemy Allies when we can aim directly at the Hero's head and close the game? In reality, the possibility of attacking the Hero or his companions almost always translates into the need to do both in order not to leave flanks uncovered and in this sense this first set of cards seemed very ~round~ and well balanced, with combos not particularly abstruse, but which still allow you to easily overturn an apparently one-way game. The same combat mechanism then presents its small dose of innovation: in particular, in the offensive phase, not only the attacker must declare which characters to face us with, but also identify the respective targets (other Allies, or the opposing Hero). Unlike Magic, Game of Thrones, and most other CCG/TCG analogues you can think of, where it's almost always the defender who decides which of his minions to counter enemy challenges with, now it's the attacker who has to find the respective ideal combinations to make the most of the individual traits of their cards. There are obviously exceptions to the rule: characters with the Elusive skill cannot be declared the target of an attack, while those with Protector can vice versa decide to intercept an enemy attack. In general, the use of cards tries to faithfully follow the idea behind the video game character classes, both as regards Heroes and Allies: Warriors protect and take blows, Hunters strike from afar while remaining safe, Druids are a paradigm of versatility and so on. These are not the only references to the video game: words relating to Talents and Professions stand out on the cards of the Heroes, although for the moment only used as a requirement for some types of equipment (or completely ignored). Most of these elements will be explored in subsequent expansions and the impression one gets is that beyond its manifest simplicity and elegance, the game hides many unexpressed potentials waiting to be revealed. We close with a curiosity relating to the ~rarity~ index of the cards: generally in games of this genre, the latter are divided into the ~Common~, ~Uncommon~ and ~Rare~ categories. World of Warcraft, following the sown of the video game, also introduces the ~Epic~ and ~Legendary~ categories, attributing to each the symbol of the proverbial corresponding color that every gamer will recognize, i.e. white, green, blue, purple and orange. Legendary cards in particular (aka Loot Cards) are particularly hard to come by and there are only four types in this set. Nothing particularly exciting in terms of gameplay (these are simply rarer versions of al", "date": "2006-11-14", "grade": null}
