Leader of the Dead Echo, a team of skilled space mercenaries, condemns his companions to a life of wanted men when he unilaterally decides to declare war on General Sarrano, guilty of having exploited the group to do his dirty work without ever telling him the truth about their targets . Years later, completely drunk, he comes across Sarrano's flagship with his spaceship and decides to launch a kamikaze attack against it, again involving his team and refusing to flee as instead suggested by his friend Ishi. The latter is seriously injured in the crash that brings the vessel to the surface of the planet Stygia: the only possibility of saving him is to graft him with cybernetic implants with associated artificial intelligence, an operation that miraculously succeeds but at the end of which Grayson and Ishi they find themselves to be the only Dead Echo still alive. In short, engaged in a manhunt together with a cyborg who sometimes lets himself be overwhelmed by his own circuits and becomes intractable, in the seven chapters that make up the single player campaign of Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition we will have to make our way through decidedly inhospitable scenarios, facing hordes of savages, mutants and federation soldiers who survived the impact. Bulletstorm is still a very good game today, but the Full Clip Edition costs too much for what it offers The rifle as a brush Bulletstorm still has a lot to say, although six years have passed since its debut on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Developed by People Can Fly under the aegis of Epic Games, this determining factor for the realization of many aspects of the production, the game stands as a sort of first-person Gears of War, focusing strongly on ultra-violence, vulgar humor and imaginative killings; so much so that, in hindsight, it would have been nice to be able to exploit this system for a return of Duke Nukem much more dignified than the one seen in Forever. Gearbox Software probably realized it too, and that's why they wanted to release the Duke Nukem's Bulletstorm Tour DLC, which allows you to replay the campaign as the Duke but which was not natively included in the remaster, in itself already rather expensive: a really questionable choice, if we consider that it is the only real novelty of the package beyond the technical upgrade. However, we were talking about the gameplay: by taking up different types of weapons, we will have an enormous variety of ways to eliminate enemies. Limiting ourselves to shooting them is an option that we will tend to discard after a few minutes: better to kick them and riddle them on the fly, or throw them against one of the many walls full of spikes, a giant cactus, exposed cables or a huge fan. To carry out this maneuver, all we have to do is throw a stomp at the opponent on duty and watch him float in stasis, creating a bullet time that is as spectacular as it is satisfying in its many, very painful outcomes. From the first chapter of the campaign we will also be able to count on a magnetic noose that catches enemies even behind cover and sends them towards us, ready to welcome any type of bullet we want to insert into their bodies. Or maybe, why not, we could kick them back, towards an explosive barrel or to the bottom of a precipice. It is in these brilliant, very bad ideas that the best of Bulletstorm stands out, so much so that from the main menu it is possible to access a mode, Echo, entirely built around the ringing of stylish kills from the point of view of the high score, with leaderboard and all the rest. The points that are earned by eliminating enemies, and which multiply if we do it in an imaginative way, can be used with support units located within the maps, in order to buy not only ammunition for the weapons we already have, but also upgrades for magazine capacity and the release of ~loaded shots~, alternative fire modes that not all rifles are equipped with, but which allow you to unleash truly devastating attacks: the closure of a picture of excellence as regards the gunplay of the People Can Fly title. Blood canvas The Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition campaign does not include new levels compared to the original edition and is completed within a good seven hours, however leaving us with a certain desire to replay it (perhaps in Overkill mode, in practice a New Game +). The outline is represented by the aforementioned Echo mode and a cooperative multiplayer for four players, in which we will have to face increasingly numerous and implacable hordes of enemies within dode different maps. In short, nothing transcendental, but the single player sector can give more than one emotion and has a fast, engaging rhythm, with truly spectacular sequences, a great variety of situations and a few but intense boss fights. Then there is obviously the discourse linked to the remastering work, in some ways satisfactory but in others less so. Upgraded from the original Unreal Engine 3 to the much more powerful Unreal Engine 4, Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition runs on our test configuration at a very stable 4K and 60 frames per second, keeping v-sync activated and all effects maxed out, in keeping with but of rather generic and superficial adjustments. Excellent performance, no doubt about it, but the doubt arises that they largely depend on a not exorbitant load. In fact, although the developers have declared that they have improved polygonal models, textures and effects in view of this remaster, frankly it is difficult to identify these innovations: the characters have edges, design defects and ~naivety~ that reveal the age of the assets, as well as there is no shortage of unclear textures in the test of the close-up shot. Instead, the introduction of a new lighting system is evident, capable of dramatically changing the general appearance of the game. The audio sector is perfectly intact, boasting beautiful music and an Italian dubbing that sees an always over the top interpretation by Dario Oppido (Grayson Hunt), assisted by Claudio Moneta (Ishi), Emanuela Pacotto (Trishka) and Gianni Gaude (Sarrano ), the latter very bastard and hilarious during the final stages of the adventure. Too bad for some obvious smudging in the levels.", "date": "2017-04-19", "grade": "7.0"}
