There are strict licenses to abide by (and pay for), fans of all types to please, and technical and time constraints to work around. It is true that no one forces EA and 2K Sports to come out with a new version of their games every year (except, perhaps, investors), but for those who develop the game it must not be easy to carry forward an ever bigger, shinier and, for this reason, cumbersome. This is to say that it is not possible to expect a revolution every year. On the other hand, the sport to be replicated is that and from that point of view you can't invent much, if you don't try to always offer new ways to apply your passion and, why not, push the players to spend time between mode folds and spend a few extra bucks to speed things up. In the review of NBA 2K22 for Xbox Series X|S and PS5 we will see how Visual Concepts for this year has decided to focus on the one hand on creating new and potentially interesting ways to play, and on the other hand on fixing the various weaknesses that have emerged debut on what, a year later, is still considered the new generation of consoles. Those expecting big changes will therefore be disappointed, but that doesn't mean that NBA 2K22 doesn't offer lots of new things to do, as well as some welcome news on the playing field. The gameplay Luka Doncic, the cover man of NBA 2K22 As we said, Visual Concepts has decided for this year - wisely, in our opinion - to stop and fix what wasn't working much in the debut edition of NBA 2K21 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. This means that the incidence of strange animations and anomalous behavior on the playing field is much lower than in years past. Occasionally it will still happen to see movements and bizarre things, but the contacts, animations and interactions between the baskets and the ball seem much more solid and consistent. This has allowed the developers to create a much more physical game, in some respects more realistic than in the past. Getting rid of a marking will be more difficult, as defenders will push and use their body to stop runs or attempts to unmark. This year, moreover, it will not be enough to press like crazy on the trigger of the race to get rid of the opponent. In fact, resistance has been reviewed and divided in two: there is the classic indicator of residual energy, the one that tells us when our alter ego will be placed on the bench to rest, and more situational fatigue, which depends on what it's happening right now. It is a difference that anyone who has practiced sport knows very well: there is a huge discrepancy between the fatigue felt after a sprint and the one felt after playing 4 quarters in a row. From the first professional athletes like those who arrive in the NBA recover in seconds, to recover from the second they too need a period on the bench or even a good sleep. Dirk Nowitzki in NBA 2K22 So far in sports video games only the second type of fatigue has almost always been taken into account. Productions that implemented it well made tired athletes less precise and faster, even more prone to injuries, but nothing else beyond that. With the ball in your hands (or at your feet) you could perform an almost infinite series of dribbles, feints and shots without suffering serious consequences. In NBA 2K22, on the other hand, it almost seems like playing with a hot ball: holding it too much in your hands is equivalent to losing lucidity and more easily making a mistake in dribbling or shooting. In fact, as soon as the ball is received, the pressure of the defense increases, the distances shorten, the doubles and the steal attempts arrive. Dribbling away is not easy, you have to overcome the friction with the opponent's body and the changes of pace are as lethal for the defender's ankles as for those of the attacker. In NBA 2K22 this translates into a clear drop in energy in these situations which, if prolonged, could lead to a blunder or a very small shooting window. The beauty is that, as we said, just go back in defense to catch your breath and you're ready again for a new attack. The positive implications are mainly two: the first is that the pace of the game is decidedly more realistic, less frenetic and based on shooting and on the skills of the basketball player. The second is that the developers have placed more emphasis on team play, blocks and patterns. Without these elements, getting rid of the marking could be very difficult. Curry's dribbling in the NBA2K22 This change, in terms of gamepad sensations in the hand, is quite large, despite the fact that the gameplay and the sport in general are still fundamentally the same. Other small changes are in the management of shooting timing, the addition of new animations for steals and blocks, the introduction of ~quick time events~ to close alley-oops and spectacular dunks and the introduction of many types of passes different, such as delivered in hand and dunk passes, even to be concluded with a peremptory dunk to the basket. The city, a GTA with the ball in segments Some glimpses of The City of NBA 2K22 As per tradition, the MyPlayer mode is the one most cared for by the developers. Also this year Visual Concepts wanted to focus on the creation of a sort of virtual space shared between the various NBA 2K22 players called The City. It's an evolution of the District, and it's a sort of miniaturized GTA where you live and breathe basketball... as well as dozens of other commercial products. In fact, the city of NBA 2K22 is full of advertising, sponsored products, brands. Almost all aimed at the American market, but between beverages, clothing and shoe brands, insurance companies or other, it seems to live in a timeout of the NBA playoffs. This portion of the city is full of secondary activities useful for obtaining new coins, badges and accessories, thanks to a story that no longer develops in a film style, like in past years, but more like a classic video game, with secondary missions and elements of this kind. The evolution of the story and of the character, therefore, are in the hands of the player, with however two obvious downsides. The first is that the narrative is much less strong and memorable than in the past. It's true that the various NBA 2Ks have never managed to tell a story without flaws, but some characters and some situations were memorable nonetheless. Here, however, everything is watered down, if not the intrinsic dislike of MP, our aspiring player/rapper. A character created in NBA 2K22 MyPlayer The second negative point is that it is seen that the City, although Visual Concepts is part of the same group, has not been programmed by Rockstar Games. Although the portion of the map is limited, moving from one point of the city to another is torture, between the too slow and woody character and the various means of transport with questionable physics. Without considering that on Xbox Series X there are sharp drops in frame rate and even several crashes. A nice menu with which to be able to jump from one mission to another without having to go down the street, in order to give those who want to focus only on the story and the evolution of the character the possibility of moving forward without having to ~physically~ move from one place to another would be welcome, a pity that the developers have decided to force us to experience The City, its many spaces and its architectural barriers. This element, moreover, slows down even more the growth of one's avatar. Switching from one activity to another, useful for accumulating more VC or earning some special badge, takes so many minutes just to reach the set goal. Movements that also dilute ~basketball~ in this case in favor of decidedly less successful moments and in the NBA theme. The W mode The WNBA has been carefully reproduced in NBA 2K22 A similar experience, stripped of all these (often useless) superfetations can be found in The W, a sort of career mode dedicated to the players of the WNBA, the NBA women's championship. No city, little narrative, lots of pitch, training, micromanagement of your own player. Even on the parquet VC worked well and you ~feel~ that you are playing a different game than that of your male colleagues. Everything, starting from the animations of the dribble to the shot, is different and you have to relearn how to stay on the court, making the ball go around more and thus appreciating this variant of basketball that is certainly less pushed from a physical point of view, but no less true. Indeed, the fact that it is a much more streamlined mode compared to myPlayer allows you to breathe much more basketball in The W than in the City, where, between sponsors, raps, clothes, tantrums, quarrels and various bullshit, one loses sight a bit the sporty and glamorous side of sport in favor of the commercial one. MyTeam, the FUT of NBA 2K22 A screenshot of MyTeam in NBA 2K22 One mode that has returned almost unchanged is myTeam, to simplify a sort of FUT, but of NBA 2K22. It is a mode that mixes Fantasy Basketball with the gameplay of NBA 2K. We start by unwrapping a series of packages useful for formare a sensible quintet, plus the relative reserves. These will be more or less strong depending on your luck (in other words, fishing a Doncic is rarer, but definitely more useful than fishing an Ish Smith), but they can be upgraded with new badges that can improve some of their stats, so as to fill some gaps or make strengths unstoppable. Also in this case, real money can speed up the creation of formidable teams made up of very rare and very powerful cards, but, unlike myPlayer, here there are many more possibilities to be able to play freely in order to accumulate resources with which more easily bridge the gap with paying players. The need, again, to monetize is visible in the Draft mode. Here a player randomly composes his team and can continue to use it until he accumulates 3 defeats. The perfect mode for those looking for something light and fast, which doesn't necessarily require hours of hard grinding. Too bad that the number of tickets to access it for free is limited and new tickets must be bought. As in FIFA you will say, but in EA's game, despite everything, this massive presence of commercials, product placements or other is not present (for now), which is sometimes even excessive, as demonstrated by the ~type of State Farm~ that is become a real character in the game. Microtransactions and other modalities Kevin Durant will bully you on the NBA 2K22 parquet This continuous presence of microtransactions and elements of this kind risks overshadowing the fact that, in the end, we are faced with one of the best basketball games ever. The modes are many and suitable for all tastes, from those who love street basketball to those who want to experience the thrill of being a General Manager of an NBA franchise. There are WNBA teams, classic teams, and a whole host of content that changes and updates in near real-time based on the current season. From a technical point of view, NBA 2K22 is one of the most complete manuals of basketball with stars and stripes: all the great champions present and of the past are easily recognizable not only from a physical point of view, but also for the way they shoot, for the moves of unique abilities, as well as for their overwhelming strength on the playing field. Thanks to the renewed physics, every type of player has the opportunity to shine: fast and light shooters like Curry will be able to score from any position and slip away from your marking, but physical centers like Embiid or Gobert can really play the role of protectors of the basket, thanks to their long arms and imposing body. Getting to score therefore becomes a game of skill: you need to know and use not only the schemes, but also your own player, so as not to force his inclinations. As we said, this is not a revolution, but an evolution designed to fix what was wrong and bring the video game even closer, one step at a time, to the emulated sport. On the parquet there are still things to fix, but the direction seems to be the right one. Outside the arena, things don't go the same way. The City is a very ambitious attempt, perhaps too much. The game engine struggles to handle everything and the physics used in the movements and interactions between your character and the environment is not up to a similar production. More than the technical problems, however, the real limit is conceptual. You can't navigate quickly from one activity to another, the interface is confusing and you can't take a step without being slapped by a commercial or an advertisement. Furthermore, all this has led to an excessive dilution of the narrative, which makes the ~story mode~ lose a lot of bite. Add in the constant presence of microtransactions and the fact that the courts and Pro-Am gyms are already full of Michael Jordans, and you get the feeling that 2K Sports hasn't done much to limit these kinds of problems. Graphically we are at the top Rui Hachimura in NBA 2K22 One aspect on which there is little to say is the technical one. On the NBA 2K22 parquet it is beautiful to look at, fluid, detailed, faithful. The big stars are perfect and painstakingly animated. Those who know the Game will find the movements of their favorite champion, those who are not a fan will soon discover how complex it is to mark a step-back from Harden or stop that running train from Zion. Visual Concepts has cleaned up the code and the strange behavior and jerky movements are much less than in the past, although present. The contacts are realistic, as well as, finally, the behavior of the ball, much less pil", "date": "2021-09-16", "grade": "8.0"}
