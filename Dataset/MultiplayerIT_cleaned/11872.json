{"name": "Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/juiced-2-hot-import-nights-recensione.html", "text": "Inspired by the Hot Import Nights show, Juiced 2 drops the player into the reckless world of extreme tuning, aboard various types of strictly rigged machines. Clear references to EA's much more famous Need For Speed, as well as to all the most popular racing games of the moment, from Gotham to Ridge Racer. From the title Bizarre we will surely find colorful cities that will welcome our raids, however the reference stops here, since the THQ work settles on very different levels. Women and engines... The product is based on a rather unambiguous formula, right from the start, right from the presentation. Colorful menus follow a very 90s urban style, roaring engines are accompanied by skimpy girls. An approach perhaps more oriented towards overseas teenagers rather than European users, but so be it. We find at our disposal the possibility of playing a career, offline and online, along an endless series of themed events that will mark our climb to fame. First we will have to create our pilot, choosing from a fair spectrum of possibilities. From facial features, to gender, to clothing, there's enough variety to waste a good amount of time. The outfits dedicated to the female characters are as abundant as they are skimpy, very much in line with the spirit that hovers in this production. The next step will be to choose a car from a shortlist of dealerships. Initially we will have a certain monetary budget available to invest in some factory-fresh racing cars, but that's not all, we will be able to make use of an efficient workshop to equip it with all the necessary customizations: from the painting to the application of various serigraphs, already pre-packaged, many of which to buy or unlock in their specific packages. Needless to say, in this case the eyes are turned to Forza Motorsport 2, whose editor is difficult to replicate. It is therefore difficult to blame Juiced 2 too much in this sector, there is an exhaustive number of options, but it will certainly not be possible to give birth to works of the caliber of those allowed by the title Turn 10. Ready to challenge me? Once all the preparations have been completed, it's time to get on the track. After the presentation of the pilots, it will even be possible to bet money with a specific character. The race will therefore present a dual task, cross the finish line first and beat the driver in question! The sense of rivalry is well emphasized during the races, even through a hilarious pip window that shows the state of mind of the character in the case of overtaking or questionable maneuvers (the game is completely in Italian, including dialogues). In addition to this, Juiced 2 features an unusual growth system, called DNA, which decodes and evolves the player's driving attitudes, in order to shape a peculiar profile. This system is also calculated for the opposing pilots. The most intriguing feature is the online implementation, where up to seven players can go through the career. This results in virtual racers being replaced with Xbox Live users. An experience of a very different caliber compared to the offline one. I would, I would not, but if you want... From a technical point of view, the THQ product hardly manages to excel, on the contrary, it hardly reaches the sufficiency due to a long series of problems. The framerate hasn't been capped, which is a big mistake, as it fluctuates dangerously between 60 and 30fps, sometimes even less, depending on the complexity of the race. The effect is disarming, even if the presence of some good effects, a discreet polygonal modeling and the speed partially fill the gaps. However, it is difficult to obtain satisfaction from the details, starting from the internal view, very approximate and plagued by graphic artifacts. With competition represented by productions such as Dirt, Sega Rally, Flatout, Gotham Racing 4 and Need For Speed itself, there is very little room for a production that tries not to disfigure rather than teach something. Ludically, things are not much better, the guidance system denotes little character, and a lot of confusion. The choice inevitably falls on an arcade setting, with weightless cars, a nervous and unreal steering that forces constant adjustments, an inadequate drift system that almost seems to aim towards Ridge Racer, which is certainly not an example of modernity. But in the case of Juiced 2 there is the aggravating circumstance that in the end it is only an imitation. For a few hours everything works and manages to convey a certain amount of fun, but thanks to the monotony of the scenarios, which are too bare, and the approximate guide system, the player soon falls prey to boredom. Online possibilities can rappresent a great antidote, the problem is finding users in Xbox Live lobbies, which are currently under-crowded. Xbox 360 - Goals Juiced's 1000 points are easily half achievable, as they are tied to the offline career. The rest, being unlocked with online races, remain quite difficult, at least until the game is more widespread. Comment Juiced 2 is a product that does nothing more than its very nature dictates. A deliberately loud and mischievous arcade racing game, which relies on a purely male user, presumably American, as suggested by the type of races and the iconography of a Pimp My Ride-like broadcast. But also very approximate, not very original and too inspired by productions of a very different caliber. Honestly, it's not the best as a business card, one wonders how much space can remain in an extremely competitive market such as that of racing games. Nonetheless, if you appreciate this type of competition, you can spend a few hours in joy. All others can fly over. Pros Very long career The DNA system is interesting You have to feast your eyes (on some necklines...) Cons Graphically modest It gets boring quickly", "date": "2007-11-01", "grade": null}
