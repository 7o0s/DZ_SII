Among the various there was also Borderlands, the series of shooters from Gearbox. It might have seemed like a strange choice, given the transition from an action game to one that is its total antithesis, but the end result was crackling and by many (rightly) considered to be Telltale's best game. Now, we are in the opposite situation. With the arrival of New Tales from the Borderlands, the strangeness is not the idea of using Borderlands for a narrative adventure, but having it made by a different team. This new game, available from October 21, 2022 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch, is in fact developed directly by Gearbox Software and takes us away from Pandora. Have the new creators of this series (as absurd as it sounds to call them ~new~) have they been able to match or improve the results obtained from the first game? Or is Telltale Games' masterpiece still unsurpassed? To find out, you just have to continue reading our review of New Tales from the Borderlands! Three on Promethea Anu, one of the three protagonists of New Tales from the Borderlands New Tales from the Borderlands puts us in the shoes of a new trio of characters. We will have from our Anu, a brilliant scientist who dreams of a world without weapons; to follow we find his brother, Octavio, a street kid who thinks he has what it takes to become the richest on the planet; finally, there is Fran, a woman who manages (badly) the family yogurt shop and manages (very badly) her anger. The three are ordinary people, but in the world of Borderlands fate is immediately ready to put a hand on it. It all begins when Tediore - one of the many multinationals of Promethea, the planet where the events of the game take place - decides to exacerbate his hostile takeover attempt of Atlas, the company of Rhys, protagonist of Tales from the Borderlands. Anu works for Atlas and must escape from the space station to go down to the planet and save his brother, who in the meantime has become one of Tediore's primary targets, also involving Fran for whom he works. Octavio, one of the three protagonists of New Tales from the Borderlands The New Tales from the Borderlands adventure has all the features you would expect from a Borderlands game. There is no shortage of the most extreme and sometimes gratuitous violence. There is no shortage of the obsession of all the characters for weapons, which is contrasted only by Anu who seems to be the only one to wonder why everyone is always so violent and obsessed with guns. There is no shortage of robots with an easy joke and not even the loot boxes, which obviously contain only money (useful for buying alternative costumes) since the characters have no equipment. The feeling is therefore of truly being in a Borderlands game, at least superficially, even more than what happened with Tales from the Borderlands. The style of narration is also what you expect: extremely comical, always based on ridiculing every action or joke to get a laugh. He can do it? Yes, especially in the early stages, where it aims almost exclusively at that as the plot has not yet become serious and there is no room for sentimentality. Fran, one of the characters in New Tales from the Borderlands The more dramatic side of the story grows in the final phase, with the characters becoming a bit more close-knit group and realizing that their actions have a weight on the entire planet and perhaps the entire universe (impossible to be more precise without do spoilers!). It is in this part that New Tales from the Borderlands struggles a bit. In a somewhat too simple way, New Tales from the Borderlands inserts a phase in which it confronts the characters with their weaknesses, all obvious to the player from the first moment since they are the most important element of their characterization. However, the game fails to get the characters to face and accept them in a credible way, making the transition from ~madmen who proceed at random~ to ~heroes aware of their role~ ineffective. Let's be clear, we are not talking about a total derailment of the plot. Simply, the characters and the narrative fail to express their true potential and the ending is adequate, but less impactful than New Tales from the Borderlands would have deserved. LOU13, a supporting character of the protagonists, not controllable Anu, Octavio and Fran, together with vare supporting actors, they work as long as the tones remain light, but every time things get serious they are not entirely convincing. Luckily, the serious moments are a minor part of the adventure. Perhaps the team should have taken a little more time to grow them. New Tales from the Borderlands - even spending extra minutes in each area to devote himself to secondary elements - in fact lasts eight and a half hours, or less than the previous chapter (which on average required at least ten and a half). Choices, QTEs and minigames Stapleface, a secondary character, and Anu New Tales from the Borderlands also takes up the structure of Telltale Games' games. As a choose-your-own-adventure style game, you have to continually make the characters decide what to say, influencing some of the relationships between the three. In reality, however, the choices only have weight on the ending and in the middle there are no major events that have arisen as a direct consequence of our actions. Gearbox's work is a little more closed and linear than many of Telltale Games' works. It's a shame, given that the 39.99 requested for the game also gave the impression of having a slightly more massive project in front of us. Between one dialogue and another we will then have to complete a series of QTEs. Gearbox, in this case, has decided to make things as simple as possible, anticipating the arrival of a QTE command by indicating on the screen where the icon will be and what type of key we will have to press (lever or button). Getting QTEs wrong is a choice, not a lack of skill. The CEO of Tediore So far everything normal. Where New Tales from the Borderlands tries to change is with the inclusion of a series of mini-games and alternative interactions. Anu has a pair of technological glasses that allow her to analyze objects and, when she has to complete a scientific invention, she puts in some healthy violence by slapping her devices. Octavio, on the other hand, has a bracelet to hack various elements of the environment. Finally, there are the Vaultlanders, an action figure-based minigame in which you have to fight against an opponent, choosing your own fighter among those we find and win as we advance. Vaultlanders is based on unique attack, defense, and ability stats for each action figure. It's actually much more elaborate than necessary since it's just a minigame in which we'll have to press a key repeatedly to attack on our turn and then complete a very trivial QTE to avoid enemy shots and then finish it off on our next turn. Even the aforementioned mini-games are extremely trivial and have left us strongly in doubt: we understand that Gearbox wanted to make everything simple, so as not to embarrass the players, but expanding these components would have given New Tales from the Borderlands that touch of playful variety plus that wouldn't have hurt. Unfortunately, as they are, they are only sporadic and uninteresting interludes: their best quality is that they are not repeated too many times. New engine for the Borderlands The capital of Promothea Finally, a quick comment on the technical side. One of the weaknesses of Telltale Games games was the graphics engine, which struggled in terms of performance and transitions even in the face of some game improvements in game. Gearbox has worked well in this sense but we would not have expected less. The graphics are in line with the main saga and the result is always excellent. The animations are of high quality and the expressiveness of the faces reflects the emotions of the characters well. We particularly appreciated the English dubbing, always of a high standard both as regards the protagonists and the more secondary characters.
