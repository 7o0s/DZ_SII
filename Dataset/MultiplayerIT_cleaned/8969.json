However, the sensitive and large iPad screen seems to have been created by the fervent minds of Cupertino specifically to enjoy the immediacy of strategic titles, tower defense and puzzles. Siegecraft in this sense represents the clear example of what is written in the introduction, thanks to its strategic but at the same time action-packed approach and, something not to be underestimated, based on finally credible and realistic environmental physics. Catapulted into battle Although the apparently historical setting aspires to have a minimum of credibility, the plot (or rather the plot outline) that serves as the scenario for Siegecraft has no foothold with the reality of the past. In fact, without any criteria, the aim of the game is to overwhelm the various enemies from time to time, using the three selectable races: knights, Vikings and samurai. Let's say right away that there are no structural differences in the combat phase between the different selectable populations: the burden of the battle is in fact entirely borne by the player, whose task will be to maneuver exclusively the imposing war machines, all with shots from above ~bird's eye~. Driving catapults and ballistas, therefore, you will have to overcome the challenges imposed by the three different campaigns; the weapons can be managed in a simple and intuitive way thanks to the touch interface and, as an aid especially in the initial stages, the trajectories of the fired bullets can be viewed thanks to a red guideline. Obviously, the ballista has the task of eliminating enemies placed on the same plane and at close range to its position; hitting from long range and tearing down strategic infrastructure is instead the role of the versatile catapult. In addition to aiming, the player has at least two ways to upgrade the bullets available: the first, free, which consists in hitting some crystals scattered in certain scenarios with simple stone balls; in this way three fireballs will be given away ready to explode once the target is reached. The second method involves the use of game credits, obtained at the end of each mission, thanks to which the opportunity is given to supply the catapult with special projectiles sold through the shop. The imagination of the developers has really indulged in the creation of ammunition: in fact, they range from comfortable explosive barrels to bramble bushes, from the severed heads of Trolls to reproductions of Mjllnir, none other than the famous Thor's hammer. But when live sheep and cows as well as explosive Halloween pumpkins can be thrown (expensively) then one realizes that, fortunately, there really is no limit to creativity. The precious money will also be used for the inevitable upgrade of the war machines, both in terms of resistance and in terms of recharge and range times; obviously for the more impatient it is also possible to buy extra money through microtransactions, a perhaps questionable practice but apparently still very much appreciated. In some Siegecraft missions it is then easy to notice a heavy reference to the tower defense genre, especially when the goal is to repel the different waves of enemies while preserving one's own troops; always like the classic tower defense games there will be no shortage of super bosses to take down by any means possible before they reach the escape route. A plus not to be underestimated concerns the complete multiplayer mode: based on the Game Center platform, it is structured as a sort of turn-based combat in which the lack of the ideal trajectory of the weapons forces the players to make several attempts before hitting the opponent. Only on the iPad there is also a local multiplayer, excellently made using the two short sides of the famous tablet. Finally, really great praise for the technical sector, which sees real peaks of excellence both in the physics of the projectiles and, above all, in the light effects and in the motion of the fluids; if you then add the beautiful textures in HD and the stable framerate, all that remains is a very well done picture, ruined only minimally by the polygonal models of the little protagonist fighters.
