{"name": "BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma Extend", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/153402-blazblue-chrono-phantasma-extend-estendimi-questo.html", "text": "You know, we're not sure if it's more irritating that Arc System Works churned out yet another revision of a BlazBlue or that, a few days later, they announced a fourth episode, virtually identical to the previous ones, for release next year. Which means that within another year another Extend revision of that new Central Fiction will be released as well, and that the story will continue until ~the takings drop~. In the meantime, the Japanese developer is working on his new vision of Guilty Gear, the spiritual prequel to BlazBlue, and even there he repeated the same joke: Guilty Geard Xrd comes out in the West, and a few days later its revision for the market is announced Japanese. It's a headache habit that rivals Capcom's Street Fighter revisions, but we forgive them every time because, in fact, each new revision is better than the last and Arc System Works' fighting games are among the most technical and absolutely satisfying. That with Chrono Phantasma Extend they risked taking the longest step, however, is quite evident ... Chrono Phantasma Extend is the best chapter to start playing BlazBlue, but certainly not the last The cast expands The peculiar feature that distinguishes BlazBlue from many other fighting games is the enormous emphasis that Arc System Works has placed in the drafting of a complex and multifaceted story that unfolds between the traditional Arcade mode and the Story mode conceived as a kind of visual novel between a battle and the other. Yes, at some point - like in Continuum Shift Extend - the storyline has become quite hectic and tiring to follow, especially if you buy a new episode without having the slightest idea of who the characters are or how their lives intertwine. Chrono Phantasma Extend compensates for this problem with a kind of gigantic encyclopedia that explains every tiny detail of this imaginary world and its inhabitants, taking stock of the situation so that newbies can tackle the Story mode without getting a migraine. At that point, they will ~only~ have to navigate the main storylines, the ~what if~ subplots, the comic episodes and the alternative endings - provided they know English, since Italian is not spoken - but if the overall picture can intimidate it must be said that it translates into a disproportionate amount of hours of play even just in single player. This also occurs thanks to the introduction of the new fighters, for a total of twenty-six selectable characters: the default cast of Chrono Phantasma is now joined by the former DLCs Kokonoe and Yuuki Terumi and two almost unpublished characters, namely Lambda-11 - who in the original episode she had been replaced by Nu-13 - and Celica A. Mercury. Despite the similarities between the characters (Lambda-11 is yet another Murakumo unit, while Celica fights using the puppet Minerva, a copy of Carl's Nirvana) Arc System Works has once again managed to significantly differentiate the various wrestlers both in the moves special than in specific strategies based on their personal powers. In reality, the new balance of Chrono Phantasma Extend has made professional players turn up their noses, so much so that the title has been excluded from the recent international Evolution 2015 competition: despite this, if you are not among those who count the single frames of each holy animation, the changes will make you neither hot nor cold. Indeed, compared to the previous episodes - Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift - you will probably discover a slightly different BlazBlue, starting with the new and very interesting Overdrive mechanics. Playstation 4 trophies Conquering the 38 bronze trophies, 10 silver, 2 gold and the final platinum won't be easy. Apart from the fact that each game mode must be completed, some trophies require you to meet different requirements depending on the characters. It won't be an easy feat. The next-gen that doesn't exist For those who missed the transition from Continuum Shift to Chrono Phantasma, it's worth remembering that Overdrive is a new mechanic that replaces some Distortion Drives or gives certain characters new possibilities. In essence, it is a temporary bonus that can be activated after loading a special indicator: once the four attack buttons are pressed simultaneously and the Overdrive is used, the match countdown - if any - freezes for a period of time inversely proportional to the player's remaining life energy. In other words, the less life you have left, the longer the Overdrive lasts, and its effects change depending on the fighter and his powers: Valkenhayn's werewolf transformation recharges fastermind, Platinum can use his gadgets infinitely, Jin's shots always freeze the opponent, and so on. In essence, the reasoned use of the Overdrive can literally overturn the outcome of a game. Fortunately, both the new mechanics and even the simplest combos and special moves are illustrated through a couple of exhaustive tutorials, so that they can then be applied in the increasingly complex challenges of the Challenge mode. Chrono Phantasma Extend is full of modes that will occupy the free time of single players, together with the inevitable online competitive mode that relies on an excellent netcode. In short, as per tradition, there is nothing to complain about. Or maybe yes. The last time we played BlazBlue was a couple of years ago on PlayStation Vita: Continuum Shift Extend showed off, on the laptop's small OLED screen, a very colorful and detailed cosmetic that highlighted the excellent work of Arc System Works on sprites and character animations. Today, on the TV screen, the same identical sprites, barely retouched for the occasion, are beginning to feel the weight of the years: the resolution doesn't do them justice, and above all the more spectacular sequences - for example those of Astral Finish - tend to be too pixelated, especially after playing that graphic splendor of Guilty Gear Xrd, which in the transition to three dimensions has only gained us since the developer has not distorted the two-dimensional gameplay in the slightest. Nothing to say, however, about the English dubbing - more than discreet, as usual - and about the bubbly rock soundtrack, trademark of Arc System Works which, once again, does not disappoint expectations in the slightest.", "date": "2015-07-21", "grade": "8.0"}
