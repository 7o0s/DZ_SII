{"name": "Genma Onimusha-PAL-", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/genma-onimusha-pal-.html", "text": "Onimusha or Genma Onimusha One key thing to keep in mind is that Capcom has not only decided to port the Ps2 version of Onimusha to the Microsoft console, but has also chosen to adopt some changes that will probably allow everyone who played the previous version to enjoy that one as well. Xbox. One of the most striking is the addition of green souls, a new type of energy for Samanosuke. By absorbing these souls our character will accumulate power until he reaches the maximum level (5 souls) which will allow him to become invulnerable for a short period of time by simply pressing the white button. Be careful though, we will not be the only ones to have the opportunity to take advantage of the power of these souls, but also our enemies will be able to absorb and exploit their effects (only that a single soul will be enough for them to significantly increase their power) and this will it will create problems especially when you start to encounter the bigger and stronger enemies who will become almost unassailable. The green souls certainly add an extra touch of strategy to the title, in fact now we will no longer be able to think only of ourselves but we will also have to make sure that our opponents do not power up. This is just one example of what Capcom has done to allow even the XBox people to enjoy Genma Onimusha Among demons, souls and flaming swords As soon as we enter the menu we will be able to decide whether to start a new game or whether to go hacking through the options, since there will be nothing interesting in the latter, proceed immediately with the game. The introductory movie showing the clash of Nobunaga's army against the rival faction has a duration of several minutes, and was awarded the best sequence in computer graphics. Once in the game you will notice that the controls are very similar to those of Resident Evil and that at first they may seem difficult to use, but over time they will prove to be comfortable and useful. During the game Samanosuke will be able to use many different weapons, some of which can be enhanced thanks to the red souls that we have accumulated during the fights, these swords will also have the ability to perform a devastating special blow, or Samanosuke will be able to charge their power and unleash a more powerful attack than usual. Each weapon will differ from the other in terms of speed and power, in fact you will easily notice that the sword that will have life from the fire gem will be much more powerful than that of the wind, but the latter will have speed from its own, it will be up to you to decide whether to demolish the enemy in a few blows, however, risking finding yourself unbalanced by one of his attacks or whether to undertake longer but safer fights. Although initially there is no possibility to decide the difficulty, if you are defeated too many times during the game a new option will appear which will indicate the level of play as a beginner. In our adventure we will meet various types of demons, many of which differ in shape and power, and we will also happen to find ourselves in front of bosses, or rather stronger and more difficult monsters to beat. Against these creatures we should not hesitate to use all the magical force in our possession. When Samanosuke is unable to move, a young ninja named Kaede will take his place, many times she will have the task of saving Samanosuke from the most dangerous situations. Genma Onimusha is not only a very funny action game, but it knows how to alternate pure action scenes with moments of calm during which we will have to solve riddles that will allow us to open chests and unlock doors or secret areas. Onimusha's problem? After understanding what the game is made of, let's move on to revealing the only flaw of its longevity. To analyze this particular, though. we need to divide the users into two parts, those who like to play by discovering all the secrets and maximizing the skills, and the player who is superficial and neglects it once the game is over. For the second type of player, Onimusha is an almost useless game, in fact it can only bring them temporary entertainment since the game lasts about 5 hours, which however are equivalent to 8 hours. For the player who loves the style and prefers to discover all the secrets, Onimusha will last much longer, in fact it is full of secrets that will be quite difficult to reveal, just think that during your adventure you will find scattered throughout the landscape of strange types of stones called Fluorite, which if brought together will probably allow you to reveal some bonuses (I say probablelmindly because I only found half of them, but I'm doing it again to get them all). Furthermore, during the game I forgot to access a part of the map because I couldn't find the way to open the door [near the decorated sword (I take this opportunity to ask for a little help)] and therefore this can further increase the longevity of the title that must be seen from a different point of view than usual, to understand that, although not as long as Morrowind (we are talking about 500 hours of play), it guarantees determined players a lot of fun and a good longevity. Instead, what may seem like a problem is the language, in fact we will be able to choose whether to set English, French or German but not Italian....... the game however does not necessarily require a translation, and even if it is more inconvenient you can understand very well what the characters are saying, provided you have a fair knowledge of the language Graphics & Sound In these respects Onimusha has no defects, indeed under the sound the game offers very beautiful and immersive music at the same time, capable of involving the player more in the action. All the other sounds related to the title are also produced very well, and I assure you that later you will use them to understand what awaits you (I guarantee that when you hear the doll's bells you will put wings on your feet ^_^). Also for the graphics there are no criticisms, the character is very well done, and has the possibility of changing clothes during the game, the backgrounds are very well done and manage to immerse you in the scene, moreover there will be interactive pieces of scenery that can be broken to continue on the road or to discover bonus chests (sometimes even flourite) Conclusions In conclusion, I think Onimusha is an excellent game but too short (I personally intend to redo it and discover all the secrets but for all those who don't intend to do so, they could be disappointed by this title), however, apart from the longevity, there are big problems, indeed I really believe that Onimusha is able to entertain many people thanks to its story, its gameplay and its riddles . MaterialsCheats Pros: Very nice play style Compelling story Sound Very fun Cons: A bit short The plot It's not unusual for the same game to look the same on the different consoles it's being developed for. And for this very reason, if it does not present any significant innovations, it is unlikely that the one who bought it for a console will hardly spend more money to play the same game on a different platform. A company that has not escaped this problem is Capcom: an example is given by its latest PS2 game entitled Resident Evil: Code Veronica X which does not present any element of novelty in gameplay compared to the version released for the Dreamcast. This problem is accentuated when the game itself does not take full advantage of the capabilities of the console for which it is developed, maintaining in most cases the characteristics of the original version. When Capcom announced Genma Onimusha for XBox gamers weren't so thrilled thinking that this was just another PS2 title ported to XBox. Instead Genma Onimusha proved to be a game full of innovations concerning both graphics and gameplay and make it a new and different experience from the one offered by the episode released on PS2. The title follows what was the initial project that those of Capcom wanted to offer to their audience. However the story remains in practice based on that of the PS2 version. It takes place amid real-life historical events that unfolded during the era of feudal Japan, when Nobunaga Oda was preparing to invade Inabayama Castle, home of Yoshitatsu Saito. You will take on the role of the virtuous Samanosuke Akechi and your task will be to save Yuki, a young princess and sister of Yoshitatsu Saito, from the clutches of demonic forces. You will later find out that Nobunaga himself has been resurrected by demic forces who intend to sacrifice Princess Yuki.", "date": "2002-04-09", "grade": null}
