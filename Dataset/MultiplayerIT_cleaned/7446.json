Gene Wilder exclaimed in the classic Frankenstein Junior, and it's more or less the same reaction we had during our first game with Neon Shadow. The theme is clearly that of the usability of first person shooters in the mobile sector, and by ~usability~ we do not simply mean that they exist and are also quite successful (the various NOVA and Modern Combat branded Gameloft prove it), but that they can offer a approach to the ~adult~ genre, if you will; a hardcore interpretation that puts the action at the center and avoids the well-established trend of accompaniment, when we move in a group but our companions set the pace and show the way. Mind you, in this FPS developed by Tasty Poison Games and produced by Crescent Moon Games there is no ~headache~ level design, you don't need to open a map and often there is an indicator to show us the direction we need to take, in a standard sequence that involves reaching and destroying an energy node and then reaching the transition to the next stage. But what we found in the game was a Doom-like approach, which pushes us to turn the corner, find ten different enemies and then retreat, wait for their arrival perhaps behind cover and eliminate them one at a time so as not to succumb to their blows . Also because the game over in Neon Shadow is particularly bad, since you have to start the mission over and there are no checkpoints. Neon Shadow is a nice surprise, a very challenging and engaging FPS, albeit with some flaws Multiple fun Neon Shadow not only offers a challenging single player campaign but also several premium multiplayer modes. On tablets it is possible to play together with a friend using a single device, but there is also a competitive online sector with frenetic deathmatches for four players. It's just a pity that at the moment the presence of challengers on the net is scarce... Hard fight with a lot of fear The choices made by the developers are quite precise and particularly affect the management of weapons, which do not include reloads. In fact, the default shotgun has infinite ammunition and reloads automatically, putting us in difficulty when the eight shots have been fired, which significantly decreases the attack frequency. The extra weapons instead last as long as there are bullets, which leads to using them only when necessary because they actually offer something new and different compared to the rifle: the machine gun reaches targets further away with greater accuracy, the grenade launcher has a high destructive power, and so on. The interpretation of Tasty Poison Games continues with the touch control system, precise and punctual, equipped with aiming assistance (which can be deactivated) and versatile even in the most agitated situations. However, it is really a pity that the possibility of implementing automatic fire has not been taken into consideration, which in touch FPS can make all the difference in the world and offer a more fluid and engaging rather than piecemeal action (see the recent Dead Trigger 2) . Let's try to explain ourselves better: the most popular approach, with a separate fire button, implies that our character has to frame a target using the virtual sticks, then open fire by acting on a separate command. If the enemy on duty is equipped with a minimum artificial intelligence, in that time frame he will be able to move, nullifying the attack or in any case forcing us to waste ammunition in an attempt to hit him. With an auto-fire feature, however, the simple action of aiming at an enemy would trigger the trigger, allowing for more freedom to mix movement and attack within the same maneuver. It is inexplicable that many developers have not come to this same conclusion, after all in a shooter, framing the enemy without simultaneously opening fire would make no sense. The second problem with Neon Shadow - if we want to overlook the inevitable frustration of a game over within seconds of completing a level - lies in the presence of marked drops in frame rate on the test device (an iPhone 5s, therefore a last generation) during hectic situations, which negatively affects the controls and the enjoyment of the experience in general. Let's hope for an update that fixes this, also because on the iPad it seems that the game doesn't run into the same problem. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, one can certainly speak of graphics that are not at the top, of very similar settings and fairly simple polygonal models (the robot-cinghiale is actually rather sad to see), elements that are certainly not central but which prevent the Crescent Moon Games production from aspiring to higher scores. Finally, the musical accompaniment is nice, minus the effects: a machine gun should make the sound of a machine gun, not of a cassette recorder rewinding.", "date": "2013-11-28", "grade": "7.9"}
