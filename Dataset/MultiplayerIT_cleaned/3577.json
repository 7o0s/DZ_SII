{"name": "Project Zero Deaths", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-zero-deaths-la-recensione.html", "text": "Competitive shooters within arenas have codified themselves into a flood of different types, at this point, so it is difficult to recognize how original there may be in the hybrid structure of Project Zero Deaths, the protagonist of this review. However, it must be said that the mix of elements put together by Detis for this particular title on mobile and PC platforms is really well balanced and interesting, although on games of this genre there is probably a need for long-term monitoring to evaluate more precisely the support of the community and developers. There are several suggestions that come to mind when playing Project Zero Deaths and range from the good old Quake to Worms, in different doses and junctures, also considering the distance between these possible sources of inspiration, but in any case these are memories positives that emerge from excellent sensations. We must premise that the mobile version, or the one tested in this review, is probably not the one that shines the most: from a technical point of view, the game is the same seen on the PC, also thanks to graphics that are not exactly demanding for current hardware, but the system of traditional control is certainly more suitable for frenetic gameplay like this, although the controls on the screen - always a rather problematic solution - are implemented here much better than in other situations. Project Zero Deaths is a 2D shooter that places us in structured arenas like platform game levels, putting us in front of various team game modes generally focused on eliminating opponents with some variations on the theme. The result is a sort of 2D multiplayer scrolling shooter which, on closer inspection, looks like a sort of two-dimensional Quake, also characterized by a constant progression of the character. In the arena With the accumulation of experience points and advancing in level it becomes possible to unlock different game modes that are added to the standard rotation, referring to the traditional types of shooter: there is the deathmatch, Bomb Delivery, Capture the Flag, collection of rings and others more or less classic variants, always based on the direct clash between two teams of players. The pace is extremely fast, with respawns every few seconds that constantly put us back into the game, while the continuous platform-style movement makes the game action particularly engaging and original. The arenas are full of platforms, secret passages, traps and mobile elements, in some cases also influenced by physics (some parts of the scenario can be moved or set on fire, for example) which enlivens the action a lot and does not entrust everything to fighting alone in focus, given that both a certain mastery of the use of weapons and the movement of the character within the maps become necessary. We therefore find ourselves running, jumping, clinging to the walls and shooting with the various weapons scattered throughout the maps, trying to complete different objectives depending on the mode but in principle to beat the opposing team by hindering or eliminating its components as much as possible within the time limit. The furious action and dynamism is a bit that of Quake-style competitive FPS, the platforming action is reminiscent of scrolling brawlers while the cartoony look and 2D framing brings to mind a bit Worms and the like, all eclectic elements but which combine to build a balanced and fun shooter. The management of the character and the constant progression are then a further push to continue from game to game: each result is useful for carrying on the gaming experience, with the advancement of the levels that enhances the character and the weapons available, unlocking further exclusive customizations. Being a free-to-play game, this is obviously where micro-transactions come in, with gems being able to be purchased for real money. These allow you to open particularly rich prize boxes and, in principle, speed up the process of character and weapon evolution, but it must be said that the game is perfectly usable by avoiding spending, conquering bonuses simply with performance in the game. Furthermore, matchmaking also seems to exclude the pay-to-win phenomenon, considering the balance found in the organization of matches with players of a similar level. Instead, there is a certain instability in the tested Android version, with frequent disconnections and sometimes quite heavy lag, but these are elements that in a game still in the testing phase (on PC it is still in Early Access) can be easily resolved during constructionNone", "date": "2019-07-26", "grade": "7.8"}
