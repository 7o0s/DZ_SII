{"name": "Star Wars - Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast-2.html", "text": "Again ... Star Wars! It seemed like a normal routine mission, it was necessary to investigate an imperial listening post that most believed by now abandoned, however some confused words including ~Valley of the Jedi~ (which we had known in the previous chapter) immediately let us understand that a normal routine is likely to turn into something much more important. On Kejim, a desolate planet in orbit around a dying sun, thus begins the third chapter of the saga that began years ago with Dark Forces. We find the surly and stainless Kyle Katarn, a sort of politically correct Duke Nukem in a spatial guise, and alongside him his trusted companion (work and otherwise) Ian Ors. On the other hand, we do not find the legendary Lightsaber in our inventory ... but fear not because Katarn's path will (re)cross first with the powers of the Force and then with the lightsaber which, years before, he had abandoned afraid of the charm of the dark side of the Force. We tell you right away that the plot, especially at the beginning, is certainly not the best part of the whole game: at times predictable, in some ways weak and decidedly not very original, however, it has the advantage of introducing the participation of some guest stars (Skywalker above all of course) and the opportunity to visit places of high ~historical~ value. Then, fortunately, a few twists during the evolution of situations will raise the average level of the script a little, we are certainly below the quality levels of Half-Life but certainly above those of Medal of Honor. The locations where our missions will take place are eight and have been divided into about twenty levels, the variety of settings is therefore ensured. It starts from an imperial outpost to pass by the temple of Yavin 4 and arrive at the flying city of Bespin. We have left out the suburbs of Cloudy City and then we have forgotten the prison of ... in short, we will have something for all tastes. The first approaches to the game. Let's start immediately with some nasty surprises, in the face of a color manual translated into Italian we soon realize that the CD-ROM contained in the fascinating DVD-Box contains the game NOT entirely localized in our increasingly reviled Italian language. Furthermore, the subtitles (in English of course) will only be activated during the cutscenes and not during the in-game dialogues. Luckily the speech is quite understandable even to those who have had the opportunity to learn the Albion language only in schools, this is a fundamental thing because many levels will be solved thanks to a series of clues received from the game characters during the course of missions. We will have another initial disappointment from the framerate that JK2 reserves for us in the very first level of the game. Medal of Honor, on the same hardware configuration, turns out to be much more fluid and, from a certain point of view, has a much higher visual impact than that offered by JK2. The loading times of the maps are in line in both games: boringly long. Very long. Luckily, however, the sound side exalts us not a little, yet another version of John Williams' symphonies is reproduced in a full-bodied and charismatic way. In the distance we can then see the first Stormtroopers and we get excited even more. Also confirmed by the subsequent hours of play, we can say without many doubts that the three-dimensional models of the JK2 characters are among the best made in the entire videogame panorama. The same animations are damn plausible and remind us of the excellent fame that Raven has managed to earn in years of honorable career. Too much news at once? You are right, so let's begin to analyze everything calmly. The visual component - Part one. As already mentioned, JK2 uses the famous Quake III graphic engine enriched by the use of the exclusive GHOUL System 2, the skeletal animation system that has been used by Raven titles since the time of Soldier of Fortune and which we will soon see in action also in his following. For those unfamiliar with it, it is enough to know that using GHOUL2 it is possible to define, by simplifying the general concepts, the three-dimensional models of the characters (players and non-players) building them around a virtual skeleton equipped with 36 joints unrelated to each other. If in titles such as the future Soldier Of Fortune 2 this translates into the famous ~36 points of contact, located to the single pixel, where it will be possible to hit our adversariesari, in JK2 the GHOUL System loses its grimmest meaning instead giving us some of the most spectacular animations ever seen in video games for PC. Already admiring our enemies we will be able to notice the remarkable work done by Raven's graphics: they will kneel in pain before dying, they will look terrified at their wounded hand and will try to nimbly avoid our laser shots. Then by activating the third person view we will be able to appreciate even more the intrinsic spectacularity of this title: the elegance in the use of the lightsaber, the acrobatic jumps, the skilled somersaults ... more than once we had the impression of finding ourselves in front of the spectacular duels seen at the cinema during Episode 1. The detail of the three-dimensional models and the naturalness of their movements are therefore at the top of current videogame productions. The visual component - Part two. It will be that by now we are used to the highly detailed textures of Medal Of Honor, it will be that by now we are almost ready for the graphic wonders of the now upcoming Morrowind however the graphics of JK2, at least initially, will certainly not make us cry out for a miracle. Fortunately, the architecture of the levels is truly epic, perhaps not at the level of the first Jedi Knight, but still very remarkable. Thinking about it, perhaps, the price of this title, compared to titles such as Return To Castle Wolfenstein, is precisely the need to reproduce science fiction environments, thus making less graphic accuracy almost necessary. On the other hand, however, we cannot fail to notice that the ~Star Wars~ feeling is reproduced to perfection. The Stoormtroopers are there, ~real~ as never before, during some missions we will see allied X-Wings darting in the skies (complete with a characteristic hiss above our heads) while we will have to escape from the lethal firepower of an AT-AT that pursues without respite. Whether or not you are a fan of Star Wars (but which gamer isn't at least a little?) you cannot fail to be fascinated, so much so that you linger for more than a few moments, by the Tie Fighters parked in the hangars or by the reconstruction of the typical infamous ~tavern~ , populated by all the worst scum in the galaxy. In short, the graphics of Jedi Knight oozes ~Star Wars~ from all pores. The same graphic effect of the weapons is particularly spot on, of course, none of them made us cry out for the miracle for the originality or for the sense of power that comes from using them (do you know the Doom doublet?) but, considering the decidedly politically correct of the George Lucas saga, it could not be otherwise. On the other hand, the poor technical realization of the animated interludes seemed decidedly out of place. The direction is not bad but the ~masks~ applied to the faces of the characters and a management of the shadows that definitely need to be reviewed (as well as in some parts in the rest of the game) made us fall apart. Even the fluidity of the game which remains acceptable for most of the game suffers several slowdowns during outdoor gaming sessions. Most likely this is due to the fact that by now even the Quake III engine is starting to feel the weight of the years and the will of the designers to want to reproduce huge scenarios, complete with open-air settings, must have definitely put the engine to a whip programmed by Carmack and associates. And for our ears? JK2 is one of the first titles to take advantage of the latest evolution of sound libraries developed by Creative. In fact, if you are the lucky owner of a Sound Blaster Audigy you will finally be able to experience the effectiveness of the EAX Advanced HD. The sounds are clean and crystalline and even the localization of the sound in space (we tested the game with a 2+1 configuration) appears decidedly convincing. Having the volume at ~ball~ and feeling surrounded by the noise of laser beams fired from the rifles of the opposing troops makes us feel definitely there, in the middle of the action. The music then could only be one of the strengths of this title, apart from the Main Theme which obviously we all know well, all the other songs will be wonderful surprises. We assure you that it doesn't often happen that we think of turning up the volume of the music to be able to appreciate its different nuances even during the game. Then, in full LucasArts tradition, which we remember years ago with the iMUSE introduced context-sensitive music in video games, the music will change rhythm and melody based on what is happening on the screen and they do it fluentlyida and decidedly cinematic. Curiosity for fans of the series: the character of Lando Cardassian will be voiced by the original actor, Billy Dee Williams. Tradition and innovation. JK2 basically has two souls, the first predominates during the first game levels: a very classic old-fashioned FPS with a marked imbalance towards the resolution of certain puzzles which, finally, go far beyond the classic ~look for the blue key and open the red door . The second instead comes out only after a few hours of play, when we will finally have the Lightsaber and the first powers of the Force available. We still haven't been able to understand how much the Raven guys were actually inspired by a certain Max Paine, however it is undeniable that more than once certain design choices and many game actions have reminded us, albeit with some forcing, of the masterpiece Remedy . In ~classic~ mode, the preferable view will be strictly the first person one and the game feeling will remind us a lot of the first two chapters of the series. Armed with our trusty Rifle E-11 we will find ourselves immersed in the good old atmosphere that we had learned to appreciate during Dark Forces and Dark Forces II. Each weapon will have primary and secondary fire modes, each of them characterized by a different balance between shooting speed, power and accuracy. There will also be all those great little gadgets that will make the life of every expert adventurer easier. Objects such as the electronic binoculars, the night vision goggles or the mythical Inquisitor Arakyd Mark VII (a ~war~ version of the training droids used by the Jedi to practice with the lightsaber) will not fail to be useful during our adventures. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is truly remarkable as is their characterization. The opposing troops will (almost) always attack us in groups and in case of difficulty they will go to seek cover and then attack suddenly from around corners! They will be warned by our noises and will not fail to watch their backs with clever cover fires. Going forward in the course of the game then, we will discover that each particular unit has its own specific modus operandi, there are those who prefer sniping, those who will launch mainly into hand-to-hand combat and so on. Too bad that, as the game progresses, all these differences will become less and less marked. Yes, because, as announced, once you get hold of the fateful JK2 lightsaber, it risks turning into a strange hybrid between FPS and third-person Action Adventure. Not that this necessarily has to be a defect, but very often all the tactics learned in the previous missions will be lost in favor of a greater frenzy of the game thanks to an almost spasmodic use of our trusty lightsaber. My kingdom for a sword. It is useless to deny it, JK2 will be remembered above all for the exciting sessions with the white weapon and for the particular use that we will have to make of the powers of the Force. In fact, during the course of the story Kyle Katarn will be able to regain possession of the powers he had wanted to give up at the end of the second chapter. All force powers have three degrees of effectiveness and as the game progresses we will manage to develop each of them. Jump, Push, Pull, Speed, Healing, Grip, Mind Control and Lightning are the eight powers that we will have to learn to exploit as quickly as possible. To ~help~ us, the game designers have scattered various puzzles along the game levels which, in full Tomb Raider style, will require even a minimal use of our gray matter. If on the one hand this increases the variety of the game, on the other hand it helps to further distort a game that as the game progresses loses more and more the FPS connotation that many would expect instead. This sensation is then accentuated by the fact that once we have learned how to use the Lightsaber in the best possible way, in each of the three different ways of using it, we will very rarely decide to detach ourselves from it and we will find ourselves, to our great surprise, using the view more and more often in third person and less and less first person. As already mentioned, however, the epic and spectacular nature of these fights is truly superior to any ~pure~ FPS that the market can offer us. It is no coincidence that the title that comes closest to the spectacularity of JK2 is a certain Massimo Dolore who has made ~bullet time~ his forte. Of course, from some points of view the ~bullet time~ still remains unsurpassed, but the ~mag", "date": "2002-05-04", "grade": null}
