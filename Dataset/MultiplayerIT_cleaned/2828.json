As you probably know, in fact, the reduction for iOS and Android of Pro Evolution Soccer uses the well-known MyPES mode as a starting point, however eliminating all the classic stipulations and replacing them with multiplayer events or matches real, locally or online. A factor that once again weighs heavily on the final evaluation? Gameplay: Something has changed Let's start with the gameplay, which in eFootball PES 2021 Mobile is substantially unchanged from the past. It is therefore possible to play using two different layouts for touch controls, classic or advanced: the first shows large buttons on the screen that mimic the functions of the game on PC and console, while the second uses a series of gestures to make everything faster and immediate, but paying in terms of precision and responsiveness. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth controller is not supported in this edition either. Well, the big problem of the game lies in the fact that it forces us to start over a progression that in the early stages proves to be absolutely boring, with matches that last too long and end with tennis scores. All without any resistance from the opponent in turn, who does not act in real time but is simply taken as a reference by the system in the context of an asynchronous multiplayer. This time, however, it seems that the setting evolves much more rapidly, and even with all the limitations of the case, it is possible to obtain a minimum of challenge after just a few games; even more so if you also dedicate yourself to the other modes present in the package, in this case the events related to the Matchday, to specific timed competitions and to the aforementioned online multiplayer, which worked well during the tests both in terms of matchmaking speed and latency. On the other hand, no improvement for the interface, and here the thing is quite serious: we imagined that it would have been the first element that the developers would have changed with the new edition, instead the menus have remained the same and do not make us cry out for a miracle either for beauty or for reactivity, the latter inevitably linked to always online. Technical realization The technical realization of eFootball PES 2021 Mobile appears more than discreet, but even here there are very few innovations. There are some new celebrations and probably some unpublished animations, but otherwise the visual impact remains essentially what we already know, and which fortunately moves well even on older devices thanks to the versatility of the Unreal Engine. The fluidity of the frame rate in short, it appears constant, without blunders, but the public is still horribly two-dimensional and the lack of some official licenses could only debase the performance of certain teams. Furthermore, little to say about the commentary in Italian, which again this year repeats the usual phrases highlighting the need for a change.", "date": "2020-10-31", "grade": "7.2"}
