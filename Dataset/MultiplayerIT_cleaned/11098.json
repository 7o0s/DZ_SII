The technical sector of In Search of the Treasure is not particularly surprising: it maintains the same, very high quality of Weapons of Destruction, but the surprise effect has diminished, we are now used to the graphic virtuosity of Insomniac and this mini-episode essentially adds nothing new , indeed it appears resized, with a greater frequency of indoor sessions and less breathtaking views. The three-dimensional modeling of protagonists and enemies is absolutely perfect as always, and once again the cinematic works of Pixar come to mind: the artists of Insomniac are confirmed among the best around. Excellent animations, for a change, granite frame-rate, graphic effects as if it were raining. Yet, it lacks that grandiose something that characterized Weapons of Destruction. The plot is also proportionate to the size of this episode: without going into detail, Treasure Search will delve into some themes introduced in Weapons of Destruction, especially concerning Captain Slag and, of course, the Zoni who ~kidnapped~ Clank. The meat in the fire thrown for the real sequel is a lot, and as always the excellent dubbing in Italian - as well as the excellent soundtrack - help to make the narrative truly captivating. More of the same? Treasure Search maintains the same mix of puzzle and action that we have come to love in the various episodes of Ratchet & Clank, even if in a more moderate way, certainly consistent with the lower caliber of this chapter. The progression loses a bit that sense of freedom that characterized Weapons of Destruction in favor of a decidedly more linear conduct, in which the player finds himself destroying hordes of enemies and solving some puzzles in a perhaps somewhat repetitive, although always fun way and pressing, a sensation certainly exacerbated by the lack of sessions other than platforming: in fact, there are no vehicles to drive or similar amenities. Some puzzles turn out to be very intelligent and make use of some new weapons, which in reality are very few: almost all the old paraphernalia returns, and it is a pity because a characteristic of the series was to surprise us with each new chapter with unpublished gadgets. The new destructive tools available to Ratchet are therefore excellent, both as a military utility and for their resolving function in some of the most inspired puzzles of the series, but really too few: it is at this moment that we realize how this In Search of the Tesoro is a miniature adventure, which nevertheless maintains the highest quality peaks of the series, without disappointing the casual player or the longtime fan. Ratchet & Clank: Quest for Treasure is available for PlayStation 3. For those who don't have an Internet connection to download the huge amount of data that makes up Treasure Search, it should be remembered that the game is also available for purchase in a box. All in all, the idea of Insomniac was commendable, rather than criticized: while waiting for a new, massive episode, we can gloat with a mini-sequel, at a bargain price, and of excellent quality. Yet the greatest flaw of In Search of the Treasure is its longevity: it is possible to complete the adventure in a handful of hours (four or five, to be generous) and the total lack of Trophies to conquer is disappointing. A brief parenthesis, therefore, but also one of the funniest titles on PlayStation 3: a must-have for fans, a must try - also given the excellent price - for everyone else. Pros Technically at the top Excellent level design Cons Repetitive Too short and not very long-lived Very few new features", "date": "2008-10-28", "grade": null}
