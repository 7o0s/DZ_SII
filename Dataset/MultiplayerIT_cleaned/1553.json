Playing Heaven & Hell I couldn't help but recall even for a moment one of the titles that for me deserves everlasting glory. I'm talking about Black & White, the masterpiece of Peter Molyneux (Lionhead). Have I seen you somewhere before? In this game (for which, among other things, a sequel is planned) the player was invited to take on the role of a neutral deity who, through his intervention with the inhabitants of the villages controlled by him, acquired enormous powers and changed from time to time one's alignment in turn (going from good to bad or vice versa). Righteous or evil conduct affected the flow of the game, transforming one's earthly avatar (a gigantic animal as tall as a building) into a nice, soft and good-natured puppy or a bloodthirsty beast. Thus increasing its power, the divinity could carry on its fight against the opposing gods who infested the territories of the map from time to time. In a mixture between the Tamagotchi concept and the strategic one, B&W probably remains the best title of its kind, loaded with a dynamism, originality and changeability that are truly rare in a single game! A must! Have I seen you somewhere before? I also cannot fail to mention Black&White Italia, the portal that the Multiplayer network hosts among its hosted ranks, entirely dedicated to this masterpiece. Good versus evil, is there anything simpler? The basic idea of the game is common to all RTS: complete the assigned mission by totally defeating the enemy or by achieving objectives such as reaching a certain level of resources or destroying a particular target. And so far we are in the most classic of cases. H&H is set in a land dominated by two immense and totalitarian divine forces, which in the most classic and banal of traditions are Good and Evil. The setting that at first sight would seem to evoke landscapes of biblical memory and typical figures of the Old Testament is in truth nothing more than a cartoony and nice reproduction of a placid world where, if it weren't for the presence of the aforementioned divinities, everything would flow without problems . But problems are not long in coming, precisely because Good and Evil themselves have come to the conclusion that this planet so peaceful and carefree cannot continue to live unaware of the presence of such great divine power. The objective of the two factions is almost identical: to capture the greatest number of souls and to bring the greatest number of humans to their cause. Not being able to act directly on the will of your subjects, you will be given the opportunity to train special figures, the prophets, starting from the subjects who already demonstrate devotion towards you. This is not a definitive transformation: if the negative outcome of a fight or conduct not inclined to your alignment make a prophet lose faith, he will not die but will become human again and most likely will pass on to your opponent. Your spiritual wealth is indicated by the level of mana, through which you can perform any action on earth. Using divine powers costs mana, as does transforming citizens into prophets. Once you get acquainted with the first prophet you will soon learn to dose his powers. Through it you will be able to start the conversion of the villagers by first attracting their attention with tricks and sleight of hand or with some divine manifestation and then move on to the real preaching that will transform your efforts into real conversions. Each citizen lives an independent life from the others and has a bar that indicates the level of faith reached towards the two factions. Once you have reached a good level, it will be enough for you to induce your prophet to preach in the center of the city and you will see your efforts turn into results. A converted citizen will rush to their home and decorate it in your honor, indicating their willingness to help you in your endeavor. Building construction is limited, all you need to do to increase your holdings is convert the inhabitants of humble cottages to your cause. Once all the houses in a village have been converted, total power over the city will be handed over to you. The passage of time will cause day and night to alternate, giving the panorama countless shades of color, but above all giving bonuses to one or the other faction.performance (obviously Good will triumph during the day while Evil will spread at night). Each prophet can count on different powers that will allow you, for example, to build roads to increase the collaboration of your cities or create a handful of soldiers useful in retaliatory actions. Just for the soldiers it is worth spending a few words. In the classic conception, RTS is based on two concepts, namely, the construction of buildings and the physical elimination of opponents. In H&H, as we have already seen, things are slightly different: if on the one hand the player's construction of buildings is limited to very few special structures, on the other hand the militia that you will find yourself leading in the game will not serve you mainly to eliminate your opponents. Yes, because in H&H the real ~enemies~ arranged on the map can actually be counted on the fingers of one hand, and they are mostly the few opposing prophets. Citizens loyal to your antagonist, on the other hand, are nothing more than the goal that you will have to conquer, and you will not have to eliminate them, but convert them! Indeed, if on the one hand the prophets are equipped with the appropriate bar of faith, which indicates when they still believe in your cause, on the other hand, death is not foreseen for the citizens at all, but rather the possibility of passing continuously from one bank to the other. 'other (and we are talking about faith, not tastes ...). The game under the lens. Here then is that the general picture becomes increasingly clear and we discover that H&H actually has very little in common with the usual RTS, if not for the control mode of the characters and the graphic setting (in terms of framing and control interface ). More than Warcraft, it is somewhat reminiscent of Black & White (I lower my head as a sign of religious respect for the aforementioned masterpiece). Having said that, one cannot fail to move on to a more careful analysis of the game, understanding what a title like this really offers the player and on which plate the course is offered. The possibility of choosing whether to follow the proposed campaigns or to choose a single scenario opens up two different paths and two different gaming experiences, because if on the one hand the story and its evolutions, even if not particularly exorbitant, offer a certain variety on the other the single scenario or the randomly generated map suffer from an innate repetitiveness, which, contrary to what is indicated by the developers, seems to nip the longevity of the title. This fact is probably related to the very limited evolutionary range that the game presents. In H&H the production of special units linked to the construction of buildings and upgrades is not foreseen, but, at the most, it links the summoning of particular prophets to the presence of others. Because of this, single-map play without the help of a story ends up being extremely repetitive. By controlling a handful of prophets limited to the seven available for each faction, the only source of variety is represented by the changing of the territory according to your choices and the animations of the characters (really funny). For the rest, the game routine must necessarily always follow the same path and the freedom to be able to choose one's own strategy is truly reduced to historic lows. When you then reach a good level of loyalty from your citizens then you will run into the most classic tussle that will see you as the protagonist in a fight to the last soul with your rival. In fact, the map is usually colored quickly with the two colors that represent the two factions in play and once the point of contact is reached, chaos begins to spread throughout the territory, making control of the game really difficult. The prophets will begin a slow and exhausting struggle for the conquest of the cities, transforming them into real spiritual battlefields. The situation very often degenerates into a chaotic chaos through which it is hoped to be able to bring the greatest number of souls into one's service in order to repress the enemy's attempt at aggression. One last look. Technically we are dealing with a medium-level product. The graphic engine, decidedly outdated, guarantees greater portability of the product, making it reliable even on decidedly low-powered machines. The eternal dilemma that divides the critics on the use of exorbitant graphics engines even when the structure of the game doesn't require it, however, is the basis of my doubts about this game. I personally think I've seen in my career as a gamer and editor an endless string of comparab gamesill with H&H. At the time of the release of Age of Empires 2 for example, although I found myself in front of a title that in many ways could be flawlessly considered a jewel, I criticized the choice made by the developers of not having implemented the possibility of rotating the view along the four isometric projections (to understand the view was unique, inclined and always pointed from the same point with the same angle). This choice is very often applied in order not to disorient the player, who, not being able to count on a fluid rotation, could find a 90 turn of the map at a time annoying. H&H has the same limitation, and it's a shame as the models of the buildings and characters, even if not made with an exuberant technique, have many details, and it would have been fun to be able to enjoy the entire view. A separate discussion must be made for the representation of water which has a rather annoying bug, a characteristic of which is mainly that of making internal boxes of scene elements disappear, such as trees and buildings, which unfortunately silhouette their profile on it. Such a pity! It is also a must to mention the possibility of playing multiplayer up to 8 players at the same time using connections via the Internet or LAN. One last look. Summing up we can say that H&H gets by with full sufficiency, without infamy and without praise. Probably a not too mature audience could particularly appreciate this title, as well as anyone who wants to dive headlong into the eternal struggle between good and evil. What is certain is that a bitter taste remains in the mouth in the face of a game of this kind, which, despite presenting some innovative ideas, has not been able to amaze beyond measure. Pros: Cartoony and cute graphics Attempts to bring a breath of fresh air into a very navigated genre Very direct and simple Cons: Some annoying bugs related to the creation of water In the long run it is repetitive Few upgrades and buildings The panorama of RTS, it is known, has been suffering from a serious form of inflation for some time. Since the middle of the last decade, a period in which this genre began to become popular, the real-time strategy has engulfed a large portion of the PC gaming market. Starting from the beginning, namely from the legendary Dune 2, up to the present day, passing through the WarCraft saga, and not forgetting Age of Empires and Dark Reign, we can easily retrace the entire evolutionary path of this type of game. Now, as is well known, video games have been suffering from a lack of originality for some time now; For this reason, cases of copying and contamination from other genres are not uncommon, as, moreover, it is difficult to come across, in recent times, an innovative genre or a totally revolutionary game. The development of the video game now tends more towards the enhancement of the graphics engines and the growth in terms of performance, perhaps improving fundamentally dated and long-established ideas. For this reason, anyone wishing to enter the field of video game development must inevitably collide with this mere reality. Heaven & Hell is proof of how difficult it is nowadays to produce a competitive and at the same time innovative title by choosing the RTS genre as a battlefield.", "date": "2003-08-28", "grade": null}
