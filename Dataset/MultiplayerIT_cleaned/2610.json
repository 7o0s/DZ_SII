{"name": "Army Men: Lock n Load", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/army-men-lock-n-load.html", "text": "Secret mission into uncharted space Well, forget the amarcord of the introductory hat, that here we have to pull the ears of 3DO for having churned out an absolutely mediocre and poor in bite product. The first mistake that catches the eye is the choice of setting. In practice, the toy soldiers live in a world made to measure for them and will therefore go to fight in plausible and perfectly sized places; made myself clear? No bedrooms or giant garages to recall childhood gaming places as happens, for example, in Toy Commander or in the successful Micromachines series by Codemasters. Of course it is a precise stylistic choice, but in my opinion wrong; in doing so, the sensation is that of playing any warmongering title in which the graphics died of cirrhosis of the liver before creating the textures of the characters. But all this is, alas, only the tip of the iceberg. Virtually all the technical realization makes you cry out for revenge (and testifies to the precarious health of the aforementioned graphics): horrible textures, landscapes made with few polygons and unstable since rather large blocks often disappear without warning and a few steps from your alter ego. Not to mention the frame rate, more lame than that of FIFA '98. There are also numerous bugs: often you will enter areas from which you will no longer be able to exit so even the beta testers were close to death. The controls that alternate some good gimmicks (such as the tank guidance system) with poor achievements are just enough, for example the soldier's walk is among the most imprecise seen in so far videogames. They poisoned the well! It only occurs to me now that I have not yet properly described the part played. I will be telegraphic and pay little attention to form as, after the previous paragraph, most of you will have already left these places. The evil Brown army is preparing to invade the neighboring Green nation (no laughing sun, eh). Your task is to prevent this by throwing yourself in spirit (alone or in the company of some fellow soldiers commanded by the CPU) in a series of missions that are quite different from each other. You go from seek n' destroy the whole play area to protecting a convoy or looking for an entrance etc. The possibility of using vehicles such as tanks and motorcycles also gives some added value to the gameplay but in most cases you will be on foot and alone against the enemy. The latter often finds shelter behind walls and crates before starting to shoot, try to do the same, if not you will not survive for long. From this point of view, the control of the character is quite complete: you can crawl, roll along the 4 canonical directions and alternate the movement view with a subjective one to better aim. In conclusion, Army Men: Lock n' Load is a very mediocre title released like this, just to take advantage of a franchise in a console being scrapped but which in any case does not deserve to spin certain 'stuff'. pros: Tank is quite fun to fly Quite varied cons: Technically awkward Text boxes pop out of the screen! I have a snake in my boot! Surely many of you were once children, confess it. Surely you have spent long afternoons directing living room vs dining room wars with your army of green plastic toy soldiers, perhaps making them fight against Subbuteo players: unarmed yes, but damn hard to drop due to the hemisphere base. You have plunged your frogmen commando into the bathtub filled to the brim to represent a dam to be blown up. You used thread and scraps of fabric from mom's sewing area to make rudimentary parachutes. You secured a firecracker on the shoulders of a suicide bomber to derail the Lima train. You attached a string from the wardrobe to the shelves and you slid over it those toy soldiers who had their arms raised and the rifle held as a pulley. Unforgettable days. Then your uncles gave you your first video game and goodbye to normal childhood... But don't worry! With the Army Men series you will be able to come to terms with your past by merging your miniature armies with the invention everyone is talking about: the video game in a (dare?) playful crossover.", "date": "2001-04-10", "grade": null}
