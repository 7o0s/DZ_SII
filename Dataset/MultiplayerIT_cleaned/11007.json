{"name": "Skate It - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skate-it-recensione.html", "text": "Appearances are deceiving? It must be admitted that Skate It doesn't exactly start off on the right foot. To begin with, the game is based on a not very credible premise aimed at speciously masking some technical limits of EA's production: in fact, to justify the total absence of life in the scenarios (with no pawns, opposing skaters and so on) the developers have opted for an unlikely post-apocalyptic setting, in which the fictitious city of San Vanelona has been destroyed by some unspecified cataclysm, making it a suitable place to make evolutions in peace. Beyond this, Skate It offers unfortunately unattractive cosmetics, daughter of EA's choice to keep the realistic cut of the graphics despite the limited potential of Nintendo hardware compared to Sony and Microsoft. We therefore find ourselves wandering within bare and poorly defined scenarios, having to deal with dull textures and aliasing galore, moving a character with rather good but poor animations in terms of polygonal complexity. All of this, we reiterate, without a living soul to give a pinch of panache to the scenarios: from an aesthetic point of view, therefore, Skate It inexorably loses comparison with a product such as Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip, whose exploitation of a cartoonish style has contributed to the achievement of a much more satisfactory visual quality. However, the comparison with the Ubisoft product offers the EA title the opportunity to highlight one of its best qualities, namely the playful offer for the hardcore audience: Skate It is certainly not a game aimed at casual gamers, either because of its steep learning curve, either due to the nature of the challenges it provides. First of all, the user has the possibility of achieving the objectives in the way he prefers, freely exploiting the resources offered by the scenario: secondly, each mission has two stages of completion, which in general require the achievement of a basic or go well beyond the requests, aiming for the hi-score. Also noteworthy is the MySpot section, which allows you to use the objects unlocked during the main mode (benches, tables, ramps and so on) in order to create a personalized skate park in which to run around at will. Three controllers are enough for me But let's go now to talk about the certainly most intriguing aspect of this Skate It, or rather the control system, which obviously rests heavily on the motion sensor characteristics of the Nintendo console. It must be said that EA could have done better, in the sense that of the three systems available, the only one that works properly is the more classic one, consisting of the Remote + Nunchuck combo: in this way, it is possible to control movements and rotations of the skater using the analog stick, and perform jumps and evolutions using different gestures made by squeezing the Remote. Using only this last device instead drastically reduces the precision of the actions imparted to the digital alter ego: in addition to the excessive inconvenience in performing the 360 in the air, it should be noted that the motion sensor system often takes whistling for fiascos (because especially of a large number of movements that are too similar to each other), making the execution of a particular trick really difficult and frustrating. The situation gets worse when you get on the Balance Board, which evidently wasn't at the forefront of the developers' ideas, given that it guarantees reactivity and precision inversely proportional to the feeling of involvement given by the peripheral: the Remote is held only for the purpose of using the two buttons to accelerate and perform grabs, while movements, rotations and tricks are entirely delegated to the ~scale~, with uninspiring results. It can therefore be said that the use of the Balance Board makes sense only to let off steam in the multiplayer modes, while the Remote + Nunchuck combo proves to be essential to successfully continue in the single career. Which, we reiterate, will certainly give great satisfaction to anyone who has the patience to bang their (virtual) muzzle on the ground several times before properly mastering the complex but satisfying trick system. Comment We must give credit to EA for having remained faithful to the line of the brand and for having brought to Wii a ~serious~ and complete skate simulation, which does not struggle to establish itself as the deepest currently available on the Nintendo console. However, the developers seem to have lost control of the situation a bit during development, ~forgetting~ to populate the game scenarios and not paying enough attention to two of the three control systems availableavailable, including through the Balance Board. Skate It should therefore be recommended to true skate enthusiasts, while those looking for a pick'n'play game would do better to stay away... Pros Deep and complete simulation Good wealth of content Noteworthy soundtack Cons Extremely steep learning curve Impossible with the Balance Board Technically mediocre", "date": "2008-11-28", "grade": null}
