{"name": "Backfirewall: la recensione di un gioco meraviglioso ma solo per chi parla inglese", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/backfirewall-recensone.html", "text": "You know those two or three dialog boxes that pop up when your phone obsessively asks you to update? At that moment you are talking to a software called ~installation assistant~ whose job is precisely to install the new update and delete the old one. This small software, destined to self-destruct, is the protagonist of Backfirewall, a puzzle game set right inside the operating system of a smartphone. With a humorous style somewhere between The Office and Silicon Valley, this game will make any tech lover feel right at home. Developed by Naraven Games and published by All in! Games, Backfirewall is much more than a simple puzzle game: it is a journey through the components, applications and contradictions of the IT processes that govern our smartphones. In the face of a simple graphic style, which could make one think of a poorly finished work, the dubbing (English) shines which makes walking through the memory banks of the RAM or the art galleries of the GPU a truly unique experience. From the point of view of the puzzles, Backfirewall certainly does not intend to revolutionize the genre but its four main mechanics, inspired by the computer world, keep the experience varied and intriguing. The only big flaw of this game is the language barrier: not only is it not available in Italian but its visual and spoken humor is all based on crippling those English terms that we too have learned to absorb in the computer world. In this Backfirewall review we will tell you all the fun this game can give you, as long as you chew a few words of English. An unlikely alliance OS9 is the old operating system that you were sent to replace but that will become the Virgil of your ~Dantesque~ adventure in Backfirewall Backfirewall is the saga of a piece of software, an assistant for installing a new update, destined to be deleted a few minutes after its birth. Not only that: the arrival of a new operating system in a device also means the death of the old one and here we see the premises of an unusual alliance unfold. OS9, the now outdated operating system, and the new Software Setup Assistant decide to embark on a journey around the various phone regions they inhabit to cause as many bugs as possible. Doing so will force the device to reboot and reinstall the old OS9. This plan initially seems reasonable, but it becomes more and more evident that the player (who takes on the role of the Installation Assistant) and OS9 (who acts as Virgil in the ~Dantesque~ adventure by guiding us and explaining what to do) find themselves entangled in a conspiracy much bigger than them. However, the phone's operating system needs an update: many structures are in shambles, some processes have forgotten what they have to do and the central administration has become very slow in processing the simplest requests. OS9, however, is determined to survive and is absolutely convinced that, when he returns to the top, he can put everything right. Clear and simple mechanics In Backfirewall your mission will be to cause as many errors as possible in the operating system of a smartphone Inspired by some functions that we use every day with our devices, the four mechanics with which it is possible to solve the game's puzzles manage to entertain without ever being repetitive. Well explained in the tutorial, these functions are given to the Assistant during installation as sort of ~cheat codes~ available to OS9. The first is the ~delete~ function with which to eliminate some elements of the scenario to reveal hidden resources. The second is ~invert~ and you can imagine it as the possibility of reversing the effect of gravity on a single object. The third is the ~color code~ with which to change the color of objects to make them assume a different function and the fourth is the classic ~duplicate~. The puzzles that these tricks can solve are almost all environmental. You'll have to remove boxes, turn on elevators, color gates and levers in order to activate them and duplicate elements of the environment not with the aim of fixing the system, but trying to break it even more. For this reason, the list of things to do in each setting is made up of phrases such as ~the incoming information management system works perfectly~: this means that your job is to go and sabotage that very system. Most of the levels, then, are exploratory, or composed of an environment that you will have to scour far and wide to cause errors. Some, however, are more linear and transition from one area to another. The Humor Barrier The contrast between old and new in Backfirewall is represented by the contrast between the many colors of an experienced system and the sterile white of a new update There is one group of people who are going to absolutely love this game and that is all those who are tech savvy and enjoy English content. That's because everything from the language of OS9 to the obsession of different apps with what the User does is infused with the language of the tech world and even the pedantic enthusiasm of Apple conferences; those in which everything is revolutionary and never seen to understand each other. Or again, the visualization of certain elements is a joke in itself: logs, textual annotations on the state of a system, for example, take the form of a piece of trunk because in English log is a term with seafaring origins which had to do with a log used to measure the speed of ships. The English dub, on the other hand, is wonderfully characterized, and manages to give each character a unique personality. The British accent of our OS9, then, is very reminiscent of Paul Bettany's voice, so Marvel fans will seem to have a real Jarvis (or Vision) decidedly irreverent to guide them. Unfortunately, all of this loses its effectiveness and impact if the player doesn't speak English, and in an instant Backfirewall turns into a mediocre puzzle game with crude graphics. Adding simple subtitles in Italian could even transform the game into a resource for studying English related to programming.", "date": "2023-01-30", "grade": "8.5"}
