{"name": "Cat Quest 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cat-quest-2-recensione.html", "text": "You wouldn't think it looking at it, unless you have already played the first chapter, but this game represents not only an original but also a very good interpretation of the hack and slash-style action RPG, as we see in this review of Cat Quest II . After a rather successful first experiment in qualitative terms and considering a notable success as a response from the public, the sequel was practically a must, but it is evident how Gentlebros has used the opportunity to make changes to the structure of the game and propose a real evolution, rather than an easy expansion operation with some additional pun on cats and dogs (still widely present, don't worry). The hyper-simplified RPG aspect is reflected in a lightning-fast start to say the least, but this does not mean that there is not a certain depth in Cat Quest 2, which can be discovered even with a certain surprise in its more subtle mechanics only by advancing for a while between quests. The story sees two kings in exile, one of the kingdom of cats (Felingard) and one of that of dogs (Lupus Kingdom) launched on an adventure to regain their rights, usurped by invaders. The doubling of the protagonists already determines some new fundamental characteristics of the game in terms of content and gameplay: this time the setting ranges between the two kingdoms, making the game world extremely large, while the constant use of two characters at the same time determines a different and more complex mechanics in the combat phases, also introducing the possibility of facing the entire game in cooperative multiplayer mode. It is a significant change even in single player, however, because it allows you to build two characters at the same time and develop them with different characteristics from each other, effectively putting us in control of a real party, restricted to only two elements but capable of presenting cooperative dynamics that make the fights more challenging. Like dog and cat Cooperative multiplayer is clearly an always welcome option, but the presence of the two protagonists also makes sense when playing single player, thanks to the possibility of switching control of one or the other at any time and also to a good artificial intelligence in management of the second fighter. The ability to develop the protagonists as warriors specialized in hand-to-hand combat or in ranged combat suggests the evolution of two different and complementary fighters, so as to always be able to count on both the strength of short-range combat and the tactics of the ranged character with attacks magic (which, however, suffers the halving of the hit points as a counterpoint), also considering that the enemies often have different vulnerabilities that prefer one or the other approach. To this variety of fighting styles are added two slots of interchangeable head spells that provide a good variety of choice, which is necessary to face monsters with very different characteristics. Described in words it seems like a rather complex standard RPG combat system, however Cat Quest 2 makes everything particularly simple thanks to an extreme simplification of the control method that seems particularly suitable for the touch screen, delegating everything to quick touches on the screen and with a almost total automation as regards the management of the equipment, so as to make it preferable to use it through the touch screen rather than the controller, obviously also supported in this case as in all Apple Arcade titles. The same ~streamlined~ style characterizes the entire game starting from the same quest and progression system: the two protagonists move from one point to another on the map in a sort of super-simplified open world, carrying out simple quests that essentially require to enter some setting and complete the dungeons to get the rewards and advance in the story. The extent and openness of the map is remarkable, with the possibility of accessing higher-level territories even at an early stage, which can present quite serious challenges. The problem is that, even for the deliberately playful and exaggeratedly ~cute~ style, there is practically no depth as regards the lore of the game, so it is quite difficult to really identify with the game with which you maintain an amused but in a rather superficial relationship, which for an RPG can be a problem. However, Cat Quest 2 remains a genuine action RPG with a cheerful and disengaged spirit, built with great care also as regards the technical realization.", "date": "2019-10-17", "grade": "7.8"}
