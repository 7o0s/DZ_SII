{"name": "Ancient Games", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ancient-games_a.html", "text": "Mayhem Studio is one of the most interesting development teams in the current mobile gaming landscape, made up exclusively of enthusiasts who want to create fun and engaging products, with an eye towards the video games of the 80s and early 90s. Not surprisingly, their catalog has a limited number of titles, perhaps demonstrating the fact that they only embark on the most convincing and valid projects for them. They certainly did an amazing job with the action/RPG Cyberpunk: The Arasaka's Plot, and they didn't follow the ~brain trainer at all costs~ trend. With this new Ancient Games, they give their own personal interpretation of the Olympic Games, inserting them in their original antiquity and devising an extremely simple and immediate control system, which adapts to all competitions. From the game start screen, we can choose whether to tackle the various disciplines in sequence or practice each one individually. There are seven sports that we will have to face: 100-metre run, 110-metre hurdles, long jump, triple jump, javelin throw, fifty-metre freestyle and target shooting. They all share the same basic setting with regards to the controls: we will have to press the 5 key at the exact moment in which our character touches the ground with his feet, rhythmically, to gain the greatest possible speed. In the hundred meters it is a question of doing only this to try to cross the finish line before the other competitors, while in the other disciplines this ~rhythm game~ style approach is accompanied by a second choice of button, which depending on the case serves to activate the ~second phase~. In javelin throwing, for example, the second button must be pressed at the end of the run-up to determine the throw angle. In the obstacle course, however, the second key allows us to jump and must be pressed at a certain distance from each stand. There are also disciplines that disregard this setting, such as target shooting: to hit objects thrown in the air, we will simply have to press the number key that marks them. Before starting the game, the game asks us if we want to activate landscape mode, which actually allows us to enjoy the screen of our mobile in full width, with all the advantages of the case. Technically, the game is simple but well done. The design of the characters is excellent, with each sprite having its own characterization and a good set of animations, unfortunately far from fluid. The background elements are not very numerous, but they are arranged according to a logic that never makes the scenarios appear bare or repetitive. The use of colors is excellent, with a nice alternation of shades that show us the passing of the day. As for the sound, let's say it's very ~80s~, with catchy but somewhat repetitive electronic music. The control system always performs very well, with an immediate and precise response to inputs.
