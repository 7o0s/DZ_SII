{"name": "The Elder Scrolls Online: Elsweyr", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-elder-scrolls-online-elsweyr-recensione.html", "text": "The Elder Scrolls Online has become a strange beast: the ZeniMax Online and Bethesda-branded MMORPG would seem to have abandoned all traditional pretensions, carving out a niche in the space between World of Warcraft-style MMO theme parks and single player RPGs such as The Elder Scrolls. The ~chapters~ experiment worked, in fact: each new update allows you to start all over again, thanks also to the One Tamriel formula which allows you to face the whole adventure, or almost, without following pre-set routes, but only at your own pace . They are standalone micro-expansions that embrace new players like few other MMORPGs can, establishing a good compromise that satisfies both newbies and veterans who love the franchise. In this sense, Elsweyr represents a further experiment which, however, did not completely convince us: in the next few lines we will explain why, referring you to our original review of The Elder Scrolls Online as regards the fundamental game mechanics. The land of the Khajiit If the chapter focused on Morrowind wanted to leverage above all on nostalgic players, recalling the atmospheres of the unforgettable The Elder Scrolls III, this Elsweyr instead seems designed to attract above all a new generation of players, perhaps less accustomed to a genre that, let's face it, by now it is agonizing. Nowadays it is unthinkable to base an entire MMORPG on the multiplayer experience, so much so that those two Ms that stand for Massive Multiplayer are starting to make less and less sense, and the introduction of Delves and Public Dungeons, content for one or two players at most respectively, it clearly clarifies the developer's intentions: to focus more on the ~The Elder Scrolls~ side than on the MMO one. And in this sense, Elsweyr partly succeeds and partly doesn't. ZeniMax Online this time focused on the Khajiit, the fascinating feline species that inhabit Tamriel. Elsweyr allows us to learn more about these catmen and their variants, the bizarre culture that mixes different oriental influences in a single architectural style that explodes above all in the huge city of Rimmen, potentially the new hub of high-level players. The life of the Khajiit is curious and bizarre, their world much less. Forget the ethereal islands of Summerset or the bizarre swamps of Morrowind: Elsweyr is a barren and desert wasteland perhaps even a little too realistic. Though well constructed, this new region didn't particularly impress us; on the contrary, it seemed to us a bit trivial and without great high notes. Fortunately, the missions that enrich the lore of The Elder Scrolls are of a completely different kind, even if they don't always hit the target. It was in particular the main storyline that disappointed us not a little: too fragmentary and obvious, it loses its bite and alternates with much more articulated and exciting secondary missions. The fault is undoubtedly the approach chosen by ZeniMax for this chapter: the storyline will be divided into a series of updates which, together, will mark the so-called year of the dragon. Thus, however, the inconclusiveness of this storyline in the making is immediately felt, and it is a pity because if there is one thing that distinguishes The Elder Scrolls Online from other MMORPGs, it is precisely the writing, furthermore embellished by the complete English-language dubbing of every dialogue. We lived hilarious adventures in the company of hungover magical cats that entertained us much more than the usual epic undertaking, even if the possibility of playing each mission alone, without necessarily having to look for a group as in the most classic MMORPGs, reminded us the sensations experienced in the traditional The Elder Scrolls. However, those who love the more collaborative aspect will find the proverbial bread for their teeth in the new twelve-player Trial, Sunspire. Don't call them dragons Elsweyr's storyline revolves around some key figures in the mythology of The Elder Scrolls Online, a mysterious army of the undead and, of course, the much-hyped return of dragons. These gigantic creatures infest the land of the Khajiit and, needless to say, they represent one of the main features of this chapter, but the way ZeniMax implemented them did not convince us at all. Forget the epic one-on-one battles experienced as the Dragonborn in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, because the dragons of Elsweyr are ~world bosses~ that regenerate cyclically, public events that essentially replace the Dark Anchors and Abyssal Geyser already in the game for some time. Completely anonymous, these dragons soar above the wastelands of Elsweyr and occasionally land in predetermined places where they skihand hordes of players to fight them. These clashes are fairly challenging because the dragons are very strong and can knock down even the best equipped player with just a few blows, but they don't require great strategy: within a few hours they have become a continuous ~zerg~ with groups of players moving like a train from one encounter to another, grinding experience points and excellent loot. Overall, dragons have become even more mundane content than Dark Anchors, and certainly much less intense and spectacular than the world bosses we fought, for example, in Guild Wars 2. Probably their deadly strength also serves to give greater prominence to the new Necromancer class, selectable from the start and decidedly versatile. The Necromancer can in fact draw on the corpses of enemies and defeated players to enhance his skills and the three branches that distinguish his spells - Bone Tyrant, Grave Lord and Living Death - allow for a variety of builds designed to tank, deal damage and even heal . We must admit, however, that after playing a few hours and unlocking a good number of skills, the Necromancer began to resemble a class like many others. It lacks something, that flicker of originality and individuality that should have made it special, perhaps also due to a certain narrowness in terms of visual effects. It still remains a very fun alternative, especially if you start a new character just to face Elsweyr, but like every other feature in this expansion it runs out of innovation too soon.", "date": "2019-06-23", "grade": "6.5"}
