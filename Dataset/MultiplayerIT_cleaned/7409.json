Conscious of the limited budget, they would have appreciated a mere modernization of the game, with perhaps a few more options than the original edition and some adjustments to the balance of the games. Nothing really revolutionary. The only must-have feature for all was one: online multiplayer. Looking at the vote you will understand by yourself that none of the wishes have been fulfilled. Why are we faced with such a failure? Paradoxically Speedball 2 HD, compared to the 16-bit version, is a worsening, both from a gameplay and visual point of view. What happened? The philosophy behind the product is the same that led to the recent re-edition of The Chaos Engine (always coming from the same team): exploiting the nostalgics of the Amiga scene by proposing one of the most popular titles of the era in which the 16-bit Commodore was on top of the wave. Not bad, and nothing illegal, in our view. The problem is what is actually proposed, and here we are faced with a product that goes beyond the mere commercial logic that justifies it, resulting in profiteering. Speedball is an ultra-violent futuristic sport that pits two teams against each other in futuristic arenas. The aim is to score goals into the opponent's goal to increase the score. The originality of the matches lies in the possibility for the players to give each other a thrashing to get the ball and aim for the goal, while taking advantage of a whole series of bonuses on the pitch. In addition to goals, points are awarded for breaking an opponent's legs or hitting some rebounders, including side stars which, if all lit, give bonus points. The purpose of the career mode is to lead your team to win championships after championships, making it grow by buying stronger players or using gym workouts to improve existing team members. Each player is rated with stars (from one to five). By improving it, the rating grows accordingly. A full five-star squad (the nine on the pitch plus reserves) results in an identical classification for the squad as a whole. Money to improve players can be acquired in only two ways: by winning games and by collecting coins that appear from time to time in the arenas. In short, if you know the original Speedball 2 you will have realized that it is the same game. Unfortunately that's not exactly the case. Rest in peace Can you take a 20-year-old game and make it worse? It seems so. Once again Speedball 2 HD features only renewed graphics, with a few more arenas and greater variety in the characterization of the teams. In general, unfortunately, the work done is not beautiful. Indeed, it is really bad, to the point that we can say without hesitation that the original is definitely more beautiful to look at. It had stripped-down graphics and wasn't high resolution, but at least it was capable of conveying an underlying vision and a sense of stylistic unity. It was enough to look at a screenshot to recognize the touch of the Bitmap Brothers. What about Speedball 2 HD? It's a hodgepodge of squat, poorly drawn and ludicrously animated sprites (the cheer when you cripple an opponent is truly annoying in its ugliness). It would have been better if they had left the graphics of the time intact as was done with the remake of The Chaos Engine. And the gameplay? Well, while playing we noticed something strange. To verify our impressions we briefly replayed the Amiga version. You will be surprised to know that they have managed to make the smoothness of the game worse. No, we are not talking about the frame rate, but about the actions, plagued by inaccuracies in the passes and in the response of the players. Having chosen to keep the controls tied to a single key, players are forced to react in context with the position of the ball and other players. In the original Speedball 2 the system worked quite well, here absolutely not. Several times we found ourselves slipping when instead we had to jump to catch the ball on the fly, or some shots went astray for who knows what adverse fate, taking directions that we hadn't dreamed of giving them. The latter problem is so marked that to score we found it more convenient to carry the ball directly to avoid having to shoot the ball from distance. In short, it is really difficult to build a play, or even hit the rebounders with precision, even if above all, it is the goalkeeper who does not get it rightto. Speedball 2 HD is a kick in the face of memories. Isn't the old classics better left alone? Done suffering? Not yet. Let's also assume that some of the imbalances already present in the original have not been affected in the slightest, and the disaster is over. What are we talking about? For example of the differences between the teams. When you have a team with very strong players, matches against one and two star teams, but also three and four stars, become health walks, to the point that results like 316 to 0 are obtained, which is not a random example but the score of one of the last games we played. The trouble is that the championships in the career mode require you to play many matches against teams of lesser caliber and that, therefore, most of the time you end up sinking into boredom waiting to be able to face a decent challenge. The career mode itself has remained tied to that of the nineties, so it is made up of a series of games in sequence, interspersed with the shopping campaign and... that's it. Team management is really minimal, given that you can only choose the general disposition of the players, deciding for a more offensive or defensive formation. For the rest we are at absolute zero: there is no economic management and there is no simulation, even if only sketchy, of the evolution of the players. Well, let's stay on this last point. Players are monoliths. You buy them, team them up, and they stay there forever without variation. Do they get injured during a game? It doesn't matter, because they will be immediately available in the next match, always in top form. Was it very expensive to work a little on the variety? It's true that Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe was like that, but it was like that on the Amiga, where storage space was scarce and sports games, even arcade ones, were still in their infancy. However, we could have glossed over all the flaws listed (not too much, but we like to dramatize) if the developers had thrown in a single, single option: online multiplayer. Instead nothing. Indeed, the communication on this side was really ambiguous (they specified that the multiplayer is only offline after the protests of the gamers), producing a burning disappointment in many. So, to play with someone else you have to be in front of the same computer... like in the Amiga days. What infinite misery.", "date": "2013-12-12", "grade": "3.0"}
