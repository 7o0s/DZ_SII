{"name": "Gwent: Rogue Mage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gwent-rogue-mage-recensione.html", "text": "The success of The Witcher narrative universe is at an all-time high. Between a videogame trilogy that has captured the attention of millions of gamers and a Netflix series that has given new prominence to the literary saga from which the adventures of Geralt of Rivia and company are drawn, there has never been a better time to be passionate of this extremely mature and brutal fantasy world. Among the various transmedia operations, the one dedicated to Gwent stands out, the card game that conquered the players of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so much so that they clamored for an instance in its own right, which became reality with the video game of the same name. Despite having the opportunity to build your own deck to challenge real players from all over the world, many users have remained faithful to the minigame that appeared in the third chapter of the videogame saga, driven by its non-multiplayer nature. CD Projekt RED has also noticed this trend and has thus delivered to the players a real narrative adventure based on Gwent, Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales. We thought that was the end of it, or that they would give new fuel to this last ~gold vein~, however much appreciated. Instead, almost surprisingly, a new single player experience was released, but with a lesser narrative thrust. Let's see in more detail what it is about in this review of Gwent: Rogue Mage. Reimagined gameplay Gwent: Rogue Mage: the card game goes roguelite Gwent: Rogue Mage is a roguelite based card game that more or less we've all come to know over the years. Anyone who has had the opportunity to experience the short video game history of the latter since the first appearance will know of the profound changes that have invested it. With the release of the online multiplayer title, a sort of ~canon~ has been reached, which has remained more or less unchanged, but the differences are many if you compare it with Thronebreaker and, now, also with Rogue Mage. In this specific case, the rules of the game have been substantially reworked. First, the rounds have disappeared. This means that strategizing by managing one's forces in such a way as to win the ~war~ while yielding some ~battle~ is not a viable prospect here. In fact, the player is forced to play all ten of his cards (five drawn simultaneously at the beginning of the game and another five drawn along as many turns), without the possibility of passing, at least as long as he has something to play in his hand. Another changed element is the absence of the division into classes as in the ~canonical~ game (no more Monsters, Scoia'tael, Nilfgaardians and so on, so to speak). Thus, the cards, while having characteristics and abilities essentially unchanged from the standard Gwent, can influence each other without any restrictions whatsoever. The only limitation imposed is that linked to the starting deck (four in all), which cannot be modified in advance in any way and each one is linked to a specific approach to battle. The initial one is Bulwark, perfect for those who like to upgrade their units rather than directly attacking the enemy. The second is Wild Fury, this much more aggressive, while the third, Hive Mind, is dedicated to those who prefer to numerically crush the enemy. The last one, Caos, is instead the wild card of the game (as the name also suggests). At the beginning of the game, after having selected your own deck, you are asked to choose a fundamental card which joins the other units, providing great support), three spells (which replace the order of the commander that we have come to know and which consume a certain amount of Energy when used) and a potion, a sort of permanent amulet that provides useful bonuses to achieve our goal. But what is our purpose? Gather mutagens to create beings capable of killing monsters that arrived with the Conjunction of the Spheres. Ergo, create the first witchers. A world in constant change Gwent: Rogue Mage: the map of the game, with forks that lead to different types of events You got it right. The (subtle) narrative follows the story of Alzur, the wizard who helped give birth to the witchers to ~fight monsters with other monsters~. Our goal is to collect three types of mutagens (which we summarize here hastily and iconically with the colors Green, Red and Blue) to give life to our ~experiment~, which turns out to be more complex than expected. To obtain these precious ingredients, Alzur must set out on an adventure through the regions of the Continent, in search of wondrous creatures to defeat. This translates, at the video leveludico, in a map (visually always the same) on which several ~markers~ are positioned, each placed on a different fork which will, however, always lead to the final objective: the boss who rewards with the mutagen. Gwent: Rogue Mage: the rules have changed a bit, but the substance remains the same The stages of this journey can be battles or events. The clashes are of two types, either normal or elite (intermediate bosses). In the first case, duels will be engaged with enemies that are not too demanding, but each with a unique special ability that will require a certain amount of tactics from the player. The reward for beating these encounters is to add or remove a card from your deck (both options are based on a choice of three randomly drawn). In the second case, however, the battles will be much more challenging, but the loot will be much more interesting. In fact, the player has the possibility to decide whether to enhance his fundamental card or whether to add a treasure to the deck (that is, a card that will certainly come in handy during the most demanding challenges). As regards the events, however, these are of three types : an event in the truest sense of the word, during which the player will be placed in a dilemma that he can or cannot indulge in order to obtain certain rewards; a place of power, which, depending on the type of sign that distinguishes it, can provide a bonus linked to one's cards or recharge part of the Energy points (useful for spells to be cast during battles and limited to a maximum of one hundred); a chest containing three ~treasure~ cards, among which we can choose only one to add to our arsenal. Gwent: Rogue Mage: each enemy has its own peculiarities, both visual and gameplay If the chosen path takes you to the final boss and, by grace received, you also manage to defeat him, you will get the mutagen. Now what happens? Now it's starting over, over and over, until you've got all three ingredients needed for your cause. What if you get overwhelmed in battle? The same thing. Yes, because this, as the title suggests and as we mentioned, is a roguelite disguised as a card game. Of a roguelite nature Gwent: Rogue Mage: Alzur's laboratory, where you can see your progress and start new adventures Combining the dynamics of the card game with those of the rogue-like game has given a nice refresh to the genre, as demonstrated by the highly acclaimed Inscryption last year. Of course, market saturation is also a reality for these products, but Rogue Mage has revealed itself in a still quite propitious moment, within which it is able to fit without being a heavy or ~already seen~ product. CD Projekt's ~backlash~ took everyone a bit by surprise and the intuition is certainly very lucky. Combining a narrative universe in the limelight with game dynamics with a high replayability rate, all through a series of already widely tested assets and dynamics, was undoubtedly a smart move by the Polish studio. The game was practically already ready (it is no coincidence that it is communicated as a single-player expansion, although it is not necessary to own any other Gwent-related title). What they had to build is the frame that surrounds it. Gwent: Rogue Mage: Player choices will heavily affect the success of the expedition To achieve our goal it is necessary to fail. It is not possible to proceed without losing some games. This is because, being a roguelite and not a roguelike, by playing you accumulate points which will then converge, at the end of the game, in level advancement. Each level (one hundred in all) allows you to unlock new cards, potions, spells and decks that will help us deal with the enemies that stand between us and the mutagens with less and less difficulty. Each game always starts with the same basic cards from your deck, which will expand as we make our way on the game board. This brings luck to influence only in the more advanced sections of the game, when victory can really depend on the absence or presence of a certain card. Sometimes you will prevail, other times you will be defeated miserably. But, compared to other exponents of the genre, the gap between chance, strategy and experience is very narrow, not making the player feel excessively frustrated and leading to that ~one leads to another~ effect that pushes you to immediately return to the field. In this case, the duration of a complete game (that is, until the boss is overwhelmed), which is around forty minutes, also helps. Visually a step back? Gwent: Rogue Mage: There that the game introduces visually seems a bit unrelated to the standards of the franchise If Gwent had given us an extremely recognizable and clean audiovisual style, Thronebreaker had spoiled us for everything concerning the game world and interface. As a result, we were a little blown away by Rogue Mage's visual implementations. In general, the game is very charming, but the credit belongs solely to what derives from the previous two productions. Each element added by the game itself remains very subdued compared to what has been ~recovered~, so much so that it almost seems like a separate title, with two natures that coexist in a somewhat daring way. It could be said that it also had to come out on mobile to justify the graphic quality that cloaks it, but here we are beyond that type of limitation (also because both Gwent and Thronebreaker thrive on smartphones). Rogue Mage is really a stylistic problem; it detaches itself from the almost cartoonish style, with very marked features, to go more on the ~photorealistic~ (in the sense of physically adhering to a realm more pertinent to reality), which compromises its character not so much as an independent work, but as a global work (after all, it's still an expansion). This dual nature made us turn up our noses, but the soundtrack catapulted us back into a chaos that is both familiar and unknown at the same time, with suggestive songs, which give the adequate charge to overcome any type of adversity the game throws at us.", "date": "2022-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
