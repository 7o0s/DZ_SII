The lack of physical controls seemed like an insurmountable obstacle; after all, the virtual sticks present in the various action games could hardly interpret the input relating to the four directions well, let alone the ~crescents~ that have always characterized this kind of product. In short, the advent of the Capcom title has shown that not only are Apple devices capable of handling excellent bitmap graphics and a certain amount of animations, but also and above all of being able to accommodate the evolutions necessary to perform special moves and super , thanks to an implementation of touch controls never so precise and multifaceted. Sure, in some situations SFIV demanded far too much (see the moves based on the rapid alternation of opposite directions) and only made eight characters available, but the presence of an online multiplayer mode in addition to the classic single player guaranteed a truly exciting experience for fighting game fans in dating. A little over a year later, SNK also arrives on the iOS platform with The King of Fighters-i, which in many ways presents itself as a reduction of the next The King of Fighters XIII (out at the end of the year on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ) and which therefore offers us the latest interpretation of the tournament born way back in 1991 with the first episode of Fatal Fury. Stronger, guys! The King of Fighters series was born a few years later, in 1994 to be precise, by which time the fighting games developed by SNK for the Neo Geo platform were enjoying a certain popularity among fans. The idea was to create a crossover with all the most famous fighters of the various Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting, including characters from different productions in the roster, such as the action platformer Psycho Soldier and the classic shooter Ikari Warriors. Thus a ~universe~ was created in which all these characters coexisted, similar to what was done by the great American comics houses, as well as by Capcom itself. Since then, much water has passed under the bridge, the genre of beat'em-up meetings no longer enjoys the same following but continues, albeit in small steps, to evolve. And with The King of Fighters-i touch reduction, it proves that it is also interested in Apple devices. Fourteen characters present, in a mix of old acquaintances (the brothers Terry and Andy Bogard, the friend Joe Higashi, the Japanese team composed of Kyo Kusanagi, Goro Daimon and Benimaru Nikaido, the women's team with Mai Shiranui, King and Yuri Sakazaki , as well as the outsider Billy Kane) and new arrivals (the powerful Maxima, the mysterious K', the little Kula Diamond and the boss Ash Crimsom), to be used through three single player modes: Team Battle, in which a team of three characters and fight to the bitter end against the other teams; Single Battle, with matches consisting of three rounds for a single selected character; Endless, the classic survival in which you have to defeat as many opponents as possible by counting on a single energy bar. Unfortunately, there is no online multiplayer mode (at the moment it is only possible to challenge a friend via bluetooth), in fact the biggest limitation of this production, while the points and money earned in battle can be spent to unlock ~historical~ images from the SNK series , trading cards and more. Finally, the possibility of saving up to three replays of our fights, as well as sharing them with friends who own the game, is very interesting. Victory is mine The control system of The King of Fighters-i consists of a virtual analog stick placed on the left side of the touch screen, while on the right are the buttons P (punch), K (kick), E (evade), S ( special) and HD (hyper drives). It is possible to perform the special moves using the original combinations, therefore drawing the various crescents with the stick, or using the Special button for a simplified execution based on the direction in which we move. The vital energy bar is accompanied by two further indicators, which regulate the execution of the super and hyper drive mode, with the latter allowing us to inflict greater damage for a limited period of time. The developers have intelligently mixed ~sacred~ and ~profane~ elements, in this case the simplification of the specials is not an end in itself but constitutes a further possibility on certain occasions, when perhaps we cannot risk that the combination of the stick is not correctly implemented orure when we want to perform more effective specials than usual, capable of breaking the opponent's defense. The typical dynamics of the series have been brought to the iPhone in a faithful way, and the slight lowering of the difficulty to the normal level does not constitute an obstacle to the usability of the experience. Rather, it would have been nice to insert slightly richer endings instead of a single image (albeit different from time to time), considering the exclusively single player nature of the product. On the technical implementation front, there's really something to be happy about: apart from the music, generally of little impact, the game boasts excellent graphics in terms of quality and quantity, with animations on average more fluid than those seen in the portable reduction of Street Fighter IV. The touches of class are even present: Mai Shiranui's breasts that dance on any occasion, King's clothes that tear if we defeat the girl with a special move, and so on. Sorry for the static nature of the scenarios, but expecting animations in that area too would perhaps have been excessive (and in any case, the backgrounds in SFIV are not animated either). Let's be content with the variety and great drawing style. The tested version is 1.0.0 Price: 5.99 App Store links", "date": "2011-07-14", "grade": "8.0"}
