But it also serves to interact in a new and unprecedented way with the virtual worlds created by the console, just as happens in this very tender Kinectimals, a game designed for the little ones and for all those who want simple and carefree healthy entertainment, far from the canonical shooters and action games that usually invade our living rooms. Kinectimals is a title halfway between Nintendogs and an adventure that leads us to the discovery of a truly well-characterized island, alive and beautiful to breathe. Super Puppies, to me! The game is set on the island of Lemuria, in the near past inhabited by Captain Jack Zampa and his crew, before they decided to set sail to discover new islands and left a wonderful litter of tender baby cats near the camps. As soon as we land, a funny creature halfway between a rodent and a butterfly does the honors for us: the friendly ~Bumblebee~ accompanies us for the entire duration of the game and will let us discover every remote corner of Lemuria. The game begins by choosing the feline we like most, selecting it from a series of species including tiger cubs, lions, leopards and so on, and then starting to play with it and cuddle it thanks to the direct interaction of our hands and body due to the sensor Kinect. We can therefore pet our big cat, brush him, feed him, but also teach him moves such as jumping, rolling on the ground, making numerous poses... simply by mimicking them in front of our TV, he will imitate us by doing the same. In these situations the precision and responsiveness of Kinect is amazing, proving to be an incredibly reliable and fun tool. The game continues slowly by discovering previously unexplored pieces of the island and advancing on the map (which we find inside our wooden house); in every place we go new attractions and amusements are discovered: playing with frisbee, jumping rope, controlling radio-controlled cars, knocking down targets or cans by throwing balls and other types of objects at them. This last action, to tell the truth, is instead quite imprecise and difficult to maneuver as one would like, making the direction of the balls thrown a rather random action more than desired by our aim. However, Kinectimals is a sort of ~handbook~ of the best Kinect has to offer, managing to exploit the magical Xbox 360 camera in many different and always new ways. The mini-game in which we have to look for treasures and where it is necessary to literally move in the physical space around us to see the on-screen view rotate accordingly, making visible what was previously hidden is also very nice. Lemuria is full of secrets Kinectimals has no claim to entertain an adult audience, but rather to appeal to children and why not their parents who will help them during the game. From this point of view, the title succeeds perfectly in its intent, resulting very relaxing and pleasant during the (short) game sessions. Kinectimals is not the kind of title that has unlimited longevity and a soft and constantly upwards learning curve: right from the start everyone is able to master the controls, and the mini-games, once they've all been played and replayed , they lose their appeal a lot. In fact, there is no multiplayer component (if we obviously exclude the fact of taking turns in front of the screen), much less the desire to have online modes. The characterization of our nice travel companions is wonderfully tender and spot on, managing to create nice felines, very expressive and also very beautiful to look at. The general realization of the island and all its most hidden corners is also very beautiful: full of details, animated, full of objects, plants, animals and things to see, it is extremely captivating and credible. A real oasis of tranquility and leisure for the whole family. In Kinectimals it is also possible to ~scan~ the tags of the soft toys found in special editions or linked to some promotions of specific retailers, so as to ~materialize~ our real stuffed puppy on the screen, with the wonder and amazement of those who are watching! The idea, decidedly ingenious and certainly taken from the ancient Kinect presentation videos, still works in a immature way as the camera has a fair amount of trouble recognizing the tags in normal light conditions. Kinectimals, in any case, represents a real summary of allthe potential that the new camera for Xbox 360 contains: some are made really well, others less so, but the title is in any case extremely enjoyable and... tender as a cuddly toy! Comment The puppies are very tender and well characterized The island is alive and full of things to do Many games are fun thanks to the Kinect Some other games are less well done The title is very short No way to play together with other people", "date": "2010-11-23", "grade": null}
