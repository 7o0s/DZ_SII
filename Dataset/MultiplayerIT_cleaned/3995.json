NIS America for its part still has two arrows that are simply perfect for its bow, and it has decided to shoot them at the same time. Yomawari: Night Alone and Yomawari: Midnight Shadows will be back these days on PlayStation 4 and for the first time also on Nintendo Switch, in a collection with a very clear and evocative title: Yomawari: The Long Night Collection. And waiting for the protagonists of the titles there will be a long, seemingly endless night, from which they may never return. If you are afraid of the dark, we advise you not to continue reading our review. Plot: little girls and oriental nightmares Yomawari: The Long Night Collection includes two relatively recent titles, Yomawari: Night Alone (2016) and Yomawari: Midnight Shadows (2017), both the work of Nippon Ichi and the visionary mind of developer Yu Mizokami. Although set in different times and places, the two titles are thematically similar: both start from a precise point, the fear of the dark and of the creatures that hide there, and develop it by telling the story of two different girls looking for a person dear to them. In Yomawari: Night Alone the little nameless protagonist has just lost her dog Poro, when her older sister decides to run to look for him. Thus he ends up losing her too, and to find her he will find himself immersed in a waking nightmare: the small rural Japanese town where they live seems inhabited, after sunset, by hostile creatures, taken from the most horrendous fairy tales of the Japanese tradition. Between hasty escapes, cunning diversions and heart-pounding explorations, the protagonist will take between six and seven hours of play to find her sister. While Yomawari: Night Alone has an original central idea and a gameplay realization that is also decidedly fresh (at least, it was two years ago), the same cannot be said for its successor, namely Yomawari: Midnight Shadows. Of the latter, the narrative premise cannot fail to seem too similar to that of the predecessor, with two friends separated at sunset who must find themselves in an equally recognizable Japanese village. Half of the proposed situations will seem familiar to the player and there aren't really new ideas, but that doesn't mean that Haru and Yui's story isn't worth living either, considering the title an evolution and enhancement of the previous idea. It is from the point of view of the disturbing game atmospheres and the charisma of delicately hand-drawn macabre places, always seasoned with that touch of tenderness of the silhouettes of the protagonists, that Yomawari: Night Alone and Yomawari: Midnight Shadows are once again winners. All this before even considering a gameplay based on a few ideas, but solid and decidedly successful: we are still talking about two games that are experienced all in one go, with the lump constantly in the throat. Gameplay: observe, explore, hide The game formula of Yomawari: The Long Night Collection is identical for both titles present and consists of a survival horror expertly mixed with some puzzle game elements. The protagonists of Yomawari: Night Alone and Yomawari: Midnight Shadows suddenly find themselves immersed in a nightmarish environment, inhabited by horrible and extremely lethal monsters; there is no health bar, just one tap from enemies and it's game over. The player then finds himself grappling with a fairly large and varied setting, which will gradually reveal itself and gradually record new places and paths at a time, during the exploratory sessions. A quick look at the game map is essential in order not to get lost or run into alleys inhabited by too fast and violent enemies; on the other hand, most of them will be unlocked as you continue in the main story, so if a particular road seems impossible to you, it's probably because it must be like this for now, and your goal is elsewhere. From time to time there will be some important key object to find in order to continue, within a narrative that all in all does not have who knows what depth or important turning point. The highlight of the experience is instead represented by the perennial tension in which the player is enveloped, guaranteed among other things in an excellent way by some important choices in the sound sector. There is no main theme music, nor proper audio tracks: the audio of Yomawari: The Long Night Collection playsinstead on the noise of the wind in the foliage, on the steps of the protagonist on the paved avenues, on the accelerated beat of her heart, the only true indicator of an imminent danger or of an approaching monster. This idea is effectively accompanied by a gameplay based on trial and error in its most basic sense: learning the movements of the enemies within a specific path in order not to die a second time when facing it. It's a pity that despite the very fascinating and intriguing first moments of the game (for some even frustrating, given that the game explains very little of its mechanics), the offer of titles gradually stabilizes without great additional ideas or variations of any kind, part those of the scenarios and game environments.", "date": "2018-10-23", "grade": "7.5"}
