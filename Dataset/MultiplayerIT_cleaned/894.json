{"name": "MX vs ATV Unleashed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mx-vs-atv-unleashed.html", "text": "The substance The internal developers of THQ evidently pay attention to the point and, perhaps to break a tradition that distinguished titles of low caliber, have not included in MX vs ATV Unleashed the classic filmed introduction depicting hordes of enthusiastic centaurs who produce themselves in jumps from thirty meters to then land on the gums. We were saying, they pay attention to the point: you immediately enter the spirit of the game, when you are faced with dozens of options to give life to games that are different from each other. It is obviously possible to rocket off with the so-called ~fast rides~, perhaps to familiarize yourself with the control system, but in reality there is no need: MX vs ATV Unleashed is not a simulation, and to take your vehicle further the finish line just understand what is needed and what is not, in a few seconds. The vehicles turn like a beauty, which will be unrealistic but allows us to build our advantage in the tight corners, cutting the trajectory to gain meters on the opponents. In jumps it is essential to manage the suspension, in order to fly further and land safely. Finally, it is possible to use the clutch whenever a sprint is needed from a standstill As the title suggests, in MX vs ATV Unleashed we will find ourselves driving two types of vehicle: motocross bikes and quad bikes. However, as we win races and earn points, we will be able to try our hand at racing driving the most improbable vehicles: electric cars, off-road vehicles, airplanes and even helicopters. As out of place as it may seem (and completely beyond the conception of realism), it is a lively alternative to normal gameplay, which never hurts. The tournaments that can be played, in fact, do not offer a great variety, especially when one realizes that the tricks and spectacular stunts are of little use for the purposes of the game. [C] Generally the jumps are much faster. so tall... Racing with vehicles like this; big is fun, but not for long. The dynamics of the races are unique. always the same. [/C] The appearance If MX vs ATV Unleashed lacks the filmed intro, there is instead a signed soundtrack, as per tradition for titles of the genre. And so in the race it is possible to listen to more or less famous songs, which will make the happiness of those who like the rock genre (let's call it that). Unfortunately, the songs in question fail to completely obscure the sound effects of the game, which are firstly few and secondly scarce. An almost analogous argument can be made for the graphics, which can be defined as functional but nothing more: the engine that moves the polygons on the screen doesn't have a lot of work to do, given the number of objects to manage, and yet every now and then there are drops in the frame rate, which already normally does not represent the state of the art. On one occasion the game even got stuck in a curve, but it could easily depend on the ~promo~ copy in our possession. The animations of the pilots are nothing special and the general level of detail is poor. The effects are lacking, and in the overall picture the only good thing is the lack of pop-ups. It must be said that the tracks are quite varied and ~clear~ in the trajectories to follow, however. Comment Probably selling a game like MX vs ATV Unleashed in the USA is a bit like selling FIFA Street in Italy: the theme and the soundtrack literally turn a blind eye to the flaws, in these cases. Unfortunately, however, motocross and quad bike racing are not very successful here (indeed, they practically do not exist), and the musical attraction has nothing to do with what a well-made video game should provide. The driving model is arcade, and the races tend to be repetitive, even if very numerous. The addition of variations on the theme, even and above all absurd, manages to break the boredom but does not transform this title into something desirable for two-wheel fans. In this sense, there is a tendency to prefer a more ~classic~ product, perhaps less spectacular but with a better technical realization. This doesn't mean that MX vs ATV Unleashed can't be a good pastime for those who love dirt track racing, but it certainly isn't the best representative of the genre. Pros: Lots of game modes Signature soundtrack Cons: Poor graphics Repetitive Poor sound effects MX vs ATV Unleashed belongs to a category of videogames with well-defined traits, which every year gives life to a new title, in the eternal search for a balance between appearance and substance. These are products that certainly have a very specific target in the States, as well as a ~hard core~ of enthusiasts, but which here end up representingre a second choice (if not a third) for the gamer who does not buy at random.
