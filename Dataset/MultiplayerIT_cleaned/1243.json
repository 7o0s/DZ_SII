{"name": "Rygar: The Legendary Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rygar-the-legendary-adventure-2.html", "text": "Diskarmor The combination with Devil May Cry is perhaps acceptable in observing the shots, but for everything else we are definitely off track. In fact, the evocativeness of the settings, this time without fantasy lands and with passages that recall the delicacy and beauty of the world of ancient Greece, as well as the characterization of the horrid enemies that we would once again find ourselves facing, probably surpass the look somewhere between the old and the modern post of the Capcom title (but it's still a matter of taste). Even comparing the two characters is at least a risky move: while not denying the charisma and breath of originality brought by the half-demon Dante, the charm of Rygar's hero has also remained unchanged since, more than a decade ago, he was a humble sprite that ran and jumped wildly. Seeing him at work in the extermination of monsters attached to his Diskarmor rather than to his life is a joy for the eyes, in fact he will be vulnerable only when his weapon goes on the attack and seems to take on a life of its own. Graphics, gameplay, flaws On a technical level Rygar is one of the best games that have appeared so far on PlayStation 2: as I mentioned before, the Greek-like world created by Tecmo will make your eyes widen more than once, as well as the bright colors and the splendid textures, with a frame fixed rate on 60 frames per second which will make the game fluid in any situation, despite the complexity of the settings or situations. The sound is impeccable, with hard and bombastic musical effects and themes, probably less light-hearted than those of the original title. Playability stands at high levels, and this is above all due to the intelligent structure of the game: there is curiosity in discovering what awaits us moving forward, just as the system of combos and personalized moves that the programmers have given to the 3 different types of Diskarmor available, with the ability to cast a summon that will shred all monsters on screen similar to a smart bomb. As defects we could pinpoint some ingenuity in the structure of the game, even if in any case we hardly notice it, but perhaps the only real problem lies in the fact that our character is vulnerable to enemy attacks in the event that his Diskarmor fails his own move: if you think about it, though, this is a feature that hasn't changed since the first game, so it's not really a programming flaw. Comment Rygar has always been one of my favorite games and it's finally time for a big comeback. It also has the advantage of being equipped with real structural changes compared to the old title which are not present in the very recent re-editions of Contra and Shinobi. Highly recommended. Pros: technically excellent many hours of fun great atmosphere Cons: some structural flaws few incentives once completed A long time ago... Diskarmor, Tecmo, Rygar Words that bring to mind a sunny afternoon at least 10 years ago, when I went to my trusted shopkeeper at the time to buy the game conversion for Nes, together with a copy of Cobra Triangle, if I don't remember wrong. To be precise though, Rygar and his world had been created by Tecmo about 6 years earlier: it was a rather unusual platformer for the times, full of various innovative elements such as the parallactic sections to switch from one area to another or the elements of interactions with ~the great sages~ scattered throughout the lands visited by the protagonist. A lot of water has passed under the bridge, but this return has fully met the expectations of most players, satisfying both the faction of the most inveterate old fans and that of newbies who approached the game for the first time, perhaps combining it with a title like Devil May Cry.", "date": "2004-07-23", "grade": null}
