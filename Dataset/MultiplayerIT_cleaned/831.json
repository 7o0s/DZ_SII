{"name": "Lumines: Puzzle x Music", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lumines-puzzle-x-music.html", "text": "Puzzle x Music Before moving on to a more in-depth analysis of Lumines, it is good to illustrate the puzzle mechanics of the game. At first glance, the title vaguely resembles Tetris: you will find yourself in a grid made up of 16x10 small squares, which will host blocks formed in turn by four tiles. These pieces can be of two different colors, positioned in all possible combinations, and the ultimate goal is to form blocks of at least 4 pieces of the same color, always on the grid, arranged in a square. The possibility of creating more complex shapes will not be precluded, but the minimum prerequisite for eliminating them from the playing field is always the one mentioned a few lines above. Once you have fully mastered the basic mechanics, it will also not be uncommon to perform real combos that also involve 9 or 10 blocks. The possibility of performing these combos is given by the fact that the squares thus formed will not be eliminated immediately, but only after the passage of an indicator placed at the top of the screen, which will scan the playing area in a timed and sequential manner. The game will be considered lost when the whole grid is filled and there will be no more space for further tiles, the difficulty instead is sanctioned among other things by the different speed with which the blocks will fall and by that of the indicator, which will be related to the skin with which we are playing. Yes, because for Sony's newborn portable console, the choice fell on a puzzle game that also marries its remarkable multimedia capabilities, giving back a gaming experience that goes beyond the involvement derived from a successful puzzle mechanic, but which seeks to completely immerse the player by touching all the senses. The distinguishing feature of Lumines is the integration between gameplay, graphics and sound that forms the background. In fact, each skin ~dresses~ the game grid, starting from the animated background and the textures of the tiles, up to the backing track, whose beats per minute will also determine the speed of the time indicator which erases the square tiles of the same color . Whenever we rotate a block or place it on the playing field, we will emit a sound that will increase the musical base. Instead, when we delete one or more series of blocks, we will enrich the backing track with a new track (sung or not) and the background with graphic effects. The skins therefore do not represent a mere accessory graphic tinsel, but are an integral part of the gaming experience, regulating the difficulty, involvement and grip on the player. There are 40 of them, unlockable by continuing in the various modes (which we will explain in the next paragraph) and represent a strong component that increases the longevity of the title. For the musical part, Mizuguchi relied on Mondo Grosso and Eri Nobuchika, with pieces that alternate between industrial and electronica. trance and other musical genres, in some ways similar in tendency to those present in the never too praised Rez. There's no shortage of sung songs (Shinin' and Shake your body above all) that slavishly follow graphics (but it would be better to say the opposite) and player interaction, guaranteeing a musical experience on a par with the visual and purely playful one. Trance Experience Lumines is structured in different modes, both single and multiplayer. In the first case we have the challenge mode as the main fulcrum, in which we will have our avatar on the screen and some statistics such as the duration of the game, the score and the number of blocks eliminated. Every few points we will level up, and every 4 levels (they should be more than 100, we have reached 90) the skin will change, which will be added to the list of available ones. In the mode called single skin we will in fact be able to dabble, without time limits and until we lose, in one of the unlocked skins, according to the more classic free mode. However, this mode will never prove to be so interesting, precisely because each skin has different graphics and sounds, which are integral parts of the game. There is also the presence of the time attack, in which we will have to eliminate as many blocks as possible in a predefined period of time. The skins therefore do not represent a mere accessory graphic tinsel, but are an integral part of the gaming experience, regulating the difficulty, involvement and grip on the player. Trance Experience In multiplayer mode, however, it will be possible to challenge the cpu in different settings: the screen will initially be divided in half and the fastest player (i.e. the one who will eliminate the most blocks) will steal space from the opponent, leaving only a small space available. portion of the grill. Whoever remains in the game wins and, continuing trAt the various challenges, we will add the unlocked skin to our ~collection~. The same challenge can be repeated with other players equipped with PSP, via Wi-Fi and the specific mode present in the game. The last option present is the one called ~puzzle~, in which the aim is to replicate some figures represented on the screen, cut out by empty or other colored tiles. If you are not satisfied with our review and images, a live video of the game is available, over 6 minutes long! It was very difficult to associate a numerical evaluation to Lumines, but in the end we decided to reward its objective value and the creative genius of its creator. Of course, it's not a title for everyone, but those who know how to appreciate this atypical way of making video games will find a real playful experience, made up of an excellent puzzle game, which reaches peaks of excellence thanks to the perfect integration between gameplay, graphics and sound. The skins and game mechanics will keep the player glued for hours and hours to the small PSP screen, for a title that together with Ridge Racers represents an overbearing business card for the new Sony portable console. There is only one contraindication: you may find yourself imagining that you are fitting pieces together while watching TV or talking to people, we have warned you. Pros Fresh and additive game mechanics Engaging audio/video compartment Lots of skins to unlock and use Cons It's an atypical puzzle game, but is it to be considered a defect? There are different ways of making video games, which follow a classic or less conventional approach, as in the case of the one undertaken by Tetsuya Mizuguchi. A true videogame author, we find this famous designer and producer behind titles of the caliber of Sega Rally, Space Channel Five and Rez which represent, especially in the last two cases, a videogame expression that seeks to involve the player according to a more sensory. After the forced and reluctant closure of United Game Artists, probably the most artistic division of Sega, Mizuguchi left the glorious Japanese software house forming a brand new one, Q entertainment, which under the Bandai label immediately got to work with Lumines, for PSP, and with the future Meteos, for DS. The ultimate goal is to exploit the characteristics of each console in such a way that the game can represent something more for the player. In fact, according to Mizuguchi, the fulcrum of a successful game, in addition to the standard canons, always remains the gap between the intended use and what the player manages to create. In the spirit that ~when I deliver my final product to a player, the game is no longer just me~.", "date": "2005-09-30", "grade": null}
