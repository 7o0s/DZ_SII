{"name": "Il limite  la fantasia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123178-disney-infinity-il-limite-e-la-fantasia.html", "text": "Infinity is a very important project for Disney Interactive Studios; the part of the multinational founded by the old Walt dedicated to video games has in fact struggled to reap great successes in recent years, making itself known more for the illustrious closures of previously acquired teams (Black Rock, Junction Point and LucasArts) than for the games produced. Mistakenly labeled immediately as ~Disney's Skylanders~, Infinity is instead a profoundly different game from the Activision blockbuster, which finds similarities almost exclusively in the main user target and in the use of statuettes - and not only - to be placed on top of a dedicated portal. Developed by Avalanche Software, a long-lived Utah team but without particular peaks in the curriculum, Disney Infinity is a title with simply enormous potential. Putting it into practice, however, is another thing ... Games in the bedroom Thinking of Disney, what characters come to mind? Probably Mickey and Goofy, or Cinderella, or the Lion King. If you are informed however, you may know that the company also owns Star Wars and Marvel, as well as many cinematic intellectual properties, thus opening the field to another flood of different characters. For the launch of Disney Infinity however, it was chosen to draw only from a few Pixar titles - Cars, The Incredibles, Monsters University - and from the films of The Pirates of the Caribbean and The Lone Ranger; a decision clearly linked to precise marketing choices, but one which nonetheless left us rather dumbfounded. Let me be clear, in the more or less short future the product will undoubtedly be expanded in this sense, and the names of Fantasia, Wreck-It Ralph and Toy Story are already certain, but at the moment the desire to rename the game ~Pixar & Johnny Depp Infinity~ or something like that. Closing the parenthesis, however, let's go back to talking about the game itself, which is basically divided into two different sections: the Toy Box and the Worlds. The first is essentially a huge, ductile and in various respects complex editor within which you can really indulge yourself in a whole series of ways, using objects and elements in overwhelming quantities at times. It's called ~Toy Box~ and in fact the meaning of this modality is similar to that of children of overturning their toys on the ground, perhaps completely different and unrelated to each other, to give life to something with the only limit of one's imagination . There is no set goal, mission or purpose; maybe you can create the castle of your dreams, or a track where you can race cars, or move the view from above to recreate a sort of early GTA (there are those who did it), or put it upside down facing in 2D-like to create a platformer, or create a stadium in which to play football, or make a giant pinball machine and so on. Then there are also the Creative Toys, or rather a sort of switch to be connected with other elements to determine cause-and-effect actions, such as the opening of a door when a platform is pressed, so to speak. The possibilities are really, really many, provided you have imagination, enormous patience and a certain type of predisposition to commit time to an editor (this factor is not taken for granted and not by everyone). Also because, as mentioned a few lines ago, the use of the tools available is not exactly simple: you have to use many often very complex menus, different commands associated with the various keys of the controller, and to put into practice something rewarding you need different hours. Thinking that the average user could be a child around 12 years old, even with all the affinity this could have with video games, it doesn't seem so obvious to us that accessibility is guaranteed in this phase, thus requiring the support of an adult . Then there are some hard to understand defects, such as the fact that the single pieces do not automatically ~hook~ to the next one but must be positioned with meticulous precision with taps of the left stick, or that objects cannot be deleted directly from the editor menu but it is necessary to switch to third-person control of the character and wield a magic wand. On the other hand, the ability to share one's creations online and download those of other users is positive; those who don't have the desire, time and aptitude to engage in creation can in fact enjoy the efforts of others, or directly from the development team, a bit like in the case of Little Big Planet. Disney Infinity has great potential, but the realization is not entirely convincing What to buy? Let's clarify the various components of the Disney Infinity ecosystem that are currently available. First of all there is the Starter Pack ( 69.99), the fundamental starting point that contains thegame, the portal, a Power Disk, the figurines of Mr. Incredible, Jack Sparrow, Sulley and finally the object to access the three Worlds. The latter, while demonstrating considerable affinities in gameplay, differ in some distinctive elements: The Incredibles is focused on combat, Pirates of the Caribbean offers the possibility of using and customizing a galleon, while Monsters University is based more on exploration and stealth. Secondly, there are the Play Sets (29.99) with which to expand the contents. Currently available are the one of The Lone Ranger, based on shooting and horse racing, with the figurines of Tonto and the Lone Ranger, and one of Cars, focused on racing, with Lightning McQueen and Holley Shiftwell. We continue with the additional characters, sold in single ( 12.99) or in triple pack ( 29.99). This is a must-buy for Starter Pack owners who want to play multiplayer. So far there are the Friends (Miss Incredible, Barbossa and Mike), the Villains (Davy Jones, Randall and Syndrome), and then Mater, Francesco, Flash, Violetta. Finally the Tokens, sold in closed packs of 2 pieces (4.99). Dad pays a lot The second section of Disney Infinity is that of the Worlds, in which the theme of the various individual films from which they are taken comes into play heavily. In practice, by placing a special transparent object on the portal, you can access an entire adventure set in a Disney world; in the starter pack, or in the basic package, the Worlds of The Incredibles, The Pirates of the Caribbean and Monsters University are included, together with the statuettes of Mr. Incredible, Jack Sparrow and Sulley. Just like in Skylanders, placing the beautiful statuette on the portal you will see the virtual reproduction of that character appear on the screen as if by magic after a few moments, to be controlled directly. The structure of the missions, while differing in the various cases in addition to the setting as well as the underlying style, largely rests on rather trivial objectives, to be obtained through dialogues with non-player characters, such as the need to reach point X or to collect certain objects. These are adventures - lasting roughly four hours each - which basically mix exploration, combat and platform phases, without however excelling in any of the three categories. It is not, mind you, a snobbish judgment in front of a game aimed at teenagers, but rather a realistic observation of the dull and dull gameplay created by Avalanche Software. Everything becomes more pleasant if played in cooperative thanks to the split screen, but there is a not insignificant obstacle: within the Worlds you can only use statuettes of characters belonging to them, and considering that in the Starter Pack there are there is only one of each ~type~, the two-player option therefore becomes possible only by purchasing other characters separately. Then there are missteps, such as the various bugs present, and design choices that are difficult to digest, such as the excessive complexity and cumbersomeness of the controls and menus. The element of growth of the protagonists is also not very incisive: each figurine can in fact level up by completing the missions, but in practice this leads to absolutely nothing with the exception of obtaining tokens for roulette (in which to obtain pieces for Toy Box) and some details in the Room of Heroes. Even the loss of energy is an irrelevant factor, since any death only involves an immediate reappearance in the exact same point without penalties. Overall, what manages to largely support the progression is above all the element of collection, for the possibility of recovering objects in the adventures to be used later in the Toy Box. Yes, because the elements available in the editor are initially only a handful, and they must be earned by completing the tutorials, using the tokens in roulette, or recovering them in the various Worlds. Too bad that there are objects inside chests that can only be opened by the specific character associated with them, just as there are elements that can only be recovered inside Worlds that can be purchased separately. Finally, there are the Powerk Disks, tokens capable of offering extra qualities to the characters or additional elements for the editor; in this case the sales model is that of closed bags, as with stickers, thus preventing knowing in advance which tokens will be contained in it. It is therefore quite evident that the Starter Pack is only the starting point, which allows you to enjoy just a slice of the entire Disney Infinity offer; for the rest, the wallet must be handed over, potentially making theat a very, very substantial total expense. A last note on the technical component, pleasant even if certainly not exceptional, but which has the merit of being able to give a certain continuity and stylistic coherence to worlds and characters that are often very different from each other.", "date": "2013-09-13", "grade": "7.2"}
