One of the most significant updates was released in early October, when the title was updated to the 2019 season of the Blancpain GT championship. The free patch introduced the Belgian track of Zolder (borrowed from the old Assetto Corsa), as many as six new cars and a new asphalt for the circuits of Barcelona, Spa-Francorchamps and Silverstone. Another major update was released in mid-December; a few days ago it was the turn of the 1.3 release which also brings the first paid DLC, the Assetto Corsa Competizione - Intercontinental GT Pack whose review you are reading. A new league The downloadable content includes fifty new liveries and four unreleased circuits. The feature that unites them is the fact that these are non-European tracks, whereas the Blancpain championship takes place exclusively in Europe. This particular selection was made by Kunos because in doing so it was also possible to introduce the Intercontinental GT Challenge championship, also organized by Stephan Ratel's company. Now in its fourth edition, it is spread over five iconic tracks scattered across as many continents: ours is represented by Spa-Francorchamps (already present in the initial version of Assetto Corsa Competizione). They are all endurance races: in Australia you run for 9 hours, in California for 8, in Belgium for 24, in Japan for 10 and in South Africa for 9. As for the other tracks, Kunos has made use of the Laserscan technology which has allowed reproduce the tracks with a quality bordering on photorealism. Let's explore the new arrivals. Suzuka doesn't need much introduction: it is the scene of the most important duels in the history of motoring. The first part of the track is characterized by a series of fast right/left bends which make the use of a steering wheel (and a pedal set) almost mandatory in order to be tackled at the right pace. In the third sector is the legendary 130R (the one that Leclerc tackled a few months ago by holding the steering wheel with just one hand), another really critical point for driving. Kyalami is a familiar sight for longtime enthusiasts: it was the last circuit to host the South African Formula 1 GP, back in 1993. The 2015 restyling made it similar to Barcelona, especially in the central part; the track is basically flat with several fast corners and wide run-off areas. Laguna Seca is another iconic location: Valentino Rossi's epic overtaking of Casey Stoner in 2008 has entered the annals of motorcycling. The corner where the sporting miracle took place is the legendary Corkscrew, which is the most critical point of this short Californian track. We have kept the real superstar of this DLC for last: it is the historic Bathurst circuit, a town located 200km west of Sydney. Inaugurated way back in 1938, Mount Panorama is a city layout: various houses can only be reached by following a few sections of the track. It is about as far away as there can be compared to modern slopes: an incredible ups and downs (it has a difference in height of 170 meters from the lowest to the highest point) to be tackled at full speed, skimming for a good part of the first and second sector the walls border the very narrow roadway. According to Mark Webber, in shape, it resembles a small Nordschleife. Despite the length of over 6 km, a lap in GT3 takes just over two minutes, just to give an idea of the average speed covered. A super-demanding track that alone deserves the 14.99 required for this DLC. A more mature game Returning to the tracks of Assetto Corsa Competizione after a few months of absence gives back good sensations: the driving experience has been refined and the behavior of the cars has been made even more realistic thanks to the continuous refinements of the physics engine. Over the months, some features that we had complained about were implemented, such as support for three monitors and a greater number of steering wheels. In this regard, it should be remembered that we are talking about a simulation in the strictest sense of the term, therefore a dedicated peripheral is absolutely necessary in order to fully exploit the potential of the software developed by Kunos. The artificial intelligence is also excellent which, at high levels, represents a demanding challenge even for the most experienced. The multiplayer sector, enrichesunpredictability of human behavior, has in turn made considerable progress: compared to the first release, the search for servers is more reactive and it only takes a few seconds to join a rapid event. The challenge rate is quite high, so expect to eat a lot of dust, at least in the first few races. Moving on to the technical part, it seems to us that the new contents have not been correctly implemented: it happened that in matchmaking the computer continued to prefer unpublished tracks rather than those already present, despite the priorities in the customization menu acting differently. These are minor defects that can be circumvented by manually updating the server list and will certainly be corrected in a very short time, as has happened in the past. In conclusion, a quality DLC whose purchase becomes almost mandatory to make the experience of the best GT3 car simulator on the market more complete.", "date": "2020-02-12", "grade": null}
