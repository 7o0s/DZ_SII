{"name": "SSX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ssx-2.html", "text": "Tracks, boards and characters Going back to the game, we can't not talk about the tracks because we have to praise the EA Sports programmers for the splendid technical realization: the tracks are very long, very detailed and full of jumps, parabolic curves and, as already mentioned, shortcuts, which however they are very easy to find at the ~first time~, since you are all taken by the race, and losing a few seconds following a fall to look for a cut is truly disastrous! At this point you will say: is that all? Do you just have to get off without doing anything else? Well no, or rather not exactly, because the aim is to finish first or at least within and no later than the first three, but it is also possible to perform spectacular jumps and tricks which, if performed properly, increase a bar positioned at the bottom on the right of the screen, which is considered as a sort of adrenaline and which can be used to increase the speed of your alter ego by simply pressing a button on the dualshock. As in all other titles of the genre, it is also possible to choose your own character and board from those offered by the game, which to tell the truth are not many at the beginning, but then it is also possible to unlock others together obviously with new clothes , new boards and two new tracks, all obviously on condition that you win the races and perform particular tricks. Ear to the music To conclude, I can't leave out the two main aspects: graphics and playability. Speaking of the first, it must be said that the title is well done, with a few problems (read snap) however of the graphic engine here and there, especially during the sequence that introduces the race. For the rest, if it weren't for the lack of anti-aliasing (a problem common to almost all the titles released up to now) one could speak of the best graphics seen so far for Ps2 but so be it. The playability is instead fantastic and you won't get disconnected from the monitor easily, risking the fusion of your beloved and sweaty console!!! Joking aside, this SSX is just the game that all Ps2 owners should have because it is certainly among the best out there. Oh I forgot to say that the soundtrack is truly exceptional with music by the legendary MixMaster Mike, DJ of the Beastie Boys, and sorry if it's not enough! Arcade - Yes; simulation - No First of all, it must be premised that we are dealing with a purely arcade title (almost a Wipeout with a snowboard) and therefore certainly do not expect a 1080 Snowboarding (of Nintendian memory) nor a Cool Boarders (just to stay within the Sony sphere ... ). The aim of the game is to possibly finish the tracks in front of everyone, as if it were a car race, only that you will find yourself going down very well made long tracks with your board and against opponents who do everything to get ahead of you, and when I'm saying everything, I'm not exaggerating: think that in addition to the classic shortcuts, which incidentally only the computer knows and therefore uses, the various snowboarders won't hesitate to push you to make you lose your balance, almost in Road Rash style (only there, in addition to the pushing and kicking, there were also the chains).", "date": "2000-12-19", "grade": null}
