{"name": "Rainbow Six: Lockdown - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-lockdown-recensione.html", "text": "in short, a complete upheaval Never change a winning team? Let's hope The fundamental aspect on which the saga was based was that of planning: from the main menu we reluctantly realize that it is only possible to select the type of armament of our men. Strangely then, depending on the type of setting, there are only a few variants of protective clothing (while in the previous game you could choose from all the existing types of protection) and it is not even possible to change the soldiers. For a questionable choice to say the least, the game will assign us the characters of the team, limited to four and not divisible into groups or taken for their characteristics; in fact, the experience factor has also disappeared, and the possibility of choosing between the various categories (there are no longer even snipers to position!). This appears as a ridiculous attempt to exalt the members of the team, who however do not enjoy particular presentations or a shred of historical background (as happened previously). To make matters worse, we add that the game maps are divided into sub-maps: in practice, after having cleaned up an area, you will move on to the next one with loading in between. In addition to breaking the action and planning, the technical limitations that led to this decision are not well understood since the levels are short-lived. This adds up to a practically non-existent plot, which only enjoys a few avoidable ~snippets~, sometimes also present in-game: these show the arrival or position of other enemies, completely eliminating the surprise factor. Finally, the difficulty factor has been significantly reduced in favor of an exaggerated number of opponents. Each level is teeming with terrorists, sometimes hidden in the most disparate places. Hence the introduction of saves whenever you want (which for some veterans of the old games is a boon) and yet another element of mass: it is possible to be hit several times before dying (in the past one / two hits were death) , and there are no more ~suffering~ effects such as difficulty breathing from too much smoke (the flashbang blinding amazingly only works if you are too close to the grenade). In short, a complete upheaval. artificial incapacity The management of the team and its operational capacity is pervaded by ups and downs: this time it is possible to indicate a precise point where to send our men (along the lines of Brothers in Arms) and it often becomes a must to keep them going; it often happens that they stay behind and don't move. This involves another more negative than positive news: in many levels it is possible to proceed by keeping the team still and advancing alone often with success! This is due to the reduction of the difficulty factor. Finding ourselves face to face with terrorists involves a ridiculous aim on their part: they often shoot at random without hitting us and, in various situations, they stare at us dazed, allowing themselves to be massacred with impunity. The cases in which small groups of these jump out like a train, ready to be shot at, are not rare. Returning to our men, we can say that they do the cover job decently, even if sometimes they don't really see the enemies. In certain levels there are terminals or other objects to interact with (bombs, PCs, metal detectors). These require a few seconds of transition which can leave us in danger; it is therefore possible to send a man to do the work while we have his back. The list of orders includes the classic commands such as opening/breaking doors, cover, attack. Some cases of ~stupidity~ also occurred on the part of our men, who for example when entering certain areas, turned their backs to the enemy or made other turns exposing themselves to enemy fire (not to mention that in the vicinity of the grenades they remain there ready to blow up). Let's hope for some patches soon... Go-go gadgets! In this last chapter we find some new gadgets with which to arm our men. They range from the positionable flash grenade, which can be placed as a trap on doors or paths (when someone runs into it, the grenade explodes by lighting it) to the phosphorus one (which burns those who are nearby). The night viewer is then joined by the thermal one, which with a very particular effect shows individuals behind walls and doors. The weapons then differ considerably (and God forbid) according to the category, with models of absolute precision or great firepower. In addition to the explosive charges to blow up the doors, our colleagues will be able to use a breakthrough hammer, useful for opening them quickly, even if you run the risk of finding mined elements! Rainbow next... The graphic part has not undergone mchanges compared to the preview version of a short time ago. So let's say it right away: R6 brings next generation tastes to an inadequate engine. The first totally negative aspect concerns the terrorists: their bodies are polygonally obscene, with very few variations in terms of texture. Considering that in some missions more than fifty are killed, one can understand the monotony of shooting anonymous and almost identical individuals. Only the realization of the heads is saved, less angular but with a plastic look. Our men, on the other hand, are well modeled, with embossed weapons and equipment, but also with skin that looks like porcelain. Unfortunately the faces show no emotions and all the characters have ~ice~ eyes, probably due to the protective goggles. Thus one has the sensation of looking at expressionless dolls. Instead, the animations are better, including ragdolls. Shooting a shotgun into a bad guy's chest causes them to fly backwards. This gives satisfaction. As already mentioned in the preview phase, there is no localization of the shots (except for the head); so if you see a foot or an arm appearing, you can take out the opponent with a few bullets on the uncovered part. Very unrealistic. Another note of demerit is the effect of explosions such as grenades: an explosion made of triangles! In positive terms we find the introduction of HDR (High Dynamic Range) which causes the typical effect of when you stare at a light and then look elsewhere, with a brief moment of focus. As a complement there are dynamic shadows, which however do not exist on the objects; it follows that some things seem ~detached~ from the environment in which we find ourselves. There are also effects such as heat distortion, environment models (such as cars) and textures of a certain thickness. The end result sees sometimes photorealistic environments collide with very little detailed elements, giving the idea that many things were created superficially. Probably greater care could have brought Lockdown to levels of excellence, but this gives us the idea of a visually old ~rigged~ new generation title. Havok, this stranger Another innovation for the series is the introduction of physics similar to that proposed by the Havok. Unfortunately this is a half-service application: some objects (smaller ones) can be hit or moved, but only in rare cases. The worst thing is to see a grenade explode under a car and have no effect. A real shame because a proper system, combined with the good ragdoll of the game, could have allowed for some interesting tactics. Rainbow vs. Tango The multiplayer part requires the usual registration on Ubisoft's servers. It is possible to create a character using a certain number of skins and clothes. Once this is done, you can embark on a mission on a dozen maps, in different modes. The challenge possibilities are: ~Recovery~ (a ~conquer the flag~ with a container), All against all (the best one wins), Rivalry (the team that achieves the indicated objectives x first wins), the interesting ~cooperative mission , in which you face the campaign in a team with other human players (Hunting Terrorists is the same thing in single levels) and lastly Team Competitive which basically follows the style of Counter-Strike; it should be noted that in Multiplayer there is no description of the characteristics of the weapons, which therefore, unless you know them perfectly, are chosen at random. Playing with human opponents earns points to the title, especially replaying it with non-CPU-led soldiers alongside. a series that has now entered the myth, transformed back into a game without many pretensions Final comment Lockdown arrives on the market in all the bitter reality of the mass-market. Fans and all lovers of tactical shooters have to face a big disappointment: a series that has now become a legend, transformed back into a game without many pretensions (even in terms of entertainment). Almost total lack of planning, poor AI, exaggerated number of opponents, make this fourth chapter the ~Serious Sam~ of the saga. It now seems clear why the game is sold at a reduced price (29.90 euros) and the doubt arises whether Tom Clancy's games are following the author: for some time he has been dedicated to inferior novels compared to what he has accustomed us to past. Not recommended for those who expected a product with attention to the tactical part, fans can only be satisfied with the new (falsely) next-generation graphics, and all the others can take a look at it and evaluate the purchase (given the affordable price). All that remains is to hope for the new Ghost Recon, which according to many will be a real revolution. Pro Splashes of next generation Voice commands in single player Multiplayer valid with also the cooperative Cons The tactical part disappeared Several bugs Poor AI Breach And Clear! Go! Go! Go! The audio sector sees some music in line with the series appearing in some excited phases. For sound effects you can use Creative's EAX libraries, which significantly increase ambient noise. Strangely, in the version we tested there were mysterious audio disappearances, especially when using guns: it seems to be a problem also linked to the game for sale, which came out with a few too many bugs. Another introduction that sparks on paper is the ability to give voice commands to the team via microphone! However, this requires correct English pronunciation and a keystroke. Some commands then systematically receive rejection by companions who do not want to know (it is specified that the game is not dubbed in Italian, but has a good English dubbing, with the characters changing their accent depending on their country of origin) . To enjoy this function to the fullest, it is important to remember the words to be pronounced well and to have a good microphone. Definitely a new way of interacting that involves a lot! But even here there is still more to do Never change a winning team? Let's hope The Rainbow Six saga can boast of having first introduced the tactical shooter genre, and after a long wait, here comes the fourth chapter. Turning point in the series, let's face it right away, due to the scandalous abandonment of its cornerstone, in practice the (almost) complete elimination of tactical planning, which allowed the most savvy to fully prepare the missions. After taking a look at the hands-on game, the dramatic doubt arose that the series, like other games, had devoted itself to the mass market, that of mere PC/console conversions, in which the product is to the widest possible audience. Unfortunately this is exactly what happened and the results are certainly not exciting.", "date": "2006-03-02", "grade": null}
