{"name": "Mission Impossible III", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mission-impossible-iii.html", "text": "What you're going to buy, 'in case you decide to accept the mission', will be a game of pure action from start to finish that will make you face ever-changing objectives of increasing difficulty. The learning curve is therefore quite simple and once you become familiar with the controls you will be able to make all kinds of evolutions to your digital alter ego, in this case the fire button will be the master and as in all games of last generation, it will react to the context and from time to time it can be used to: shoot, perform the various stunts Ethan is capable of, kick, grab or immobilize enemies on duty. There is also a particularly effective special move that allows you to eliminate, with a single blow, all the enemies present on the screen at a given moment. Obviously provided that the adrenaline gauge, always present on the screen, is full enough. A game inspired by the MI saga could not miss the possibility of using a whole series of weapons and gadgets that would make even the most operative of the secret agents dormant in us envious, among which we find assault rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers. During the game, the guys from Gameloft have not neglected to place very useful energy and ammunition refills which, however, as the action continues, will become increasingly rare. Normally the development is that of a classic side-scrolling platform even if, at times, we will be called to command a helicopter and the gameplay will radically change becoming, in all respects, an old-fashioned vertical scrolling shoot-em-up type Tiger Heli. In these sections we will have to survive until we reach and defeat the classic end-of-level Boss. Also in this case we will still be able to take advantage of a large choice of weapons ranging from the use of simple projectiles to that of very useful guided missiles. But that's not all, in addition to all this, every now and then we will also be called upon to solve some mini-games in perfect Mission Impossible style with the help of a PDA (intrusion into computer systems, creating masks from the faces of neutralized guards, etc.) which it will further put us in the shoes of the most famous secret agent of the moment.", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
