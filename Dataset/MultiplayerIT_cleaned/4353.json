It has happened a few times in the past that developer HAL Laboratory has distanced himself from this kind of philosophy to experiment with something completely new, but it must be admitted that Kirby is at its best when he returns to the formula that has made him famous over the years '90, as demonstrated by his latest adventures for Nintendo 3DS: Triple Deluxe and Planet Robobot. The new Nintendo console, designed with an eye to local multiplayer experiences, seemed the perfect platform in which to express the spirit of Kirby to maximum power. HAL Laboratory had the opportunity to create a little gem... and they let it slip. Fantastic Four Kirby: Star Allies mainly revolves around two gameplay features. The first, of course, is the multiplayer component. Star Allies isn't the first Kirby you can play with friends, but there's something fresh about the way this Switch iteration delivers the dynamic. Once Kirby has ~recruited~ an enemy to his team, the players - four at most - can participate in the game in any way and at any time: you can play with a pair of Joy-Con or split them, or alternatively use the Controller Pro and any other possible combination. Essentially, a copy of the game for Switch already guarantees the possibility of playing in two, assigning a Joy-Con to each player. There's no split-screen and on-screen characters are locked to Kirby, so the game automatically ~transports~ them to the pink wad if they fall behind. Alternatively, the CPU takes control of non-player characters, employing responsive and resourceful AI. This makes Kirby: Star Allies a perfect living room game, suitable for young and old who want to spend a few hours in the colorful and lively worlds of HAL Laboratory. The second important feature of Kirby: Star Allies is the ability to combine the powers of the pink wad and its companions. Doing so is very simple: just tilt the analog stick upwards to prepare our character for the fusion of powers. If a friend of ours or the CPU is controlling a compatible character and will use its power on us, a specific combination will be obtained. There are many types of pairings, but they are generally two main categories. Sometimes two powers can intertwine and form some sort of super attack, but in most cases it's simply possible to bestow an elemental property (fire, ice, water, electricity, or wind) on a skill that relies on a weapon. For example, combining the fire of Fiammelleo with the Ninja power of Kirby, the latter will find himself attacking with flaming kunai. In reality, these combinations only partially change the various skills, limiting themselves precisely to modifying the appearance of the various attacks and their effectiveness if the targets protect themselves with the opposite element, but it is a marginal advantage if you consider that all enemies collapse after very few hits. Kirby: Star Allies is a game of disarming ease, perhaps the simplest of all those that have had the pink ball as a protagonist in recent years. The problem lies not only in the weakness of the enemies and bosses who, apart from the last one, give very little trouble, but also and above all in an uninspired level design, far from the peaks reached in Triple Deluxe. Instead of building the various stages around the dynamic combination of powers, HAL Laboratory has preferred to place some environmental puzzles here and there, suggesting their solution through unequivocal visual clues: see that fuse? Set it on fire. Look at that fan! Hit him with a power that generates wind. And if the player should have missed the numerous enemies of the same type on the path that leads to a puzzle, the game itself gives him the power to solve it in the same room. And if a player doesn't have that power, at that moment, the CPU automatically takes care of solving the puzzle for him. At certain moments, Kirby: Star Allies feels self-guided. The environmental puzzles repeatedly reminded us of those found in the LEGO Traveller's Tales titles, but in this case it was often necessary to start the levels all over again to reach the puzzle with the right characters and powers. In Kirby: Star Allies, however, it is rare to complete a stage without having collected all the collectibles on the first go. Do you want a balloon? In certain internships,we found ourselves at a crossroads or at three different paths. Signposts pointed precisely to one of them and we thought it was a diversion and that the best path was the one full of enemies. But no: the path indicated was the clear one, and in the end we also found a piece, a sort of collectible present in variable quantities in the various levels which serves to compose a series of illustrations. Star Allies literally takes players by the hand and leads them down the safest and most rewarding paths, and when it doesn't, it rarely tries to get in their way. Occasionally you come across platforms that bring the team together and force the player to face bizarre shooter sequences or fun racing at breakneck speed, but more often you get to the end of the stage without even realizing it. This happens due to another problem, hand in glove with the very low level of difficulty: the four characters who move and fight on the screen, quite simply create enormous confusion. Between flames, sparks, bombs and rotating blades, it becomes difficult to follow the action more than anything else. At times you have the distinct sensation of pressing buttons at random, and this is especially true when fighting bosses: the speed with which you defeat most of them and the general chaos that is created prevent you from recognizing and assimilate the patterns of the opponents, which would be very useful in one of the extra modes that are unlocked at the end of the game, in which you have to challenge the bosses one after the other. All this confusion, however, does not justify the fluidity of a title which, despite being visually very clean and colorful, certainly isn't exactly cutting-edge and inexplicably does not reach the sixty frames of Super Mario Odyssey, remaining anchored to the thirty and fortunately without uncertainties. The worlds are divided into a colorful forty stages: sunny beaches, underwater caves, volcanic caverns, green prairies... There is no shortage of variety, but Star Allies really seems to be looking for Dream Land clichs at all costs and the choice of scenarios rarely surprising. Even the mini-games didn't impress us much: far from some illustrious examples of the past, such as A rhythm with Dedede, they are really banal and perhaps, after having tried them once, you will never play them again. It's a real shame because the touch of HAL Laboratory occasionally emerges overbearing and makes us regret what, perhaps, was a hasty development. Kirby's new powers are very original - Racno, in particular, is really strong in combat, while Cleaner wins the sympathy award - and the puzzles that require more powers to solve, and therefore the micromanagement of the team, elicit a satisfied smile . If only the rest of the game had been at those levels, now perhaps we'd be talking about a new yardstick in the franchise.", "date": "2018-03-14", "grade": "7.0"}
