It is clear that when a few years ago on his Famitsu pages it was revealed that the artist was working on a new project entitled Zwei, with which he promised to bring the genre back to the qualitative glories of the past, the community of enthusiasts could only enter in fibrillation. Produced by Bethesda but completely developed by Tango Gameworks, the game, which draws liberally from some of the greatest exponents of the genre, is finally ready to debut on markets around the world, and we have reviewed it for you. Without getting entangled in too many spoilers, let's say right away that the plot behind The Evil Within revolves around detective Sebastian Castellanos, and a dark and powerful ~force~ that seems to have first contaminated a psychiatric hospital, where there is a real own massacre of patients, doctors and policemen, and then the whole city. In a disturbing atmosphere full of mystery, Sebastian finds himself facing an endless nightmare, where it is not always clear what reality is and what, instead, is the result of some form of madness. The new nightmare born from the mind of Shinji Mikami is a tribute to the classics of survival horror Male nostrum Certainly nothing is what it seems and Mikami is one of those Japanese authors capable of giving a cinematographic touch to his works even using assorted quotes and references. In this case through hints and ideas taken from horror cinema and, as we will see, also from other videogame productions. Once you start playing, the atmosphere is decidedly surreal, and right from the start you can breathe a sense of unease and mystery in finding yourself in the middle of a nightmare, without being able to understand what is happening. Sensations immediately amplified by the situation of absolute abandonment experienced by the character, by the dark and distressing corridors, by the corrupt environments of which it almost seems you can smell the smell of mould, blood and rottenness. Faced with an unimaginable, almost Lovecraftian terror, as Sebastian the user must explore frightening environments, solve simple puzzles and fight for his survival. And to do so he must resort to any means. In the more ~quiet~ phases, especially when exploring or trying to solve puzzles, the game seems to wink at the first chapters of Silent Hill, with the oppressive environments, which sometimes change in front of the protagonist, the sinister noises, the dark spaces, the watermark on the screen and the character design of some enemies. It is in these junctures that the production of Tango Gameworks is perhaps able to put the right amount of tension on the user, worried that the imperceptible dull sound of steps behind him, or the neon lamp that has just burned out leaving in the darkness the corner adjacent to a passage, are not signs of some hidden danger. When, on the other hand, the situation sees Sebastian engaged in the extreme defense of his life, the initially more visceral, almost intimate horror turns into something different, and drags the player into a ~mutant~ nightmare, made up of fights, parallel realities and splatter, for a mix of elements that for some mechanics appears clearly inspired by the fourth chapter of Resident Evil, even if in a more evolved form. As in the case of the control system, comparable to that of a modern third-person action shooter, with the possibility therefore of shooting and moving at the same time, or in the possibility of doing some crafting, and even evolving the skills of the hero. In fact, by collecting special bottles scattered around the scenarios, and finding a mirror for a dimensional shift in a hospital, Castellanos can use them to enhance himself and his weapons. In the first case it is possible to improve the characteristics of the detective, such as increasing his energy bar or physical resistance after a shot, while in the second one it is possible to work on the damage multiplier or on the reload speed of weapons, and so on. In terms of gameplay, however, Mikami's signature is also evident with regard to the type of view, which is from the back and slightly shifted to the left, or in some solutions applied to hand-to-hand combat and to the aiming system, which however, especially when the monsters are too close, sometimes it sticks a bit resulting in little fluidity. The interface however has been significantly reduced to interfere as little as possible with the action. From the origins of the Capcom series, Studio Tango also wanted to grasp the survival soul of the experience, making available little ammunition, to be dosed with care. remcompletely dry is quite unlikely, but the amount of bullets is small enough to ensure that the player never abuses the trigger too much. To further play with this idea, the developers have made it possible for Sebastian to be able to punch his opponents, to use mines, or to take advantage of the traps that infest certain environments (for example, there are leghold traps and motion-detecting explosives, which can be defused among other things, to collect the pieces and recycle them to create bolts for the crossbow, one of the weapons in the game). In this sense, the title pushes the gamer to an intelligent use of the resources at his disposal, to retry certain situations a few times, to almost study the environment and the creatures to be killed, before solving the problem and eliminating the threat. In this way, death after death, the user can become more experienced and aware of the location and behavior of every enemy, and every trap placed in the area. All in all an interesting idea, but one that may perhaps discourage less patient players. Above all because in reality it is always advisable to move with circumspection, since The Evil Within is a difficult game. Very difficult. And confrontation is often the wrong solution, especially if played, as we did, at the Survival level. The gamer can then act in the shadows, distract the enemies by throwing bottles, take them from behind for a silent kill or lure them, as mentioned before, into a trap. If on the one hand, as mentioned before, the product is characterized by a precise direction, strengthened by a solid ~traditionalist~ base, on the other hand it also seems to be preparing for the opening towards new elements, clearly inspired by the stealth phases of the splendid The Last of Us. In The Evil Within's bestiary there are various types of enemies, most of which reminded us of the Shibito from Forbidden Siren, and others characterized by a decidedly disturbing appearance, with different attack patterns, sizes and moments of ~appearance~. It's up to the player to decide what to do. In the case instead of the big ~bosses~, some of which are practically unbeatable, the best solution remains the escape. Some escapes are quite linear, others are a little less so, but not all are the same. In certain moments, Sebastian can in fact escape by simply sprinting away from the enemy and dodging some obstacles, while in other situations he must also pay attention to the traps that the enemy throws or places nearby. Playstation 4 trophies The Evil Within offers 42 trophies, divided into 28 bronze, 9 silver, 4 gold and one platinum. To get them, just progress in the adventure, satisfying requests such as recovering every collectible in the game, upgrading every weapon or defeating particular enemies. More complex are the two that require you to complete the game in AKUMU mode or within five hours. Terror dimension Everything perfect, then? The answer is ~no~. Indeed, if we wanted to be picky, we could say that what is the strength of the title, that is to say the desire to be similar to the great classics of the genre, could at the same time also constitute its limit. This is because perhaps those who do not live on ~bread and survival~, or who are looking for a title full of novelties or with an astonishing impact, may not fully appreciate it, seeing in it a certain basic repetitiveness in some mechanics, or almost perceiving a feeling of ~already seen~ in some moments of the game. In reality, in our view, apart from the lack of originality (which is not always a bad thing), the only major flaw that can be attributed to the production is a certain inability to really scare the player. Not that in this sense there is no lack of ideas to jump on the chair, but certainly these moments are few in relation to the will expressed several times by the author, to reinvigorate the survival genre by terrorizing the public. In any case, in our opinion, we need to look at Mikami's game without prejudice, therefore as a title that pays homage, we repeat, to traditional survival games without frills or revolutions of any kind. For the rest, moving on to analyze the technical aspect, it must be said that The Evil Within is pleasant: the level design is quite varied, the scenarios different from each other, at least from a certain point onwards, and the modeling of the main characters is good (a little less that of the others). Globally, there is a certain ability to keep the average quality always at the same level, thanks to the adapted version of id Tech 5, the engine signed by id Software. However, since it is a product between two generations, from an aesthetic point of view, the game is qualitatively anchored more to the ~old~ consoles than to the one that can be reached on today's systems. The glance is not bad, and the graphics manage to fully restore all the disturbing and twisted atmosphere of the nightmare universe in which the protagonist finds himself, thanks to the care placed by Mikami in the direction and in the details, such as for example the trails of blood on the ground, the mangled bodies, and the many dark corners, in turn enhanced by the wise use of light sources and the subsequent play of shadows. Not to mention the good quality of the particles: from the smoke generated by the flames to the mist of humid environments, up to the debris that invades the surrounding air in city areas. The adoption of the 21:9 film format instead of the 16:9, then, proves to be a finesse for cinephiles, with the black bands which, among other things, do not cause any discomfort. On the other hand, it is also true that some textures are quite disappointing, especially those used for certain characters or for some elements that make up the scenarios: seen at close range, they are rough and generally flat. Without forgetting certain surrounding elements, such as the insects that infest the houses, which are practically 2D, and move projected onto the walls or floor. Our feeling is that even the noise effect of the Silent Hill-like image is a ploy to camouflage some graphic defects rather than a ~simple~ artistic choice. Where Tango Gameworks has operated optimally is the sound sector, complete with speech in Italian. As we had reported in one of our previews, except for some unfortunate translation of the texts, and a couple of lines of the protagonist dubbed in an unconvincing way, the result is good. The audio effects are decidedly excellent, with all the sampling of grunts, sinister noises, environmental effects and anything else one could ~want~ in a product of this kind, as well as the soundtrack, quite spot on, capable as it is of giving the right charge when required, or to accompany moments of greater narrative tension.", "date": "2014-10-14", "grade": "8.5"}
