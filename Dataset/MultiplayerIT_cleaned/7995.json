By properly exploiting the mysterious deaths of several influential historical figures, and sometimes even with the advice of established scholars, the Ubisoft developers have managed to pigeonhole the events of Desmond Miles' ancestors into an all in all coherent mosaic, to the point that acting as if anything, the opposite is the sci-fi digressions set in the near future. However, the approach chosen by Ubisoft for the first downloadable content dedicated to Assassin's Creed III is quite different, given that The Tyranny of King Washington makes no secret of its nature as a historical fake. Taking advantage of a very common narrative device in literature (Philip Dick's Swastika on the Sun is one of the most famous examples), the writers started from an event that probably happened, namely the offer made to George Washington to be crowned king of the newborn United States of America, and they overturned the results, trying to imagine an alternative historical course. The DLC has an episodic structure, with a division into three chapters which is also reflected in the peculiarities of the gameplay. The package can be purchased either separately, with each episode at the price of 800 Microsoft Points or 9.99, or in a single solution thanks to the Season Pass of 2400 Microsoft Points or 29.99. A price that is certainly not indifferent but, as we will see, the first chapter bodes well for the overall play offer. Before moving on to the analysis, a warning to all those who have not yet completed the main game, since the following discussion will inevitably contain spoilers on the plot of Assassin's Creed III. Rewrite history More than an expansion, speaking of The Tyranny of King Washington it would be correct to use the term spin off. Instead of expanding or continuing the story, this episodic DLC ~rewinds~ the events of the original game's storyline from a certain point forward, returning the player to the beginnings of Connor's exploits. Waking up from a bad dream and decidedly foggy, the latter re-encounters, not without manifest astonishment, his own mother, who informs him of the bad situation facing the Frontier. In fact, it seems that George Washington was blinded by power, crowned himself king and declared his dominion over the lands of the natives, rounding them up and massacring them. Naturally the weight of this situation will fall right on the shoulders of our Ratonhnhak:ton, the only one able to oppose the tyranny. The introduction to this new course of the plot takes place without too much ado, with the disbelief of Connor, who somehow seems aware that he has gone ~back in time~, which perfectly reflects the disorientation of the player himself. It should be noted that, at least in this first chapter, no explanations will be provided on the occurrence of this bizarre time loop but, once the circle is closed, the developers promise that the elements for full understanding of the event will be provided, to a greater extent those who know how to pay attention to details. In any case, although time has an absolutely relative value within the Animus, in chronological order the events of this DLC are to be considered subsequent to those narrated in Assassin's Creed III, therefore it is not to be expected that Desmond will find a place. As mentioned, the division into three episodes also has precise implications from a content point of view, therefore this first chapter takes place entirely within the borders of the Frontier, while the remaining two will take place respectively in Boston and New York, where George Washington had built his own fortress, giving it the shape of a gigantic Masonic pyramid. Also from the point of view of gameplay, each episode will present a particularity, represented by a new power available to Connor. By completing an ancient magical ritual of the natives, the player will in fact be able to rely on three powers, one for each chapter, which will help him in his rebellion against the tyranny of King Washington. Xbox 360 goals The first chapter of the Tyranny of King Washington DLC offers four achievements for a total of 90 Gamerscore points. These are objectives related to reaching 100% Synchrony and obtaining a certain number of eliminations with active invisibility. The law of the pack If the first part of the episode takes place as per tradition for the saga, with the choice between facing the enemies openly or more tactically in stealth, oncecompleted the ritual and gained access to the new power the gameplay changes drastically. Thanks to the magic of the natives, in this episode Connor will be able to make himself invisible for a short time, or call to himself three ghost-wolves capable of automatically attacking enemies, excellent for helping each other in a fight or to create a diversion. Having completed the short, and suggestive, sequence of the ritual, in which Connor will find himself following a pack of wolves in the rough architecture of the Animus, we will return to regular gameplay, with the new commands already mapped on the pad (in the Xbox 360 version we headboard, Y to activate invisibility and LB to summon the three wolves). The invisibility draws directly from the health bar, consuming it completely in just under fifteen seconds, hence the need to use it carefully. Of course, any sudden or abrupt action, such as running or openly attacking an opponent, will break the effect, exposing the player. Eliminating silently and without being seen is possible but draws the attention of the guards in the direction of Connor, making it necessary to change positions. When you make yourself invisible, the movement speed is slightly increased compared to usual, so as to allow the exploitation of the limited time available. Confirming the good attention paid by the developers in the creation of this DLC, the design of the settings has evidently been specifically designed to make the most of the power of temporary invisibility. Although the Frontier is almost identical to the one already visited in Assassin's Creed III, the enemy outposts placed ad hoc for carrying out the missions show clear signs of this good work, such as the continuous alternation of open paths and bushy areas, where it is possible to hide and wait for the power of invisibility to recharge, in a rather short time. The level of difficulty is as always discreet, but not exceptional, although even in this case the balance has been made with care, to avoid making the completion of tasks and fights too easy. For its part, the use of the three ghost wolves is less essential than invisibility, but can prove useful for countering larger groups of enemies. The latter have in fact several armored elite members, able to repel almost all of Connor's attacks, unless their guard is previously opened with the appropriate move. Alongside the main missions of this first chapter, the completion of which requires about two hours of gameplay, various secondary tasks will appear on the map. In fact, it will be possible to help the oppressed natives both by obtaining and bringing food to the camps, and by assaulting the round-up convoys, killing all the guards and freeing the prisoners. This is accompanied by the classic chests, present in large numbers and almost always very well defended. In all, these contents can extend longevity by a further abundant hour. From a technical point of view, although Assassin's Creed III presented many bugs and assorted inaccuracies, the optimization work done with this first chapter of The Tyranny of King Washington seemed better to us. The Xbox 360 version we tested presented no particular problems, boding well for the finished product. The first of the three episodes that make up The Tyranny of King Washington, Infamy, struck us for the ability to vary the approach to gameplay offered by the Assassin saga in a clear and positive way. Although it initially appears as a secondary detail, the brief invisibility available to Connor completely changes the exploration and assault activity on enemy bases, thanks also to the specially studied level design, so much so as to almost make one wish that such an interesting idea had been integrated in the original game. Although the ~supernatural~ twist may not be to everyone's liking, and the bizarre twists of the plot remain unexplained at the moment, the abundant two hours of gameplay (more than three, in case you decide to complete the side missions) amused and convinced us. Those who appreciated the original game will undoubtedly like them and, given the very rapid succession of missions and events, they could even convince some detractors more.", "date": "2013-02-19", "grade": null}
