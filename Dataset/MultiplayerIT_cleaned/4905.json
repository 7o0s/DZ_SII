Paris! What better place to masturbate? The truth is that we lacked foresight, because 5Wolf's title managed to sell more than one hundred thousand copies, contradicting us across the board. In short, it seems that there have been many who consider this stuff worthy of purchase. Some say that much of the success of similar junk derives from the squalid circles that have now formed around the Steam cards, which make low-cost games particularly attractive. Whatever the truth, What's Under Your Blanket 2!? exists. Yes, the deeds of the lord of the saws have become a saga, going from a private dimension to a multicultural one. In what sense? Don't worry, the game is identical to its predecessor: you have to help the protagonist masturbate under his cover without getting him caught, only where in the first chapter the acts were performed in the places of his private life (his home, emergency room and so on) , here he has internationalized and now he happily masturbates in China, in France and in front of the White House, challenging other well-known onanists such as Trump, Chinese leaders and so on by arm wrestling. The enemies who want to prevent him from producing the sacred sketch are no longer his little sister, mother or grandfather, but waiters, Russian tanks, fleeing Obama and so on. Fortunately, the kitten that occasionally appeared in the first chapter to disturb us, and that had to be caught to chase it off the screen, is still there because, as we know, kittens are universal. If you like, we are faced with a great allegory of contemporary Western man, who never stops masturbating under his cover in the face of the great movements of history; but let's not elevate ourselves too much with reflections, also because we don't believe that the author of such a masterpiece had such high and profound ambitions while developing it... Why review What's Under Your Blanket 2!? It's actually a good question... You make me fap, you make me fap, like I'm a doll Game mechanics of What's Under Your Blanket 2!? are very simple to describe: move the mouse pointer over the protagonist, repeatedly press the left button to make him masturbate and stop when you hear the sounds announcing the arrival of someone offstage who could see us, or when you are the Godlike combo is reached (in this case, if you continue with physical activity, the tool is on fire). Competitive mode... The goal is to reach orgasm by filling a long bar at the bottom of the screen. Below it there is another bar, smaller, which indicates the attention of the other characters present on the scene: when filled, they all turn towards the protagonist. For the rest, between one masturbation session and another you have to defeat a boss arm wrestling, that is, you have to click madly on the left mouse button to fill yet another bar. That's all? Absolutely yes. If you want we can notify you of the great coup of the development team, which has drawn a female face on the hand of the protagonist... ah, true, there are also multiplayer modes: the cooperative one, in which you masturbate in company, and the competitive one, in which whoever scores the most points wins. Essentially they play in a similar way to the single player mode, only that there are other hapless humans to share the pain. However, they work badly, are very limited and are not very popular, so don't hope that they will somehow improve the title. What else to add? Let's see... Ah, the soundtrack! It consists of a single electronic piece, evidently played by a deaf and mute monkey, which disturbs after just ten minutes... which happens to be just the time it will take you to finish What's Under Your Blanket 2!? and its five levels of sadness.
