Those who have purchased this new edition of the title developed by Avalanche Software and have therefore already exhausted the adventure dedicated to the Avengers, in the event that they are not fully satisfied with the experience offered by the editor, can do nothing but turn to the Play Sets for extend product content. At the moment those related to Guardians of the Galaxy and Spider-Man are available, and it is the latter that we will evaluate in the next few lines. Even without any substantial news, the World of Spider-Man gives a few extra hours to Disney Infinity 2.0 Spider-Man and his friends Each Play Set, as fans will surely know, allows access to a real adventure with mild free roaming elements structured and divided into missions, set in the universe of one of Disney's intellectual properties. After the focus on Pixar feature films and Pirates of the Caribbean and Lone Ranger from the first chapter, this second episode shifts the focus to Marvel characters, and one of the most representative and famous of all is obviously Spider-Man. At a cost of 29.90, the Play Set therefore guarantees access to the adventure in question together with a pair of statuettes to be used within it: in this case, the chosen ones are Spider-Man and Nova, but within this specific Mondo you can also use Goblin, Venom, Nick Fury and Iron Fist, each of which can be purchased individually at the price of  12.99. It is therefore easy to understand how the completionists are destined to reach very substantial figures very soon in order to be able to take home the complete package. Having closed the parenthesis regarding the economic model of Disney Infinity 2.0, however, it is right to focus on the contents in the strict sense of this Play Set, and from this point of view there is a first small disappointment linked to the setting: it is in fact the same New York which has been the theater for the World of the Avengers, albeit with some modifications. Inevitable one would say since that is the ~home~ of the protagonist, but despite this it is clear that the lack of aesthetic variety is a point against considering the selling price of the additional package. The plot of the World of Spider-Man, absolutely trivial, is limited to placing the heroes in contrast with the evil plans of Goblin and Venom; luck has it that the structure and contents are all in all superior to those of The Avengers, offering greater variety in the missions which in this case also find some quite pleasant puzzle elements. Let me be clear, the action key remains preponderant, as does the aspect related to combat: as already mentioned in the review of the Starter Pack, the possibility of developing the skills of each character proves to be intriguing as well as useful in practice, going to partially remedy the shallow depth of the initial model. Too bad that from this point of view we should point out the lack of variety in the types of enemies present, really a handful that are repeated continuously in waves, mortifying the progression. An extra effort would have been enough to fix it and at the same time make the gameplay more satisfying. However, both characters contained in the package are decidedly pleasant to use: Nova above all, thanks to the possibility of flying and the gratifying attacks available, but obviously also moving around by throwing cobwebs between the buildings with the good old Spider-Man always has its charm . It should also be noted that, within the bland cross-over that the programmers have managed to integrate into Disney Infinity 2.0, within the Play Set in question it is also possible to use, after having unlocked them, the statuettes of Iron Man and Hulk. Moving on instead to the technical point of view, the sensation remains, but more than anything else the certainty, that the graphics engine has been calibrated and calibrated on the basis of the capabilities of the old-gen, making very little use of the new hardware. Let me be clear, you are never faced with unpleasant scenes, but the polygonal complexity is still quite modest for the settings. On the other hand, the modeling of the protagonists is very pleasant, with an apt stylistic code that tries to make all the characters in the vast catalog as homogeneous as possible. Ultimately, the World of Spider-Man proves to be a advisable purchase for Disney Infinity 2.0 owners who appreciated the contents present.ti in the Starter Pack and want to expand them, however keeping in mind that the strengths and weaknesses are roughly the same.", "date": "2014-10-10", "grade": null}
