The fascination of seeing the most disparate human activities reproduced in virtual form has always exercised an attraction towards a certain public which for some is incomprehensible. For example, what's the fun of running an agricultural business? Evidently a lot, given the success of titles like Stardew Valley, or Harvest Moon before it. Not to mention the various ~simulators~, some of which have taken the concept of simulation to its extreme consequences, so much so that they appear almost incomprehensible to the general public. Many features that in other video games would appear absurd, in a simulator are not only suitable, but necessary to create the right atmosphere that fans like so much. Pure Farming 2018 follows in the wake of the various Farming Simulators trying to distinguish itself in different ways, but partially missing the target, probably due to its youth. Not that it's badly done, let's clarify, but some tricks that fans of the genre have come to expect by now are absent. But let's go in order. No multiplayer, no parties Once the game has started, it is possible to choose between three modes: ~My first farm~, i.e. a long campaign/tourial in which we must achieve the indicated objectives from time to time, also carrying out the secondary missions assigned by the local farmers, to accumulate money and experience ; the ~Cultivation Challenges~, which we can describe as single missions that take place on different scenarios of varying difficulty; finally ~Free cultivation~, i.e. the classic sandbox mode in which, given the initial resources, we are the ones who have to manage the company as we please, obviously trying not to make it fail. If you know the Farm Simulators, you will have already noticed the first notable absence: if in fact the campaign mode is of great help for newbies and is a commendable addition, the total absence of an online component makes itself felt. The reason lies precisely in the genre itself: Pure Farming 2018 is an accurate simulation, in which the player is called to carry out all the tasks directly. In short, to plow you have to take the relative agricultural machine and go in person to the land, crossing it several times from top to bottom. The same goes for planting, harvesting and so on. Sounds boring to you? For an average player it is but, as already pointed out, simulator lovers are looking for this. In Farm Simulator multiplayer allows players to collaborate in carrying out various tasks, so that if one plows a certain field, another can devote himself to another activity (working another field, or selling the crop, or even more). In Pure Farming 2018 this is not possible and you have to do everything yourself, at most relying on artificial intelligence which can, at a certain cost, help us manage the farm. Too bad it doesn't always work very well, but that's not the problem either: what makes itself felt is above all the lack of sharing work with other humans, which is particularly heavy in sandbox mode. After all, even in reality who would ever manage such a large amount of work alone? Friendly agriculture That said, there is no doubt that the developers, the Ice Flames, have done a great job to refine the mechanics related to agricultural activities and the various machinery to the maximum. Of the latter there are not many (overall less than half of those of Farm Simulator), but since it is a very young title, it is not too surprising. It is mostly up to the player to decide whether he wants to trust the series, hoping that it will grow like the Farm Simulator one, or if he wants to play it safer by relying on the Giants Games product. It sounds bad to say, but it's the only way to allow new players to enter the market without being immediately crushed. Remaining on agricultural machinery, there are various types: tanks, transport vehicles, tugs and trailers, tractors and much more, all useful or necessary to manage the different types of cultivation or to expand the activities already underway. If you want more information about it while playing, you can go two ways: read in the integrated encyclopedia, or face the campaign mode and select some secondary mission that requires its use. By doing so, you usually receive an email on the protagonist's virtual tablet, which acts as a user interface, in which it is explained what needs to be done. Of course, not being able to rent vehicles (as in Farming Simulator), it is only advisable to face the missions that require the use of machinery that you want to add organically to the profirst stable, i.e. those with whom it is believed to be able to carry out activities that go beyond the mission itself. Apart from that, we have to admit that we really liked the developers' response to the issue of introducing newbies into the game. Often such titles take many things for granted, while in Pure Farming 2018 they really don't, which makes it the perfect choice for anyone who wants to approach the genre without suffering too much. Realism Speaking of realism, Pure Farming 2018 manages to join the competition without problems, also adding touches of class such as the drone that gives detailed information on the fields. For the rest, the crops grow according to the right rhythms, rotting if they are not harvested, and the various productions are simulated in a decidedly realistic way. As you can imagine, the fields, depending on the occurrences, must be tilled, ploughed, sown, irrigated and, in short, made productive. The aforementioned tablet will help the player, which contains all the information he needs: from a map of the area, to the livability of some land, in case you want to raise animals, to the state of the vehicles, with the possible possibility to repair them with a simple click (after taking them to the workshop), at the cost of the sheds and so on. The controls are also extremely functional and you can play without problems with each of the systems provided. Too bad for the lack of support for the steering wheels, which will make ultra enthusiasts turn up their noses in particular. It should also be noted that the sandbox mode allows you to play on different scenarios, some of which are very distinct from each other, including one set in Italy. Finally, speaking of more technical issues, the game engine hasn't turned out to be very heavy: sure, it doesn't make you cry out of miracles from the point of view of image quality, but it must be said that the vehicles are reproduced very well, as are some objects of the scenery are pleasant. The greatest details, however, are found above all in the cultivations, as it should be. That said, don't expect much more than what you've already seen in other simulators. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is excellent from the point of view of the effects, very rich and varied, and terrible from that of the music, the latter really silly. This is not a dramatic flaw, given the genre, but it is fair to note.", "date": "2018-03-19", "grade": "7.5"}
