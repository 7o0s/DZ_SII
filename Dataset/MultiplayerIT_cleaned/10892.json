It seems like centuries since the first Lara lorded it over our cathode ray tube televisions with her triangles in search of archaeological finds, and then she imprinted on the collective imagination of us gamers a new concept in break with the past: no misunderstanding in impersonating a beautiful girl and take pleasure in observing her delicate digital movements. There have been dozens of beautiful women on any console since that time. Today a new video game is in the pipeline that features another adventuress with sinuous shapes, but this time in a shamelessly declared way: Ayumi is sexy, blonde and full of curves, but above all she fights in very skimpy clothes! It's the action game that best represents the essence of fan service, a theme so dear to us, grown up on bread, manga and bitmaps. X-Blades, this is the title of the new hack'n'slash released on all next-gen platforms, winks at all lovers of the oriental world, at those who adore Japanese anime and are passionate about beautiful women -equipped-with-big-weapons. Let's find out together. Gamers prefer blondes X-Blades is the latest work of the largest independent developer in Russia, the Gaijin Entertainment software house, a particularly prolific house in the country where it has given birth to countless video games of all kinds. One of these was called Oniblade and had a particularly international scope. Whether for the genre, or for the female protagonist, the distributor TopWare Interactive and Newave Italia (the same as Two Worlds, for example), have decided that it could have represented a valid alternative to the Japanese action. This is the story of a title whose conversion was originally intended exclusively for Xbox 360 and which for this reason, in the West, was renamed with its current name of X-Blades. Oni, the original name, literally means ~demons~ in the Japanese language, creatures of which this distinctly action game is literally chock full. The style is manga, in cel shading, but with imaginary, dreamlike and evocative settings drawn in a decidedly fantasy way with a less minimalist and iconographic design than Ayumi, incarnation of the anime stereotype. Its predominantly action nature is mixed with RPG-style elements, typical of all those games where your character evolves over time and acquires new skills and magic by progressing through the levels, even with short platform sessions. The blonde braids, the blue eyes and then... The whole game is structured on levels to be tackled in a progressive and linear way, one after the other, eliminating all the enemies and bosses we meet until we unlock the wall which represents access to the next area. Each scheme, none excessively dispersive or long, is interspersed with an upload that summarizes how many runes we have discovered (useful for upgrades), the enemy souls conquered and the objects destroyed. X-Blades is a succession of rooms inside a large container represented by the ruined castle where the whole game is set. For this reason, the sets are inextricably linked to this theme from start to finish, without ever departing from the usual sequence of columns, walls, stairways and some large square dedicated to boss fights. Access to already visited and cleaned rooms is always possible: in this way we can go back at any time to look for a missing rune, or to collect souls, the exchange currency for upgrades, spells and health. In fact, enemies always come back to life, and backtracking is a fundamental part of Ayumi's growth. Without souls you don't buy the most powerful spells that are used to defeat the advanced bosses. Monsters and demons are always born in large quantities, to be faced almost as if we were faced with a fighting game for meetings. In fact, at each level, a bar appears that indicates how much energy is missing to completely annihilate the enemy forces in the area and access the next one, and corresponds to the residual life of the single boss of the level or to the global life of all enemies. The weapons available to the prosperous Ayumi are many, and all effective if used intelligently. As the title suggests, the main one is the pair of swords that the protagonist wields with ease from the beginning, but which in reality we soon put aside in favor of spells. With the trigger you can shoot, a valid alternative to melee combat, and from mid-game onwards it is also allowed to upgrade the guns, using the d-pad to change the rate of fire. Accumulating souls, we said, yes Frthey can unlock ever more devastating spells. The various enemies react according to the basic rules of the ~elements~: ice beats fire, fire beats ice, for example. All the keys on the pad are used, and the very long list of spells must be carefully studied every time we find ourselves in front of an enemy: after having studied the weak points on the bestiary (the dictionary of enemies, which can be recalled with the start button) it is necessary to decide which attacks to ~map~ onto the keys to be able to launch them quickly. The problem is that when there are more than 4 spells to alternate, you have to resort to the inventory menu, inevitably interrupting the flow of the action. As you progress through the game, you learn new moves and our young heroine becomes more and more skilled, following modes that are very similar to those of an RPG in which you can choose both the weapons to unlock and the aspects to upgrade. You also get stronger by finding the runes within the levels that act as useful power-ups. The colored crystals that we find in the middle of each scheme also have various functions: the red one increases the fury, or the energy available for special moves and spells, while the green one gives some relief to Ayumi's wounds. One more trigger for perfect Z-Targeting At the beginning of the game our heroine has basic skills, in addition to her particular beauty, which she can enhance by learning new air attacks (some of which are very reminiscent of the last Prince of Persia), melee combos and spells. X-Blades has three levels of enhancement of each individual skill. The pistol one is increased with silver artifacts, melee weapons with gold ones, and flying attacks by discovering ruby relics. The camera works very well, the commands are practical, fast and punctual, making the player fully capable of maneuvering the character to his liking. The same cannot be said of the enemy targeting system (as in many games of the same genre, it uses a sort of Zelda-like Z-targeting) which is difficult and impossible to manage with precision as you cannot choose the enemy to attack . The latter is automatically locked according to the orientation of the camera, which can be locked with the left trigger. The method is very inconvenient in the most crowded situations, which represent 90% of the game, because it is not possible to change the target of the pointer in any way, inevitably complicating the player's life. Ayumi's moves and spells are well choreographed and spectacular, with good variety and convincing animations. In some moments you find yourself surrounded by dozens of enemies, both on the ground and in the sky, and it is not easy to manage the whole game scene. It is necessary to continually enter the menu (which can be called up with the select key) to recover energy, fury (necessary to activate spells and upgrades), change active spells, but also to unlock new ones. The purely action sessions are interspersed with a couple of short platform sections, but, basically, in X-Blades they lead their hands from start to finish. Enemies and the taste for demonic trash As already mentioned at the beginning, X-Blades is a fantasy game set in an imaginary world where the forces of Light collide with those of Darkness. Our heroine can use both to her advantage by accumulating particular crystals that progressively increase the time she can remain transformed into a demon. The effects on the screen are many and help to create a visual orgy of lights, shadows, colors and particles. The setting of the ruined castle, a complete fruit of the designers' imagination, is evocative, but it is too similar for the entire duration of the game. The color palette used is characterized by extreme and very lively plays of light, thanks to an HDR pushed to the limit that constantly dazzles the player's eyes. The quality of the textures is also excellent - all well defined and bright, even if they repeat themselves for the majority of the game. The design of the enemies is too fluctuating and the animations of the beautiful protagonist do not find a counterpart in those of the opponents, who are still made with a small number of polygons and a bizarre, but all too generic style. Much better to keep your eyes focused on the protagonist's backside, which in this sense can have its usefulness. The general fluidity of X-Blades has definitely improved compared to the build shown before the summer, and now the game is stable and travels without uncertainties at 30fps, while increasing dramatically in some closed environments and without enemies. Maybe the cel shading and the style used for the protagonist can make thispicking someone's nose, not integrating perfectly with the context, but it is still a matter of more or less acceptable artistic choices regardless of the eye of the judge. There are no particular alternative game modes, nor one in multiplayer, consequently the longevity is closely connected to the player's ability to complete the main story, in about 8 hours, of which the last ones are committed to going back through the levels already faced, albeit with some changes to weather conditions and enemies. The audio sector is decidedly cared for and can be seen from the opening song, sung with a beautiful melody and gothic-metal style, as well as all the BGMs, very rock. The sound effects are of excellent quality, but numerically limited. The Gaijin studio shows all its legacy of the PC experience: X-Blades was in fact developed on Windows PC and then converted to next-gen consoles, of which it certainly does not take full advantage of the hardware, but it still does it with diligence and good graphic cues. Comment The new next-gen action heroine is called Ayumi: a beautiful girl who looks like a blonde hentai doll. After so many Japanese stereotypes, a Russian team had to think about creating an immediate and fun game. The guys from Gaijin have done a decent job both from a purely technical point of view, with a game that satisfies the eye with effects and lights on the screen, and in terms of pure playability, very intuitive and frenetic, but with an unprecedented depth RPG linked to the use of the dozens of spells present. There are some imperfections such as the automatic target system which in some situations affects the even good precision of the controls, and the relative inexperience of the development team is also noted by the very poor polygonal models of characters and monsters, which do not shine even for artistic quality. No complementary, extra or bonus modes, and no exploitation of any cooperative or multiplayer contribute to the poor replayability of X-Blades, which however maintains a discreet longevity of its kind even if thanks to the continuous use of backtracking. A game that will certainly be appreciated by lovers of challenging hack'n'slash and by all those looking for an alternative to Devil May Cry or Too Human.Pro The RPG-style growth system Good graphics and audio sector The combat system can give away satisfactions once tamed and is inevitably fun Cons Inaccurate target system No multiplayer, online, extra or bonus support The style and character design of characters and enemies Xbox 360 - Goals X-Blades provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to store. Some of them will be obtained simply by progressing through the various levels, within which all the runes must be discovered and accumulated as many souls as possible, in a very simple way. Others by carrying out particularly long combos, evocations of light and shadow or by performing specific actions: passing a level without losing energy, using only magic, and so on. To complete all the objectives, however, a decidedly high commitment is required, given that it is necessary to accumulate millions of demonic souls, complete the game on all difficulties and obtain the maximum level in each type of attack.", "date": "2009-02-06", "grade": null}
