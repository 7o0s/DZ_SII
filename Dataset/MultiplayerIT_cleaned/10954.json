{"name": "Strong Bad Episode 5: 8-Bit Is Enough - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/strong-bad-episode-5-8-bit-is-enough-recensione.html", "text": "The long run of Strong Bad ends at the gates of Christmas, with a fifth episode absolutely worthy of the rest of the series and capable of summarizing both the well-known spirit of the website from which all the adventures are inspired, as well as the peculiarities that have made this production is an almost unique case, not making it a simple fan service but making it an attractive and indeed very tasty product for all lovers of graphic adventures. After a thousand vicissitudes, between bands of dubious talent and non-legitimate independent states, this fifth iteration is self-referential, focused on the world of video games and filled with quotes, goodies and jokes. Out of the cabinets The story is as always crazy: the already known Videlectrix arcade machine goes crazy and, for a sort of magic, all the games inside it materialize in the world of Strong Bad, intending to use their terrible - and pixelated, we talk still 8-bit - weapons to destroy and conquer all. 8-Bit is Enough therefore has a crazy plot but, unexpectedly, also solid and well written, with every single ironic and parody point that turns out to be inserted in a credible context, so as not to make it a simple set of gags but a true story , impossible not to appreciate for any player so many and so well done are the references and quotes, even to the other episodes of the series itself. The game itself, in its most strictly playful meaning, offers practically nothing unseen and mixes with the usual wisdom the dialogues to the collection of objects to the resolution of puzzles anything but impossible or bizarre, scrolling fast and smoothly also thanks to the usual adjustable aid system as needed. Having to move as if between the levels of the games themselves that have become reality still adds some new ideas and, all in all, we can easily be considered in the presence of the most varied and quantitatively full-bodied episode. Longevity is usually limited to a handful of hours but a good dose of extras have been included, enough to entice you to take a few extra game sessions before archiving everything and waiting for the next ones, unannounced but much more than probable followed. Scalette what a passion The graphic style is the usual mix of essential features, bright colors and the almost perfect resemblance to the episodes available on the web, certainly not new generation or with exceptional technological prowess, but effective and fun. The references to video games are also credible and although no character or setting appears directly referable to a title not developed by TellTale, many elements hint at famous productions belonging to the catalog of softco such as Cinematronics and Nintendo, or to entire eras with huge sprites squared and angular. The sound is equally valid and suggestive, which for the first time places great care not only in the dubbing - which has always been the strong point - but also in the music and effects. Comment 8-Bit is Enough is the conclusion that we all expected and fortunately it didn't disappoint: the mix of humour, madness and video games manages to entertain for the entire length of the adventure and some gimmicks in particular leave you really satisfied, especially for how they are inserted in a non-innovative gameplay but slightly more varied than in the past. Lovers of the series can take it with their eyes closed, the others should recover the past chapters, it will be difficult to regret it Pros Videogames are at the heart of the story Simple but entertaining puzzles and situations Unique personality Cons Remains a niche product Only in English PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: 1.5 GHz RAM: 256 MB Video Card: 3D with 32 MB Disk Space: 240 MB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core QX6700 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTS 320MB", "date": "2008-12-22", "grade": null}
