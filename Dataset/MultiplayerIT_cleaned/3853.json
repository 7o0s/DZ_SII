{"name": "Resident Evil 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-2-recensione.html", "text": "With the first Resident Evil (1996) Capcom had pop what Infogrames experimented with Alone in the Dark (1992), mixing its structure and mechanics with some elements of the NES horror RPG Sweet Home. Basically he had made the masses digest and canonized the genre of survival horror, however with much more remote origins, traceable in Nostromo (1981) for PET 2001, 3D Monster Maze (1982) for ZX81 and in Haunted House (1982) for Atari 2600 and in Ant Attack (1983) for ZX Spectrum, and which had seen interesting developments in more advanced titles such as Project Firestart (1989) for Commodore 64, D (1995) for PC, the obscure Doctor Hauzer (1994) for 3DO and Clock Tower (1995) for Super Nintendo, just to name a few. Resident Evil 2 was released in 1998 and was a natural sequel to the first episode, of which it exploited the same graphic engine, suitably improved, and of which it inherited most of the mechanics, but placing them in a wider setting: there where Resident Evil had lived inside the classic mysterious mansion, Resident Evil 2 moved the action to the neighboring town, Racoon City, two months after the events told in the first episode. From Resident Evil to the Resident Evil series Despite the technological recycling, the development of the game was decidedly troubled, with the development team having lost Tokuro Fujiwara along the way and with the director Shinji Mikami who, after having practically canceled the project in controversy with the top management of Capcom (he wanted to close the series, they wanted to turn it into a franchise, as it was then), had left his place to a young and promising designer, Hideki Kamiya, to take that of producer. Kamiya, anticipating his vision of the video game that he would have developed fully with Devil May Cry first, and then the PlatinumGames games, injected a lot of action into the gameplay, above all from the first moments of the game, making it decidedly more frenetic than the average of survival horror of the time, including its predecessor. It is not for nothing that the first sequence sees us fleeing from some zombies after a spectacular car accident, where Resident Evil introduced them in a much more discreet way to its mysteries. Kamiya probably realized that he had to overcome a major limitation inherited from the first chapter, namely the fact that the players were now aware of who they were fighting, the Umbrella Corporation. No longer able to count on the tension derived from the construction of the scenario, he opted for a less investigative and more dynamic approach, giving greater importance to the enemies as adversaries, rather than to the mysteries that surrounded them. Not that there was no lack of puzzles, plots and subplots, some of which will then be inherited by the subsequent Resident Evils, but there is no doubt that Resident Evil 2 was loved more for gimmicks like Mr. X and for the focus on the conservation of loaders and various resources, accentuated compared to the first Resident Evil, which for the story it told, actually quite obvious. In any case, it is in Resident Evil 2 that we meet characters such as Leon Scott Kennedy and Claire Redfield, the two playable protagonists, as well as Ada Wong and Sherry Birkin, who will return several times in the series. Gameplay Let's try to play Resident Evil 2 again today. As already mentioned, the first few minutes make us understand without misunderstanding the different setting of the game compared to its predecessor, immediately forcing us to run away from the zombies roaming the streets of Racoon City. Their number is overwhelming and Leon and Claire's weapons are not enough to eliminate them all. The only option is escape. The control system, which has remained unchanged compared to that of Resident Evil, is not ideal for managing the situation, with the character who must be rotated on the X axis to be directed and then moved by pressing the stick forward or backward. Thought with the experience of a 2019 player such a system is absurdly wooden, but in 1998 it worked quite well. Convenience makes intolerant. Be that as it may, the cumbersomeness of the controls also has a precise playful function and adds tension to the whole experience, with the player who, limited by the clumsiness of the characters, ends up perceiving the individual threats as greater than they really are. The real survival experience begins once you enter the police station, where more canonical puzzles are presented, you begin to understand the situation and you are forced to face an ordeal of zombies. The setting remains identical to that seen in the previous chapter, with the pre-rendered game areas shown through exquisitely cinematic static shots and the 3D characters that move atinside them following their morphology. Currently it is difficult to find similar titles, especially among the major productions, but at the time the Alone in the Dark model was very popular, due to the possibilities it gave in terms of storytelling and management of the player experience, with the shots used to produce various dramatic effects. Take for example the sequence of the crows, modeled on that of the dogs of the first Resident Evil, whose tension was played entirely on the change of shots and on the off-screen actions they generated. The combat system is really basic: with a key the character points the weapon in front of him, and with another he shoots. If you want you can raise or lower the aim with the left stick, but that's really all. More than hitting zombies, the important thing is to learn to ration your ammunition, shooting only when strictly necessary, otherwise you end up having to focus on just the knife. As in the first chapter, in case you are injured you can consume the classic healing herbs that are found around the levels, while if you want to save you have to resort to typewriters. Puzzles are essentially of two types: there are those based on finding specific objects, such as keys or documents, and mechanical ones, such as the library puzzle. The game map is larger and more varied than that of the first Resident Evil, which however used some places more intensely, being the more closed setting. In Resident Evil 2 some areas are essentially overcome by running, so as not to waste bullets, limiting the attention given to them by the player. The relationship between the main characters is also more refined, with Leon and Claire who meet on several occasions, giving life to a more articulated story than that of the first chapter, also enriched by spectacular filmed sequences. From a technical point of view, the greater budget invested in the development is evident, both for the aforementioned size of the map, and for the large number of FMV sequences, and for the more widespread use of animations in the scenarios. To pay a little for the grandeur due to the success is the atmosphere, less tense than that of the first Resident Evil and succumbing to some of the direct competitors, such as Silent Hill, released only a few months later. The substance is that for long stretches Resident Evil 2 is more of an action survival with zombies than a real survival horror, despite the fact that in 1998 certain distinctions made little sense. However, the new nature of the series will be clarified in the following episodes, in particular by the masterpiece Resident Evil 4, with the paradox of the return to the horror origins which took place only with the seventh chapter. But that, as they say, is another story.", "date": "2019-01-21", "grade": "8.0"}
