The jewel created by Media Molecule for PlayStation 3 has undoubtedly brought something new to the video game market, proposing itself not only as a nice inertial-based platformer, but also and above all as an extremely powerful software for creating customized levels. Developers at SilverTree Media must surely have been impressed by LBP's gameplay and style, as references to the game are evident right from the start in their latest project, Cordy. No editor, of course, but the gameplay based on the platforms and the physics of objects has been reproduced very faithfully on iPhone and iPad, with surprising results. Furthermore, the fact that the product belongs to the ~freemium~ category is different from the usual, far from some annoying extremes: Cordy can be downloaded for free from the App Store and played in its first four levels, after which it is possible to unlock the rest of the game (another twenty-two levels) at the price of 1.59 euros, without further disbursements. If we really want, for 79 cents you can buy objects to change the character's appearance, but it is an absolutely ancillary and not mandatory practice. In short, SilverTree Media wanted to distribute a single version of its title and insert an in-game purchase system to unlock its contents, rather than opting for the traditional ~free~ and ~full~ editions. A choice that we don't know whether to praise or criticize, given that freemium games don't really enjoy a very good reputation these days, and unsuspecting users could fear additional costs in addition to the already mentioned 1.59 euros to get the full product. Run, Sackb...um, Cordy! Cordy's gameplay is extremely simple and immediate, also thanks to the excellent touch control system: two buttons on the left side of the screen, to move the character left or right, which are opposed to as many buttons on the right side, which are used to jump and to interact with the scenery (pushing, dragging or picking up objects, for example). A third button only appears when we have collected all the ~electrons~ scattered throughout the stage and we are close to the device that will open the door to exit the stage, while the controls for accessing shopping in the stage are located in the upper part of the touch screen. -game (as already mentioned, to buy Cordy customization items) and to return to the level map. In fact it is impossible to ~die~, but it is certainly not by avoiding the game over that the SilverTree Media title tries to entertain us, but by challenging us to complete each stage completely, obtaining all three stars: the first for the simple achievement of the 'exit, therefore assigned by default every time we complete a level; the second for the collection of all the ~electrons~, even and above all the hidden ones; the third for the ~fast lap~, or for having completed the level within a variable time limit. A very simple solution, but which thanks to the quality of the product manages to effectively stimulate replayability, exponentially increasing the duration of the experience, which therefore goes well beyond the even high number of stages available. We have said that in terms of style and approach to the platform genre, Cordy undoubtedly recalls LittleBigPlanet, and the feeling is strengthened every time the character is called to move blocks to reach a certain platform, or to drop heavy objects against a barrier to break through it. However, there is also a bit of classic Sonic in the game, for example when you have to run (and Cordy accelerates) to take a longer leap than usual or to destroy a brick wall. The technical sector is really excellent in terms of style and numbers, it plays in a nice way with the feeling of depth of the scenarios and with their three-dimensional nature, all without giving up a certain degree of detail. In the face of some slowdown during the most spectacular stages, it is even possible to adjust the graphics so that they are less heavy for older generation devices. On the other hand, the sound disappoints: the music is too repetitive and not striking, the effects are within the norm.
