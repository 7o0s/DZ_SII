After the interesting experiment made with Paper Planes, a ~casual game~ of unsuspected depth, the Finnish team has finally decided to try their hand at pure puzzle games, obviously inspired by the classics of the genre but without limiting themselves to creating a clone or a mere reinterpretation . The aim of the game is to build ever higher totems, but things change depending on whether you choose the classic mode or the arcade mode: in the first case, we will find ourselves having to achieve specific objectives in each stage; in the second case it will simply be a survival race, with the aim of scoring as many points as possible before time runs out. Whatever our intention, however, the first obligatory step is the tutorial, which will explain to us in detail how the game works and what are the possible actions. The action takes place within fixed stages with three spaces to arrange as many columns, while the ~bricks~ that can be dropped are displayed at the top of the screen. Using the d-pad it is possible to move between these objects and select them by pressing the 5 key, then decide in which of the three columns to drop them. Unlike the classic Tetris, in Totomi there is no time limit established by a movement of the columns, nor is it necessary in any way to move or rotate the ~bricks~ before they land: everything is established by a time bar that is at the bottom of the screen, as well as the specific characteristics of each item released. As mentioned at the beginning, in fact, the Rovio title is based on simple notions concerning animals and objects. We will therefore find ~bricks~ that eat other ~bricks~ or that are eaten by those already lined up, others that mate (literally) and multiply, still others that cancel each other out. We will have to organize our totems according to the objectives to be achieved: sometimes it will be necessary to make the beavers eat a certain number of logs of wood, or to make elephants mate at certain times, etc. Once the combos are totaled, it will be possible to ~close~ a column and reset it by dropping a piece of tree trunk. The graphics of the game are simple but very well done, with an almost perfect interface and a nice style. The various ~bricks~ are drawn with thick strokes reminiscent of cartoons, and coupling them results in the appearance of spectacular animations. The use of colors is excellent, perhaps just a little simplistic in the application of shades. Note the numerous gimmicks that visually represent the compatibility between the various animals: when they can mate, bottles appear; when they ~coexist~ by doubling the boxes, hearts appear, etc. The sound, as usual, does what it can with a series of fairly good quality MIDI music.
