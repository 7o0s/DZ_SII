Quello vero.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/78448-metal-gear-solid-peace-walker-il-ritorno-di-snake-quello-vero.html", "text": "Colombia, 1974: ten years after the events narrated in Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake (now known by all as ~Big Boss~) finds himself in command of a group of homeless mercenaries, the ~Militaires Sans Frontires~. One day he and his second Miller are visited by a very particular couple, a teacher and a student from Costa Rica who ask for the intervention of the MSF to put an end to what appears to be a military occupation of the country. Soldiers kidnapped and held captive the girl, who somehow managed to escape and now begs Snake to help her free the place where she lives from oppression; to bring back that peace that at the moment lives only in the hopes of those who strongly desire it. Paz's words (~peace~, in fact) touch Snake, who in the end accepts the mission despite having intuition that the teacher is actually nothing but a KGB agent, and that the ~liberation~ of Costa Rica is part of the perspective of a military equilibrium between the United States and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, there is something that Snake absolutely must investigate: a recording made by the girl who was with Paz, who never came back from the ~invaders~ base. The one engraved on the tape (from the first Walkman model in history...) seems to be the voice of The Boss. But how is this possible? Over the course of its numerous missions (only the main ones exceed thirty), Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker will answer this and other questions, telling us about the birth of Outer Heaven and showing us the tormented maturation of one of the most charismatic characters who have ever appeared in a video game: Naked Snake. Voiced once again by the hoarse voice of David Hayter, who has put more ~humanity~ than usual in this new interpretation, Big Boss arrives on PSP accompanied by all the narrative force of which Hideo Kojima is capable, within a product that we could certainly define as among the most important ever made for the Sony portable console. No longer a spin-off of MGS like Portable Ops, therefore, but a real key episode of the Konami saga, in this case a sequel to the Snake Eater that greeted the glorious PlayStation 2 in the tears of its extraordinary finale. Fire, walk with me The first game sequences act as a quick tutorial to the combat system, which in melee allows us to hit opponents with a combination of punches and kicks but above all to grab them and throw them at other enemies, or to make them lose consciousness by squeezing the socket. It is possible to choose between three different control systems, but in the end the most complete is the one in which the analog pad is used to move the character and the main buttons manage the camera. Complete, we said, but far from immediate, especially when we are dealing with fast moving targets. The back keys L and R are used respectively to aim and open fire (or strike with bare hands), while the d-pad allows us to access the inventory with the left (support equipment) and right (weapons) directions, as well as to interact with the scenery (up) and duck (down). One of the reasons why Snake accepts the mission in Costa Rica is the KGB's promise of an offshore platform where the Militaires Sans Frontires will be able to establish themselves permanently, a ~Mother Base~ (we'll call it that from now on). forward) from which to coordinate the operations of the group, with the personnel divided into various units for each area of interest: combat, research and development, canteen, infirmary and espionage. Our first mission is precisely to search and free the area, currently occupied by the enemy, using the stealth dynamics that Metal Gear Solid fans know well. In Peace Walker, silence and patience are rewarded in a particular way, because the results obtained in each mission are reflected in the growth potential of the Mother Base and, consequently, of our equipment. Always use the balloon! The game takes from Portable Ops the concept of ~forced recruitment~ which sees our character capture as many enemy soldiers as possible to turn them into faithful allies, introducing in the gameplay (but also narratively, in a rather nice and elegant way) the Fulton Recovery: After putting an opponent to sleep or stunning, Snake can literally ~fly~ them off the stage using a balloon which is then recovered from an MSF helicopter. The maneuver works in any situation, even indoors, and adds an unprecedented and important strategic element to the Konami series, because the recovered soldiers end up in the MotherBase, to flesh out the ranks of the Big Boss army, and can be assigned to various departments according to their characteristics. The combat unit, for example, can be used in its components to tackle the numerous extra missions that become available as we proceed with the main plot, or used in external missions with automatic functioning, i.e. that are ~simulated~ while we we complete a normal level. Just form groups and select the target, trying to risk as little as possible: returning from the mission, the soldiers will enjoy an improvement in their skills. Or, well, they won't come back at all. Upgrading your combat unit will lead to an increase in GMPs, which in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker serve as money to build new weapons and equipment. However, these operations are subordinated to the simultaneous growth of the research and development unit, which in turn depends on the espionage unit for the collection of new projects. Finally, the canteen unit and the medical unit play a regulatory role, in the sense that they are not used in practice, but their development is necessary so that the troops never lack food (which would jeopardize general performance) and because everyone wounded soldiers are treated. As soon as the units reach a certain level, new projects are unlocked and we can use the GMPs in our possession to start the production of weapons and objects. The arsenal in Peace Walker has been taken care of in a particular way, in fact we have numerous types of pistols, assault rifles, machine guns, shotguns, missile launchers, sniper rifles, grenades, explosives, etc. However, it must be said that in practice very few of these weapons will prove to be really useful during the action: the ~stealth~ approach to which we have previously mentioned implies a predominant use of the silenced pistol with tranquilizer darts, also with a view to capturing unconscious enemies, while boss fights are decided by missile launchers. The good old cardboard box The matter of equipment is different, which we will end up using fully during the missions. We have already talked about the Fulton recovery system, then there are the classic ~rations~ and the like for restoring energy (essential during the boss fights and in the final stages), a sound detector that can work as a radar to warn us of presence of enemies in the surroundings, a sonic visor that performs more or less the same function but in a directional way, a very important supply system (to send us a load of ammunition from Mother Base), a night vision device, binoculars, a walkman and the classic string of cardboard boxes for all tastes, from the classic to the ~love~ one, passing through the tank-shaped box. No substantial innovation, therefore, apart from the introduction of the analyzer, an electronic device that ~measures~ the capabilities of our enemies and which therefore allows us to decide which ones to capture and which to leave on the ground. In reality, the circumstances and the game structure push us to ~convert~ as many opponents as possible, so the selection, despite having its own reason, is often overlooked in favor of a faster approach. Speaking of speed, Peace Walker is like the other episodes of the series, that is, it allows us to choose the approach we prefer to complete a mission but, as already mentioned, it favors patient and silent actions. This means shooting a tranquilizer dart into the leg of an enemy on guard and waiting for him to collapse (without firing any more shots to avoid ruining the silencer), then capturing him and moving on to the next one until the end of the stages, which usually boast modest dimensions and present therefore as small ~puzzles~ to be solved in the most effective way possible. The alternative, unfortunately, is quite messy: Metal Gear Solid has never been a shining example as regards the management of fights, which also in this episode prove to be ~slippery~ and complicated. To the well-known limitations of the series, however, is added in this case the extraordinary cumbersomeness of a control system which to define as difficult is little, and which due to the ~digital~ management of the view often puts us in truly infernal situations. Who doesn't play together... In Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker there is an ad hoc multiplayer mode, both in cooperative and competitive versions. We can therefore play all the missions of the game together with a friend, with the boss fights in particular which can be tackled in four at the same time and a series of competitive modes for six players. It's a pity that the developers didn't include an infrastructure mode natively (which is still possible using a PlayStation 3 and the ad hoc party), but for the moment we can be satisfied. Of course if the game came out on PSN too... Technical realization Let's throw it there: the best graphics ever seen on PSP? Let's also say that Peace Walker takes the well-known technical limits of the Sony portable console and overcomes them beautifully, offering us excellent polygonal models in terms of detail, textures and animations. Snake in particular is truly extraordinary, while as regards the enemies and the members of the MSF there is an (obvious) minor production care and one suffers a bit from the clone syndrome, which manifests itself systematically given that the characters wear by default a balaclava and (often) the same uniform. The missions take place within scenarios of limited dimensions, as we have already said, but during the boss fights there is a clear expansion of the borders and the spaces to cover suddenly become enormous. An excellent job has also been done with regard to the textures, i.e. the lack of definition of the same has been masked in the best way. It can be said that the numerous forests tend to present themselves in a rather confused way and to clash with the aiming reticle, but it is bearable. The bosses of the game are huge war machines controlled by artificial intelligence, and as per tradition they follow attack and movement patterns which, however complex, can be memorized in a matter of minutes. Their appearance is solid and convincing, they convey a real feeling of power (especially the last one...) and they are armed to the teeth. There are two different types of cutscenes: the ~normal~ ones use the game's graphics engine and show us sequences that are perhaps a little repetitive from a directing point of view, but always effective and spectacular; the ~stylized~ ones come from the skilful pencil of Ashley Wood, designer of the Metal Gear Solid comic for IDW Publishing, and combine dynamism and originality in a perfect union. The sound sector boasts excellent dubbing in English (subtitled in Italian), the classic effects of the series and an essential and well-dosed musical accompaniment, capable of creating a great atmosphere.", "date": "2010-06-23", "grade": "9.0"}
