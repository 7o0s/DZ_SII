{"name": "Il pi grande degli Slam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98991-grand-slam-tennis-2-il-piu-grande-degli-slam.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360With Top Spin 4 and Virtua Tennis 4 already available for a while, dividing the market between ~simulations~ and ~arcade~, Electronic Arts arrives late to the party, but shows up armed with enthusiasm and different ideas originals. There is therefore a lot of interest around Grand Slam Tennis 2 despite the unfavorable timing, also because although it is a quasi-debut by EA Canada the know-how that characterizes the sports productions of the American label - this year then strengthened from the amazing results of FIFA 12 - is now a constant, detectable in almost all fields in which it is applied. This second chapter doesn't have much in common with the first, released exclusively on Wii and characterized as an almost caricatured solution of real tennis, although valid in any case from a playful point of view. With Grand Slam Tennis 2 EA Sports officially launches into the field of tennis simulations, bringing with it its engine and its typical well-established structure in terms of options, menus and general layout. Continuing the publisher's new and valuable policy regarding sports titles, the game tries to insert specific innovative features, which try to offer something more than the competition in terms of gameplay beyond the simple exploitation of the powerful licenses purchased for production of the game. Mind you, the latter are present and make themselves felt: it is in fact the first tennis game to offer the official licenses of the four major international tournaments of this discipline, namely the US Open, Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon, thus offering the possibility of experience for the first time a video game grand slam, the dream of fans. However, it is not only this element, together with the various real players of the present and past tennis within the roster, that give an imprint to the EA Canada product. There is also and above all the new ~Total Racquet Control~ control system to give an innovative push, albeit with some uncertainty, and the team's usual care in the digital reconstruction of the reference sports universe, the air you breathe during matches that actually tastes like tennis. Full analog control The cut given by the developers certainly seeks the simulation path more, which places Grand Slam Tennis 2 in the direct wake of Top Spin 4, much more than going to annoy Virtua Tennis 4 in its arcade territory. Apart from the usual, powerful superstructure made up of stratified options and career possibilities, what strikes you immediately, once in the field, is the particular control system adopted, called Total Racquet Control and based on the new analog concept with which EA is structuring the input system in several of its sports titles (Fight Night and NHL are the first two examples that come to mind). Different shot patterns and ball direction are applied through movement of the right analog stick, with variations added by lob and bungee triggers: a fast forward motion is a ~flat~ shot, a backward to a ~cut~ one while a back to front one to a ~top spin~, with the possibility of loading each shot for a certain amount of time in order to amplify its effects, being however careful to calculate the right timing for the impact with the ball. It is an ingenious and complex system, which takes time to be properly assimilated but which is also capable of giving great satisfaction once it is mastered, however some doubtful points remain. First of all, in the most agitated phases it seems to take longer than simply pressing a key, which sometimes makes you prefer the old ~arcade~ system based on the front keys referring to the various types of shots, for which the system still applies of loading, which does not make it a total simplification of the game mechanics. The fact that both control systems are active and present in every moment of the game allows you to easily jump from one to the other when necessary, making the learning of Total Racquet Control gradual or simply leaving each player the freedom to interpret each moment of the game in the preferred way. The downside is that, aside from the satisfaction of being able to master stick movements properly, there is no obvious advantage to using TRC over keys, which may make the new control system redundant. control for the same results, also considering its relative discomfort in the faster stages. The other doubtful point is given by the handling of physics regarding theposition and movement of the player towards the ball, since sometimes one gets the impression that the tennis player is almost ~adjusted~ (millimetrically of course, it is still necessary to be in the right place at the right time) in the ideal position to obtain always the best effect, with the only truly influential variable given by the timing with which you hit the ball after loading, which certainly simplifies life, moving the axis towards the arcade style, but consequently flattens the structure a bit and lower the challenge level. Curiosity The PS3 version of Grand Slam Tennis 2 has the value added, compared to that for X360, to contain support for PlayStation Move, since that for Kinect is missing. The sensing device Sony's motion obviously adds a good deal of fun especially in offline multiplayer situation, shifting the style towards sports party game, but the implementation is well done and adaptable to various predispositions. Those looking for instant entertainment can only use the Move with the CPU controlled tennis player, but the more experienced players can choose total control using the Navigation controller or a normal controller to move your avatar. There response to commands is rather faithful and immediate, even if, as it happens in competitors, it is often the movement of the wrist that is most indicative that the correct simulation of the shot with the whole arm. The grand slam The other important introduction of Grand Slam Tennis 2, this time from a content point of view, is the presence of the four major tennis tournaments belonging to the ~Grand Slam~, namely the US Open, Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon, each represented from a number of different courses (3 or 4 per tournament) faithfully reproduced. This is an addition of no small importance, especially as regards the single-player game mode, mainly the Career. The latter is structured on the model already applied by EA Sports to its other sports titles and allows you to create a player starting from a complete editor and launch him on the international tennis circuit, trying to climb positions to reach the top of the rankings. The calendar allows you to take on various types of challenges in succession, choosing between training sessions, exhibitions, pre-tournaments and tournaments, capable of earning various points to spend on new equipment and finally on improving the player's statistics. As in FIFA 12 and other EA sports, various objectives are set throughout the calendar to be completed, both on a seasonal basis and within each event, capable of providing additional experience points and providing more ideas for tackling the matches. The Career represents the maximum playful offer in single player within Grand Slam Tennis 2, yet it does not convince at the levels of the corresponding modes present in other EA sports. In the end, the game situations are only those four and a deeper management of the tennis player's characteristics, specific training sessions and sponsors is missing, which could have given substance to the experience, also because the other exponents of the genre offer much more. especially to avoid a monotony that can occur in the long run. However, there are ample possibilities to vary the action even in singles with the other modalities between training sessions, customizable tournaments, exhibition matches, the possibility of playing singles and doubles and the particular ~Classics~, i.e. matches taken from the real history of the Grand Slams in which historical situations are recreated to face in the game, something similar to the ~scenarios~ of the old Internation Superstar Soccer. However, the fulcrum of longevity remains, as is natural for the genre, multiplayer, which also in this case can count on the good online support to which EA has now accustomed us. Xbox 360 goals 42 unlockable achievements are featured in Grand Slam Tennis, with the usual total being 1000 points. The achievements are spread over all the various game modes and in particular in the Career, with the request to obtain certain placements and awards or beat the various important tennis players to get points. Most of the objectives are quite accessible to those who intend to play in depth in single player, even if as usual the complete collection is quite demanding. Digital tennis players There is the usual, excellent work of the EA Canada graphics in the polygonal representation of the sport in question, even if in this case there is a minor push towards spectacularization, justified in fact also by the general composure of tennis respectto other disciplines. The settings are well done, even if the general rendering - especially as regards the lighting and image rendering - does not reach the levels of Top Spin 4, and the polygonal models of the tennis players are excellent. In particular, applause goes to the reproduction of licensed tennis players - a dozen men and women as regards contemporary athletes (such as Federer, Djokovi, Nadal, Sharapova, the Williams etc.) and 11 ~legends~ such as Becker, Borg, McEnroe, Sampras and others - which in addition to the similar appearance are also characterized by certain typical movements, convincingly reproduced in the game. This is an aspect that has a considerable weight for tennis fans and combined with the licenses on the Open and the presence of modalities such as the Grand Slam Classics and its historical scenarios can make the difference. In short, from a technical point of view, Grand Slam Tennis 2 has little to blame, it is perhaps desirable to take greater care in linking the animations of the characters and greater dynamism in the lighting system, but as a first step in the world of tennis simulations realistic mold is really promising. As far as the audio accompaniment is concerned, we note the presence of two-voice commentary during the matches complete with technical commentary by John McEnroe, an innovative element in the genre which, despite a certain recurrence of sentences, helps to characterize the game in a particular way. A last mention must be made for the artificial intelligence and the consequent difference in involvement between single and multiplayer: the game against the CPU requires an upward adjustment of the level of difficulty to result in an exciting challenge (the first year of the Career , necessarily set on the easy level, allows absurd situations such as the possibility of making a Grand Slam by winning tournaments against much more powerful opponents and higher in the rankings) and in general the AI does not prove capable of devising particularly creative and exciting plays, long. In short, the usual rule on the centrality of multiplayer to ensure a lasting and exciting gaming experience applies here too, and perhaps more than in other sports games.", "date": "2012-02-10", "grade": "7.8"}
