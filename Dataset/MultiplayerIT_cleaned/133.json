{"name": "Eragon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eragon_a.html", "text": "Golden (double) dragon Eragon broadly follows the events narrated by the book and film, centered on the figure of a young man who, together with his faithful dragon Saphira, must try to put an end to the reign of terror of an evil ruler. In this mobile version of the game, all of this translates into a mere pretext to slaughter enemies in a scrolling beat'em up sauce, a genre that is decidedly underused on mobile phones. And probably wrongly, considering how Eragon manages to juggle well with the playful mechanics typical of the category, configuring itself as a sufficiently complete product. The control system tolerates as many as eight keys to move in as many directions, delegating the primary attack to a single button: don't worry though, during the adventure various combos of two or three hits are unlocked and even some very powerful but they waste a portion of the protagonist's energy with each use. Eragon is therefore a scrolling beat'em up with all the trappings, which winks several times at a timeless classic like Golden Ax: in fact, the look of some enemies, the presence of ampoules to restore energy and mana and also the special attack, which in Eragon's case manifests itself in the on-screen appearance of Saphira's muzzle that sets fire to the entire area causing substantial damage to enemies. Unfortunately, the Vivendi product does not follow in the master's footsteps in one of the most important aspects, namely the involvement and the level of difficulty: Eragon is an extremely easy game, rather short (one hour is enough to complete it), but above all devoid of that personality and bite that are essential to make inroads into the user's heart. Eragon therefore lets itself be played quietly, but it certainly cannot be said to be a particularly exciting or demanding beat'em up. A real pity, in the light of the excellent cards that the Kaolink opera brings to the table, such as the bonus stages riding Saphira: in these phases the player must roast the various opponents using his fire-breathing partner, being careful to avoid the attacks and not to drain the flame power gauge. Again, Eragon offers a tasty series of crossroads which, although they do not radically change the course of the adventure, still add a discreet replay value to the whole. However, the most convincing aspect of the Vivendi product lies in the basic but appreciable elements of character growth: essentially, at the end of each level the user can choose to enhance two of the four characteristics of his alter ego (attack, defense, energy and mana), depending on your playing preferences. Moving on to the technical sector, Eragon gets along very well, showing off well-kept and well-animated sprites, backgrounds with different levels of parallax and absolutely spot-on colors; the very short but frequent loadings, on the other hand, are slightly annoying, while the sound is almost completely absent, relegated to a few jingles at the beginning and end of the level. It must be said that, like many other mobile products, Eragon changes from day to night when running on an older system: running it on a Nokia 6630, we reluctantly noticed a noticeable drop in graphics quality (even the backdrop and enemies always repeat the same throughout the adventure) and in the fluidity, as well as in the very nature of the game, deprived of crossroads, bonus stages and even the map.
