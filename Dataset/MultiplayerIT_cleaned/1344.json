{"name": "Battlefield: Vietnam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlefield-vietnam-2.html", "text": "wild thing! You make my heart single! As soon as you load the game you immediately notice a detail, a certain care that was missing in Battlefield: 1942 now seems to adorn the new DICE title and you can see it starting from the game menu. Captivating graphics, theme music and a less sparse approach to the interface, without saving on accessibility. In the game, the sensation is the same: the new graphics engine does not impress, especially when compared with what the next summer season will reserve for us, but it is certainly impactful and draws a precise border with the past. The deformed figures that ran on ~pool table~ levels have disappeared, now the maps have good detail, a fair complexity and textures up to the situation. For their part, the soldiers evolved into G.I. Joes full of muscles and gnashing jaws. The models of the weapons absolutely do not make you regret Call of Duty or the Vietcong, but rather they are well textured and have excellent animations, the vehicles are rich in polygons and move very well (the physics of the helicopters is excellent). The only ironic note: they reveal a somewhat ~plasticky~ aspect which, combined with the ~G.I. Joe of men, will give you the impression of playing with toy soldiers on the beach. Nothing negative, in any case, just a matter of ~feeling~. The levels are not entirely set in the jungle, indeed to tell the truth you will see very little of the jungle and even if present it does not reach the levels of detail achieved by other titles. On the other hand, the goal of BF: Vietnam is to relive the great pitched battles of the war, which generally took place far outside the tangled forested areas of the north of the country. In any case, it is obvious to note the good work done by the team on creating a natural environment that is sufficiently effective, beautiful and not too heavy for the players' hardware, provided that you compromise with the aesthetic goodies offered by Directx9 and that you tolerate the numerous stability problems that the engine suffers from on ATI video cards, probably the result of an excessive zeal in respecting the release dates of the title. Speaking instead of level design, it is not easy to form an overall opinion: fourteen levels are not many and very often, due to the new ~Evolution~ mode (simply the points of each team are taken from one map to another and is won by adding the result of several battles), which joins the already known ~Assault~ and ~Conquest~, it happens that the same map is re-proposed with only a few aesthetic changes (for example at a different time of day) and a of alternative waypoints and speaking of mere quantity this thing certainly does not play in favor of the product. The maps are sufficiently well studied in order to increasingly create a single combat front and trying to disperse the players as little as possible, furthermore the urban settings offer tactically interesting game ideas and generally manage to recreate the cinematic atmosphere of titles such as Full Metal Jacket (one at random). And my dear mother left me when I was quite young The Flower Power, the rediscovery of the blues by the white hippies, the explosion of rock, R&B and so on. The years of the war in Vietnam corresponded to those of a deadly and unrepeatable musical explosion. Electronic Arts could not fail to seize the opportunity to add an extra touch of spectacularity to the title and so here is an abundance of licenses for an avalanche of unforgettable songs that ... ~do a lot of Vietnam~. Mounting a Huey, starting the rotors and shooting Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival is a unique satisfaction. There are about fifteen songs and you can also listen to them in multiplayer while driving any vehicle, in addition to this there is a special folder to insert personal mp3s in-game, which can be listened to, in this case, only locally. This is just a touch of class, but I swear it makes half the atmosphere of the title. Spreading death and destruction listening to Wagner is something priceless, almost like listening to Little Richard on a Huey while Jesse Ventura spits tobacco on your amphibians (who remembers Predator?). The sound effects do their job admirably, but from a technical point of view it seems that a few steps have been taken backwards: between imperfect audio buffer settings and some incompatibilities with the Creative drivers, you may have more than one headache, up to to annoying system crashes. I fought the law and the law won! Many new onesvehicles and weapons from the 70s await you on the swampy battlefields of Indochina. The armory is stocked, looks and works great, and above all, much deadlier than the assortment presented in Battlefield: 1942. The classes have been revamped and revised for better gameplay and more defined roles, and the new skills are excellent. of engineers, such as the ability to mount field mortars, dig tunnels to obtain mobile waypoints or place traps and sabotage enemy vehicles. The damage model is vaguely more realistic, dying is much easier and it begins to be necessary, despite the permanence of the arcade approach, to find adequate cover during firefights. The vehicles are present in decidedly reduced numbers (but this is not necessarily a bad thing, rather a choice of game design) and offer numerous innovative functions such as the possibility for helicopters to lift vehicles on the ground with a tow hook, and the possibility for passengers to fire freely from moving vehicles while also turning the old jeep into a useful assault craft. The vehicles are therefore promoted with full marks, apart from perhaps an excessive fragility of the tanks, but the balance of the classes presents a curious anomaly: how can a man carry around 15 kilos of M-60 machine gun (a weapon generally operated by at least two people) ultra-precise even at medium range, which fires billions of shots and still have the strength to carry a handful of rocket launchers on one's shoulders? This is the curious dilemma that did not perturb the minds of the DICE team when building the US Army's ~Antitank Class~. The result is obvious: this sort of human death machine is the most inflated class on servers, we hope for a prompt correction by patch. Final comments The EA recipe, therefore, is renewed: after two years, two expansions, a lot of mods on the net and thousands of players crowding the servers every day, Electronic Arts tries again and there is a chance that it will succeed. The biggest problem with this latest incarnation of Battlefield is the numerous technical problems that have been encountered and the impression is that the lesson of BF:1942 has not served any purpose. We have in our hands another, potentially, excellent title awaiting a very urgent patch: the servers are already so many and they are exploding with players. Unfortunately it is difficult to ignore the aforementioned technical problems and when the lag generated by a still immature netcode gets in the way, one really wonders if it was the same team of the previous title who wrote the code. It's a real shame, because the Battlefield saga grows with this new title and gains in playability with a ~fun factor~ decidedly above the average of the titles in circulation. Paradoxically, its main opponent is its ancestor Battlefield: 1942 which continues to crowd the servers and which, to date, offers a much more mature and stable network code. After all, it should be enough to wait for the first patch to be able to crown the new king of online arcades. Pros: Very high playability Great atmosphere Numerous elements of innovation Cons: Immature netcode Bugs and system crashes Sometimes unbalanced War! What is it good for? (absolutely. Nothing!) Electronic Arts has taken up the challenge and we are now spiritually ready for a future decade of games set in Vietnam, but it is better to enjoy the novelty while we still have time and savor this new title, a sequel to the more than famous ~Battlefield 1942~, which brings us on the battlefields of the Indochinese peninsula. You are not in the narrow forests of mountainous Vietnam of ~Vietcong~ here, but EA leads us by the hand to take part in the great battles between US troops and North Vietnamese regular army, the famous NVA. From the Ia Drang valley to the city of Qan Tri we will take up arms to relive one of the most important conflicts of the 20th century, all in the DICE (the software house, editor's note) way, of course.", "date": "2004-04-02", "grade": null}
