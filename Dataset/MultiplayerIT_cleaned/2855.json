Good question, given that fifty years have passed since his last (un)encrypted message and no one has yet managed to trace the identity of one of the most disturbing serial killers who terrorized California at the turn of the 1960s and 1970s. David Fincher's homonymous film, with a first-rate cast (among which the stars of Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal shine) traces its contours using all available information up to 2007, the year of its release ; not much more has been known since then, although in recent times technological advances have revived the case. Will This is the Zodiac Speaking be able to add some detail to the intricate events? Let's find out in our review. A journalist in the footsteps of the killer In short, our murderer not only had a passion for young women, on whom he raged with sadistic cruelty (five victims attributed to him with certainty, even if he himself claims to have sent many more to the cemetery), but also for the journalism and puzzles: after the ruthless executions he sent the local newspapers both the details of the murders (of which only the author could be aware), and above all the encrypted messages. Of the four published full-page, only the first was fully translated: the one in which the Zodiac killer explained the reasons for his actions and threatened to blow up a school bus in order to bring pain to as many American families as possible (fortunately words were not followed by deeds). This is precisely the episode that opens the second effort by the Polish studio Punch Punk Games (the first was Apocalipsis). In the role of journalist Robert Hartnell (probable alter ego of Paul Avery, a reporter who for years dedicated himself to revealing the identity of the man behind the mask) we should go to Mount Diablo, a hilly town near San Francisco, where the Zodiac given an appointment: the goal is to foil the plan at the school bus and deliver it to the police, but things don't go as planned... Anatomy of a murder In an interweaving of the ghosts of Robert's past, characterized by a difficult childhood and the mysterious disappearance of a little girl, and his obsession with solving encrypted messages, the player is transported to the scenes of two of the crimes committed by the Zodiac, with the objective of reconstructing the chronological order of the events and saving, at least spiritually, the souls of the poor victims. The first case to be solved is that of Riverside, the scene in 1966 of the murder of Cherri Jo Bates, an eighteen-year-old student first approached and then stabbed with unprecedented violence. Although there are no certainties about the author, many clues lead to Zodiac, above all a rambling poem engraved on a university desk attended by the young woman. The second investigation, in turn divided into three acts, revolves around the attack on Lake Berryessa (precisely the one at the Glory Hole), where the serial killer stabbed Bryan Calvin Hartnell and Cecelia Ann Shepard in 1969. The boy managed to save himself from the six stab wounds inflicted on his back, while poor Cecelia lost the battle with death after two days of agony. The player's task is, very simply, to explore the areas of aggression, solving trivial environmental puzzles and collecting all the clues in order to have a general picture of what happened; then, once the events have been put in order, recover the cipher and move on to the next level, where the second part of the murder has to be investigated and so on. Everything is complicated (if you will: the lowest difficulty level eliminates the root of the problem) by the indiscreet presence of the murderer who obviously cannot be tackled. To avoid being identified, you must therefore move slowly in the shadows, taking advantage of the limited shot only to move away when you begin to smell something burning. If you are ~caught~ you have to start from the beginning of the level, fortunately maintaining the progress achieved up to that moment. Unsatisfactory technical realization All of this, as anticipated, mixes with the lived Robert Hartnell, in whose past domestic violence and the figure of a little girl called Goose are intertwined. To drive away the ghosts that are driving him mad, the protagonist entrusts himself to the care of a psychologist who, between one investigation and another, asks him questions whose answers are not at all obvious (such as the choice of one of three photographs that have no apparent connection with the events) and whose choices will also influence the ending, which is reached for the first time dafter about five hours. The maps are quite small, so the backtracking that the game often forces is not that annoying; however it must be admitted that the stealth phases are rarely effective in conveying anxiety and fear and more than once one will be tempted to (re)start the adventure by completely eliminating the presence of the Zodiac to enjoy the reconstruction more calmly (and with less frustration) events, especially interesting for those who are not very knowledgeable about the case. Technically, the Punch Punk Games project is very small. The minimalist graphics adapt to the noir atmosphere (we appreciated it in other detective stories such as This is the Police), but the settings would have needed more breathing space and above all more attention to detail. The maximum resolution, FullHD, is a bit limited by modern standards; there are also some annoying bugs, such as settings not being saved and mouse pointer freezing in inventory screens, which should be quickly fixed. The English dubbing (Italian is completely missing) is literally unsustainable: whoever lent the voice to Zodiac, clearly unsuitable for the role, found nothing better than opening the vowels wide to give back the idea of the schizophrenic killer; and things don't get much better with the alter egos of Robert and the doctor who treats him. Not bad, however, the dynamic soundtrack that adapts depending on how close the enemy is and manages to raise the player's alert level. A few unexpected screams help keep the tension high.", "date": "2020-10-09", "grade": "5.0"}
