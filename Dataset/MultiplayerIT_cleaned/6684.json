{"name": "The Talos Principle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142175-the-talos-principle-enigmi-filosofici.html", "text": "In the period in which puzzle games have found new fertile ground, thanks to the diffusion of mobile devices and the thriving independent panorama, proposing truly original, brilliant ideas with a strong personality is increasingly complex, also because the courage to dare, in a ruthless market and devourer of clones, sometimes you pay very dearly. Yet The Talos Principle, the object of our analysis, represents the emblem of the desire to impose and stand out, catalysed by an uncommon artistic inspiration and by a narrative substratum so deep, mature, as to be almost alien to the videogame medium, where the urge to reflect is often punched out and is an end in itself. It is surprising that a work of such elegance and delicacy was born from the guys of Croteam, the software house behind the series of ~caciaroni~ shooters of Serious Sam, yet, as we wrote in our previous test of the game, the idea was born exploring some environmental puzzles for the new chapter of the aforementioned blockbuster saga. The introduction to the team of a couple of key figures in the narrative design field, namely the programmer-philosopher Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, authors of some very interesting titles such as The Swapper, FTL and The Sea Will Claim Everything, has transformed a puzzle game similar to Portal - conceptually - in a completely new experience, at times moving, ingenious and able to tickle even the most refined palates. If you want to know more, just keep reading. The Talos Principle is an inspired, original and highly successful puzzle game Existential problems In Greek mythology, Talos (or Talo) is a living bronze colossus that Hephaestus created for Zeus, an imposing automaton whose purpose was to protect the island of Crete from unwanted visits. Imagine the questions that such a form of life-non-life - what we would today call artificial intelligence - could ask itself before the mirror about its own existence and consciousness, and you will have a first, subtle idea of the philosophical and metaphysical themes touched upon in The Talos Principle. What would distinguish a man from a machine, if we could replace, one by one, individual neurons with nanorobots capable of replicating their absolute functions? And if we replaced just a handful of these brain cells, would we still have human consciousness? Existential questions that, during the adventure, the player will have to face by interacting with ancient terminals scattered on the map, teased by the thundering voice of Elohim - a sort of almighty God who ~accompanies~ us from the beginning - and by cryptic messages and sequences which from time to time reveal themselves before the eyes. The first impact with the Croteam title is alienating due to the double soul of the scenario, immersed in bucolic ancient landscapes but dotted with futuristic elements, such as for example the aforementioned computers, which suggest an experimental nature for the area in which we are confined. After all, even the player's avatar is an elegant android, and only by making your way through the multitude of puzzles proposed, puzzle after puzzle, can you get a clearer and more personal idea of the mysteries that surround the Garden of Elohim's Creation . What is surprising is the quantity and quality of the texts, references and quotations, which captivate the player, encouraging him to ask questions and reflect on the concept of free will, on opposites and on the theme of extinction, with a truly unusual elegance for the gaming medium. There is no doubt that such a profound and well-finished work from a narrative point of view, which pushes the player to numerous reading sessions, is not for everyone, although it is possible to neglect them by dedicating oneself to the simple solution of puzzles. Nonetheless, not getting carried away by the sophistication and maturity of the arguments covered, could partially reduce the intrinsic appeal of The Talos Principle. At the time of writing, the title has not yet been officially released and has no Italian subtitles, however the developers have told us that they are working on the various translations, and our hope is that the texts in our language will be up to par of the original ones. Architectural barriers Ok, there's a lot of philosophy and the plot is really very intriguing, even resulting in multiple endings determined by the player's choices and personality, but what kind of game is The Talos Principle? As specified in the introduction, we are dealing with a first-person puzzle game inspired by the masterpiece Portal, from which, however, it distances itself from the point of view of the most intimate dynamics, relying more on logic puzzles rather than on skillfulty of the gamer with mouse and keyboard. At the beginning of the adventure we find ourselves immersed in a surreal Greco-Roman scenario, and our mentor Elohim, part father and part master, after some cryptic messages warns us not to be seduced and tempted by the Tower, a huge building which will mark the progression towards the end credits. The game map is divided into three main sectors simply called A, B and C, inspired respectively by Greco-Roman, Egyptian and Gothic-Medieval antiquity, within which we will find a sort of temple or cathedral, which in turn provides free access to the puzzle rooms, seven for each setting. In each ~room~, a fascinating open-air scenario, there are doors to access individual puzzles, which can be solved in any order you wish. The player's aim is to recover the so-called ~seals~ - the Tetris tetrominoes - which, through a special and intriguing mini-game, allow you to continue exploring the Garden of Creation. The seals are not all of the same family and for clarity they are divided into colors; the red ones, for example, allow access to the various floors of the Tower (six in all), while the yellow ones unlock the various gadgets needed to solve the puzzles, which are increasingly complex even though they never lead to frustration. There are more than one hundred seals to collect, as well as bonus stars and secrets to reveal, elements that support the longevity of the title, which in the first ~run~ can easily exceed twenty hours of play. The puzzles are all of a logical-deductive nature - only a handful require a certain manual skill - and to reach the coveted tetromino, usually closed behind an energy barrier, it is necessary to carefully observe the environment, as well as exploit the objects available to circumvent security systems and obstacles of various kinds. There are six gadgets in all and, in most cases, they must be combined with each other (when available) to find the right balance for a single room: the Jammer, for example, is very useful for unlocking energy barriers and stopping the dangerous mines with movement; the Laser Connector diverts the light beams (blue and red) to be directed to the various switches; the Cube is useful for climbing ledges or positioning other gadgets at certain heights; the Fan and the Platform are generally used to move or lift objects, while the Holographic Recorder allows us to replicate some of our actions by making available, for example, twice as many objects on the screen. Although the aforementioned gadgets are not many and in the last phase of the adventure one feels a little tired in the logical solutions prepared by the developers, the variety is still very good and is able to tease the player's brains for a long time. Since each puzzle can be completed almost freely, beyond the introductory phase, one cannot speak of a real learning curve, although in any case one is ~accompanied~ in the use of each new gadget conquered. Some puzzles are quite simple and quick to process, others require time and patience to complete, as Croteam often plays with perspectives, windows and symmetries, making a very careful study of the area necessary to place objects correctly. The solutions in most of the puzzles are unique, however there is no shortage of puzzles in which it is possible to find alternative ways. Finally, remember that it is possible to start the game in ~moddable~ mode, with the possibility of creating puzzles and entire customized campaigns, for the further benefit of longevity. Ancient charm We also really liked The Talos Principle in the Early Access version, but with the update to ~code review~ it benefited from a whole series of features that further underlined the excellent graphic-artistic work of Croteam. Among them we find, for example, the support for the Direct-X 11 libraries, decidedly more refined and solid than the Direct-X 9, and a renewed lighting system, particularly appreciable in the temples where delicate rays of light filter through the windows. The bucolic scenarios of the Garden of Creation often lead to breathtaking panoramas, where it is above all the rendering of the sky, the ocean in the background and the light effects that embellish the image. The rendering of the vegetation and the various ruins is also very good, especially the Greco-Roman and Egyptian ones (the medieval scenery shines a little less), even net of some washed-out textures on the tree trunks and not always precise shadows. Furthermore, with our test configuration we were able to play with all the details at maximum 1080 e60 very solid frames per second, a significant step forward compared to the Early Access code, marred by slowdowns in certain circumstances. The numerous advanced graphics options also allow you to shape the experience according to your gaming system. The sampling of Elohim's thundering voice is excellent, as is that of the sound effects, deep, vibrant and with an excellent three-dimensionality. The soundtrack is also delightful, relaxing and at times melancholy, fully integrated into the philosophical context that embraces the plot and capable of touching the right strings.", "date": "2014-12-12", "grade": "8.8"}
