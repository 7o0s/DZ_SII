For i few who had never heard of him yet, here is a brief excursus on his history. Called simply ~Sangokumus~ at home, it is a historical series that started in 1997 on the PlayStation, born as a spin-off and offshoot of the video game ~Romance of the Three Kingdoms~ which was in turn inspired by the classic of Chinese literature ~The Romance of the Three Kingdoms~ which represents one of the four most famous books of all time in Middle Earth. Dynasty Warriors has sold something like 12 million copies over the years and represents the most successful series for Koei, today Tecmo-Koei after the merger between the two historic software houses. One of the most evident characteristics in each chapter has always been the scarcity of innovations in the gameplay, which is almost the same year after year as the previous one, making sure that the latest chapters released on current consoles are virtually identical to those of 20 years, graphics part. But the dispute has always continued because the fans love and want to play exactly with that gameplay and have little tolerated in the past the timid introductions and innovations made by the developers. In short, the dog chasing its tail has meant that Dynasty Warriors comes out today with a very strong retro taste that fans will like so much, and just as many will hate. Tecmo-Koei however, wants to amaze us with this eighth chapter. Viuleeeeeeeee! But with grace Dynasty Warriors 8 therefore, does not differ much from the previous ones, apart from some juicy novelties which we will discuss later. It is once again a hack'n'slash with a role-playing structure and a distinctly action soul, without frills and fairly long to complete. Inspired by the origins, i.e. the ancient Chinese battles between warlords, it is a question of conquering enemy territories by making one's army collide against the opposing one, always led by a general and other ~bosses~ who, once defeated, will make us annex the place from manned them. Dynasty Warriors 8, as per tradition, offers a very large cast from which to choose your commander: 77 characters each characterized by distinguishable features, detailed clothing and armor and personalized weapons. The classic story mode tries, with many poetic licenses, to retrace real events, battles of the past with protagonists of the time, clashes between famous warriors and so on, in order to amalgamate the plot just mentioned and serve as a glue between a fight and the other. The main mode is very long and dotted with many enemies, bosses, mini bosses and dozens and dozens of armies to be faced basically all with the ardor of wild button smashing and without much reasoning or thoughts. Maybe the saga is also liked so much for this: the action is not reasoned but purely intuitive, and the combat system is simplified to the max. You can carry two weapons at the same time and ~switch~ between them as you please; there is the parade, some custom combos and the use of particular items within the various game areas. The second weapon makes sense when a new game mechanic is activated, namely ~Heaven, earth or man~ (read: paper, scissors or stone), during which we must select the weapon that manages to damage the most the opponent based on his characteristics (some weapons damage others) and always looking for the weak point before attacking at random as it was once done. However, the game action remains very frenetic and lacks moments of pause. The pleasure that such an intuitive, fast and ~brainless~ gameplay can cause, which sees us face hundreds of enemies at the same time, is soon explained. Seeing whole armies shot down with white weapons and the feeling of invincibility you feel give a thrill of omnipotence rarely replicable in other video games. Dynasty Warriors 8 perhaps responds to all those unconscious desires for revenge on the regulated society, and subject to its own constraints. How many times, stuck in traffic, have we not wished we had a tank to go over everyone with unprecedented violence? The concept is clear and perhaps it is no coincidence that this saga is particularly successful in the Rising Sun where it was also born. The new chapter of Dynasty Warriors has arrived between news and firm certainties! Xbox 360 goals The latest chapter of Dynasty Warriors offers the canonical 1000 points, to be unlocked through ben41 goals. It won't be easy to get them all because many are linked to specific game actions that are difficult to identify without the help of a guide, others to obtaining particularly hardcore statistics such as defeating 100,000 opponents or completing all stages with all selectable characters: impossible for every person still lucid. Ambition expands the managerial ambitions of the saga Although the gameplay and general structure of the game have once again remained unchanged, except for some novelties that do not distort the substance of Dynasty Warriors 8, this time Tecmo-Koei seems to have intercepted some discontent in the fan base and for this reason has introduced a completely new that frankly amazed us for its diversity and fun. In addition to the story mode, which follows historical events and intertwines with many episodes of oriental mythology, and the free mode that does not follow precise patterns, Dynasty Warriors 8 finally offers a purely role-playing component inside, called Ambition. The aim is to build a castle worthy of being visited by none other than the Emperor. To do this we must (obviously) fight but in much shorter sessions than the single player game which will give us, once completed, raw materials to build our fortress-city, new weapons and useful items as well as train fresh allies. For example, we will have to think of the blacksmith, indispensable for obtaining new swords and repairing broken ones, or the innkeeper who prepares food for the soldiers in his always open restaurant. By accumulating fame, wealth and fighters we will create a real small personal empire that one day hopefully will be worthy of the Emperor himself. The management component is in this case preponderant compared to the purely action one, and this breakthrough by the developer would appear to be a sort of experiment to be resumed and perhaps expanded in the next chapters of the series. Returning instead to the classic gameplay tasted during the ~in battle~ sessions, it must be said that once again the juice lies in developing a Kill Count as high as possible, and this through the use of increasingly powerful weapons and devastating combos . The ~Storm Rush~, a sort of uncontrollable ~Berserk~ style ardor, for example, allows us to attack relentlessly for a few seconds when our ~affinity~ bar is higher than that of the opponent. Once the blue bar, indicated above the opponents, is exhausted, the Storm Rush activates itself and begins its destructive ardor. On the contrary, or when our affinity bar is lower than that of the enemy, a ~Switch Counter~ can be activated which not only resets the opponent's attack but allows us to react instantly through the timed pressure of a command that appears while we are about to be attacked. A question of timing therefore, to counterattack and turn the situation to our advantage. By attacking enemies, the ~Rage~ bar is increased slowly, until it reaches its peak and gives us the opportunity to activate this uncontrolled fury by pressing the back button. This attack lasts the same time that we hold down the dedicated button, except for the extinction of the bar itself which regulates times and methods. It is possible, once again, to create weapons, fuse them (option borrowed from the Orochi saga), duplicate them, upgrade them and save them, so as to create a personal arsenal to be used later in battle. The use of the horse in battle also returns, which can be called by pressing the other backbone and on which our character automatically mounts to start leading from a meter and a half in height: a favorable position to do more damage. Retro feel The graphic sector of the series has never been compared or represented the pinnacle of any videogame generation, on the contrary. Often the most fervent criticisms have focused precisely on the fact that the graphics engine changed very little, exactly as much as its gameplay. Dynasty Warriors 8, after almost 7 years, still uses the same early generation 3D engine. Changes and improvements have obviously been made, so that today the game horizon is much further away, there are (almost) no more bad clipping phenomena or sudden polygonal appearances, bad interpenetrations (always present but less noticeable), textures not brilliant. Even the polygonal models are almost unchanged: those of the opposing armies are once again quite sloppy and sparse, a factor due to the impressive number of characters on the screen but obviously also to the lack of commitment of the technical team working on the graphics sector. Improved weather effects during battle sessions andartificial intelligence has been revised by retouching it towards a more difficult level, pleasing to the western public. The music, always orchestrated and impactful, is pleasant and very beautiful, even if it is often repeated ad nauseam given that some game sessions could last for tens and tens of minutes without stopping. The game is very long, there are 4 stories to complete each of about five hours and the Ambition mode is full of things to do and virtually infinite. We really liked the new direction of Dynasty Warriors because it managed to keep its spirit intact, while introducing some new features that will not displease both newbies and old fans. Of note are some quite obvious problems in the Xbox 360 edition of the game, which is often afflicted by moments of total confusion due to unexplained slowdowns in the frame rate that sometimes make it unplayable. Tecmo-Koei is aware of the fact and has recently declared that it is already working to solve the problem through an imminent patch release.", "date": "2013-07-23", "grade": "7.5"}
