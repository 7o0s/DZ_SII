{"name": "50 Cent: Blood on the Sand - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-recensione.html", "text": "You gotta get out of the ghettos boys!, Mr. Wolf admonished Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, after solving the disastrous Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction, and taking this film classic literally, 50 Cent leaves his native New York for a fictional middle country east, where together with the G-Unit boys he will have to hold a mega concert. The fee for his work, no cash but an elegant skull studded with diamonds and precious stones, is promptly stolen from him, consequently together with his cronies, between a f@ck and a bit@h bestowed without paying attention to sensitive souls, all he has left is to start the hunt in search of the lost skull. Two games in one The first impression is that of a classic third-person shooter, but from a gameplay point of view the guys at Swordfish Studios have kept in mind, during the development of two titles, Gears of War for the basic mechanics, the protagonist can in fact, run and take advantage of cover to take cover and shoot blindly, and The Club, an underrated game by Bizarre Creations for its arcade attitude of shooting, where successful shots reward the player with points and assorted extras. However, all in a purely casual and arcade perspective, given that the difficulty is never too high, but above all because the two souls interpenetrate each other without either of them excluding the other, in fact generating a curious immediate and rather amusing, but which dilutes the potential of the two approaches. Furthermore, so as not to miss anything, the developers have included the very inflated quick time events, in the form, however, not of a decisive blow during a boss fight, but a more generic melee to be activated whenever you are cornered with an enemy. In practice, however, its usefulness is almost equal to zero, given that in the economy of the game the need to kill with bare hands is practically nil, reducing Fifty's fists to a mere scenographic need, given that the weapons fire are the real protagonists of the game. You start with a simple pistol with infinite shots and then collect or buy, spending the money collected around the levels, all the classic paraphernalia such as machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and so on. Moments aboard vehicles, jeeps and helicopters were then thrown into the cauldron of the game, which have the only merit of breaking up the action, given that they do not offer a good level of challenge, but rather are rather flat and dull, more a graft due with a view to inserting everything that is normally found in a shooter and for real gameplay needs. The game scheme is quite simple, seen and reviewed in many similar games, you enter a room, or a courtyard or a square, and you have to kill all the enemies that arrive in waves. Once this is done a door opens and the sequence continues. This is not to say that Blood on the sand is particularly boring and repetitive, the developers have done a good job of level design, creating very varied and well-crafted environments, full of cover and places to hide, but the general impression is that you want due to the decidedly frenetic and fast pace of the shootings, the Gears of War aspect of the game is debased or at least little explored. Do I take the poster or shoot the guy with the machine gun? More than a ~tactical~ shooter, pass me the term, all cover, fire and movement, with perhaps some moments in which you observe your opponents to study their placements, perhaps attempting a flanking, you are faced with a title that is the gun version of a scrolling beat 'em up, fast and frantic, but that leaves little room for a more reasoned approach to shooting. This ambivalence, this inability to choose decisively the fulcrum of the game is supported by the inclusion of a score heavily borrowed from The Club, which rewards the player according to the way he kills his opponents. The shootings are in fact littered with small targets that are activated in real time during the firefights. For example, we are told to kill the guys stationed on the roof with an RPG within a certain time limit, or we are awarded points if we attack the opponents head-on (what are the covers for then?), or for precise headshots. In addition to the extra points, completing these ~mini achievements~ also gives the player small bonuses in the form of explosive projectiles and so on. Furthermore, to complete the series of extra things to do, we are asked to find posters and targets scattered throughout the levels, obviously everything contributes to raising the score and the final evaluation, a means that is used to unlock the whole series of bonuses in the form of artworks, music videos, and songs that will delight fans of the New York rapper, but also tricks like invincibility and infinite money. Going forward in the game, one remains perplexed by the offer of the title, undecided on what it really wants to be, which if undeniably fun, especially if played in two online, with the possibility of joining and exiting the game fluidly, fails to deviate too much from an overall judgment of an average product, not mediocre though. It's almost impossible to talk about a title with ups and downs, there simply aren't any sensational ones, and quoting Horace it's possible to say that the Aurea mediocritas is the main feature of this game. Using a daring metaphor, if Gears of War is a Hollywood blockbuster, full of barrels and explosions, Blood on the Sand is a pleasant TV movie, well made and enjoyable, but far from the opulence of six-figure cinema productions. Average that can't be more average Even the artificial intelligence, cross and delight of titles of this genre, works quite well, with enemies who, although not equipped with particular flashes, offer a good challenge to the player, while it is not uncommon to see one's adventure companion, always ready to indicate the correct path within the level, to save 50 Cent in the most agitated moments. The only critical points, which in any case do not heavily affect the overall judgment of the title, concern a method of control that is sometimes a bit cumbersome (entry and exit from the roof) and that of being rather short, between six and eight hours, but the duration cannot fail to ignore the possibilities offered by its being arcade, by its inherent replayability, by making the highest score, hitting all the mini objectives and unlocking all the extra contents. Nothing new that has not already been seen in The Club, and here presented in a minor key, but functional and well thought out in the same way. Even from a purely graphic point of view the philosophy remains unchanged, the use of the Unreal Engine does not make one cry for a miracle, but at the same time nothing is particularly negative. Of great impact as written at the beginning, is the work done on the level design, with the various and well-modeled structures and areas, the models and textures of Fifty and his boys are good, while those of the enemies are only sufficient. In the same way there are discreet special effects, complete with particles following pyrotechnic explosions, which however do not substantially change the construction of the levels and a pleasant use of HDR. Those who know a ~street~ English will instead appreciate the excellent dubbing work done by 50 Cent, a continuous foul language without respect for anything or anyone, obviously then the unreleased songs present in the game are an indispensable plus for fans of the rapper, which can then be organized into a convenient tracklist. At the conclusion of the review it is impossible not to underline the lack of trophies (present instead the Achievements, 46 for a total of 1000 points), which is rather strange given that from January 1st all titles coming out on PlayStation 3 should have them. Comment 50 Cent, Blood on the sand is a decidedly particular title, and difficult to evaluate. Blend without restraint, smoothing out every peculiarity of the parties involved, the mechanics of Gears of War and the arcade approach of The Club, then adding a pinch of Quick Time Events. The resulting mixture is a decidedly casual title in terms of approach, which is halfway between the two souls of the game, undecided on what to really be, without either taking over the other. In short, a game without particular excellences or heavy criticalities but which works, an average product equipped with good graphics, fun and immediate, especially if played in pairs, but which could make the most savvy players turn up their noses who can immediately unmask the easy ~hyper-quotationist~ operation created by the guys from Swordfish Studios.Pro Fun and immediate Excellent management of the coop The arcade soul and the mini objectives Against Undecided about what the real focus of the game is Moments on vehicles to review Controls a bit woody", "date": "2009-03-17", "grade": null}
