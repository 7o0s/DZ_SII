{"name": "Rayman Raving Rabbids - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids-recensione.html", "text": "Eggplant Parmesan The first impact with Rayman Raving Rabbids is misleading: all in all, the first stages show a solid polygonal engine and a good variety of colors, which thanks to the illusory 3D makes this adventure much more similar to a two-dimensional platform even in execution, surprising with sudden camera movements that resume the action from another perspective during some passages that ideally remain linear scrolling. In reality, one is soon baffled by some audiovisual shortcomings which certainly place Rayman Raving Rabbids below even older products such as Super Mario 64 DS: in particular, the textures are sometimes really poor, and the polygonal models of the various little creatures, of the Rabbids in particular, are uninspired and decidedly crude. Instead, Rayman stands out, as usual excellently animated, throwing punches left and right, hopping with his floating limbs, adapting to the unfriendly frame rate and the slowdowns that occur from time to time in the more graphically complex situations. Not only that, there is a series of bizarre considerations to be made regarding the audio department: some pieces of music, fortunately few and rare, are seriously unbearable, in particular the intermezzo between some stages, a jumble of din combined with the verses irritants of the Rabbids. However, nothing can be said against the exhilarating and irresistible music tracks that play songs like ~Girls just wanna have fun~ at high speed, with a crazy little voice singing while jumping from platform to platform: bizarre idea on paper, definitely winning in-game, considering the result obtained. With all its aesthetic defects, the stages in Rayman Raving Rabbids entertain for a festive and fun musical accompaniment, intriguing the player in the simple playful passages proposed by the Ubisoft title. Rayman Touch'n'Go Most of the stages maintain a decidedly classic structure, with Rayman having to jump towards a switch or a floating platform, perhaps taking advantage of the special costumes that will be obtained by progressing in the adventure: through the power of fire it will be possible to burn obstacles and blow up walls , with the costume linked to the power of the earth it will be possible to generate boulders and use them as steps, and so on. Acquiring a new super power often also involves a certain amount of backtracking through the various levels, to reach a new stage or to discover various secrets. However, the most interesting play sequences are those that involve the use of the stylus and the touch-screen of the DS, which Ubisoft has wisely exploited, integrating them well with the rest of the game-design ~imported~ from home consoles. Unlike many producers who drown in a teacup in this kind of porting, the work done is commendable: the stages specially designed for this conversion are simple but fun. Excluding the mini-games in which you have to recompose puzzles, for example, from time to time we will be called upon to use the stylus to interact with the environment around Rayman, busy running independently towards a finish line, while we cut ropes to lower bridges , blow up enemies or obstacles, hold catwalks down or press timed switches and so on: the actions require only intuitive contact with the touch-screen, moving the stylus as required, and reflexes and timing are put to the test. They are certainly the funniest stages of the game, which are enriched from time to time with new obstacles combined with all the powers possessed by our animated Eggplant, becoming more and more complicated without ever being frustrating. Probably aimed at the little ones, Rayman Raving Rabbids proves to be an intriguing and simple platformer, enhanced by the stages that require the use of the touch-screen. Graphically much more could have been done especially in terms of texture and FPS, the visual sector is therefore balanced by an audio department that is pleasant especially for the hilarious parodies of some famous songs, which make the playful experience sparkling while maintaining that cartoonish and exuberant setting to which the adventures of the Ubisoft eggplant man had accustomed us. Certainly not an unforgettable platformer, but with some excellent ideas that we hope will be taken up by all those developers who don't know what to do when the touch-screen is involved. Pros Some music tracks are very nice Stages that use the touch-screen are fun Classic and nice platforming Cons Visually really could be improved Sound effects not up to par Too easy Over a decade ago, Rayman was a bolt from the blue forthe consoles on which it ran, devoid of two-dimensional platformers worthy of the name: not that it was a truly inspired or original game, but the then surprising use of multiple parallaxes, the well-kept cartoonish design and the captivating and modern aesthetic style (despite the of the protagonist, a sort of zucchini!) made him very famous for those who owned a Saturn, PlayStation or Jaguar. And in the end, he let himself play which was a pleasure, keeping that classic feeling combined with some new and interesting gameplay ideas. Rayman's flying punches often struck in the following years, in various incarnations for different consoles: from laptops to older sisters, Rayman also invaded the PC, even becoming a kind of party game. The fame of the funny creature made in Ubisoft faded over the years, and after the splendid Rayman 2 (on Dreamcast, in particular) the lack of inspiration and innovation made Rayman ~one of many~, without part of art. The new adventure, Rayman Raving Rabbids in fact, is proposed on home machines as a return to the glories of Rayman 2, but on DS there is a decidedly new challenge to face...", "date": "2007-04-06", "grade": null}
