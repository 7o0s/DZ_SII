Therefore, it is often enough to approach one of these, especially if well built, to re-enter the tunnel, as we see in this review of Unhappy Raccoon. On the other hand, on mobile the phenomenon has perhaps not yet reached the extreme diffusion that we are seeing on PC and consoles, therefore there is certainly room for new exponents on portable platforms, especially if they also have a rather extravagant and showy characterization. capable of attracting attention in a distinct way. The ~furry~, i.e. the graphic style that uses anthropomorphic animals with a rather stylish and modern look as the protagonists of stories, is perhaps one of the most polarizing types of characterization, but in this case everything is so accurate as to be perhaps pleasant even for the biggest detractors of furry characters. On the other hand it must be said that the narrative elements are not exactly predominant here, therefore the characterization serves more to build a particular aesthetic than to tell a complex story of interpersonal relationships between more or less attractive animals. The story is quite trite and not very thorough: in the universe in question, the god Raccoon allows adventurers to explore various planets, taking part in challenges that demonstrate their value in combat. However, something new, threatening and dark is infiltrating this sort of established order, which the protagonists will obviously have to face by exploring various planets and cleaning their surface from the henchmen of evil. There's not much more to say: it's about unlocking the 6 heroes that make up the basic roster (only the first, Kitana, can be used at the beginning) and traveling the universe with them aboard a spaceship to expand, modify and customize, by visiting different planets and completing their dungeons. Unhappy Raccoon is distributed as free-to-play and its rather grinding roguelike nature can push towards micro-transactions, even if for the moment the system seems rather fair and balanced. Roguelite action-RPG Unhappy Raccon: Kitana, the starting character The structure mixes action RPG elements with hack and slash mechanics to the typical roguelike trend, with the gameplay loop repeating itself until the conclusion of the individual dungeons. In the midst of the battle, also considering the type of shot adopted, Unhappy Raccoon is somewhat reminiscent of Diablo, but above all of Hades, just to give a recent example among the most illustrious ones. When the spaceship lands on a planet, the classic scheme starts: after choosing the initial bonus to use (linked to elemental magic to be applied to the character's standard weapons) we start discovering the dungeon, which is made up of a series of rooms connected to each other, all to be cleaned up by the enemies who are increasingly numerous and aggressive as they advance towards the finish line. Each character is characterized by specific traits and preferred weapons, which modify the fighting style by presenting the classic variations between ranged attacks, melee or intermediate solutions. The combat system follows that of the classic hack and slash, with the need to act quickly and dodge attacks as much as possible, pressing the keys corresponding to special attacks and active and passive skills with relative cooldowns. The controls on the touch screen, with sticks and virtual keys, are not very pleasant as usual but in this case, if nothing else, they respond well and manage to be as intuitive as possible, making the action rather readable, even if the dodges and precise maneuvers remain somewhat problematic in the most agitated situations. Unhappy Raccon: The Skill Tree The other pillar of the gameplay is the progression and management of the characters, a fundamental element to push you to repeat the same dungeon even several times in search of the conclusion, given that progress is still preserved from one attempt to another. There is a very large skill tree for each fighter, even if none of these manage to emerge for specific characterizations, making them all quite interchangeable with each other. The ~furry~ style characters are obviously the element which stands out more from an aesthetic point of view, with a particularly accurate and high-profile character design, which is also reflected in a 3D technical realization of remarkable workmanship, also considering the platforms on which the game runs. Unhappy Raccon: a screenshot The scenere of the procedural dungeons are obviously built in a simple way and with various repetitive elements, as befits this type of level design, but in general the representation of this strange world is very convincing. Between futuristic and totally fantastic elements and some features that instead refer more clearly to reality, Unhappy Raccoon is an interesting looking game, assuming you can deal with the characterization of the characters.", "date": "2022-10-14", "grade": "6.9"}
