{"name": "Tails of Iron", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tails-of-iron-recensione.html", "text": "Autumn is coming and there's no better way to welcome you into chestnut season than with a beautiful story of brave mice fighting amidst falling leaves, ancient crypts and pouring rain. After about ten hours consumed in just two days - such was the ludic ardor - we write these lines with the heart of someone who is asking you to let go of passing fads or trends for a moment and simply asks you to focus on one aspect gaming key: when single player works, there's none for anyone. We can open a thousand debates on playful tastes, priorities and lifestyles, but heck, when three boys from Manchester as a second work draw a two-dimensional action adventure with Metroidvania hues and a top-level combat system, immersed in a well-packaged setting and fascinating, then there is still a lot of hope for the gaming of passion. Well done, Odd-Bug Studio, applauds to you because in the story of the mouse prince Redgi you have included yes, many references to the past and present, of course, but the density and the believability of what you've hand-drawn in the double, triple, sometimes quadruple parallaxes gives so much structure to the game world that in an instant you feel part of it. It will be the care that emerges from every inch of the background or the violin that is added to the soundtrack when we approach the bard of the village, but the environment works, enveloping with its details and the desire to tell a small fantasy world turned upside down by a war between races of the ground. Follow us in the Tails of Iron review because this is a story of brutality, blood and revenge that deserves to be fully experienced. Revenge against the frogs In Tails of Iron, frogs will be Prince Redgi's chosen enemies. Frogs against mice, a leitmotif that does not shock given the recent explosion of games with protagonists with anthropomorphic features, but which in Tails of Iron captures from the very first moments. The moments in which Redgi, one of the sons of the mouse king, takes our first steps in the game world are able to tell that behind beautiful handmade backdrops there is a pulsating air of life at court, it is credible, realistic . The little guardian mouse waiting for us, the fixer, the street cleaner, the mercenary in the background who blows up a coin, the carpenter who moves to repair broken pieces: thanks to the care of the single element in the daily life of that specific universe, Tails of Iron has the advantage of making you breathe the setting in its progression. It's no secret that Redgi's quest is to take revenge on the evil frogs, who in one of their sorties burst into the palace and take everything, even the king's life: in this journey of reconstruction and liberation from enemy occupation, our mouse adventure in this country, in close contact with his subjects who will make us rebuild the kingdom piece by piece. Although seasoned with a fairly linear progress - and in this sense, little metroidvania - Redgi's path triggers artistic mechanisms that we greatly appreciated. First a mill, then a village, then the castle and so on: each piece of the quest brings with it a stylistic evolution in the setting, which gives an absolutely non-trivial sense of satisfaction and pleasantness, all accompanied by medieval music by excellent workmanship. We said, the linearity: yes, Tails of Iron is basically a linear game, in which history and gameplay are the masters, with just a pinch of backtracking in the end. It went well for us like this: although we would have expected a little more salt in the recipe, the advance of the tope fish allowed us to enjoy this journey without ever taking a breath, with our heads bowed towards our goals and it doesn't matter if the map not huge or playfully varied, Tails of Iron is a story and as such it doesn't make you ~waste~ time wandering around that much. You know what you have to do, the map tells you where, you do it and you go on regenerating the kingdom: after all, the structure is less complex than expected, but even this almost primordial essence becomes an excellent ingredient if combined with the true fulcrum of Tails of Iron, or its excellent combat system. Parries, dodges and a lot of counterattack Tails of Iron's combat system is fun and rewarding In Tails of Iron there is a very appreciable gameplay choice that we feel the duty to share: the mobs that reappear are very few. We mean the recurring enemies, the ones that appear at every step. It's a choice that makes sense, a very clever setting decision: if we spend hours ridding the lands of bad guys, why would they reappear? There are no loops, there are no bonfires: the game world evolves according to our progress and where beforebut there was destruction and fire, once the enemies had been removed, the people took everything back into their hands and repaired the buildings, returning to live there. If the ranger post was overrun, with the invader removed, the woodland dwellers were back to their duties, resulting in an almost relaxed environment to shoot in. From this point of view, the game takes quite a bit from Hollow Knight, both for the use of the benches and for having relegated most of the dangerous areas to the underground part. But in Tails of Iron progress is balanced with combat, the real flagship of the production. Thanks to a successful sequence of dodges, parries and counterattacks, fighting is fun and rewarding. Both in the verse dialogues and in the animations of the enemies, Tails of Iron uses simple visual terminology to indicate what will happen shortly thereafter: with red you dodge, with yellow you parry and counterattack, with the round comes an attack from 'high. Everything else is up to our reflexes, the double dodge, the range of the weapons and the heaviness of the equipment we will choose. As in souls, weight affects agility, while the weapons available are a mix of swords, one-handed and two-handed axes and spears, ranged weapons and their helmets, armor and shields with variable weight and characteristics in resistance to various types of enemies. Tails of Iron isn't a difficult game, but it shouldn't be underestimated: you'll have to get used to the combat system, otherwise you won't go on. There are some tougher fights, but nothing incredible and as soon as you enter the logic of the system, it will be satisfying to go around defeating enemies. We close with the only sore point: exploration. For heaven's sake, all beautiful and well told by Doug Cockle - Geralt's voice - which creates a lot of atmosphere, but Tails of Iron is not a big game. The areas not touched by the main quest are very few and quite quick to complete, as well as the extra quests, you will finish them in an hour at best. There's very little backtracking and the overall ambition is naturally relegated to a small, passionate but humble independent production. It's a great shame: having put everything in the right place, it would have been wonderful to get lost in the meanders of the kingdom, explore, discover and amplify the scope of the setting, instead there is very little extra and what is there is not even that satisfying in terms of the quality of the reward. It is clear that the game wants to give its best in the breakneck race that takes place from start to finish, enraptured by its undoubted qualities, but minimally expert players will eat this title in a maximum of ten hours, doing more or less everything and finding himself a little bitter in his mouth for all that could have been expressed and which instead, we hope, will find completion in a second episode.", "date": "2021-09-20", "grade": "8.2"}
