Nowadays various collections and remasterings are very fashionable, thanks to the passage of generations, but we must give the ~merit~ to the Osaka house for having been the first, in not at all suspicious times (we are talking about the three thousand editions of Street Fighter II , early 90s!) to undertake this policy, and to have carried it forward with an absolutely moving persistence and nonchalance. If then the emotion should be for Capcom who persists in milking not their own franchises, but precisely the individual games, even when it is clear that there is no more milk, or for the public who evidently continues to indulge in practices of this type, will be the subject of another article. Like many other Big C series, following the commercial history of the various episodes of Ace Attorney is a difficult task, between the original Game Boy Advance episodes, the Nintendo DS remakes, the localizations of the latter and the conversions for other formats, portable and not. Not to mention sequels, spin-offs and crossovers, which are not of interest here, just know that all this has led to the present Trilogy, that is the collection of the first three historic titles, for many fans, not without reason, still unsurpassed. The first three great Ace Attorneys in one convenient package, but there's room for some objections. The trial of the century Given the proliferation of conversions mentioned above, there is a good possibility that a large number of gamers have had to deal with at least one of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice For All and Trials And Tribulations, the three titles included in this collection. Knowing even one of them is equivalent, from the point of view of the play structure, to knowing them all. We are basically dealing with visual novels, an all-Japanese genre but which lawyer Wright himself has helped to clear customs here in Italy, that is to say an extremely linear game, whose main objective is to tell a very complex story, through screenshots semi-animated and tons of text. However, due to the particular judicial setting, Ace Attorney has always accompanied its visual novel soul with an investigative section reminiscent of the old graphic adventures, with lots of pixel hunting in search of every single useful clue, and the need, to move forward, of the use of logic in the procedural phases. Procedural phases and investigative sections are precisely the two ~sections~ into which the game action is divided, and if the latter, as we said, see us move from setting to setting, hunting for clues and evidence as well as any witnesses with which to enter into long dialogues, the first ones take place entirely in courtrooms where the classic presumption of innocence does not apply, but its exact opposite. The accused appears before the judge practically already convicted and it is up to Wright to exonerate him, cross-examining the various witnesses produced by the prosecution, pressing them on every weak point of their statements and showing at the right moment the evidence that unmasks their lies and contradictions. Finally, some particularities are inserted into this structure: in the last segment of the first episode there is the possibility of manipulating some three-dimensional objects to discover new evidence, a section that was inserted at the time of the conversion on DS to exploit the polygonal capabilities and the touch Nintendo laptop screen; in the other two games, however, the Psyche-Lock makes its appearance, a sort of mini-game always linked to tests and interrogations, and which is the first of the various ~gameplay digressions~ that will then appear in the following episodes. So far, as befits any self-respecting investigation, the cold and objective analysis of the play structure, which by its nature is certainly not attractive to the most mass audience possible, as demonstrated by the fact that the genre to which it belongs has never broke through outside Japan until a few years ago. But what, then, made of the various Ace Attorneys some of the most beautiful visual novels of all time, capable of captivating and involving even an audience until then very little accustomed to putting up with cascades of text and logical reasoning among the finest? Twists The answer is simple: settings, plots and characters are often absolutely out of parameters. In a nutshell, the writing, here the exclusive work of the creator of the Shu Takumi series (returned to great power only recently with the crossover between Phoenix Wright and Professor Layton) rarely abandons levels of excellence. You could go and re-read our original reviews of the three titles and then come back here, to discover that even after many years the narrative part remainsexceptional: the characters so exaggeratedly Japanese in their characterization, yet, at least some of them, of a disconcerting depth; the various plots, intricate and compelling in themselves, but even more when you begin to understand the links and connections between the various cases of a title and then again (and this collection makes this even clearer) between the various episodes of the series ; the moments of absolute exaltation, underlined by pressing music, in which a lying witness is unmasked, the cards are completely turned on the table and suddenly the judge and the public are all with us while the prosecutor, bold and contemptuous up until the moment before, it produces priceless expressions of defeat; the generally very comic tenor but which does not spare very effective moments of tension, impending threat, drama, even some digressions into the supernatural. And to the almost always impeccable writing are added, as you may have guessed, graphics and sound that are decidedly well done but never invasive, aimed as they are at reinforcing and never disturbing the various sensations and moods that alternate in the player along the of the plot. Thanks to the not exactly very dynamic genre and by virtue of what has been said so far, we can affirm without fear of denials that, even if the subsequent episodes, especially Dual Destinies for Nintendo 3DS, have introduced various innovations, the original trilogy has aged in an excellent way, as a good wine, and revisiting the various cases was an extreme pleasure even for the writer, who already knew them quite well. If the review were to end here, we could do nothing but a couple of trivial but true and sincere observations: the desirability of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, unless you hate the genre, is maximum for those who have never tried anyone of these three episodes, while remaining high, due to the price, if you have to recover two or even just one, as well as it is maximum for those who only met Wright and his clique later and want to go and find out where it all started from . Before leaving, however, in the most classic legal thriller tradition there are at least three questions to be answered, and perhaps we will see that things are not always exactly as they seem at the beginning. The 3D effect It limits itself, in some screens, to clearly detach the portraits of the characters and the elements of the interface from the backdrops. Nothing exceptional therefore, it does not affect the gameplay in anything, but it is still a very small thing more. Don't call me ~Dick~! The first aspect to examine concerns the added value of the collection compared to the individual games: is there something that is able to entice you to buy even those who know the original trilogy perfectly? Content-wise, absolutely not. The titles have remained perfectly identical to themselves, in their many merits and also in their defects, such as the not always stringent logic when it comes to understanding which evidence to present and in response to which witness statement. Improvements can only be seen on the aesthetic front: the screens, always starting from the original assets, have been redesigned to adapt them to the Nintendo 3DS screen (complete with a stereoscopic 3D effect that we analyze in the usual box), with results that are sometimes difficult to evaluate unless you are also facing the Nintendo DS and/or Game Boy Advance versions, but certainly better than those of the iOS version, in which the transition to high resolution has not always gone very well. Even the music has been rearranged and remixed, sometimes in a very light way, others in a remarkable way, as in the case of the beautiful track that can be listened to in the main menu. That's all: no bonuses, which would have been very welcome by fans as well as novices, no artwork, curiosities, unpublished material, in short, nothing that would make the purchase justifiable even for veterans. Ultimately a fairly lazy conversion work, which was limited almost entirely to packing the three episodes, where the adjustments made are so subtle that they will hardly be noticed. Secondly, there is the distribution model to discuss. As well as Dual Destinies, this Trilogy is also released (all over the world, moreover, while the other at least in Japan is physically available) exclusively in digital format on Nintendo eShop. We understand the doubts of collectors and those who generally don't trust digital delivery, but we don't feel like saying that this is, in itself, a defect: the distribution models of our favorite pastime have now radically changed, and if a home thinks he can cut production and distribution costs in this areaThis way, welcome, we will have a greater and more varied offer and we will see the release of titles that otherwise would never have been available. However, the perspective changes slightly when the price element is added to the whole discussion: 30 Euros for three games, with a commitment that easily ranges between 40 and 60 hours, is certainly a reasonable and convenient outlay, a little less when however on iOS systems there is the exact same collection, different only in some visual/sound details, at a price that is exactly half. For those who have a compatible device, you will understand that the attractiveness of the Nintendo 3DS version is no longer so high, and perhaps others can wait for one of the many discounts that Capcom regularly organizes on the eShop. Finally, the localization problem. All three episodes are entirely in English and, if desired, a welcome addition albeit only for a small segment of the audience, in Japanese. It's not a quality problem: the English localization, despite the problems and contradictions deriving from having wanted to transport to the USA events that are clearly set in Japan, is decidedly splendid, vibrant, full of puns, jokes even quite strong, cultural and pop references. But you need to have at least a basic grasp of the language to get going, let alone to catch all these jokes and references, and that automatically cuts off a huge chunk of the audience. We will not make the argument here, even if it is fair, that English is always good to know, or we will say, as elderly players, that ~in our time~ Italian in a video game was a real chimera, and how many of us have learned the language of Albion just to play this or that RPG: the fact is that today almost all of the play offer provides for localization for our country, and if Ace Attorney Trilogy doesn't have it, it means that it has something less than the competition and which loses attractiveness for a range of users. All this made even more disappointing by the fact that the Italian translations, not as splendid as the English ones but still excellent, exist, are very official and can be found in all the cards of the first three Nintendo DS games! Cost containment, okay, decline in sales of the series here, okay, but this simple observation makes Capcom's choice almost completely inexplicable and masochistic.", "date": "2014-12-18", "grade": "7.0"}
