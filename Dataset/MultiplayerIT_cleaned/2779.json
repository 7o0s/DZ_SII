The experience of recent years has obviously shown us the opposite, showing us empirically how only a few products, mostly specially designed around this technology, meet success and appreciation from critics and the public. To explain better, let's take an extreme case, namely The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR. No one questions the underlying quality of the production nor the undeniable benefits, in terms of sense of immersion, from playing Bethesda's masterpiece in the very first person. Yet, how many have really enjoyed the whole main story, from start to finish, with the viewer on? Specially embroidered adventures are needed, which do not weigh down the experience too much, which know how to propose the most suitable pace and also the right emotional and aesthetic load, always well calibrated to the specifics of virtual reality. This introduction is by no means accidental. Because speaking of city builders, a question arises: does it really make sense to juggle between visors and controllers of various shapes, when the mouse, keyboard, classic PC screen work so well? We approached Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition with this doubt well carved in the head and in this review, among many others, we will try to clarify this point too. Classic in substance Graphics are certainly not the strong point of Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition, somewhat as the title suggests, is the revised and corrected version of the same game already appreciated about a year ago on Meta Quest 2. As anticipated, it is a rather classic city builder, in whose main objective is to guarantee the happiness and well-being of the inhabitants who will gradually populate the metropolis that you are going to build starting from the maps, nine in all, made available. Simple to explain, complex to make, as the tradition of games of this genre dictates. Initially empty, you will have to fill the scenario with buildings, factories, structures necessary for the proper functioning of a city. You will have to worry about the sewage network, electricity, to ensure that areas with a high risk of fire or crime are not created. Obviously, it's not just a question of providing what is needed so that everything is simply sustainable. It is essential to have an eye on the needs and requirements of citizens. A residential district must be distant from the industrial pole. Without places of recreation, it is difficult for the happiness of the inhabitants to take off. Fostering education, allowing easy access to government structures and making sure that the public transport service is efficient are all but secondary. The HUD of Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition is relatively clear, some menus are in fact difficult to read The variables are many, especially considering the budget. It is true that by selecting the relevant mode you can enjoy the pure and simple pleasure of building without limits, but by playing without shortcuts you will also have to consider taxes, income and expenses. In short, you will constantly have to consider multiple factors and it is no coincidence that menus abound. From this point of view, Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition has nothing to envy to other similar games, since it will be able to commit you and not a little, especially when the metropolis reaches a certain size and the problems to which to pay special attention are multiply exponentially. Whatever your preference, that is whether to prefer the economic or the social sphere, just to give two examples, even after the game has already started for some time, it is not uncommon to have to reconsider one's choices and be forced to spend time and resources on a heavy redevelopment of entire neighborhoods. Difficult to succeed immediately on the first try. With Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition you will have to make a few attempts before giving life to a truly functional city The possibilities, in this sense, are really many, a sign of a deep gameplay, the result of well-linked mechanics and a long series of buildable structures. Also for this reason it is impossible not to blame the developers for not having inserted a campaign that would infuse a minimum of progression to the whole. There is a short tutorial, useful for learning and understanding the fundamentals of the game, but the rest is at the complete discretion of the gamer who will have to independently find objectives and motivations to move forward. The good and the bad of virtual reality A quiet residential neighborhood, equipped with every comfort, created to perfectionArt in Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition On closer inspection, this is the first factor to consider regarding Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition. If it is undeniable that the gameplay works wonderfully, applied to a context without tangible stimuli it can lose effectiveness. Of course, true connoisseurs of the genre are used to software that does not rely on any campaign, but the console public, less accustomed to experiences of this type, could suffer what actually remains a gap that can discourage anyone who needs objectives and goals to continue in the game. This is undoubtedly a first alarm bell that reveals not so much the inadequacy of the Fast Travel Games AB proposal, but the lack of focus on the destination platform. Even more so if it's not the only emergency light that is activated. Yes, because virtual reality, in this context, offers a lot, but takes away at the same time. On the one hand, the view from which the city and scenery is filmed is certainly suggestive, as well as enveloping. Thanks to the specifications of PlayStation VR 2, the definition and cleanliness of the image guaranteed by the OLED screen, playing with the zoom level and the angle of view, you can literally see everything. By moving the point of view away, and taking advantage of the Sense reactives, neighborhoods are created, power lines are erected and roads are built rather intuitively. Much better than on a flat screen, sometimes you just need to turn your eyes to see even more clearly the impact of your work on the rest of the city. The nine maps in Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition are distinguished by conformity and breadth, each with precise geographical asperties to consider Furthermore, by activating the zoom to the maximum, it is not uncommon to find oneself as simple spectators of the daily grind of the metropolis. In the guise of simple virtual tourists, if not mayors who enjoy themselves at the sight of their creature, Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition is also able to give these moments of pure and simple contemplation. For some, this feature will have no value, of course, but others will certainly be pleased to know that from this point of view, virtual reality can give an edge to the management genre. Graphically, however, it should be emphasized, you will not find yourself in front of a breathtaking show. The polygonal complexity of each on-screen element is relatively crude and there is no shortage of pop-ups. Nonetheless, when the screen fills up with buildings and moving elements, the global rendering doesn't look too bad. On the other hand, however, it is equally undeniable that technology doesn't match the genre at its best. The management of the menus, for example, is not entirely optimal. The adaptation to the Sense buttons is certainly successful, but it is still difficult to move from one screen to another. The construction itself isn't as precise as it is on PCs with a mouse and keyboard. Sometimes you make a mistake, you have to start over, you have to cancel a given command. From Cities: VR - Enhanced Edition we would certainly have expected greater care in terms of image definition, which remains just enough and little more In short, the experience is more cumbersome and tiring than elsewhere. Even considering that in the long run the viewer weighs on the neck and therefore it is impossible to indulge in a prolonged marathon as happens when you are comfortably in front of a screen.", "date": "2023-04-01", "grade": "7.0"}
