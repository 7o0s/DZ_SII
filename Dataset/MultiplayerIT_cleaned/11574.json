{"name": "Poker Smash - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/poker-smash-recensione.html", "text": "Diamond smash The Void Star Creations production mixes the basic rules of poker with the mechanics of many puzzle games of the past (and probably of the future); rows of cards appear constantly from the bottom of the screen, at an increasingly rapid pace as the game progresses. The aim is basically to eliminate the cards with precisely poker combinations; from simple sets, to straights, flushes and so on. In reality, the programmers have well thought of simplifying things a bit, including only the 10, J, Q, K and A; a fundamental choice to maintain adequate accessibility to the title even for those who know very little about the rules of poker, even if in any case it is possible to fill any gap with an apt practical method. The cards can be moved horizontally, by modifying their position on the lines or by making them fall into any free spaces downwards; in this sense, the intuition of making use of both analog sticks is very convincing, the left one to move the cursor and the right one to interact with the cards, a factor that makes the action decidedly fluid. The substance is therefore similar to that of dozens of other puzzle games: create combinations to remove ~objects~ from the screen before they reach the top of the screen, under penalty of game over. The variations on the theme are to be found, in addition to the ~twist~ of poker, also in the presence of additional elements in the gameplay, apparently marginal but which in reality become fundamental in case you want to aim for prestigious results. First of all, the ability to increase or slow down the scrolling speed of the cards, respectively to create sensational combos or to think for a few moments organizing one's moves. Or again, bombs can be used to detonate a single card and thus eliminate it from the game board; from time to time there are also ~challenges~, or specific requests for the creation of certain ~hands~ which, if completed, allow you to add a few extra points to your overall loot. In the end, therefore, the mechanics studied by the programmers work incredibly well; absolutely not revolutionary, as is clear, but robust, engaging and above all particularly stimulating. Therefore, Poker Smash does not lack the ~quid~, the spark capable of making a puzzle game the companion of endless gaming sessions; and in the same way it is not without a good level graphic component, anything but minimalist, colorful and detailed, full of special effects and with many skins, or tables that form the background to the action. Also noteworthy is an online mode for up to 4 players, pleasant even if not particularly thorough. Goals The 200 target points available in Poker Smash are all obtainable by meeting certain requirements during matches, such as racking up a certain amount of points, playing all possible hands in a single game or building combos of up to 24x. Comment Poker Smash is a puzzle game capable of emerging from the mass of XBLA's offer, which is not a small advantage. It probably won't be remembered in the annals next to the masterpieces of the genre, but at the same time it is equally true that the effort of Void Star Creations is a product endowed with personality, fun, engaging and which with great merit ranks among the best titles available in the Microsoft's online service offering.
