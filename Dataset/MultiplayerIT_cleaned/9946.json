Thanks to the 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, which ran at 7.61 MHz, and its 64 KB of RAM, the technical difference compared to the now outdated NES appeared enormous, and played a key role in advertising campaigns aimed precisely at underline the proximity between what is offered by the Genesis (American name of the Mega Drive) and the arcade cabinets. Strengthened by an extraordinary commercial success (we are talking about almost thirty million pieces sold worldwide), the SEGA gaming system was also quite long-lived and this factor favored the progressive improvement of the quality of the titles: put Gain Ground on one side ( 1988) and on the other Streets of Rage II (1993), for example, and you'll feel like you're watching two games belonging to different generations, while running on the same hardware. With the SEGA Genesis Classics Pack, a first selection of classics developed by SEGA for Mega Drive arrives on Steam, and given the caliber of some titles, this is an excellent opportunity to indulge in retrogaming. At the moment there are eleven games available and it is possible to buy them separately for 2.49 euros each (with the only exception of Sonic 3D Blast, sold inexplicably for 4.49 euros) or all together for 29.39 euros, so unfortunately without any discount for those who take the complete package. Our advice is to buy the titles that interest you the most individually, following your heart and nostalgic nature but also paying attention to quality, given the presence of some titles that are decidedly less ~classic~ than others. Beasts and comics For a game developed in 1988, Altered Beast is miraculous. We are not referring to purely technical aspects, but to the particular mix of absurd ideas and historical settings that have absolutely nothing to do with each other, which in the end, however, contribute to the creation of a product that not only lets you play, but remains also in the head with its images, its rambling sounds (see the improbable sound effect that accompanies the protagonist's punches and kicks) and its jingles (which invariably stop when a vocal sample is played). The anonymous centurion we wear is resurrected by Zeus to save his daughter Athena from the clutches of a demon; and so he launches himself against an army of monsters and creatures of all kinds, which he fights thanks to the powers conferred on him by the father of the gods, or the ability to change shape until he transforms into a powerful hybrid between man and beast. Depending on the stage, the final form of the transformation varies (wolf, dragon, tiger, bear and then wolf again, this time golden) but not the two intermediate phases, which see the centurion's muscles swell out of proportion. For its value, the immediate gameplay and the inevitable reminiscences, Altered Beast must certainly be recovered and completed once again. Just as the excellent Comix Zone must be recovered, without thinking twice: it is a much more recent title (1995) which sees the beefy comic book artist Sketch Turner fall victim to his own characters and end up imprisoned between the pages by himself create. With the help of a friend who can communicate with him from the real world, Sketch goes from panel to panel (literally!) looking for a way to get home and defeat the ~super villain~ who put him in danger. this absurd situation. The gameplay of the game skilfully mixes action, platform and above all fighting game elements, with clashes that involve the use of a certain strategy between parries, combos and special moves. The design of the characters is excellent, the animations too and the sensation of impact would still have a lot to say today, with some enemies being hit so hard that they tear the ~strips~ of paper that separate one panel from the other. Released at a time when Mega Drive owners were already thinking about switching to a 32-bit console, Comix Zone really looks like a fun product, well done and also quite challenging. Bombs, dolphins, spears and swords Crack Down, dated 1990, is certainly one of the least convincing titles in this collection. The game is very straightforward and fairly fun, but is characterized by extremely poor graphics, rather limited gameplay and the presence of a few stages. Much, much better than the famous Ecco the Dolphin, an original and inspired adventure that sees us control a dolphin engaged in the liberation of his companions through a series of levelsbased on inertia and finding objects. At the time of its release, Ecco struck all Mega Drive owners for its colors and its quality, but also because of a level of difficulty that was not within everyone's reach. Dusting it off after so many years could therefore prove to be a controversial experience, therefore we recommend purchasing it with reservations. On the other hand, it is difficult to recommend the purchase of Gain Ground, a 1988 title that already at the time of its launch probably seemed old, with a reduced playing area compared to the screen (almost like Crack Down, in which you played in windowed mode.. .) and inferior graphics to many 8-bit console releases. On closer inspection, this particular cross between shooter, action and strategy has its own why, with fifty increasingly challenging stages and a large number of different characters to control, but the presentation is so poor as to dampen any enthusiasm in advance. It happens. The legendary Golden Ax deserves a completely different speech, which in its Mega Drive version certainly does not appear identical to the coin-op (there are a lot of animation frames missing, the spells have been depleted and the stages appear less detailed) but shares its amazing hack'n'slash gameplay, solid and fun. The three selectable characters (warrior, Amazon and dwarf) are not very different from each other, but the challenge is certainly engaging thanks to the multiplayer mode for two players and the addition of some extra stages as well as the ~duel~ mode. Unmissable. Ninjas, hedgehogs, flying dudes and balls There are two titles in the Shinobi series available in the collection, and they are extremely different products despite sharing the same character (actually not, as the protagonist of Shadow Dancer in the Japanese version is not Joe Musashi but his nephew Hayate). The first, Shadow Dancer, is the Mega Drive conversion of the coin-op of the same name produced by SEGA in 1989. You will certainly remember the ninja dressed in white and above all his dog Yamato, which could be thrown at enemies to make them vulnerable before an attack. Well, the home version differs a lot from the arcade game, with completely redesigned stages and a different mechanic, which only maintains the distinctly hardcore character of the original: one successful hit and you're as good as dead, so we start again from the beginning of the level. Nostalgics might give us a little thought, but in reality Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master, released in 1993 and featuring decidedly more evolved graphics and gameplay, appears much more deserving: the dog is missing, but the energy bar does it allows you to make some mistakes without paying the most extreme consequences and there is a good variety of enemies. So let's move on to Sonic 3D Blast, the most expensive title in the collection as well as the most recent (1996). Developed by Traveller's Tales under the aegis of SEGA, the game was supposed to represent Sonic's passage to three dimensions (moreover, it came out in conjunction with a version for Saturn) but it cannot be said that it performs the task in the best way: managing jumps in a 3D context it appears really difficult and the speed of the character ends up being a problem instead of a resource when you need to approach enemies with caution. A classic Sonic episode would have been preferable, and not a little: this interpretation with an isometric view leaves the time it finds and you can definitely do without it. Space Harrier II and the original Vectorman close the review: the first is the sequel to the famous SEGA arcade, dated 1989, and feels the weight of the years in a particular way, with unwatchable graphics full of ~blinking sprites~; the second is a 1995 action game characterized by excellent pre-rendered 3D graphics, with really fluid and convincing animations (thanks to the appearance of the characters, mainly composed of spheres), whose background story disarmingly resembles the one that Pixar he used for the outstanding WALL-E. It is certainly not a classic, but it is in any case a fun and well-made title to try.", "date": "2010-06-28", "grade": "7.5"}
