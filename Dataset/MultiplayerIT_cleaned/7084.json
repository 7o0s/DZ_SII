Indeed, even earlier, since that's where it dominates on the cover. This is Ronan O'Connor, the protagonist. A hothead who grew up with a natural talent for making trouble, getting beaten, stabbed and convicted, whose most successful joke is that he ended up working for the police, as a detective. A guy we've already gotten to know in recent months, during the first hands-on of the game, and who proves to be one with whom it's easy to identify with, whose events to take to heart, even if he's not the first and almost he certainly won't be the last of the characters of this mold proposed by the world of video games, nor even the most charismatic and original among them, or one feels the need for someone a little more brilliant to write the lines of dialogue for him. Square Enix's investigative action adventure opens knowing how to create a strong sense of empathy for this braggart with a ready joke, a cigarette perpetually in his mouth and bad luck always on his heels and closes making sure that, despite everything, the last and most heartfelt thought is addressed to him. Despite it all. Here is our review of Murdered: Soul Suspect. Is there life after some good ideas? Try again (try again, try again) and check As if a difficult life weren't enough, Ronan knows how to be abused even by death. The event that kicks off Murdered: Soul Suspect, in fact, is his death at the hands of the Killer of the Bells, a serial killer who is terrorizing Salem, of which he was on the trail. In the end, the passing could represent for O'Connor the coveted opportunity to embrace his wife Julia, who died in dramatic circumstances three years earlier. But no. The daring reasons for the protagonist's death keep him trapped in a limbo between the world of the living and that of the dead and the only way to finally let go, run towards the warm embrace of his beloved, is to settle the outstanding scores. In other words: Ronan earns the right to compete in the revenge match against the deranged man he hunted alive, with the help of the director of some advantages deriving from his new condition. The aim of the game is to investigate the Bell Killer, following in his footsteps track by track, crime scene by crime scene. In addition to resorting to the inspection of the scene of the crime, as he once did, Ronan can take possession of any witnesses and former colleagues, to hear their thoughts, sometimes influence them, or scrutinize what they see, in order to gather details that cannot be identified otherwise . Possession can also concern some object scattered here and there, with which to establish a ~mediated~ interaction with the other dimension, or a cat, to reach normally inaccessible places. His spirit status also allows him to see traces invisible to the living, relating to past events. Meanwhile, the number of clues necessary to try to formulate a hypothesis and find out what happened is clearly indicated on the screen, proceeding in the adventure. It is not necessary to find them all, given that once a minimum threshold has been reached, the game itself will start asking the user if he intends to try. In any case, making a mistake does not lead to any concrete consequences: you can try again as many times as you want, at the most you are penalized in the evaluation, calculated in badges. Once the novelty effect of the early stages or the attraction of the most interesting cases has vanished, Murdered: Soul Suspect takes off the mask: more than an investigation game it looks like a game on investigation, i.e. in which the main topic fails to inhale much of the gameplay, stopping at a superficial smattering. In many cases, in fact, one could limit oneself to probing the interactable elements of the scenario on the carpet and, once enough clues have been accumulated, trying indefinitely until the only foreseen solution is right. There are no real puzzles, tests of logic or lateral thinking, nor at least the possibility of meticulously inspecting objects, combining them with others or manipulating them in some way, as in different titles on the same theme or with an adventure cut, however some types of ~unconventional~ interaction, along the lines of David Cage's productions, which would have at least added a little ~experimental~ charm, are only tentatively hinted at here and there, mostly at the beginning. Although always firmly harnessed in the parachute of infallibility, the most stimulating ideas devised by Airtight Games turn out to be certain tests in which an element must be interpreted by choosing among several alternatives, an expedient that actively calls into question a little intuition,offering an appreciable investigative aftertaste. Focus on PC conversion Murdered: Soul Suspect welcomes with a ~Press Start~ even when no joypad is connected to the system which portends an epic fail in the line of certain pedestrian conversions with which, alas, the market never ceases to amaze. Which would have gone in contrast with what we had ascertained a few months ago, in the preview phase, when we had taken a peek at the menus, finding a rather complete series of options dedicated to the Windows format. Fortunately, the Airtight Games guys didn't back down and the game features a large collection of settings designed for this platform, which also include different types of anti-aliasing (various FXAA, MSAA and EQAA qualities) and ambient occlusion ( SSAO and two settings for the HDAO), in order to scale on as many configurations as possible or to allow you to find your optimum between performance and image quality. How much these features are able to offer an appreciable plus compared to the console counterparts we will ascertain in a video comparison coming soon to these pages, in the meantime we can record that the game is stable and with performances congruous to what the classic Unreal Engine 3.0 so as it has been reworked for the occasion, it puts on video, without unpleasant bottlenecks (to give the numbers: on the 1080p test configuration, with everything maxed out and 4xMSAA runs at an indicative average of 90 FPS). All right, then? Not completely. In fact, the V-Sync has an anomalous behavior, similar to that of the first Dead Space, inexplicably capping the framerate at 30 FPS, while equally inexplicably it is not possible to reconfigure the controls, if the mouse and keyboard are chosen as input devices. A couple of flaws that we hope will be confined to the build review on the basis of which we wrote the article or that will be resolved with a patch that accompanies the release of the game, in a few days. Salem, bloody Salem The town of Salem intervenes as a trait d'union to the locations where the crime scenes related to the main plot are distributed. Some of its areas such as streets, parking lots, courtyards and beaches constitute a large hub that can be freely explored, where you can get even more in touch with the alienating reality in which Ronan finds himself condemned. Here it is in fact possible to better understand the blunders in both architectural and chronological perception that characterize the limbo in which the game is set and above all to stop and get to know the other souls who have remained imprisoned within it, learning to realize with more knowledge, through the their personalities or their vicissitudes, what it means to be dead. Some of these can also be helped, with small optional quests through which to reconstruct the causes of their death or dissolve other types of knots that keep them entangled there, unable to pass completely. Other reasons to entertain yourself for a walk are represented by the numerous collectibles scattered around. Between ~files~ dedicated to the Killer of the Bells, the memories of Ronan and his wife Julia, historical facts of the town and much more, one is almost bombarded with stuff to collect. The vast majority of them are arranged in an extremely elementary way, while those that require a little effort in terms of environmental study or in the use of the protagonist's powers, including the teleportation available from about halfway through the adventure, are certainly more welcome. Without claiming the variety and refinement of a pure sandbox or an RPG and thus turning a blind eye to sentences out of context and a few too many twins or mechanical behavior among the non-player characters, overall this aspect of the game proves to be successful. In fact, it allows you to step into O'Connor's shoes a little more, to deepen your knowledge of Salem and above all to feel free to shape the pace of the adventure, mediating the rigid scansion of the main cases. The action phases inserted here and there are also appreciated, where it is necessary to deal with the Demons, frightening entities ready to swallow the soul of others, to be faced with a mediated approach, of a stealth matrix. Although in the long run tricks are discovered to win it rather easily, these are situations that can always offer some good discharge of tension mixed with adrenaline, moving things a bit. Just for once Permeated by an atmosphere that arises from the effective encounter between thriller, noir, detective story, horror and grotesque, the story of Murdered: Soul Suspect plays its intriguing starting points with mixed fortunes, unfolding equally between situationswell-drawn ions and clichs sighted from two kilometers away. In addition to the opening in the running to new themes, including just to name one already known, without anticipating too much, there is psychiatry, and some accelerated violence that hits hard without giving in to splatter temptations, substantially absent throughout the game, like a couple of twists, one of which is particularly effective, although already seen, especially in other media. The impression, in any case, is that even here more could have been done, starting from the characters who animate the story, given that apart from Joy, the young medium who supports O'Connor, who makes herself at least participating with him in classic but successful interludes of ~strange couple~, there is no one who can match Ronan, starting with the killer, who along the way does not turn out to be a figure of who knows what charisma. Some other food for thought about the opportunity to make the new Square Enix production your own comes from its duration. We finished the game with the Steam counter indicating nine hours, committing ourselves for about three quarters of the adventure to exploring thoroughly, trying to find as many elements of investigation, secrets and side quests as possible (arriving, for the record, at a amount of 170 Clues out of 192 and 135 Secondary Cases out of 173), which leads us to think that the net duration is approximately five or six hours. Added to this is a substantially zero replayability factor. Once concluded, Murdered: Soul Suspect offers no incentive whatsoever to be returned. As has already emerged in recent months, the story does not in fact provide for crossroads, alternative endings or the possibility of influencing the scansion or the nature of the main events in any way. Not even a New Game Plus is contemplated, thanks to which the most hardened completionists can increase their chances of catching all the collectibles, even if they are well aware of having to put up with an identical ludic-narrative development: the only possibility is to start a new game, equal to the first, with all elements zero. And there's no sign of any extras, like a movie gallery or artwork, on the menu either. Nothing. Thinking about it, after all, Ronan didn't go so badly: at least he found something after the end.", "date": "2014-06-03", "grade": "7.0"}
