We therefore find the various Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and companions in a ~rough~ but convincing version, with armor bearing signs of many fights and transformations depicting unknown vehicles. The Wii version of this interesting tie-in distances itself from the others, offering us the typical action of rail shooters. What about the DS version? Surprisingly, it doesn't shy away from the comparison with what was seen on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, presenting itself as a third-person action game full of depth and based on the concept of ~tag team~, with the player having to choose two characters from those available and switch from one to the other in times of need. The change is not made for pure fun, but it is necessary to take advantage of the double energy bar as well as the specific characteristics of each robot. Dualbots In its portable reduction for Nintendo DS, Transformers: The Battle for Cybertron is available in the usual two editions, Autobot and Decepticon, which are distinguished precisely by the story mode which involves the valiant Optimus and his faithful companions on one side, on the other the evil Megatron and his band of henchmen. For this review we tested the Decepticon version, which in the end offers almost the same stages as the ~good~ counterpart, albeit with different protagonists. The number of usable characters rises according to the level reached, according to an upgrade system that is based on experience points and is very reminiscent of that of RPGs. The first missions turn out to be simple and accessible, but from a certain point onwards the pitfalls multiply and the passage from one robot to another (you have to select two at the start) becomes mandatory. The differences between the various Megatron, Starscream, Brawl, Skywarp, etc. they are not limited to the appearance, but materialize in the close combat style and in the type of energy used for the weapons, which depending on the sensitivity of the target can cause more or less damage. Furthermore, the presence of characters who transform into spaceships adds a new element to the exploration of certain scenarios, thus revealing their secrets more easily. In this regard, the collection of data-disks allows us to select a bonus capable of increasing the physical strength, speed, resistance or precision of our Transformer. Decepticons, transform! The game control system allows us to move our character using the d-pad, while the buttons are used to shoot, melee attack, jump, switch robots and lock-on targets. The touch screen is used only for vehicle transformation, accompanied by a different layout for the controls that changes whether it is a land vehicle or an aircraft. The possibility of transforming adds a pinch of variety to the gameplay, especially during certain sections, but don't expect the dynamism of the unforgettable Transformers for PlayStation 2: the approach of the Vicarious Vision title is decidedly more static and reflective, also considering the amount of enemies that we will have to face and that will put a strain on the regenerative capacity of our robots. In this sense, the switch from one character to another allows us to have the ~reserve~ recover their energies, even if very often the situation forces us to stop and get back on our feet before proceeding to the next room. In terms of managing the difficulty, The Battle for Cybertron in its Nintendo DS version is anything but ~casual~, indeed in some situations it is decidedly ~hardcore~ and offers us a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the presence of far from numerous checkpoints tries to keep the game in balance between excessive simplicity and an abyss made of deep frustration, giving the game a good longevity also thanks to the ~arena~ mode and multiplayer (unfortunately only locally). Technically an excellent job has been done: the polygonal models do not boast who knows what level of detail, it is true, but they have a good set of animations and they move within scenarios perhaps afflicted by not always happy chromatic choices, but without other well designed and organized.", "date": "2010-07-23", "grade": "7.4"}
