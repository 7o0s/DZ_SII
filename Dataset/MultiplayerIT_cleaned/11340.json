{"name": "L'incredibile Hulk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lincredibile-hulk.html", "text": "Indeed, to tell the truth something out of the ordinary The Incredible Hulk has it: the duration. With just 30 minutes of play needed to complete the adventure, the Hands-On product can seriously aspire to the shortest mobile game title in history. There are only three internships available, set in as many scenarios, namely Brazil, a campus and New York: broadly following the plot of the film, The Incredible Hulk puts the user in the role of the green beast, fleeing from the evil Emil Blonsky and his henchmen. On a playful level, this translates into an action game with a really reduced thickness, as it is easy to understand from the following lines. The control system is very simple, with the directional cross used to move our beefy protagonist and two keys useful respectively for throwing punches and lifting objects to then be able to throw them. All of this wouldn't be a bad thing at all, if only the gameplay wasn't a real sieve: hitting individual soldiers, for example, is an almost impossible undertaking, given the Hulk's inability to launch attacks on the run and the speed with which enemies run away from the muscular green mountain. There is nothing left to do but eliminate the human opponents by picking them up one by one and forcefully throwing them to the ground, an operation that soon turns out to be terribly annoying. The situation improves slightly when you come across ~heavier~ enemies such as tanks (in this case you can use some objects present in the scenarios as projectiles), to fall back into the most absolute sadness during clashes with Abomination, the boss that appears three times during the adventure. On all these occasions, the procedure is the same: just punch the concrete pillars that are thrown at the Hulk back to the sender and repeat until the bad guy is knocked out. In short, it certainly cannot be said that the developers have made an effort to do so. Just as there was no mention of making the settings destructible, enhancing the most fascinating feature of the Marvel character, or brute force: apart from a couple of walls here and there, the Hulk's blows have no effect on the various elements of the scenario. This bleak picture is completed by an approximate graphic realization, evident daughter of a hasty development: the Hulk and Abomination sprites are appreciable, but everything else (starting with the backdrops, boring and lifeless) falls into the most total mediocrity. PRO Well done Hulk sprite AGAINST Trivial and poorly crafted gameplay It ends in 30 minutes Mediocre graphics", "date": "2008-06-25", "grade": "S.V."}
