The situation with Jet Car Stunts is not destined to change, since the True Axis product despite its appearance cannot be defined as a racing game; on the other hand, however, it is one of the best games that have appeared on the Apple terminal in recent months. Roller coaster In Jet Car Stunts you control a car, but there are no other drivers to be beaten to cross the finish line first; the only opponent is basically time, and the objective on the contrary is to be able to get to the end of the course as quickly as possible. Nothing could be simpler on paper, but this is until you realize the conformation of the tracks to be tackled; real roller coasters made up of platforms, chasms, parabolic curves, loops, jumps, platforms and anything else that can contribute to making the player's life difficult. A kind of exaggerated and four-wheeled declination of the Trial specialty on motorcycles, just to give a distant picture of the gameplay proposed by True Axis. The game modes are basically two; Platforming, with 25 tracks divided into 5 difficulty levels in which the focus is on extreme track design, and Time Trial in which instead you have to complete a few laps within a time limit. The control system is based on the accelerometer for steering and on four virtual keys for acceleration, reverse, brake (and airbrake in flight) and turbo; a number of different configurations allow you to vary the arrangement of the buttons on the screen to suit every preference, but in principle everything works absolutely flawlessly. Accuracy, essential in this type of product in order not to open the door to frustration, is guaranteed. Consequently defeats and failures become attributable only to errors by the player; and, especially in the more advanced levels, we assure you that there will be so many. Yet thanks to a captivating formula and such an effective and valid alchemy of factors, there is never a lack of incentive to try again or try to improve one's performance and thus obtain the gold medal. Someone has found links between Jet Car Stunts and the timed levels of Mirror's Edge; in fact it is not such a risky comparison, both in terms of mechanics and in terms of graphics. The programmers have in fact chosen to adopt a particular aesthetic aspect, with colored polygons but practically devoid of texture; the result is excellent, fascinating and above all accompanied by a very high frame rate, a mix that makes Jet Car Stunts one of the most technically interesting products available for the iPhone.
