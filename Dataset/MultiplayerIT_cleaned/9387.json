It is a racing game with a distinctly arcade character and ~turbocentric~ gameplay, characterized by the presence of numerous real-life cars as well as a large number of modes. Asphalt 3D, in this case, offers forty-two cars from twenty-one different manufacturers, seventeen tracks set within nine scenarios (Italy, USA, France, Japan, Brazil, Spain, Greece, Germany and South Africa) and eight different modes, especially online. in the latter case for up to six players simultaneously. The French company always takes the ~quantitative~ factor into great consideration, and so in addition to the single race and the aforementioned multiplayer we can access a very full-bodied and fairly varied career mode, in which each victory is rewarded with money and experience points which allow you to unlock respectively new vehicles and new items for tuning. The management of the cars is very simple, just enter the ~garage~ to select the car we want to use, modify its colors and possibly the decorations as desired, then apply upgrades such as improved exhausts, more efficient brakes, racing cooling systems and etc. There are also items that can improve boost output, however you have to progress quite a bit to unlock them. Thunder days Once on the track, the arcade character of Asphalt 3D appears clear after just a few moments, given that it is possible to race without practically ever touching the brake. Or rather, the brake must be touched but only to trigger controlled drifts that allow us to tackle even the tightest bends without decelerating. Risky manoeuvres, such as skidding but also ~foiled accidents~, when passing very close to a car proceeding in the opposite direction, help to replenish the turbo bar located at the top of the screen. It can also be filled by collecting the numerous objects present on the track, thus adapting our trajectories as needed. According to the level of the indicator, four different ~boosts~ can therefore be activated: the first three types simply boast an increasingly greater boost, while the last one becomes operable only when the bar is full and in practice transforms the scenario around us in a sort of ~negative zone~, with the car speeding along regardless of the obstacles and becoming able to ram and instantly knock out any opponent. The career mode sees you compete in ever-changing ways, from classic first-order events to elimination races, from drift-based challenges to one-on-one duels, and so on. The reward system guarantees a certain progression of the experience, with the unlocking of new tracks and new scenarios only when we have successfully completed the already available races, and the addition of interesting extra achievements that require a certain effort to be conquered. In short, from the point of view of content, the Gameloft title fears no competition, also thanks to the experience made recently on Apple devices with Asphalt 6, of which the Nintendo 3DS game is not a direct conversion. That this is a good thing, however, remains to be demonstrated. The 3D effect As these are two racing games, it's impossible not to compare the use of stereoscopic 3D in Asphalt 3D and Ridge Racer 3D. In fact, if the Namco title manages to offer high-class solutions, including for example water drops and three-dimensional petals, the same cannot be said of the Gameloft product, which limits itself to showing us our car and the information in 3D of the interface, with very few other elements capable of ~piercing~ the screen. Stereoscopic vision in some ways helps to pay little attention to the uncertainties of the frame rate, however: in this sense it does its job very well. Points of view The sixth episode of Asphalt runs on the iPhone 4 at a resolution of 960 x 640 pixels, boasts very defined textures and special effects such as reflections on the metallic bodywork of the cars, all while maintaining a frame rate that to the eye is very close to thirty frames per second , without practically ever suffering from declines or uncertainties. The price of the game is 3.99 euros. Asphalt 3D for Nintendo 3DS costs ten times as much, doesn't boast extra content of particular value beyond the stereoscopic 3D effect, runs at an inferior resolutionlower, with much less defined textures and suffers both from frequent drops in frame rate, and from a literally ridiculous collision system, which sees our car ~bouncing~ backwards as if it were a ball when it collides head-on with another vehicle, which ~gets stuck~ in the side barriers or which ~slips~ on impact with obstacles which should instead jeopardize its movement. Without making anyone cry out for a miracle, Ridge Racer 3D (direct competitor of the Gameloft title, given that both are part of the 3DS launch line-up) has shown that on the Nintendo handheld it is possible to move more polygons, insert more effects and always keep excellent fluidity even at this early stage of development on the new platform. It is therefore clear that a terrible job of optimization has been done, and it is a real shame considering the amount of content and modes that Asphalt 3D is able to offer. Compared to the iPhone versions, the game uses a classic control system on 3DS, which on the one hand can count on the excellent precision of the Circle Pad, on the other it does not allow any customization and therefore forces us to use the default configuration , which sees the A button to accelerate, the B button to brake and the L and R lats respectively to change views (there are three available: in first person, in third person from close up and in third person from a distance) and operate the boost. It goes without saying that to carry out a drift you have to press two buttons together with the right thumb, where the possibility of assigning the brake to the left backbone would have made the maneuver easier. Finally, the sound sector moves between ups and downs: we appreciated the variety and quality of the music that accompanies the action, while the effects leave much to be desired.", "date": "2011-03-29", "grade": "5.5"}
