{"name": "Spider-Man 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spider-man-3.html", "text": "Spaida-man! Spaida-man! A year has passed since the debut of Spider-Man in New York, and Peter Parker, now a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle, still carries on his shoulders the dramatic confrontation with the crazy Goblin, father of his best friend Harry Osborne , and the memory of Uncle Ben's death, caused by his involuntary mistake. With great powers come great responsibilities, Ben Parker had told him in the car the night he died, when Peter didn't want to listen to him, and now the young superhero has decided to put this philosophy into practice. Easier said than done, actually, given that life, real life, is escaping him from all sides: in love with Mary Jane, Peter cannot attend her for fear of putting her in danger; he lives in a small and dirty apartment so as not to get his aunt May in trouble too; suffers the daily abuses of J.J. Jameson, its editor-in-chief, determined to do everything to discredit Spider-Man; and even the university grades are declining, despite being extremely intelligent: for this reason an interview with the brilliant Otto Octavius about his new experiment could be an excellent opportunity to regain altitude in Professor Connors' lessons. But obviously something goes wrong, Octavius' experiment fails and the scientist ends up becoming a mad criminal, Doctor Octopus, whom Peter will have to stop by coming to terms with his private life, with his superpowers, with himself. As is clear, the video game follows the cinematographic plot, seasoning it however with a series of additional unpublished ~episodes~, which will surely be appreciated by fans of the comic: Spiderman will in fact have to contend with the mysterious Black Cat, with super-criminals such as Rhino, Shocker and Mysterio (it seems that a Spiderman videogame cannot be a Spiderman game without them...) and with petty everyday crimes, including muggings, shootings and chases. Ah yes, we forgot that it will also be necessary to deliver pizzas and buy upgrades to go to the next level, but we will talk about this in the next paragraph. I am Spiderman. This is more or less the feeling you get when playing the Activision title: really feeling like Spider-Man. Treyarch's idea isn't exactly revolutionary, but it was implemented in a truly excellent way: the player obviously impersonates Spiderman and is free to move around the Big Apple far and wide, for an incredibly vast playing area, jumping and climbing buildings, swinging with cobwebs and doing stunts between leaps. Most of the fun is due to this freedom of movement and exploration, and the incredibly user-friendly control system. The rest is rather tedious: divided into chapters, the game forces us to solve missions of various types to proceed from one to another; generally we have to reach a certain place, defeat the boss on duty, or earn enough ~hero points~: the latter are obtained by solving minor ~quests~, accessible by talking to the citizens who populate Manhattan, or by defeating common criminals that happen to us to catch them mugging someone or beating up someone else. The problem with quests is that they are incredibly monotonous and repetitive, and there are four types of them: those in which we have to save citizens who are about to fall off a building or sink with a boat, those in which we have to chase cars, others in which we have to knock out the delinquents on duty, still others in which we have to take injured passers-by to the hospital. The ~hero points~, however, are not only used to overcome a chapter, since they can also be spent to buy upgrades for our friendly neighborhood Spider: in the appropriate shop, in fact, it is possible to buy new stunts, various upgrades for our webs and various special moves to use in combat. The latter follows the system already developed by Activision for Spiderman on PSOne: based on a few keys, it allows you to perform numerous and imaginative aerial and terrestrial combos, enriched by the possibilities offered by the web (it is even possible to grab an enemy and make him spin and crash into to his cronies), from the introduction of a sort of timed counterattack and spider sense, which allows you to ~slow down~ time by increasing Spidey's perceptions. Exploration, however, is certainly the most satisfying element also from the point of view of ~hero points~, given that it is possible to find icons in the most hidden points of the Big Apple that will give us ~hero points~ for having recovered them. others that will kick off timed races, and various mini-games or secrets that make the title more varied than it can be imaginedto appear. Unlike what generally happens for tie-ins, especially for those inspired by the films of the moment, Spiderman 2 is not a bad title: it is indeed a good game, undermined only by excessive repetitiveness. Technically fluctuating, but with merits that far outweigh the defects, what convinces and keeps the player's interest high is the freedom of action and movement, the vastness of the explorable area and the infinite number of secrets to discover even after completing the main adventure. In short, it is a title that all comic book lovers and those who enjoyed the film will like, and that we recommend trying even for those who don't know Spiderman but just want to have fun. Pros: Enviable freedom Loads practically absent It's Spider-Man Cons: Game mechanics a bit repetitive Average longevity Visual Effects The technical sector of Spiderman 2 certainly does not cry out for a miracle, but it shows touches of class and truly noteworthy features. Certainly, the first that catches the eye is the enormity of the playing area, a very detailed and excellently reproduced Manhattan: divided into neighborhoods, what surprises the most and the total absence of loading during Spiderman's movements, which fixes in the lack of annoying pop-ups and fog effects. In short, New York is there, ready to be explored far and wide, from the tallest skyscraper to the most ambushed street (remarkable, moreover, the blur effect that characterizes Spider-Man's nosedives). On land, the Big Apple is populated by its inhabitants who stroll or drive their cars incessantly, and who, although polygonally modeled in a very approximate way, give the environment a truly effective touch of realism. Speaking of polygonal modeling, the various characters have undergone a rather fluctuating treatment: if Spiderman and Doctor Octopus are divinely made and animated, resembling their real counterparts (Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina) the same cannot be said of the aforementioned inhabitants or also supporting characters, woody and poorly textured (poor Mary Jane looks like a Kirsten Dust who has just been hit with a cartoon in the face). On the sound side, little to say: the original soundtrack pleasantly accompanies the action at every juncture together with the buzz of cars and passers-by, but the dubbing really leaves something to be desired, due to unsuitable voice actors and the repetition of phrases and jokes that are far too childish. Spider-Man, created by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee in the 60s, is probably the best known and most appreciated American comic of all time. With a light-hearted tone (but even Spidey has faced his beautiful tragedies) and a less ~superheroic~ approach than other comics such as Avengers or X-Men (to stay at Marvel), Spiderman has always addressed the theme of men in tights with a more human approach: after all, Peter Parker is what we could define as a real American ~nerd~, and it is no coincidence that Spider-Man is considered more of a ~neighborhood~ superhero (as is Devil). Currently, the Spider-Man comic has more than 400 releases, excluding the various specials, appearances in other series (his spats with the Human Torch on the pages of the Fantastic Four are very famous), the cross-overs in which he took part, the parallel universes and who knows how many other albi and albetti in which he peeped with his red and blue costume. The production of the film Spiderman, directed by Sam Raimi (genius director of the Evil Dead saga and co-producer of the well-known TV series Xena - Warrior Princess among others), arrives at a time when the film market is increasingly interested in the transpositions of comics, especially after the success of the film dedicated to the X-Men, directed by Brian Synger. If the results in this field are often unconvincing or in any case questionable, due to the very difficult work of adapting a complex medium such as the American comic strip, with its infinite telenovela-like subplots, and the consequent liberties taken in this phase regarding a story or a character who can convince neophytes as well as indignant fans, this did not happen for Spiderman: the first feature film proved to be an excellent film, faithful to the original spirit of the comic in practically every aspect and the same happened with the very recent sequel, which really hit the mark. In all this mechanism of transpositions, the transformation into a video game of the ~new~ adventure of the little Spider, the last of an infinite series that began at the time of the 8-bit, by Activision, already responsible for the excellent Spiderman for PSOne (however inspired by the comic and not the movie) and the mediocre Spiderman per PlayStation 2 (inspired instead by the first film): will something have changed compared to previous video games?", "date": "2004-10-07", "grade": null}
