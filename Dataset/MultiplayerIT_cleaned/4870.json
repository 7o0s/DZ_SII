The Sony Japan title was certainly among those able to offer a peculiar portable experience capable of giving a precise identity to the Japanese manufacturer's console, to the point of deserving a sequel and a spin-off for PlayStation 3. Eleven years later it arrives the high-resolution version for PlayStation 4, with a commercial operation that is curious to say the least but certainly more successful, from our point of view, than Parappa the Rapper, if only for the graphic style and gameplay dynamics able to resist more to the inexorable passage of time. The protagonists of LocoRoco are these ~puppety and soft~ creatures with a circular shape, with a tuft on the top; they recall the Smile Slimes of the Dragon Quest series but are decidedly more cheerful and singing, even when the situation around them is not exactly favourable. The game is instead a classic platform divided into levels, 40 in total spread over 5 worlds, within which you have to reach the exit, while collecting some collectibles and increasing the amount of LocoRoco to take home, for a maximum of 20 in total. After 11 years the original LocoRoco returns in sparkling high resolution on PlayStation 4 Playstation 4 trophies Unlike the original, of course, LocoRoco Remastered introduces trophy support, totaling 28 with 10 silver and 5 gold. The simplest ones are tied to the completion of the five game worlds, then the 100% completion of each level. The others are donated for mini games and collectibles for the LocoHouses, requiring a few more hours to finally reach the coveted platinum! Rolling rolling Playing LocoRoco you feel some reminiscence of Lemmings, also because you don't have direct control of the nice protagonists, but of the inclination of the surrounding world, thanks to the use of the upper backbones present on the DualShock 4. Moving the horizontal axis, therefore, it is possible to roll these fluffy beings to the right or left; pressing and then releasing L1 and R1 simultaneously, however, shake the ground to make them jump and thus overcome obstacles blocking the passage. Along the way there are slides, sticky or slippery terrains as well as secret passages to discover; as mentioned, your LocoRoco can eat fruit and increase its size, vice versa by pressing the circle button it is possible to generate a flash capable of ~frightening~ the gelatinous mass and breaking it down into individual LocoRoco: to return to the compact shape, just leave the same button pressed button and begin the absorption process. The characteristics that add quality and freshness to the levels are also of an aesthetic nature, thanks to the comic and jovial graphic sector that constantly changes from a visual point of view, and the joyful and ardent music that accompanies one's deeds, constantly sung by the nice protagonists and contextual to the events on the screen. There is no shortage of dangerous antagonists, represented by the Moja Corps that undermine the joy of the sun, the moon, the world itself: they must be countered by hitting them in advance before they steal the LocoRoco, preventing 100% completion of the level. In fact, to achieve the coveted perfect score there are three types of challenges, that of bringing home all 20 LocoRoco, the little flowers scattered around and the 3 or 4 Mui Mui present, small blue hominids with which to unlock new songs and objects for improve and expand your LocoHouse. The latter is a sort of playground for the LocoRoco, which can be customized to your liking and then see what happens; three mini-games are also unlocked in the main menu which also allow you to increase your collection, using up the extras of a title that can be completed in a few hours but which fortunately offers good replayability, despite having a little shortness of breath in terms of longevity overall. The PlayStation 4 version as content is essentially identical to the original PSP, obviously the resolution has been ~shot~ to 1080p on the smooth version of the console, 4K on the Pro, keeping the style intact and not looking too crass after all these years from the title original. The sound sector has been resampled and is still engaging and able to generate empathy while bringing our little LocoRoco home safely.", "date": "2017-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
