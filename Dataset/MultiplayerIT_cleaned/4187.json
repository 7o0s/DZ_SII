In fact, we are talking about the remastered edition of the episode which, in 2012, relaunched the series thanks to some happy intuitions, selling over ten million copies and laying the structural and narrative foundations for the subsequent chapters. A decidedly ambitious game also from a technical point of view, which it is no coincidence that it was very difficult to maintain a stable frame rate on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, thanks to the large open world, the sophisticated effects and the large number of possible interactions with the scenario between enemies, animals, vehicles and NPCs. In short, the remaster comes to do justice to the Ubisoft Montreal title in the console field, where on PC the situation has clearly always been very different. So let's go back to playing Jason Brody, an American boy like many others, who finds himself in the middle of a real nightmare when he and his friends, during an ~extreme~ holiday, end up inadvertently trespassing in the area of a tropical island controlled by a group of dangerous guerrillas. During his short captivity, Jason is forced to experience situations that will change him forever, starting a transformation that will lead the boy to become a warrior. Gameplay and structure: home, sweet home If it is true that Far Cry 3 represents the starting point for the modern interpretations of the Ubisoft franchise, which with the fifth chapter has further emphasized the element of the ~charismatic villain~, multiplying these figures and giving each of them a precise personality as as crazy as it is intriguing, in the same way in terms of gameplay and structure, trying Jason's adventure again is like going home, or wearing a pair of long-used shoes again. The ingredients are all there: the highly epic narrative introduction, the short tutorial that illustrates the stealth facets of the action, the desperate escape through the woods that ends with a potentially fatal fall, which instead marks the beginning of a new life for the protagonist. Saved by Dennis, an acquired member of the Rakyat tribe, Jason is encouraged to become aware of his abilities, to test the warrior in him and which also manifests itself through the Tatau tribal tattoo, enriched each time with new signs to indicate the skills learned during the campaign, related to the Heron, Spider and Shark classes. There are shops where you can buy weapons and ammunition, vehicles that we can borrow to cover long distances, the inevitable communication towers to reactivate, outposts to conquer, flora and fauna that represent precious resources but also dangers, in the optics of a crafting system thanks to which more capacious backpacks, holsters and belts can be made, gradually supporting the acquisition of ever richer and more varied equipment. All this system still works excellently today, both for those returning to Far Cry 3 after a long time and for those who have not yet had the opportunity to play the classic episode of the Ubisoft series. The problem lies in its inevitable lack of freshness and originality, if we consider that the same formula has been reused by the French house for practically every subsequent chapter. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-four Trophies of Far Cry 3 Classic Edition refer to the list of original achievements of the game, and are obtained by performing certain actions in the campaign, obtaining a certain amount of skills, spending specific amounts at shops, collecting collectibles and carrying complete the side missions. Technical realization: a half-hearted remaster Free for Far Cry 5 Season Pass owners, to be purchased separately for all the others, Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is in short a title that is still very valid today, which is a pleasure to play and offers phases in which the freedom of action is enhanced by the many strategic options available, while we face opponents who move according to behavioral routines of moderate thickness and consistency. What is missing is the remaster side, in the sense that this edition does not seem to have been created with the commitment and enthusiasm that one would have expected for the return of such an important and celebrated episode. There is an optimization problem related to the aiming system, although this does not dramatically affect the quality of the gameplay, but above all it was decided to include only the single player campaign in the package, cutting away the cooperative multiplayer that is so satisfying had given us at the time din the original release, strong in funny situations that it was possible to share with friends, while maintaining the progress achieved in this area. Then there is the technical discourse, which moves unexpectedly between ups and downs: as highlighted in the analysis carried out by Digital Foundry, the game does not run at real 4K, but at 1440p, without going beyond thirty frames per second and indeed recording on some occasions frankly difficult to digest declines. Doubling the frame rate would probably have been impossible due to the extra work on the CPU, undoubtedly the weak point of the current generation consoles, but in general the quite good results obtained by the developers are mostly the result of the goodness of the original material rather that of the remastering work, which we can define as a bit drawn out.", "date": "2018-06-26", "grade": "7.0"}
