Giving an answer to this question is not an easy task given the many opinions on the subject and the countless discussions that animate the forums, but a small Swedish software house wanted to walk the thin line that separates video games from interactive stories, proposing titles that have to be born as many admirers as detractors; we are obviously talking about Simogo, to which Year Walk and Device 6 are due, two excellent examples of how a well-crafted story can make up for apparently unjustified gaps. Could pushing this concept to the limit prove to be a great idea or did the Nordic duo ride too much the wave of success? Find out with us. The Sailor's Dream is all about the plot, but unfortunately the narration is not satisfactory Captain, or captain As specified at the beginning, The Sailor's Dream contains practically no gameplay element and the user's task is limited to the exploration of the various islands that make up the imaginary world of the game; each environment that is gradually discovered contains fragments of memories that reconstruct the story and the user's task is to discover its meaning and make sense of everything that is revealed, given the non-linearity of the situations in which we find ourselves. Basically each atoll that can be visited is made up of multiple rooms that must be explored as in the old text games, being able to choose whether to go north, south, east or west, all simply by swiping on the screen. Apparently not all rooms contain elements worthy of attention but it is up to the player to find every little piece that constitutes the cornerstone of the narrative, carefully examining each screen to understand its characteristics and advance in the novella. There are no puzzles to solve or enemies to defeat and the experience is limited to the mere discovery of new information, all seasoned by the excellent ability of the Simogo duo to leave nothing to chance, given that each element has reason to be present in a certain time or place, which Year walk and Device 6 lovers will already know. The only mental effort required of the user is to understand the events and set them in the right order to guess the vicissitudes of our captain, which is not easy, however, as the exposition is extremely hermetic; this last component, the backbone of the entire project, risks being the hole that causes the ship to sink. If the final experience is based on the player's ability to identify with the characters or to take the place of the helpless spectator in the face of events, the fiction must be so well thought out and ingenious as to transport the intrepid adventurer between the seas and make him try at least some emotion. Unfortunately it cannot be said that the story has been well written and everything appears so vague and far-fetched as to make the game absolutely inconclusive, leaving a bad taste in the mouth over the main narrative, which in any case does not last more than a scant hour. To be an application that makes the plot the main focus on which to base its appeal, disappointment is inevitable. Fortunately, the graphics and sound bought are instead treated in every detail, with excellently hand-drawn settings and accompanied by perfectly fitting background music, which do at least partially justice to the basic idea. Unfortunately these two elements cannot keep afloat a product which, although made very well from a technical point of view, risks boring the player in a short time, given the almost zero replay value and the rather demanding price by the standards of the mobile market.", "date": "2014-11-14", "grade": "6.7"}
