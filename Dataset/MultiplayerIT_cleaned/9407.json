Although the title could be improved in many aspects, especially in terms of interface, the success was completely unexpected, to the point of convincing the developers, not only to create a Game Dev Story 2 in the near future, but also to localize it in English all its games so far released on the App Store. Yet it is curious that, among the management of Luna Park, cities and video game stores, Kairosoft has given priority to Hot Springs Story, a simulator apparently less able to satisfy the tastes of the Western public. After all, who among you has ever dreamed of running a spa? Time to relax Those who have played Game Dev Story will find everything very familiar, since Hot Springs Story shares the same graphic style and an almost identical interface. All of this is obviously presented in a new context, which moves from a small office populated by a handful of nerds to an increasingly large and complex wellness centre, in which to welcome customers with adequate facilities and quality services. Compared to the previous Kairosoft title, the attention thus ends up shifting largely from people to objects: in addition to building bathrooms, spas and recreational places, the environment must be furnished with plants, distributors and lanterns. Planting pine trees near a thermal bath has immediate repercussions on its pleasantness, thus increasing the degree of customer satisfaction; moreover, based on the rooms and objects present nearby, a particular service can evolve, beautify itself aesthetically and confer some bonuses, even if it is rather annoying not being able to rotate the rooms at will and direct the entrance from any side you want. The aim of the game is to expand your center thanks to the receipts of your customers, investing in new structures but trying at the same time not to squander all the earnings. The experience, otherwise too linear, is made more unpredictable by a series of random or periodic events: good management work leads to articles in the main sector magazines, while there are also events and awards dedicated to the best wellness centres. An interesting novelty concerns the passing of the seasons, which in addition to adding a little variety to the aesthetics of the game, influences the bonuses conferred by the flora and the influx of people; the player is also able to choose a specific customer target, and try to attract mainly students, seniors or career women, for example. Much like Theme Hospital and other old Bullfrog gems, from time to time you may get a visit from a VIP who, if impressed by your centre, could give it big publicity. Through a menu it is then possible to purchase some items, mostly power-ups that increase the characteristics of your services; in this regard it is appropriate to underline that from the options it is possible to change the monetary currency from yen to dollar, although the exchange rate is rather approximate. Furthermore, listening to the criticisms leveled at Game Dev Story, Kairosoft has finally included the possibility of zooming or playing in landscape mode, optimizing the interface to cover the entire screen of the device. Thumbs down instead for the repetitive and uninteresting music that accompanies the game, while the decision to leave a hideous mouse cursor on the screen is inexplicable, which in addition to clashing with the style of the title almost gives the impression of playing with a rather than with an application optimized for iPhone.
