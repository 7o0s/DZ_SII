At the same time, the Spanish team must be recognized for having shown uncommon courage, accepting to make a difficult bet and therefore encountering many difficulties in meeting the enormous expectations that the ending of the first Lords of Shadow had generated. It is difficult to tell you about this final episode without anticipating anything about its plot, after all the incipit already represents a significant spoiler for those who have not yet had the opportunity to try their hand at the series; however in the unusual mix between present and past, which alternates urban settings with a gothic flavor and gloomy dungeons full of monstrous creatures, the desire to preserve those elements that made the franchise's debut memorable stands out. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 stands as a valuable action game, which gives its best on PC Cross and delight The experience of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 therefore starts from a multifaceted combat system that can be upgraded on various fronts, in which our default weapon, the terrible Whip of Shadow, is supported by the Sword of the Void and the Claws of Chaos , objects capable of stealing vital energy from opponents and destroying their shields and armor, respectively. Unlike the first episode, now the view can be controlled freely and this has forced the developers to make some changes to a system that still works very well, can be highly spectacular and guarantees, thanks to the skilful use of ~slow motion~, a satisfying feeling of impact. The balancing of the difficulty appears perfectly in line with what has been seen in the past, therefore at the normal challenge level the most savvy users will hardly come across the game over; but they will still have bread for their teeth, since the many enemies will not be asked to sink their blows and it will be necessary to calculate the times well in order to use the parry effectively, opening the defenses of the monster on duty to ring in devastating combos and close the case by sucking his blood. The bosses are also very beautiful, harbingers of inspired visual solutions and an emphasis on the inevitable alternative phases, in which, for example, we are asked to get on the back of a huge opponent to hurt him. The narrative component, thanks to the contribution of Kojima Productions, represented one of the strengths of the first Lords of Shadow and in this sequel it inevitably loses a pinch of bite, resulting in themes that are anything but original but in any case enriched by some undeniable touch classy (see one of the first scenes, when Gabriel has to recover his appearance and therefore eat). Fans of the original chapter may turn up their noses at some representations of the modern scenario, but it is a feeling that lasts just long enough to return, with the memories and sensations of the protagonist, to the old and fascinating castle. What basically ~doesn't work~ in the game are the stealth phases, for example those in which we take the form of a mouse, since they appear distant from the other elements of the gameplay and not particularly inspired. To shuffle the cards a bit, this type of operation fits us, just as the use of more complex platform sections than those of the beginning seemed adequate to us, in which every now and then it is nice to understand where we need to go and where maybe we can return later to discover some secrets, thanks to the sandbox-style setting of some locations. It's funny that international critics rejected without appeal this kind of experimentation, perhaps ready to punish in the same way the reproposition as such of the original model. The PC version Regardless of the sound accompaniment, which boasts an extraordinary quality on all platforms as regards the music by Oscar Araujo, supported by effects and dialogues (in English) up to the situation, the graphics of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 give absolutely the best of itself on PC. The console version of the game, while managing to remedy the frame rate problems that had characterized the first episode, runs in fact at a sub HD resolution, 1024 x 720 pixels, and uses low resolution effects and textures at the same time. In the Windows environment things are different and it is very pleasing that the MercurySteam developers have committed themselves to this, first of all by giving us a product that runs at 1080p and 60 fps fixed even on mid-range configurations (in our case 80-120 frames per secondly with vsync deactivated), and secondly by inserting in the operation a package of high definition textures and advanced effects which help to increase the definition of the textures and the quality of the surfaces in a substantial way. Of course, the implementation of supplementary features such as tessellation, to give further thickness to certain scenarios and improve the outlines of the sometimes ~rough~ polygonal models, would have been welcome; but there's really no need to complain about the quality of the PC version, which among other things offers us kinematics calculated in real time instead of simple movies, as often happens in multiplatform productions. The options available to adjust the quality of the graphics are many, even if they never go into detail: in addition to activating or not the HD textures and choosing the resolution, it is possible to set the quality of the antialiasing (although it is not clarified the technology used), motion blur, shadows, depth of field, particles and lighting. The game supports both mouse and keyboard commands and the Xbox 360 controller, with the latter which is naturally recognized automatically, has the same layout seen on the Microsoft console and represents the best choice for enjoying the experience, literally designed around to that device.", "date": "2014-02-28", "grade": "7.8"}
