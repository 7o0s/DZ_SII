After a year, the Canadian studio in Montreal is back to having its say, bringing continue the discussion that began with what, together with dance games, is the most interesting trend among those made possible by motion controllers outside of gaming. Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 resumes the ranks of what was done last year, further improving the interface, making it lean and fast, and making use of software updates to ensure that you can indulge in training without worrying about being detected correctly and , above all, by inserting exercises on the ground, so as to offer a complete range of possibilities in all respects. Fitness profiles One of the major defects of the first chapter was a general slowness in navigating through the menus and, above all, the fact that too much time passed between one exercise and another, between tutorials and uploads, thus failing to recreate that dynamism and continuity that a fitness workout can and must convey, given the need to keep the heart rate of those exercising high. In Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 all phases are followed without interruptions, the confirmation of the choices takes place by pressing the icons as if they were virtual buttons and require no more than a couple of seconds of waiting, with the right balance between preventing tedious long-term twists and turns. This is how you navigate between the four areas of the game ranging from the one for fitness classes (hip hop and yoga, for example, but also a training camp with a ruthless military, while helicopters land and explosions animate the seabed) , to the area dedicated to the exercises of individual muscle groups, up to warming up with rope jumping, dribbling or a light form of fit boxing. Obviously, these mentioned are just examples, given that there are so many exercises in each area. The first section of the menu is the one where, however, the usefulness of this new package is felt most strongly: apart from the connection with Uplay and the official website, where you can update your card and compare yourself with friends, and beyond to being able to check your progress on the calendar, in this area you can determine your goal. After choosing your profile, between sedentary, sporty and pro, we are asked for the result you want to achieve, which ranges from simple weight loss to the desire to keep fit. Based on these two parameters, Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 suggests the number of weekly sessions, their duration and the number of weeks needed to achieve our goal and marks the exercises in each of the available areas, suggested, with series of repetitions that can reach up to 30 minutes straight. In short, training at home has never been so easy and full of motivational ideas. Xbox 360 goals Pretty easy 1000 points for goal lovers. Most are those that reward the progressive consumption of calories, but there are also substantial ones for those who complete all the exercises in all areas, thus giving satisfaction even in the short term. See how I sweat The presentation remains one of the strengths of Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012, re-proposing the same softness and modernity of environments typical of the first episode, with the addition of some gems such as running on the spot which mimics those forms of fit tourism that go so far fashion in the major world capitals. Here are, for now, New York and London, with the various monuments that appear along the ride with a photo and the narrator who, while inciting the ride, describes the places you are ~visiting~. The improvements in terms of usability are evident and if, on the one hand, these certainly include the progress in detecting all the exercises, which are much more varied and complex, on the other there are tricks such as the audio click which warns of a series detected by the sensor, which is replaced by a bell, when that series is also perfectly executed, so as to be able to concentrate on the movements without having to constantly check what you are doing on the screen. In short, Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 represents an excellent balance between seriousness and entertainment with complex workouts ranging from simple series dedicated to a single muscle group, up to real fitness lessons explained with slenderness and which alternate exercises of different nature, but always held together by the obigeneral goal to pursue. Perhaps a slightly more precise indicator could have been provided to know at what stage one is with the program after each single exercise, given that only the percentage achieved on the total program is indicated, while it would have been useful to know the remaining minutes to complete the workout planned for the day. There is also the application to check one's progress on mobile (from iOS to Android), and the only problem we encountered is a certain cumbersomeness and lack of clarity in interfacing with uPlay, the Ubisoft service, to download new exercises , obtained by training progressively and earning reward points. This part, as well as the one relating to sharing one's exercises on social networks remain nebulous and not very accessible, but, and that's what matters, for those who want to keep fit now there are no more excuses!", "date": "2011-11-18", "grade": null}
