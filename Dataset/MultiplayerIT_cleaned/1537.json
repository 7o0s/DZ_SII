Those who have already tried one of the previous chapters of NFL Fever will have an idea of what they will face with this new episode of the series. In fact, not much has changed since the past edition and the programmers have continued on the path taken with the progenitor, i.e. not proposing a clone of Madden (EA) or Nfl 2k (Sega), but rather a cross between the arcade and simulation, focusing in particular on ease of use by new users. Fever 2004 is the classic game for everyone, intuitive controls, playbook without extremely complex schemes and a setting based on spectacular actions, understood as numerous series of launches, rather than long and difficult races. In this department, however, there is an interesting novelty compared to the past, the Microsoft guys have implemented three types of different ways to make passes: One Button, which is the simplest and most immediate, where each button corresponds to a ball carrier, and the transition takes place directly. Trigger Passing, in which the triggers of the Xbox pad are used to better dose the power of the pitch made, thus managing to maximize the quarterback's skills, while maintaining control over the pitches that is simple enough even for non-experts. Read & Lead, the most complex mode, suitable for NFL Fever veterans. This is an extension of Trigger Passing, in which after having selected the receiver it is possible to move a cursor on the screen, choosing exactly the point where to make the pass. In this mode you need to know the game patterns perfectly, given that to all intents and purposes you have to anticipate the movement of the runner, choosing the point where he will receive the pass, hopefully. Apart from this novelty, the rest of the gameplay has remained almost unchanged compared to the 2003 edition, even if as regards the AI of the CPU, improvements can be seen, especially in the scoring by the defense. The middle ground between arcade and simulation used in Nfl Fever, if on the one hand it allows you to differentiate yourself from the EA and SEGA productions, it is still difficult to implement in the best possible way and it happens that the physics of the ball sometimes has some small defects, as in certain quite powerful throws, but received almost without difficulty by the runners. The game options are what you can expect from the Microsoft title, from the career, to the quick game, from the multiplayer game to the various tutorials and workouts, these in particular are very well taken care of, thus facilitating new players who are not versed in the rules of football like the Americans. New helmets under the sun. The technical department of Nfl Fever 2004 has also improved compared to the past edition and, although not showing the same difference that was felt between Nfl Fever 2001 and their respective competitors of the time, it shows some details worthy of a production exclusively for Xbox. High-resolution textures, self shading, new management of lighting effects, such as the reflections of the sun on the players' helmets, excellent rendering of the field even in snow or rain conditions, and elements at the edge of the field such as photographers, cheerleaders or reservations made certainly not in the form of trivial textures. The fixed frame rate at 60 and the good cleaning of the image contribute to a satisfactory result. The only weak point of the engine concerns some animations that seem to be missing from the players, although revised and improved compared to previous versions, they are not comparable to those of the competition. surround sound Ups and downs also in this department, despite the use of Dolby Digital 5.1 and renewed sound effects, decidedly successful, the weak point of the NFL Fever series, or the commentary of the match, has not been strengthened properly. Even a few comments from commentators, combined with feedback that is not always perfect, lower the overall value of this department. For the soundtrack, however, no problem, perfect for the chosen music and with the possibility of using your own tracks directly from the Xbox hard disk. XSN & Xbox LIVE! As previously mentioned, from Nfl Fever 2004 onwards, all Microsoft sports production will be part of the XSN line, i.e. it will allow the world of Xbox Live to be combined with Internet, Email and Personal Computers, in order to make the game even more engaging online on Xbox. By connecting via a PC to the official Microsoft site (https://www.xsnsports.com), after a short registration to link your account on Xsn to our gamertag on Xbox Live, we will have full access to all the possibilities offered by Microsoft. From the XSN site we will be able to see all our game statistics updated after each game and obviously compare them to those of our friends or, better, to those of our rivals. Statistics, but not only that: we will be able to participate in the various tournaments and championships, check our position in the standings, invite our contacts on the Xbox Live friends list to challenges and private leagues, leave messages directly from the web page that will be notified when the player in question will connect to the network with the console, the interaction between the internet and Xbox Live has never been so strong. For each XSN game, our gamertag can create or participate in up to a maximum of five championships at a time, obviously it is possible to exit the various competitions at any time, at the complete discretion of the user. If for some reason it is not possible to participate in one of the matches on the calendar, through the XSN website, it is possible to give in advance, perhaps through one's own pocket pc, connected to the internet via GPRS or Wi-Fi, the forfeit for the match with three simple clicks. At the moment, the site connected to NFL Fever 2004 is still in the Pre-Season phase and will start at the end of September with the arrival of European players as well. XSN, however, is not only NFL Fever, but is divided into sections each dedicated to different sports titles. Although it may seem obvious to some, it is fair to specify that the service and use of XSN sport is completely free and over time, the features will increase with the arrival of new titles. Comment NFL Fever is certainly promoted, albeit with some reservations. In its favor it has the advantage of looking a lot at less experienced players, thanks to the relatively soft learning curve, combined with excellent tutorials. Obviously, the heart of this sequel is the total support of Xbox Live with the various XSN features, a factor that is certainly relevant for all users who consider online gaming not as an optional, but as a necessary and important modality. For these Nfl Fever represents a milestone and a turning point for Xbox and for Live, to have absolutely, therefore. The negative side lies in the direct comparison with the two sacred monsters branded EA and SEGA, from which the Microsoft title certainly stands out, but which it still cannot match, thus remaining a second choice by the football enthusiast who may not be interested in live services. The potential of the Nfl Fever series is very great, unfortunately, in this edition released less than a year after the previous chapter, the work of the programmers has been completely absorbed by the implementation of XSN support and the new passing methods, leaving out the weak points of Fever 2003. This choice, unfortunately, has penalized a little the final rendering of the game, which will have the possibility to take flight next year. Pros Live like never before and the advent of XSN Excellent graphics and light effects Easy and immediate even for football uninitiated Cons Apart from XSN, there are few new features introduced in the series Animations sometimes lacking Audio commentary not all 'height New year, new American football...sort of. Like every season, the various development teams dedicated to sports titles offer the public updated versions of their series, this 2003 is no exception. The new NFL Fever 2004 is certainly the most awaited since the release of the Xbox, not so much for the technical upgrades or for innovative changes to the gameplay, but because it is officially the title that opens the Microsoft ~XSN sports~ brand. The Online aspect of NFL will be taken up later in this review, now let's start from the description of the actual game.", "date": "2003-09-26", "grade": null}
