{"name": "Kuon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kuon.html", "text": "Known and appreciated by the most thanks to their strategic games dedicated to robots and scrolling shooters, the creators of the excellent Armored Core present themselves to the public with this title that seems to mimic other productions of the genre, from the atmospheres of Project Zero to creatures and the action of Silent Hill 4. We are in feudal Japan in the 1100s, during the Heiankyo period. A night like many others, in the villa belonging to a local squire, something terrible is about to happen. The man is awakened by the sinister litanies that some children are singing in the garden. Intrigued, the landlord gets up and decides to go and take a look, however falling victim to a disturbing female figure (do you know the classic pale woman with long raven hair of the Japanese horror tradition?) who soon it will turn out to be a ghost. Once the unfortunate lord was massacred, the woman drags his corpse to a room where two girls are waiting for her. There the specter throws the victim's body into a large basket and slips in, closing the lid behind him. Then it's silence. A short time later a well-known local exorcist arrives on the spot to investigate the events that took place in the mansion, but he too disappears into thin air. And this is where we enter the scene Utsuki and Sakuya In the role of two young girls, who we will control in turn in two distinct phases of the game, we will have to explore the huge building and its surroundings in an attempt to drive out the evil forces present on site and free, if possible, those who have been captured from ghosts. The game is divided into three different main chapters, which means that we will be ~forced~ to retrace the same path several times in order to be able to fully experience the protagonists and discover all the secrets hidden in the mansion. Utsuki is the protagonist of the Ying phase (Chapter of light), and is the daughter of the missing exorcist, who arrives at the villa together with her sister Kureha in search of her father, while Sakuya is the one of the Yang phase (Chapter of darkness). The girl is a disciple of the missing priest and will arrive on the spot accompanied by a group of apprentices to purify the mansion and its inhabitants. Once these two main chapters have been completed, we will be able to unlock and face the third phase, the one called Kuon, hence the title of the game, which will serve to conclude and connect the whole story. This ~section~ of the game will see Seimei as the protagonist, however we prefer not to reveal any details to you so as not to spoil the surprise. Ghosts Kuon owes a lot, for game mechanics and settings, to Project Zero, more than to any other survival horror. As in the Tecmo title we will have to explore large gloomy and distressing areas, barely illuminated by the dim light of the lantern we have supplied, being careful not to get lost and to the menacing silhouettes of the beings who spy on us in the shadows. The final aim is, of course, as previously mentioned, to free the mansion and possibly some of the individuals who disappeared inside it, from the forces of evil, solving puzzles to continue our research and facing numerous ghosts and creatures of the night that will block our way. street. To do this, our two friends will not have equipped a ~Jill Valentine~ paraphernalia or an incredible camera with extraterrestrial powers, after all we are in the middle of feudal Japan, but only the strength of their spells. Through the help of particular talismans, the two maidens can invoke good creatures from the afterlife able to help us during the fights, or launch magical attacks. To be honest, it must be said that some white weapons can actually be used. Exploring the gardens and the villa you can find knives and the like, but since these are too ineffective against most monsters, the above magical powers are the best ~remedy~ against enemies. One eye on Project Zero, another on Clock Tower... That Kuon is a purpurri of similar titles is also demonstrated by the presence of an element typical of another game: the ~Panic meter~ of Clock Tower 3 (and its twin Haunting Ground). Utsuki and Sakuya, in fact, are certainly not two ~Rambos~ (and thank goodness we say!) so every time they face too many enemies and consequently will not be able to stand up to you, they will fall into a state of total panic. A special indicator bar will fill up quickly and only escape or meditation will be able to calm things down. During this phase, however, you will unfortunately be easy targets of malign entities for which it is advisable to seek, if possible, a refugeThurs sure first, even if it's hard in certain situations just to try to escape. For this reason, as well as to increase the tension in the gamer, Kuon's game rhythm is mainly slow, designed to offer a soft approach to the exploratory phase. To avoid attracting the attention of ghosts and the like who haunt the rooms, and therefore escape the panic situations described above, as well as not to leave clues or precious objects behind since the areas to be controlled are very dark and it is easy to get lost if you proceed running, perhaps not seeing a path or a secondary entrance. Nightmare atmosphere The graphics sector is undoubtedly one of the best things in the game. The settings are very accurate and detailed, despite the permanent darkness in some areas they certainly facilitate the work of the engine. Each location has fairly well-made textures, sometimes of an excellent level, and well-structured polygonal models. Too bad they are a bit repetitive. Even the characters are aesthetically very accurate and characterized, with their very studied period clothes and their well-modeled faces. The only drawback perhaps is the fact that when the PCs speak in the cutscenes, made with the same graphics engine of the game, they don't move their lips!! Perhaps due to telepathic powers? After all, are they or aren't they ~special~ girls? Different speech with regard to monsters. While some ghosts are quite detailed and can boast a remarkable character design, almost entirely inspired by the creatures of the Japanese tradition (ghosts and monsters), other ~beings~ appear out of place, made with few polygons, careless as if they had been forced into the game at the last moment to make up the number. The soundtrack, on the other hand, does its duty in full: the music is atmospheric and worthily underlines the various phases of the game, with highs when a sudden appearance occurs such as to make you jump in your chair even before seeing who or what is there is paraded in front. Conclusions In summary: Project Zero, Silent Hill, Clock Tower, Resident Evil, Haunting Ground and a sprinkle of Obscure (in turn ~semi-clone~ of Konami's ~silent hill~). The cocktail offered to us by From Software for its first survival horror is inspired, more or less, by all these titles just mentioned, from which the Japanese softo has tried to extrapolate the best features. Not always such an attempt, that is to say to create a mixture of ~the best of the best~ taken from other games, has produced good results, and even Kuon is no exception. However, despite some flaws and a continuous feeling of ~already seen~ during some phases of the game, we would like to promote this latest horror title: the Japanese feudal setting, the creatures, the typical ghosts of the culture and tradition of the Land of the Rising Sun , the ability of the game to ~scare~ combined with our perpetual hunger for adventures with demons and the like, on balance mean that Kuon can still carve out a small space for himself in our / your personal toy library. Pros: Nice atmosphere, dark and engaging. Good quality graphics. In some places really scary. Cons: Characterization of some creatures to be reviewed. Gameplay and Pg control not excellent. No localization in Italian. On the PS2, horror-themed adventures commonly known as ~survival horror~ abound like swallows in spring. From the Resident Evil series (Outbreak and soon 4) to Silent Hill to Project Zero, passing through the ~singles~ Cold Fear and Obscure, practically all the most famous software houses have offered their very personal ~vision~ of this genre to the public , with not always exciting results. However, it is undeniable that survival arouses such enormous fascination among developers, and not only from an economic point of view given the potential earnings deriving from sales, to the point of pushing even the most ~unsuspected~ teams to produce at least one. As in the case of From Software, ready to try their hand at the enterprise with this Kuon.", "date": "2005-08-03", "grade": null}
