Of the almost forty employees, the fulcrum is made up of some of the historical names of Bizarre Creations, and in recent months the rumors have become increasingly insistent that the company is secretly involved in the development of Blur 2 or, even, of Project Gotham Racing 5. However, these are only conjectures, and with the exception of a simpleton arcade released last year on the App Store, the only concrete project in the hands of Lucid Games is Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery, a puzzle adventure for iOS and Vita which in recent days it debuted with the release of the first episode. Sasquatch is my daddy In a very similar way to what was seen with Professor Layton and Puzzle Agent, Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery uses a graphic adventure guise to hide what is actually a collection of various puzzles and riddles from Puzzle Week. The pretext for connecting them to each other is the bizarre adventure of Jacob, a little boy who, sent by his parents to the Feathered Eagle summer camp, meets a Sasquatch with a singing obsession: the plot of the first episode, ~A splash in the night~ flows quite predictably, seeing the two unlikely friends help each other as they try to hide their secret from the camp directors. It's a simple story with no big narrative pretensions, but at the same time it manages to prove to be tender and funny thanks to the characterization of the various characters and the dialogues with the other kids on the campsite, all with a few wheels out of place, some more and some less. To make everything even prettier, the artistic style chosen by the art director Chris Davie thinks: visually, the game mixes caricatured characters with environments and menus that seem to be made of cardboard, and overall there is the sensation of seeing small plastic toys move around in a sort of colorful diorama. When you then move from exploration to solving puzzles, the polygonal models of the characters give way to completely 2D illustrations, also in this case in line with the ~hardback~ style of the menus. Although there are some edges in the iPad version, the final result is coherent, spot on but, above all, original, capable of demonstrating the versatility of the Unreal Engine both with 3D scenarios and with two-dimensional screens. To move inside or outside the campsite, simply rub a finger to rotate the view, almost as if you were leafing through a book, tapping on routes to follow, objects to collect or characters to chat with. However, as already mentioned, these exploratory moments do nothing but take the player from one puzzle to another, and it is precisely the puzzles that represent the key element of Lucid Games' game, as well as the most evident similarity with the series of Level-5. For example, a riddle asks you to cut a pizza into smaller slices, paying attention to the ingredients on each slice and to the tastes of the various characters; in another you have to arrange backpacks and luggage on the various shelves, however being careful to follow the strict instructions of their owners. In short, the authors have tried to ensure a minimum of variety between one puzzle and another, but fans of Professor Layton and puzzle enthusiasts will not find anything particularly original in Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery. The level of difficulty is high enough to offer a non-trivial challenge even to those who are a little more experienced, but the risk of getting stuck and not being able to overcome a particular puzzle is solved thanks to a system of clues which, even in this case, draws on the aforementioned Professor Layton and Puzzle Agent. By collecting cans on the ground, the player can accumulate a certain number of telephone credits, which are used to get in touch with friends and relatives able to give him a hand: among the three levels of help, the most original is undoubtedly the first and cheapest, thanks to which you can connect to a fake social network called Suggestbook, where among the various messages published by friends only one is useful for solving the puzzle. The completed puzzles are saved in a separate menu and can be repeated at any time, but the score obtained obviously changes according to the attempts used. It must be said that finding the cans hidden in the scenery can be a fun practice, since you often have to tilt the device to move the camera around the scenery, but their abundance ensures that the player is never dissuaded from using them.give one, two or three clues to the first more complicated riddle. Despite being a long way from Professor Layton's care, Jacob Jones is off to a good start", "date": "2013-05-28", "grade": "7.9"}
