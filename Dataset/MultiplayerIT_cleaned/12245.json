{"name": "Ghost Rider - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-rider-recensione-2.html", "text": "Cheese ghost To begin with, Ghost Rider for PSP does not slavishly follow the plot of the film with Nicholas Cage: which, considering the paucity of the film, could also be an advantage, except that the storyline of the Climax title is practically nil. The intro of the game does nothing but introduce the user to the background of the protagonist, while there is practically no narrative link that keeps the various stages glued to each other. But this is certainly not the worst demerit of Ghost Rider, which in fact presents a play structure visibly ~inspired~ by masterpieces such as God of War and Devil May Cry and which nevertheless fails to be the least bit exciting. Just like in the Capcom product, the game is divided into missions and the action is enriched by a rating system that rewards the most spectacular combos with the most points; and as in Kratos' adventure, here too there are fast and heavy shots, a weapon upgrade system that takes advantage of the orbs collected from fallen enemies and some healthy slow-motion to emphasize the most spectacular shots. All substantially side elements that cannot support a title sunk by boring and monotonous gameplay, a very pale copy of the aforementioned video games. This is because Ghost Rider is above all too easy and linear: the stages are extremely circumscribed and characterized by an elementary level design, and the action is made sleepy by incredibly stupid enemies and by some overly powerful combos provided to the player already after the first bars of the game. 'adventure. Add to this the constant and annoying backtracking and a below average longevity (a handful of hours are enough to complete the story mode) and it will become clear how Ghost Rider is anything but a pleasant entertainment. It's not a motorcycle, it's a chopper In addition to the canonical game action, Ghost Rider also includes some sections aboard our superhero's motorcycle: these should serve to break the rhythm of the adventure, but the only thing they manage to break is the user's will to continue. given how sloppy and poorly implemented they are. In these sub-levels you simply have to go from point A to point B in the shortest possible time, taking out the enemies that randomly come forward and avoiding some obstacles scattered here and there. The problems of the driving segments are many, starting from a ~slippery~ control system and continuing with repetitive settings and - again - a lot of backtracking, the result of a clumsy attempt to water down the playful experience. Even if equally mediocre, the motorbike sections acquire a slightly greater thickness in the context of the Challenge mode, which enriches them with some variations and multiplayer support that even tolerates game sharing (all exclusive to the PSP version of the game). But it is really too little to be able to help Ghost Rider rise beyond a global insufficiency, also considering how the cosmetics of the product are not the best. The only really positive aspect of the Climax work is the polygonal model of the protagonist, well defined and animated, but everything else is absolutely to be forgotten: the stages are made ugly by a flat and impersonal design, the look of the enemies is the most anonymous one can imagine, the textures are poorly defined and there are even problems with the frame rate - subject to drastic drops - and with the camera, which almost always cuts off the opponents, preventing us from understanding where the threat is coming from. Comment Ghost Rider is, quite simply, a really bad tie-in. Almost totally detached from the reference film and guilty of a gameplay that results in a bad copy of elements stolen from Devil May Cry and God of War, the 2K product is not recommended for fans of the film nor for action game enthusiasts : in light of all this, Ghost Rider could only be of interest to true comic book buffs looking for an expensive ornament. Pros Winning play structure on paper... Cons ...but poorly made More than mediocre graphics Boring and short-lived Being a worthy tie-in to a cinematic blockbuster is a tall order, but even more so if the reference film was lukewarmly received at the best of times. Ghost Rider belongs to this second category, an action game inspired by the film of the same name that has returned from rather meager box office receipts and mainly negative impressions from the public and critics. The question arises: is the film or the game better?", "date": "2007-05-29", "grade": null}
