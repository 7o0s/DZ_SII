We're not talking about the Paris we all know, but a metropolis of a not too distant future where something didn't go the right way. The promises of technology seem not to have been kept, everything appears aged and in the process of decay. Democracy is dead, the city is divided into two districts representing as many social classes, and a dictator controls the country through violence and information, occasionally organizing sham elections in which citizens can only re-elect him. Meanwhile religious sects are multiplying, all with their own prophecy about the end of the world or some coming messiah. What does Alcide Nikopol, the penniless artist protagonist of the game, have to do with all this? Why did the gods set their sights on him? What are the ends of their machinations? Who is the android who has decided to challenge the president in the next elections? Nikopol: Secrets of Immortals is a rather classic graphic adventure but with an exceptional setting. Freely taken from Enki Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy, it faithfully follows its style, creating a world in the grip of chaos and despair in which the player is called to immerse himself by solving the usual cartload of puzzles. The view is in first person, in the classic Myst style, with the camera that can rotate three hundred and sixty degrees. The interface is also quite classic, with the cursor in the center of the screen changing shape according to the possible interactions with the elements of the scenario. In short, from a purely structural point of view there is nothing new compared to similar titles and, for example, if you have played the recent Dracula 3, you will immediately understand what we are talking about. The Alternatives Nikopol is a game with a unique visual style. If you wish, you could try Revolution Software's Beneath a Steel Sky (1994). We know that we are talking about an old title, but it is one of the best sci-fi adventures and, moreover, the game is now distributed for free. Coming to more recent times but not too much, you absolutely cannot miss Blade Runner (1997), inspired by Ridley Scott's immortal cinematic masterpiece. But if we really have to recommend a game that you can find in shops (how sadistic), we recommend Reprobates, an adventure with a desperate and surreal setting released last year. And yet you die The main differences compared to the competition mainly concern the contents. First of all in Nikopol you can die. In reality we are not talking about an absolute novelty (until the first Monkey Island you risked perishing in all graphic adventures), but about a precise design choice probably useful for keeping tension high. lack of time makes everything more complicated but also more exciting To give an example, in the first chapter (of five) the break-in of a monster in Nikopol's apartment makes it necessary to quickly solve the various puzzles that divide from salvation. Lack of time makes everything more complicated but also more exciting. Wanting to be bad we could say that death is a device made necessary to hide the relative brevity of the game. In fact, a particularly inspired adventurer can finish it in a single day, even if, realistically speaking, the average player will take more time, especially to solve some not exactly immediate puzzles. And the rubber chicken with pulley? Speaking of puzzles, it should be noted the excellent work done by the developers to try to integrate them perfectly into the game scenario. So no complications due to the illogicality of the situations, even if in some cases you have to empathize with the game world to be able to understand what to do, as for example in the second chapter, where the holy man of a sect to which Nikopol has joined has created a somewhat particular cemetery, above all for the method of storage of corpses and their remains. Among the different puzzles, however, there is no shortage of sub-games in which you have to figure out what to do and, as a little extra, there are two very short sections in which you have to shoot with a sniper rifle. wait! Don't run away, we're not talking about the usual action sequences forced into graphic adventures (we know that Simon the Sorcerer 3 still enters your adventurers' nightmares) which are usually done very badly and distract from the game rather than increase involvement. Instead, these are very short moments that do not detract from the adventure and which, on the contrary, are well blended with the rest. Enki Bilal Born in Belgrade in 1951, Enki Bilal is a comic book author and film director of domestic leveltional. Father of numerous masterpieces also translated into Italian, his unmistakable style has earned him recognition all over the world. Among his most famous cinematographic works we must mention Tycho Moon (1994) and Immortal (2004), while, having to choose between his comic works, we mention the Tetralogy of the Monster (begun in 1998 and concluded in 2007) and above all the Nikopol Trilogy , which White Birds was inspired by to create its product. More precisely, the plot is taken from the first volume entitled: ~The Fair of the Immortals~. Fun Fact: In the game, the drawings in Nikopol's studio are original plates by Enki Bilal. Disputes One of the most fascinating and controversial elements of Nikopol is the scenery itself. Now, those used to Bilal's style will not find it difficult to follow the plot and understand the ending, which leaves many questions open and does not resolve all the questions that arise from playing. In this sense, the developers have made a great effort to try to simplify the narrative by giving it greater linearity than the comic. The fact remains that it is not easy to understand the intrigue between gods, technology and politics put together by Bilal. Let me be clear: it is not a defect. It is a precise choice of the author who may like it or not. The important thing is to be aware of what you are going to handle. The fact remains that the sets of the game are the best graphic adventures have offered in recent years. We are not talking about graphics per se, but about style and, more particularly, about building a fascinating world, despite its technical limitations. In short, you will surely have understood that we are dealing with a title with many facets that can be judged in a very different way depending on how you welcome it and depending on how you manage to get in touch with the author's imagination.", "date": "2009-06-15", "grade": "8.0"}
