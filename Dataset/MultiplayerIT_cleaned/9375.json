{"name": "New York sotto attacco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86889-the-3rd-birthday-new-york-sotto-attacco.html", "text": "Parasite Eve was one of the most appreciated series by the public at the time of PlayStation 1. Especially the first episode, based on the interesting novel Parasite Eve by Hideaki Sena, which turned out to be a successful mix of genres between horror action of Resident Evil, a great success of the time, and other more purely RPGs. The story centered on the figure of a scientist who, destroyed by the premature death of his wife, tried to exploit his research on mitochondria to bring her back to life. Mitochondria are present by the hundreds in animal and plant cells, and are broadly regarded as the energy powerhouse of cells. The scientist was convinced that by recharging this energy and exploiting its effect he could bring his wife ~back~. But the consequences were other and far more disastrous. Several years later, after countless rumors, postponements and delays, expectations and hopes on the part of fans, as well as a failed attempt to bring the saga to mobile phones, Parasite Eve finally returns to the scene with a third chapter, this time on PlayStation Portable. The 3rd Birthday, this is the title, is actually more of a spin-off or a new beginning for the series than a sequel. It is also different from its predecessors as it concentrates its gameplay mainly on raw action (but there are, as we shall see, strategy and RPG elements), setting the story in a New York distracted from the Christmas atmosphere which is attacked by unknown lifeforms called Twisted. These creatures capable of eroding space and time have sprung from a huge entity called Babel. Who or what am I? Where do they come from? Aya Brea, now a special member of the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation), a special department created specifically by the US government to deal with and eliminate these monsters, lives isolated in the headquarters of the team to which she belongs. She has lost her memory, including memories of her past battles, and is emotionally weaker than we remembered her, plagued by a recurring nightmare perhaps related to the mysterious disappearance of her beloved Kyle Madigan and adoptive/clone sister Eve Brea. She is the only candidate compatible with the system called Overdrive, an exclusive technology that allows CTI agents to modify the past to then obtain positive effects in the present. Stroll through time Just the time shifts of the policewoman directly from the CTI headquarters are the fulcrum around which the whole adventure revolves as well as the gameplay of the product. Let's see how. The game is divided into acts which are in turn divided into chapters and at the beginning of each mission Aya is sent back in time through the technology described at the beginning, the Overdive, which is also the name of the ability that allows her to take over the body of any ally, human or otherwise, during the clashes. And not only those: helicopters or armored vehicles can also be manipulated. It goes without saying that this aspect adds a strong strategic component to the clashes, which in fact become anything but mere shoots and advances, but something more complex, at least in the more advanced stages of the story. In fact, if initially the game may seem like the classic Japanese-style third-person shooter, upon careful and deeper analysis it turns out that it is not such, and indeed embodies something much deeper in terms of gameplay than other products gender. In fact, while facing the creatures that have invaded the Big Apple, the gamer can switch to another character who will take on the appearance of the beautiful protagonist and then attack from another position. For example, suppose a first ~enclosure~ housing Officer Brea is fighting one-on-one in an alley with a group of monsters while another cop covers him by shooting from a rooftop. With the Overdrive System, as mentioned above, the user can ~pass~ to control the body of the latter and therefore find himself in a new elevated position. Or even take control of the helicopter that is flying over the area and from it launch dozens of missiles against the enemies. In these situations, in addition to her own equipment, Aya can freely dispose of the weapons and ammunition of the ~possessed~ individual. The characteristics of the latter are crucial for the outcome of the mission, as our heroine, by default, can equip four weapons, three of which can be assigned before each act, and the fourth determined instead by the body she controls. Ergo if the girl takes possession of a sniper she will have a Barrett M-82 style rifle and related advantages, if she does it with a simpleand citizen may hardly be able to use a small self-defense pistol. Without forgetting the fact that the same ammunition usually scattered within the scenario are decidedly limited during the adventure, and therefore it is necessary to ~recover~ them also through the control of the best equipped allies. Strategy and action In some cases Aya can occasionally, and only when they will be in practically zero living conditions, take possession of the Twisted's bodies, finishing them definitively through a kind of finisher that makes them explode from the inside. Be that as it may, the more our heroine uses certain weapons, the more she learns to master them and make the most of them. Furthermore, in this way, over time, he can have access to a whole series of controls on them, such as the possibility of modifying and enhancing them individually in relation to his own category (machine gun, grenade launcher, etc.) using the appropriate points (BP) obtainable by defeating the enemies. Always from the elimination of monsters, the character also acquires the experience useful for leveling up and thus increasing his life bar, unlocking more powerful gadgets and new possible combinations for DNA. But we will talk about this last topic in detail in the next paragraph. In this, remaining within the scope of the shootings, we add that the allies often present in the area can further be exploited for combined offensive actions. By pressing a button, in fact, you can activate the Crossfire and concentrate friendly fire towards a specific target to shoot it down, perhaps obtaining bonus points in case of success. However, all this has a cost in terms of risk: before being performed, this action requires the filling of a special bar and at the same time no shooting, while aiming at the enemy to be hit. Which can make the agent vulnerable to attacks from the potential victim or their ~friends~. To avoid surprises, the character managed by the user can find shelter behind the various elements scattered around the level, taking advantage of such covers as in Gears of War to dodge the blows of enemies or recharge their vital energy. However, these improvised barricades are not indestructible and often crumble or explode after being hit by opponents. DNA spherography The 3rd Birthday is a particularly difficult game, regardless of the type of difficulty level selected for the campaign. For which, strategy and Overdrive aside, it becomes essential to know how to exploit Aya Brea's superhuman qualities to survive and progress in the adventure. The young woman, let's not forget, always has a ~particular~ DNA and somewhat unusual powers: these, specifically, are linked here to a primary function called Liberation. By loading a special bar placed visually below the vital one, the protagonist is able to unleash a sort of auric energy that makes her devastating and faster than ever for a certain amount of time. Another interesting aspect of the game then lies in the possibility of customizing the characteristics of the main character at will. A bit like it happens in role-playing games with spells and special moves, also in this The 3rd Birthday, thanks to the Over Energy system, through particular elements to be implanted in Aya's DNA, it is possible to improve her abilities, making her learn new ones as well skill. When you shoot down a Twisted in particular situations they release colored spheres. The latter are globes that vary in characteristics based on the defeated monster: there are ~balls~ of a normal, unique or rare type. Each sphere of DNA is distinguished by a different chrome in relation to the type of influence it can have once equipped, and their contribution is not always positive. For example, some can increase the attack power or energy recovery, others the strength of critical hits or recharge. These spheres can level up and strengthen the power of the related skill or ability as for the magic of fantasy RPGs, and combined with each other obtaining unprecedented results. It depends on how they are placed side by side or superimposed, up to a maximum of nine, in the appropriate board-menu which vaguely recalls that of the Final Fantasy X spherography. Graphics and sound For the rest, and especially for the exploratory phases, the product is practically identical to its predecessors or to any title of the genre to which it belongs: the policewoman can be moved freely with the analog levers while the camera can be rotated and positioned at desired with the D-pad. The interaction with the surrounding environment takes place through the upper front keys used for Overdrive, grenades, alland actions, etc, with the back buttons used to lock on to enemies and to quickly switch weapons. Final note on the graphic and audio sectors. For the first, just one word is enough to describe and summarize everything: spectacular. The CGI movies are the traditionally splendid ones that Square Enix has accustomed us to over the years, especially on home consoles, with its usual almost flawless and Hollywood-style direction. The characters, especially the main ones, appear well defined. Aya, of course, especially. With a truly remarkable attention to detail considering the hardware on which the game runs. For example, when the agent is hit and has little energy, it often happens to see her clothes tear in certain points and show below, without exaggeration or vulgarity, it is clear, one's graces. Among other things, our heroine can count on a series of really not bad clothes, some of which are particularly unusual such as the sexy French maid dress. To wear them, just go to the Briefing Room section from the main menu, and in addition to equipping new weapons, selecting the missions (even those already finished), you can try on the clothes. Only the scenarios, or at least some of them, are sometimes a bit bare or unfinished. As for the sound, The 3rd Birthday has a soundtrack of great impact. Each song manages to characterize and underline the area in which you are or the moment of the action that is taking place in that instant, effectively immersing the gamer in the narrative context told by the game.", "date": "2011-04-01", "grade": "8.0"}
