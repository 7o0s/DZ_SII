{"name": "Time Crisis 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/time-crisis-5.html", "text": "The evolution of the evolution of the species It is a pleasure to see that the Namco developers have introduced further innovations in Time Crisis 3. We are referring mainly to the possibility of using four different weapons, whose ammunition is obtained by hitting (several times, possibly) a particular type of enemy. It will be possible to scroll through the weapons simply by pressing the trigger while crouched, and very often the greater firepower will prove indispensable to pass certain areas unscathed, especially when the enemies are fast and tough. In addition to the classic pistol, therefore, you can use a machine gun, a rifle and a grenade launcher. Tackling the end-of-level bosses without the support of these weapons is certainly not impossible, but it gets really complicated. This aspect leads us to talk about the game structure. Time Crisis 3 consists of a total of three levels, divided into as many areas. In each area you will have to face a certain number of firefights, paying attention to when the enemy bullets become potentially lethal (the so-called ~red shot~): in that case it is absolutely necessary to crouch quickly, in order not to lose one of the five lives disposition. Like all pistol shooters, TC3 rewards the gaming experience: memorizing the position of enemies, especially important ones, is essential to be able to overcome unscathed areas. Conversely, players who fail to complete the game with the credits available are awarded additional credits, depending on the area reached. Everything takes place on the tracks of a story worthy, we can say, of the worst children's magazine: a military regime has taken command of an island in the Mediterranean and threatens the world with atomic weapons. Two special agents, dressed not in uniform but as if they were going to a high school party, sneak into enemy territory with the intention of defeating the threat. It is still true however that the story matters relatively in this kind of games... Technical features The game makes extensive use of animated interlude sequences, the realization of which sometimes leaves something to be desired. The actual graphics are much better: quite detailed and fluid on every occasion, it is in fact functional for the purpose but does not represent the state of the art on PS2 at all. The sound sector of the game is also functional: the effects are realistic but nothing more, and the music has the advantage of not being annoying. The flaw, of course, lies precisely in their lack of bite: they are forgotten once the console is turned off, unceremoniously. The Italian adaptation has been edited to the limits of the obsessive, if we think we are dealing with a lightgun shooter: dubbed voices (among others, by the ubiquitous Marco Balzarotti. And probably also Luigi De Rosa) and even warnings on the screen translated into our language. In short, we are faced with a product that is too well cared for from this point of view. The presence of only three levels, however long and demanding, does not represent a revolution for the genre, which has always been characterized by immediacy but also by poor longevity. To improve things there is the possibility of playing in two at the same time, with the unprecedented ~touch of class~ of having two different points of view and having each other's backs. Comment Time Crisis 3 doesn't struggle much to win the title of best pistol shooter on PS2, given the lack of competitors. But it is a game that introduces several important innovations and which can represent the new yardstick for lovers of the genre. From now on, any lightgun shooter that doesn't give the option to at least switch weapons will be considered obsolete. The game is very entertaining and offers a large number of tense situations. The ~shooting positions~, then, in some cases turn out to be absurdly original: you will happen to shoot with the floor ~across~, upside down (obvious quote from the film ~Leon~, I would say) or while climbing on the wagons of a train about to fall into the void. In short, Time Crisis 3 is undoubtedly an excellent product for its genre. This does not mean, of course, that it is an excellent product overall: it offers a decidedly shorter challenge than most titles of a different genre and technically cannot compete with the good things we have seen on PS2. Pros: Four weapons available Frenzied and fun Fully translated into Italian Cons: Not very long-lived Good but not exceptional graphics The evolution of the speciesThe historic partnership between Namco and Sony has produced a large number of outstanding titles. Generally these are and have been coin-op conversions, but it would be more correct to talk about games designed specifically for PSone first and then PS2, launched in arcades to test their popularity and then immediately artfully packaged for the home market. Time Crisis is part of the bunch. Perhaps less popular than the various Tekken and Ridge Racer in the console arena, the gun shooter series has proven to work great as a coin-op, introducing a strategic element right from the first episode (converted for PSone years ago, of course). recent products like The House of the Dead had thought: the ability to take cover from enemy fire. If you are used to graphic adventures of a certain complexity, perhaps this will make you smile, but in the field of pistol shooters it is a revolution that changes the cards on the table: the required reaction speed is the same as always, but being able to manage your own actions adds some depth to an otherwise quintessentially flat genre. Of course, the canons of the arcade must still be respected, and so it is possible to crouch at will but bearing in mind that there is a timer to be respected to pass each area, and that the delay irreparably translates into the loss of a ~life~, exactly like when hit by a bullet.", "date": "2003-10-30", "grade": null}
