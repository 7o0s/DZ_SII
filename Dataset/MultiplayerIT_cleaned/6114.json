Interactive, this time double. However, this is not an extra content that expands the stories of Arkham through the events of some supporting actor of the Dark Knight or the superhero himself, but a classic DLC containing mainly skins of various kinds, this time by Rocksteady Studios themselves . Specifically we have the 1989 Movie Batmobile Pack, which includes Batman and Batmobile skins inspired by Tim Burton's 1989 film, as well as two circuits, one of which is based on its sequel, Batman Returns, and the Bat-family Skins Pack, featuring six alternate timeline-focused character skins for Catwoman, Robin, Batman, and Nightwing. Both add-ons are available from August 18 for season pass holders, while the 1989 Movie Batmobile Pack is available for purchase separately for  1.99 on PlayStation Network and Xbox LIVE. Batman: Arkham Knight's two August DLCs offer new skins for the Batmobile, Batman and his friends A jump into the past The first pack is based as mentioned above on the 1989 film ~Batman~ directed by Tim Burton, with Michael Keaton as the Bat Man, Jack Nicholson as the super-villain Joker, and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale. It was the first in the series of Batman films produced by Warner Bros. and was a critical and financial success, garnering the highest grossing film based on a DC Comics comic book at the time. Tim Burton's Batman received multiple BAFTA, Golden Globe and Saturn Award nominations, and inspired the Emmy-winning animated series of the same name, as well as several subsequent superhero films. Thanks to the 1989 Movie Batmobile Pack add-on, it is thus possible to drive the Batmobile inspired by the film, taking on new challenges within two special circuits. These are found within the AR Challenges in a combination of four one- and three-lap timed challenges, along two ~tracks~ that recall the Joker's famous parade and the Penguin scenario from Batman Returns. For the record, the rides are accompanied by the main theme music from Burton's two films, curated at the time by Danny Elfman. Unfortunately, however, it must be said that apart from the charm of the two settings, complete with snow to cover the areas, the paths do not add anything in particular to the gaming experience and indeed, you want for a less controllable Batmobile than Akham's original Knight, you want for the ~circuits~ that are structurally anonymous and have rotating pylons that are particularly difficult to overcome (as soon as you touch them the car explodes), racing to beat the records set by the developers sometimes even becomes frustrating and useless, given that overcoming the new challenges AR Challenges does not add stars to the final tally. In any case, the vehicle with the new skin can also be used in the main game (together with a new Batman costume based on Tim Burton's films), but considering that it cannot transform into an armored vehicle, it becomes practically useless, if not for a matter of aesthetics, since the Arkham Knight's drones can ~party~ her in an instant. Therefore, it can be used only after having cleared the streets of the latter and only in free-roaming. Moving on to the other pack available, the Bat-family Skins Pack instead includes six character skins based on alternate timelines. So here is a first costume dedicated to the sensual Catwoman, which takes up the purple one worn by the ~cat~ in the comics dedicated to her, illustrated by Jim Balent starting from 1993. The Original Arkham Nightwing instead allows Dick Grayson to have a slightly more jaunty, at least in the haircut, and to wear a different mask and ~overalls~ than in the original game. Also nice is the ~One Year Later Robin~ skin, which gives Tim Drake a red and dark blue outfit with gold lapels, as well as a new haircut. The Robin suit is based on the DC Comics story arc One Year Later, which follows the events of exactly one year into the future of the DC Universe, immediately following the events of Infinite Crisis. Finally we also have three new costumes for the Caped Crusader: in detail the one worn by the hero in Batman: Arkham Origins, the iconic gray and black one, and finally the famous Batman ~suit~ from the 70s, with the black logo of the bat imprinted on a yellow oval shape. Again nothing to complain from a visual point of view: the design of the costumes is good and each of them has been well rreproduced by the graphs. Despite this, this month's double package is disappointing in our opinion, a wasted opportunity to offer Batman: Arkham Knight owners something more substantial to improve the gaming experience and expand it, also from an artistic point of view. Cars and two circuits for the AR challenges are really too little to recommend their indiscriminate purchase to all users, despite the price of just 1.99 euros; ditto the handful of skins in the second package, which by the way we had already seen in previous DLCs of past games in the series. From this point of view it would perhaps have made more sense to include the two contents within the retail version, or in the Batgirl add-on or in the next package which will see the light in September. Our advice, therefore, for those who obviously do not have the season pass and have not yet played the main game, this time is to wait for an all-encompassing edition, while for the most ardent fans who want to collect everything, really everything, from the world of Batman, then the reverse is true.", "date": "2015-08-21", "grade": null}
