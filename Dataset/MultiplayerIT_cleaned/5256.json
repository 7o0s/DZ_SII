{"name": "Signalis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/signalis-recensione.html", "text": "Dissatisfaction with the present produces a well-known, but obvious result, namely that of looking to the past, to seek what is perceived as the original meaning of things: an ideal purity which, cleansed of history, becomes the essence of the present. Of course, the obsession with the past can produce enormous distortions, sometimes monstrous, but in some cases looking back seems to be the only way to move forward and actualize something desired that was thought to be irretrievably lost. In recent years, the independent scene in the world of video games has often looked to the history of the medium, not only as a matter of nostalgia, but also to rediscover forms of game set aside by the market, as well as to free itself from the dictatorship of production. The triple A industry has become unattainable for smaller teams and suffocating for the desire to express themselves by individual developers, so we have not infrequently witnessed the return of more accessible and in a certain sense human technologies and visual styles, manageable without having to invest tens of millions of dollars in it. The rose-engine development studio has tried just such an operation, as we will see in the review of Signalis, a survival horror that looks at Resident Evil and the first PlayStation, but also further reaching Project Firestart. Gameplay Elster, the protagonist of Signalis Elster, the protagonist of Signalis, is a Replika, i.e. a working humanoid android who, having awakened from cryostasis on a drifting spaceship, decides to infiltrate a gigantic government structure built on a distant and very cold planet, in search of his partner and the meaning of his dreams. Something terrible happened in the days before his arrival and the androids that were supposed to protect civilians have now become their persecutors. The place appears to be in ruins, despite not being completely abandoned. There are survivors, very few actually, but they are all looking for a way to escape. Our goal, however, is different: to go where evil was born, in a horror adventure whose story and style strongly recall the works of Stanley Kubrick, Hideaki Anno and David Lynch, the main sources of inspiration for the developers (they revealed them themselves, so we didn't have to work very hard to locate them). Signalis' puzzles are on average more challenging than those of modern survival horror games The base is made up of several distinct environments: rooms and corridors that must be explored in search of key objects, weapons, ammunition and healing items. Here and there there are also documents, which help to understand the context from which the adventure was born and which make us understand the role of the totalitarian regime of Eusan, a galactic dictatorship that keeps the entire solar system in check. The action is framed from above, with the rooms divided from each other by mechanical doors. The levels of the base are basically labyrinths that must be explored from top to bottom and in which classic puzzles must be solved, which require the combination of objects or the careful reading of documents in search of clues. For example, in one of the floors of the base we will have to find five access keys scattered around the level, examining pipes, working with strange machines and so on. As you may have understood, in terms of adventure elements we are more in the parts of a Resident Evil, or a Silent Hill, than from those of a modern survival horror, in which one advances on autopilot. Combat is not the focus of Signalis, even if it is present Rare in the first levels, descending into the depths of the base you also encounter hostile creatures, ranging from crazed androids to monstrous beings with strong Lovecraftian references. Signalis provides various tools to counter them, from pistols to rifles, with the gimmick, also classic, of limiting the number of ammunition available, so as not to make the indiscriminate massacre of every creature possible. Indeed, as we will see, it is often better to avoid combat, using the simple stealth system integrated into the game or running wildly past enemies. Fighting itself is a matter of holding down the key to aim your weapon and fire when the crosshairs appear on the enemy. Nothing too complex, to be honest, but it is clear that Signalis does not aim to be a shooter and tries in every way to focus on exploration and atmosphere. Some moments of Signalis are particularly dramatic To this end, short first-person sequences have also been introduced into the game, usually linked to specific environments, or to interlude sequences, in which you do not fight but have to replaysolving puzzles, such as finding a certain frequency on Elster's radio, or interacting with a seemingly non-functioning dashboard. In general, the gameplay of Signalis works and is also engaging, especially if you appreciate survival horror of a certain type. The story told is less predictable than it seems at the beginning and is skillfully told by short filmed sequences and the aforementioned documents. Unfortunately some of the choices made by the developers go a bit to undermine the experience, creating paradoxical situations. Problems In Signalis it is often back and forth Signalis' problems are largely related to his aspiration to resemble the survival horror classics. If from the point of view of the puzzles the game works, the choice of managing the inventory in the Resident Evil way, therefore with a very limited amount of space, ends up forcing you to go back and forth between the sparse crates in which it is possible to deposit the stuff in excess. The result is that, when possible, we tend to carry only the key objects, those whose use is linked to the progression of the game, amassing ammunition and healing objects in the collection points (unfortunately it is not possible to leave excess objects on the ground or exchange them with others). The fact that in this way you go to fight less could also appear positive, but the truth is that, given the weakness of the stealth mechanics, it becomes preferable to run here and there to avoid enemies, who are often very slow and not very reactive. Thus the atmosphere is partly penalized, partly because one becomes very skilled at overtaking on the run and, therefore, the sense of impending danger decreases, and partly because the annoyance of having to retrace the areas already visited takes over, just to fetch a certain item left behind or ammo to clear areas you want to explore further (or where fighting is unavoidable). All to remain adherent to an object management system that the survival horror classics handled much better than the rose-engine game does. With this we don't want to say that Signalis is a bad title, but only to underline how the rigidity with which it looks to the past has proved to be counterproductive for certain aspects of the gameplay, making it lose some strength and preventing it from taking flight, so as to reach an excellence that he had at hand. 90s vibe Signalis' first-person sequences are very much reminiscent of 90s 3D From a technical and stylistic point of view, however, there is little to complain about: Signalis mixes 2D mechanics and 3D graphics in an excellent way, following a much appreciated trend on the indie scene of recent years, namely that of going in search of a visual feeling from before PlayStation, perfectly fitting for what it aims to achieve in terms of atmosphere. Just the lack of definition of the characters and some objects of the scenario, combined with the semi-darkness in which the rooms are immersed, with the scarce sources of lighting that often lengthen the shadows dramatically, creates a sense of profound anguish, as if one were penetrating a dying body, the perfect setting for the story being told. Even the sections in pure 3D, viewed in first person, produce a similar effect and even more strongly recall the 90s, despite their brevity. To help immerse yourself in the game world there is also the perfectly fitting soundtrack, never intrusive and made of dark and very slow atmospheric music, often formed by a few sounds, which blend perfectly with the scenario, becoming a perfect frame for the action.", "date": "2022-10-25", "grade": "7.5"}
