{"name": "Metro Exodus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metro-exodus-recensione.html", "text": "In a few months, exactly 6 years will have passed since Metro: Last Light, the latest original work by the boys of 4A Games, arrived on the market. Since then, the team has only made a handful of remastered, a dubious quality title for VR platforms and was then involved in a series of vicissitudes which concerned first the dissolution of THQ and the consequent handover to Koch Media, and subsequently the move of the main office from the native Kiev, in Ukraine, to a more discreet and less folkloric Malta. Perhaps it is also for all these reasons that it took more than five years to see the conclusion of the Metro videogame trilogy realized. A trilogy that has always been characterized by a unique and particularly characteristic narrative and atmosphere that have often made up for a gameplay that is not very refined and perhaps too far from the standards of the most famous shooters. With Metro Exodus, the new chapter that is the subject of this review, 4A Games has however decided to go all-in, changing the cards on the table and really aiming high with a formula that, while remaining faithful to the genre of first person shooters and the classic physicality of the series, greatly extends its expectations with some open world grafts, the presence of crafting mechanics and exponentially increasing the variety of scenarios. The ultimate goal is to make this chapter appreciated by as many players as possible, without overdoing it and above all without distorting the main elements of the series. Follow us in this review of Metro: Exodus to find out if the guys from 4A Games have succeeded in their intent. The story of Metro Exodus The Metro franchise is a virtuous example of ~trans-mediality~. By this term is meant a universe that transcends its original medium and spans multiple media. Metro was in fact born from some short stories by Dmitry Glukhovsky, later merged into the novel Metro 2033 and subsequently expanded through the video games of 4A Games, some amateur short films, other novels by the original author and a series of further stories signed by other writers and representing a sort of expanded universe of the dystopian future hypothesized by Glukhovsky. The peculiarity of this scenario lies in the supervision work carried out by the Russian writer who, in this way, has tried to maintain a certain basic coherence in the narrative plot in Metro: Exodus and above all to keep some key characters clear and well present, including Artyom, the protagonist of the entire series (and video games); Colonel Miller, head of the Order's rangers, aka the Spartans Artyom joins; Anna, his wife and Miller's own daughter; plus a handful of other soldiers and factions who periodically connect to Artyom's affairs by significantly modifying them or undergoing important upheavals from the passage of our hero. Going into the details of Metro Exodus, but being careful to avoid any spoilers, we will find ourselves in front of the epilogue of both the videogame trilogy and all of Glukhovsky's novels since the game is positioned not as a direct sequel to Metro: Last Light , but as a sequel to Metro 2035, the book, thus concluding the entire narrative arc of Artyom and associates and narrating their definitive departure from Moscow. The universe created by the Russian writer, for those unfamiliar with it, is based on a third world war that took place in 2013 following some battles that broke out in the Middle East and then resulted in a conflict on an international scale whose disastrous outcome led to the nuclear bombing which involved a large part of the globe. In Russia, the holocaust saw the very few survivors concentrated in Moscow thanks to the refuge offered by underground tunnels, and in some cities on the outskirts. Obviously the war has not only led to the decimation of the human population and the creation of new societies of survivors, but also to the genesis of unprecedented mutated and terribly violent animal and humanoid species. In concrete terms, the game develops almost as if it were a sort of road movie and will see us cross Russia aboard a train, the Aurora, which acts as a narrative glue between one scenario and the next and will allow us to become familiar with the others Spartans, our wife Anna and some survivors that we will pick up along the way. All through optional contextual dialogues or by interacting with the on-board radio with the sole purpose of listening to the conversations of strangers and thus discovering some ancillary elements of the Metro world and of the locations that we will find ourselves exploring. In this regard, while appreciating the substantial writing work of the screenplaysbulls, we couldn't help but turn up our noses at dialogues that were too trivial, obvious and often extremely telephoned in their epilogues, sometimes even with a soap opera feeling. The journey of almost 8000 km that will take us along the red lands will last about a year and will see us face all four climatic seasons with tangible consequences on the settings, through 12 different chapters of very variable length. And here we come to the first crucial element of Metro Exodus: can we really speak of an open world first-person shooter? The answer is absolutely negative. The work of 4A Games has nothing to do with a Rage or a Far Cry but has a classic level structure with only some very large scenarios that allow a free roaming approach to the objectives. In reality, if you want to go deeper into the matter, only three maps are really open, while most of the chapters maintain a more linear structure thanks to a whole series of narrative tricks and excellent design gimmicks. And right here lurks the answer to one of the most recurring questions in the heads of those who adored the previous Metro precisely because of their claustrophobic, almost survival horror, often very guided atmosphere: does Exodus betray the canons of the series? Yes and no: on the one hand it is obvious that being largely set outdoors, far from tunnels and sometimes in lush or desert scenarios, it moves away with great force from the imaginary that it had helped to create with 2033 and Last Light. At the same time, however, precisely having kept the more open-world aims at bay, having preserved a certain survival component also thanks to crafting and above all by offering a last third of the campaign that is close in style and atmosphere to the first chapters of the series, they allowed him to maintain a thin veil of familiarity. Whether you're a fan of Glukhovsky's universe or not, this exclusively single-player first-person shooter will keep you entertained with good gimmicks for most of the 20 to 25 hours of gameplay it takes you to complete, but be prepared for a radically different experience from that of 2033 and Last Light. Gameplay On the gameplay front, Exodus is both a confirmation of the best-known feature of the Metro series, its physicality, and its natural evolution that takes the form of crafting and a system of modifications regarding weapons and equipment. Let's start from the first element: the 4A Games title is not a simple first-person shooter where interactions with the protagonist's guns and equipment stop at the change of magazines and, at the very least, at the use of a medikit, but great care is instead placed in the activities that we will be called upon to carry out during the fighting and in the few, well-deserved moments of rest. Weapons tend to jam as they get dirty, forcing us to reload more than necessary or fire several blank shots before seeing them work again. The equipment that Artyom wears will physically occupy the visual space when consulted, such as the watch to keep the duration of the gas mask filters under control, or the map with attached notebook to have indications on the roads to follow to reach the objectives or, again, the dynamo that we will have to use from time to time to keep the battery that powers the torch charged. Among other things, the mask once again represents a distinctive element of Metro's iconography: wearing it means seeing little of the environment around us, being forced to clean it every time we perform close kills or the bad weather will dirty it; sometimes we will even have to repair it to prevent the oxygen from escaping. From this point of view Metro is perfectly adherent to tradition. Metro: Exodus also brings with it a crafting and equipment improvement system. Through the backpack that we will be able to open at any time without interrupting the game action, we will be able to create medikits (energy is not restored automatically), filters, ammunition for special weapons and replenish a couple of throwable items such as daggers and jars to distract enemies. However, we will have to find workbenches to be able to produce the ammunition of the standard fire mouths, clean the latter and interact with the equipment worn. The possibilities granted to modify the equipped weapons are decidedly more interesting: at any time we will be able to change stock, barrel, magazines, sights and some other extra features, recovering the modifications from the weapons left on the ground by enemies or sometimes by some key characters. In this way we will be able to bend the fire mouths aour needs, for example by making a pistol much more versatile over a distance or by silencing it, or by significantly changing the rate of fire of a sniper rifle or even the range and power of a shotgun. The system has convinced us for its versatility and goes well with a stealth and survival component that permeates the game action: ammunition is always scarce, the enemies are very tough and being able to hit an opponent on the head, perhaps from a distance and without notices in advance the shot we are firing, it means arriving better equipped for subsequent clashes. Many of the chapters that make up the campaign offer approaches to objectives capable of significantly rewarding those who manage to act in the shadows, waiting for the night, avoiding patrols and silencing the minimum number of guards possible. Even mutants can often be bypassed or will tend to ignore us if we don't disturb them persistently, especially in the more open levels where there is even a minimal respawn of killed opponents. Exodus therefore knows how to stimulate a certain stealth gameplay, also thanks to an excellent level design full of secondary passages and alternative ways, but never backs down if you prefer the guns blazing approach thanks to a good feeling of the tools and the excellent differentiation between the available fire mouths. It is therefore a pity that this variety of equipment in Metro: Exodus is not accompanied by a similar richness in the composition of enemies and their behavior in battle. Opponents can conceptually be reduced to two types: more or less armored humans and more or less aggressive mutants. In the first case, we can only expect long-distance combat and a certain underlying immobility that reaches its peak in stealth actions; in the case of demons the attack pattern changes but is repeated indefinitely since they will all tend to come towards us to attack us in melee. There are only a couple of sporadic exceptions with some mutated animals able to ~spit~ at us from afar, but after a very few hours of play you will already know perfectly how to behave in relation to the enemies that appear in front of you and there will never be a paradigm shift or some news that can really surprise you. The more airy structure of the Exodus maps also brings a renewed mission management: now, alongside an always clear main objective, we will also have a handful of completely optional secondary activities that we can receive from some characters or discover simply by exploring the scenario. Nothing particularly original or creative, but it helps to increase the longevity of the game and to offer variations on the simple shooter mechanic related to ~get to place X to continue the campaign~. It's just a pity that the developer's choice to minimize suggestions and indications and to force the player to consult the map with its notebook, makes it very confusing and cumbersome to understand what the various question marks that will fill the map refer to during our wanderings. We will have to try to remember the dialogues by heart, often proceeding by trial and error and exploring the various areas to the end to make sure we don't forget anything. Technical and graphic department Since we were talking about a certain paucity as regards the variety of enemies and their reactivity above, let's open our technical disquisition by analyzing artificial intelligence. Always the Achilles heel of the series, this aspect of the game had already left us lukewarm on the occasion of the very first meetings with Metro: Exodus and, unfortunately, the situation has not changed with the final code. The enemies behave in a very basic way, respecting the two classic routines already described above: running towards the player to attack him in melee or shooting from a distance to try to stay in cover. The difficulty in the game therefore lies in the scarcity of ammunition and in the effective resistance to the blows of enemies who will require many bullets to go down unless you are particularly good at hitting them in the head or in their weak points. It's a little better when you try to act in stealth, even if it's just a matter of memorizing the patrols and being very careful not to ~wake up~ anyone, on pain of the classic generalized state of alarm. Artificial intelligence is the only real malus in the technical sector of Metro: Exodus because for everything else, graphics in primis, the game is absolutely excellent, with very few flaws.
