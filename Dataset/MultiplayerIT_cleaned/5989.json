The new contents promised by CD Projekt Red seemed interesting, but in these cases a certain skepticism always prevails. After the installation, the uninhabited region northeast of Velen, the one immediately above Oxenfurt, was filled with life, especially hostile, and a new main quest was unlocked, which we will discuss shortly. There are several ways to try out the new features immediately: either load a previously saved game with a Geralt of at least level 30, or start a new game with a preset character of an adequate level to face the expansion. Be very careful, because the weakest monsters that roam the area are of thirty-second level, so it's simply not possible to venture into these lands with a weak and ill-equipped Witcher, unless you want to risk your life with every step. Before dedicating ourselves to the main countryside we decide to take a ride on the good Rutilia to explore the landscape, discovering without too much surprise that, even if there are beautiful views, it does not differ much from the rest of the region. Nothing we didn't expect and basically it's right to ensure the geographical continuity of the map. But now it's time to work: customers oppressed by monsters are waiting for us. We reviewed Hearts of Stone! What will the first major expansion of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt be like? Shani The Hearts of Stone main campaign begins like any other mission. Geralt picks up an ad from a bulletin board and, having reached the indicated place, receives a very specific task, perfectly in line with his profession. Although the encounter with the enigmatic and brutal employer heralds storm, initially it seems that the Witcher's goal is only to fight against a powerful enemy who is terrorizing Oxenfurt. From then on, however, Geralt will find himself embroiled in a very different story from the one outlined in the opening bars, made up of revenge, honor, illusions, contracts, love, ghosts, parties and fights. We don't want to anticipate anything fundamental, but it is impossible not to mention the return of Shani, one of the protagonists of the first chapter of the series, however widely presented by the promotional material. Let's say that the girl will play an important role in the campaign and will be the cornerstone of one of the most original missions of the entire series, which from a simple amusement will turn into a strong reflection on Geralt and his being a Witcher. Returning to a more general vision, it is clear that CD Projekt Red has placed great care in the narrative side of Hearts of Stone, experimenting with solutions never tried before and partly digressing from the tones of the series. It is not the first case in the history of video games in which an expansion dares to offer something valid and different from the base game (remember Mask of the Betrayer, the first expansion of Neverwinter Nights 2?), but it is a rarity, since the most of the time laziness prevails in the realization. However fear not, because there are also some more canonical moments that do not disfigure compared to the others. For example, some of the bosses are challenging and require you to use good fighting technique to win. Nothing insurmountable, but don't expect to be able to overcome them by hitting keys at random. As far as we are concerned, it took us a dozen hours to get to the epilogue by focusing on the ancillary quests. And the other activities? If the main quest of Hearts of Stone is decidedly successful and interesting, the same cannot be said for the secondary activities. As tradition has it, to discover the hot spots, the question marks, of the new region, you need to reach a specific bulletin board and take all the announcements. Unlike the base game, where in each territory there were interesting situations to discover, not necessarily related to quests, here there is an overabundance of camps of criminal gangs formed by ex-soldiers and places invaded by monsters to free , which yield only a little loot. There are also more challenging fights, but to say that one hand is enough to count them is not hyperbole. In short, speaking of an expansion released not too long after the original game, one can also be satisfied, but perhaps the problem is precisely that one does not seek contentments from an expansion of The Witcher 3. We didn't expect revolutions, but something better could be done, perhaps by creatively reusing other elements of the basic title. Even speaking of real secondary quests, the situation does not improve. There are treasure huntso and some detective missions, but little else. Every now and then you face mini bosses, but these are creatures you have already seen, only of a higher level. In short, nothing comparable to the beautiful complementary stories that we experienced while chasing the Wild Hunt. It almost seems that once the Hearts of Stone main quest was created, the developers filled in the rest of the map as best they could. Charming! With Hearts of Stone a new craftsman is introduced into the world of The Witcher taking advantage of the arrival of some oferian exponents in Velen. It is a breed with clear Arab traits or, as we have already said during the test in Warsaw, with clear references to the inhabitants of Dorne seen in the Game of Thrones TV series. We are talking about the enchanter, a profession that has remained shrouded in mystery in recent weeks but which we have finally been able to fully test in its functioning. Apart from the unlocking and upgrading mechanics which force the player to spend increasing sums of money to gain access to the most sensational bonuses, the mechanism is simple and very effective: using this craftsman we will be able to apply a particularly powerful passive bonus on a piece of armor or on a weapon. The only requirement is that this equipment has at least three slots for the application of runes or glyphs and these last ones act as reagents to make the inscription. If we decide to enchant the object, we will lose the possibility of setting the stones on it. Just to name a few, we will be able to ensure that our armor always deflects all incoming arrows, or we will be able to have access to additional effects of signs such as the axii, which automatically transfers from one killed enemy to the next, or the igni which sets fire to all enemies close to the one struck and burned alive by our magic. There is also a real new set which, although it does not belong directly to one of the Witcher schools, still has noteworthy statistics and a good aesthetic design. It's just a pity that its finding is linked to the liberation of the criminal camps which, as also written above, really seems to be one of the most recurring elements used to ~fill~ the dead zones of this expansion. On the other hand, the small improvements connected to version 1.10 which accompanies the release of this expansion are decidedly more interesting. Finally it is possible to have a small arrow on the game map that allows us to quickly reach the indicator concerning the quest followed and the possibility of equipping four different consumables has also been implemented which can be changed on the fly in game with a long press of the digital cross. Five additional feats from the general skill tree also add to the appeal. Small bonuses such as the ability to fire two shots with the crossbow before having to reload it or an increased inventory capacity that go in the direction of making Geralt's level increase more usable. Technically Hearts of Stone confirms the exceptional visual sector set up by The Witcher 3 with, if possible, a further artistic and aesthetic enhancement as regards the handful of new explorable structures created for the occasion. From the area that forms the backdrop to a wedding essential to the main quest, to the external area surrounding the crypt of a family that is very important for narrative purposes, we must recognize that the work of the artists of CD Projekt Red continues to reach excellent quality peaks. And the same can also be said for a couple of unreleased tracks added to the splendid soundtrack. Unfortunately, however, we have also noticed how this expansion brings a few too many bugs and is decidedly dirtier in terms of optimizations and gameplay stability. In our test we happened to witness problematic artificial intelligences, especially as regards the new creatures introduced (boars and arachnoids) but above all to see absurd situations due to an approximate management of the physics concerning some pieces of armor or even whole characters . It is probable that all this will be resolved during the launch of the add-on, but at this stage it seemed obligatory to point out that not all of our tests went as smoothly as oil.", "date": "2015-10-08", "grade": "8.5"}
