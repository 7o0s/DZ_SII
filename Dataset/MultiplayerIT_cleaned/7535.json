This is the prestigious recognition that the Rocksteady developers have been awarded practically unanimously by critics and the public for their work with Batman, the protagonist first of Arkham Asylum and then of Arkham City. Two titles of extraordinary quality, able to tell in an unprecedented and terribly convincing way the lights and shadows of one of the most famous superheroes in the world, not surprisingly among those who have undergone changes and modernizations over the years, up to the recent - film interpretations. When you have a character like Batman at your disposal, in theory the rest should come easy. However, if we talk about video games, it is an assumption that is anything but founded, given that many development teams have failed despite having the same material available. The merits of the British studio, almost at its debut with this series (before they had only worked on Urban Chaos: Riot Squad for PlayStation 2 and Xbox), are therefore undeniable and pose a disturbing question: what would a Batman be like without their contribution? It is precisely this question that the guys from Warner Bros Games Montreal had to answer, shouldering a great responsibility, namely that of not disappointing the many fans of the franchise and perhaps introducing some new element within a formula that has now been widely tested. We will see together how only some of these objectives have been achieved, albeit in view of an excellent level of production, which is confronted once again with the PC platform in search of the traditional ~superior version~. We remind you that the review is also available for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii U. Good old Gotham City Batman: Arkham Origins is set before the events we already know and sees us take on the role of a Dark Knight in activity for a relatively short time, who meets certain characters for the first time: allies (the future Commissioner Gordon, his daughter Barbara) and opponents (Black Mask, Bane, Deathstroke, the Riddler, the Mad Hatter and many others, with even some surprises). The expedient is very interesting from a narrative point of view and probably opens the door to a parallel series to the one that Rocksteady will certainly continue on the next gen, however in practice the novelties - we say it immediately - are not substantial. Can Arkham Origins be classified as a simple ~more of the same~? Basically yes, even if, considering the quality of the two titles that preceded it, these productions are welcome, and revolutions be damned. So let's see what has changed. Firstly, the experience system, which now assigns points based on the quality of our fighting technique but puts us in front of mostly passive upgrades, which increase our resistance to blows without however providing us with decisive techniques compared to those with which we begin the adventure, completely identical to what has already been seen in Arkham City. Maybe that's right: instant KO blows would have ended up debasing a combat system that is still very valid today and characterized by a non-trivial degree of challenge, which other productions should certainly take as an example. Secondly, an attempt was made to focus more on the investigation - after all, Batman is still the ~most skilled detective in the world~ - with a virtual reconstruction of the crime scenes made up of advances and rewinds that somewhat resemble the ideas put into field from Dontnod Entertainment for Remember Me, since it is necessary to identify from time to time one or more extraneous elements within the sequence and deepen them. It is therefore a pity that often these phases are so ~assisted~ as to be deprived of much of the interest, sacrificed on the altar of accessibility. More on the changes: the traditional grappling hook is now equipped with a push system that allows you to ~jump~ from one building to another to cover considerable distances more quickly (a godsend), while it is possible to instantly reach points on the map thanks at the Batwing (a godsend, part two). Finally, we noticed a different organization with regard to the numerous secondary quests, which are now grouped within certain categories and constitute in themselves a sort of parallel story, which increases their charm. Batman: Arkham Origins is beautiful to see and play on PC, just a pity for some glitches The multiplayer mode Another novelty of Batman: Arkham Origins consists of the introduction of online multiplayer, in this case of a single team mode called ~Invisible Predatorle Online~, which allows eight players to compete in four different scenarios. This is not a four-on-four, however: while six people take command of the gang members of Joker and Bane, two others randomly chosen they control Batman and Robin, dealing with different mechanics and often moving to the upper areas of the map to avoid being seen and attack by surprise. The objective of the current heroes is to fill the intimidation gauge to the maximum, carrying out repeated eliminations, while the minions must try to kill the members of the opposing team (and possibly the heroes) until they run out of respawns available. The fact of having included a single mode protects the developers from the absence of online players, together with the limitation to eight participants which however is invariably reflected on the quality of the experience. In fact, two teams of three represent too few elements to populate medium-sized maps, and this often translates into long walks in search of the enemy. When controlling gang members the gameplay closely resembles that of any Gears of War, also thanks to the Unreal Engine 3, and an experience point-based growth system allows you to customize a little bit of everything, from the look to the equipment of our alter ego. There is also no shortage of paid content, in the sense that you can buy credits to unlock weapons and more quickly. Although pleasant, the feeling we got from the online component of Batman: Arkham Origins is that it is basically a filler, which competes with much more important and followed productions (the same Gears of War, already mentioned) and will hardly do proselytes, especially in the presence of a single method and the aforementioned limitation in the number of participants. The small version The Batman franchise has always taken particular advantage of technologies such as NVIDIA's PhysX and, in general, has been best expressed on the Windows platform. Arkham Origins is no exception, and is presented on the screens of our PC in dazzling form: except for the computer graphics cutscenes at 30 frames per second, which in the end show a lower detail than the in-game graphics, as often happens for cross-platform titles, the glance is remarkable and the differences compared to what was seen on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U are also notable. First the detail: on current generation consoles the polygonal models give the sensation of being ~blurred~ during close-up shots, which clearly does not happen on PC, even more so when playing at 1080p resolution. Owning an NVIDIA video card is also a valuable extra, because the aforementioned PhysX technology contributes substantially to the atmosphere of Gotham City, thanks to the introduction of mists and fumes that react to what occurs on the screen, as well as a yield of wind and snowflakes based particle really convincing. It didn't end there. Playing Batman: Arkham Origins on the test configuration, with all effects at maximum, we notice a substantially greater visual distance than that offered by the consoles, i.e. the buildings in the distance are perfectly distinguishable and not covered by the traditional ~fog~ device, and all of this moves at 50-60 frames per second without hesitation, even in the presence of vertical sync activated (which alone has a heavy impact on fluidity). As for the controls, it is possible to play with mouse and keyboard but we strongly advise against this configuration (as we always do, for third person games) in favor of the classic Xbox 360 controller, which is perfectly supported. In short, we are faced with the best version of the game currently available, were it not for the presence of a fairly large number of glitches, even quite serious ones, which the Steam community is not failing to highlight. The first boss, Killer Croc, in fact sees the enemy disappear when he collides with the bars, with the result of necessarily having to reload the last save. Or in a Riddler tower, you climb up a loophole to get out but Batman's hands melt into the wall and you can't get into the vent. Added to this are various polygonal interpenetrations (beaten enemies that merge with the floor) and some crashes. In short, a patch is needed.", "date": "2013-10-28", "grade": "8.5"}
