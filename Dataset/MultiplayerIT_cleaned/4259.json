{"name": "Forgotton Anne: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199276-forgotton-anne-la-recensione-di-forgotton-anne.html", "text": "A few years ago a famous fairy tale for adults and children, The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupry, was brought to the cinema, enriched among other things with unpublished quotations. At one point, for example, the character of the aviator says a phrase to the little girl that is hard to forget: ~the problem is not becoming an adult, but forgetting~. Like any self-respecting ~maxim~, we can apply it to various contexts, but what does it mean that forgetting is the problem? The point is that when we forget someone (or something) we are not only impoverishing our memories, but also the lives of others: we deprive them of our presence, of our awareness, of our interest. Forgotton Anne talks to us about this, and many other things: she tells us that forgetting hurts, that remembering is sometimes painful, and addresses an incredible amount of important issues, in the form of a fairy tale only apparently for children. A fairy tale made in the style of Japanese anime from the 80s, and which exploits the mechanics and game modes of the most basic graphic adventures. The things they left behind Forgotton Anne is set in an alternative world of fantasy, parallel to ours: it's called the Forgotten Lands, and it is here that the objects that human beings have forgotten end up, which they have left behind for various reasons. Imagine the teddy bear you slept with when you were a child, the right sock of a now worn-out pair, the drawing you made for your mother in kindergarten: precious memories that sooner or later, due to forgetfulness, distraction, but also time, they are lost. When the owner loses them, these objects end up in the Forgotten Lands and come to life: the developers want to underline that thanks to us and our emotions, we put a little life and soul even into the objects we own. Consequently, when we forget about them, the same objects end up in this parallel world: here they begin a life marked by hardship and fatigue, a miserable existence where the only thing that matters is the promise of Master Bonku, the master of the Forgotten lands. Master Bonku is building a bridge capable of connecting the two worlds, and will allow the forgotten objects that have proved faithful and excellent workers to return home, reuniting with their human beings. During the adventure, however, we play not Master Bonku, but the young and pretty Anne: the girl is the guardian of the local order, a sort of guardian of the Forgotten Lands, and has a privileged relationship with Master Bonku. They are also the only two humans in the world of Forgotlings (as the Forgotten Objects are called) and possess an extremely powerful tool: the Ark. It is a sort of steampunk glove capable of channeling, stealing and donating the main energy form of the Forgotten Lands, the same that allows the life of the Forgotlings: the Soul. Imagine how well terms like Soul and Ark sound in English (the whole game is in English, spoken and subtitled), and yet the exoticism of the sound collides with a cruel detail: the Ark is also an instrument of death for animated objects, since it can steal their vital essence (the Soul, in fact). Given these premises, which have also been made known by the developers (and even something more) through various game trailers, we will not tell you anything else about the history of Forgotton Lands. The reason is very simple: the narration represents the heart and the main value of the entire production. Without her, Forgotton Anne would be a decent indie, but certainly not an exceptional one. Fortunately, the themes it addresses, and the precise way it addresses them, make the work of ThroughLine Games a very difficult experience to forget. A gray world, but beautifully animated Once we have established that Forgotton Anne is a very good adventure, full of meaning and important themes, there is always a fundamental question that we must answer: how and how much to play? Unfortunately, if the highly guided narration proves to be intense and engaging, the same cannot be said for the proposed game mechanics: Forgotton Anne is a graphic adventure mixed with some puzzle-platform elements, but the components of both generally they appear sketchy and extremely basic. Anne is able to survey some points of interest, jump and climb; Equipped with a pair of Soul-powered tech wings, she can at most jump higher and cover long distances between platforms. Again, the Ark she wears on her wrist allows her to move Soul between certain containers and devices, and also to ~distill~ (i.e. kill) determinesyou Forgotlings; unfortunately the title never offers a challenge that goes even slightly beyond the ~easy~ level, and moreover the character's movements and his collisions with objects are extremely stiff and woody, making his movements from point to point on 2.5D maps. However this can at least reassure you in one point: you can complete Anne's adventure in the approximately six hours required without fear of being able to get stuck somewhere, because it would really take a lot of effort. However, other aspects of the production are extremely pleasant: the exploration of the various game areas of the Forgotten Lands is encouraged by the presence of some collectibles, which collected in the notebook of the protagonist (together with the details of the missions in progress) provide us with new background on the world of lost property and its inhabitants. We also bear in mind that everything you see will be hand-drawn in an appreciable anime style reminiscent of the 80s, and visually it will be difficult not to immediately think of some of Studio Ghibli's masterpieces: a first look at the backdrops of the various areas really leaves speechless for the attention to detail and the majesty of the overall effect. It seems to be precisely in those places together with Anne, distressing and claustrophobic places in the best tradition of Orwell (have you read 1984?), where there is no real distinction between things and people, and indeed in this case it seems that to be very more human are precisely the objects, which refuse to remain enslaved to a dictatorial regime full of promises and poor in facts. If from an artistic point of view there is very little to complain about, it must also be said that the design of Anne and Master Bonku leaves a bit to be desired, and overall it seems made in a much more hasty way than the game environments, the Forgotlings and the beautiful orchestrated soundtrack. Even here, however, one cannot help but think that even the ~neglect~ of the physical appearance of the human characters does not have some meaning on a conceptual level: it is precisely men who have lost things, who make them suffer, and again to enslave them in the Forgotten Lands. Let us not forget that among the ethical and moral themes on which Forgotton Anne insists, and on which the protagonist herself will slowly ask questions (her psychological evolution is not only credible, but extremely appreciable) dominate consumerism, the postmodern depersonalization of things and people, the less and less weight attributed to individual feelings, soul and memories. It is not the objects that are responsible for all this: it is human beings.", "date": "2018-05-16", "grade": "8.5"}
