{"name": "Shaun of the Sheep", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88728-home-sheep-home-shaun-of-the-sheep.html", "text": "The CG animated series ~Shaun the Sheep~, produced in England by Aardman Animations, was broadcast for the first time in 2007 and currently has sixty episodes, some of which have also arrived in Italy. In fact, the localization was rather rapid, given that it is a basically ~silent~ show, in which the various characters communicate through their own expressions and thus manage to entertain young and old spectators. The protagonist of the series is Shaun, a shrewd and smart sheep, who stands out from the crowd of his colleagues and lives his own adventures inside a large farm. Not infrequently she is saved by Bitzer, the big dog who controls the flock, but often it is she who gets her friends out of trouble, especially little Timmy and the huge Shirley, the latter with a strong passion for food . We find these three sheep in Home Sheep Home, a tie-in for iPhone and iPod Touch belonging to the action puzzle genre and featuring surprising gameplay, which bases its puzzles on physics through fifteen levels of increasing difficulty. Our goal in each stage is to reach the exit, and to do so we will have to take turns taking control of Shaun, Timmy and Shirley, using their unique abilities to our advantage. One sheep, two sheep... We can switch from one sheep to another by simply pressing the relevant icon on the touch screen, then use a classic-type control system to move it, with two diverging arrows at the bottom left of the screen and a jump button on the right. Shaun is the more balanced character, he jumps well and weighs the right amount, while Timmy and Shirley represent two extremes in terms of weight, mass and jumping ability. The key to solving each level lies precisely in taking these factors into consideration, exploiting them in the best way. Need to move a large object? Best done using Shirley. Need to squeeze through a very narrow passage? Then it's Timmy's turn. Some practical examples: in one of the first stages we have to drop a beam placed vertically so that it turns into a bridge and allows us to pass to the other side of an abyss. To succeed in the enterprise, just take the command of Shaun, take a jump and impact with the beam to make it fall right where we need it, then simply go over it with the three sheep. In alternative situations, perhaps the beam is already in a horizontal position, on the ground, and we have to make it ~crawl~ to transform it into an improvised bridge. The point is that just by pushing it, it would inevitably fall down due to the weight. So it is appropriate to place one of the sheep on the end of the beam that rests on the ground and perhaps use Shirley to move the now ~balanced~ sheep and beam across the abyss. Clearly the further you go, the more complex the puzzles become, with the appearance of switches, trampolines and so on. Some levels actually require some testing and some reasoning to be overcome, but in the end their quantity (fifteen) turns out to be scarce, barely adequate for the purchase price of the game. It must also be said that the touch controls are too small, so using them correctly, especially in situations where a little speed is required, becomes a problem. Finally, the technical realization is excellent: hand-drawn graphics, complete with ~notes~ in the background, and music that recalls the theme of the television series.
