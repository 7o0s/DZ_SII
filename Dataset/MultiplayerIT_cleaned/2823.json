Sure, it's never been easy to navigate between different configurations, features missing at launch, drivers that fry your GPU, glitches that make it impossible to complete campaigns or ruin your saves, mysterious crashes and finally the wonderful, evergreen speech related to optimization. For some time now, however, the situation has worsened further due to the semiconductor crisis, the phenomenon of miners and scalpers, as well as a pricing policy that has made even what it has always been the mid-range of GPUs, and which today in fact does not exist: getting a new generation video card designed for 1440p under one thousand euros has become an apparently impossible challenge, and so the prefix percentages are destined to further decrease phone of those who own a medium / high-end gaming configuration. Here, the PC version of The Last of Us Part 1 arises in many ways as the synthesis of all these distortions. The necessary (but unusually long) shader pre-compilation phase, in which the processor is fired at wood-burning oven temperatures, tells a lot about what is wrong with launching a product in these conditions, but that for a series of logics commercials (see the connection to the television series) necessarily had to arrive on the market, and which for the same reasons was not provided to the editors before its release, given that they were well aware of its problems and feared a unanimous slam. Allo at the same time, the recent example of Marvel's Spider-Man demonstrates how games on the Windows platform can change their face overnight, perhaps after the expiry of the embargo on in-depth articles, which therefore find themselves analyzing a product that no longer exists ; because in the end this is what we do: we provide as accurate a description as possible of what we see and what we feel, but the crystal ball is not part of the standard equipment of a video game journalist. And therefore, who knows, maybe tomorrow or in a week it will arrive a gigantic patch that will make everything we are about to tell you obsolete, but until then this is our review of the PC version of The Last of Us Part 1. The game: story, structure and gameplay The Last of Us Part 1: Tess, Joel and Ellie in the early stages of the campaign If you are purely PC users and this is your first contact with The Last of Us, allow us a few lines to tell you about the game itself: an action survival set in a post-apocalyptic world, devastated twenty years earlier by the sudden spread of a mushroom responsible for transforming countless people into ferocious mutants, who ravaged cities and forced the survivors to take refuge in fortified settlements under the control of the army. Introduced by a dramatic flashback, the story that is told is that of Joel, a man made tough and violent by events, who lives off smuggling with his partner Tess until he comes across a different delivery assignment than usual: he must escort a young girl, Ellie, up to a research center controlled by the rebel faction of the Lights. A mission of fundamental importance, given that she is the first human being apparently immune to the infection. The Last of Us Part 1, Ellie and Joel in a touching moment of the early stage Drawing on the classic narrative elements of road movies, Neil Druckmann tells a human story of great depth in the game, full of very well-characterized characters, of a bond that progressively becomes stronger and of a violence that is not only that of the infected, but also and above all of those who survived the catastrophe by losing their humanity, such as the teams of ruthless marauders that Joel and Ellie come across along the way. The plot is supported by a still current gameplay, in which the protagonists find themselves facing enemies within generally very large scenarios, which allow you to alternate between a stealth approach and open-face combat as appropriate, always keeping an eye on cover and ammunition, and then collecting resources for crafting and collectibles while they are resolved little environmental puzzles. The concept of remake and the differences with the original The Last of Us Part 1 and the undeniable improvements of the remake The Last of Us Part 1 stands as a remake of the title originally released in 2013 on PS3 and remastered the following year for PS4. As we have often explainedor, the term in question indicates a complete technical makeover that acts on geometries, animations, assets and effects, giving us a visually renewed experience but in step with the times also on the gameplay front, refined for the occasion. The story, the dialogues and the characterization of the characters do not change, as does the structure: the campaign of The Last of Us Part 1 (and that of the Left Behind expansion, included in the package) does not reserve any surprises for those who have already completed the game, perhaps many times; but without a doubt he is able to reproduce those sequences in a different, more conscious and coherent way than the work done with Part 2, as also demonstrated by the changes to the interface and accessibility options, as well as the workbench animations that Joel Use to upgrade your equipment. The Last of Us Part 1, Ellie and Joel on their journey However, we were also talking about the gameplay, which in this case can count on improved routines as regards the artificial intelligence of the enemies; in particular the human ones, who tend to have a greater perception of space and what is happening around them, identify the corpses of their companions and immediately alert the others, putting into practice slightly more elaborate group attack strategies than the original version , which give rise to frenetic clashes in which it is often necessary to move, sink and fall back. However, it is inevitably the technical sector that bears the most evident signs of this operation of ~adaptation~ of the Naughty Dog saga, drawing on the technologies that the team of development he employed for the second chapter in order to deliver substantially more detailed and better animated characters, who move more convincingly within renewed scenarios, embellished with textures and effects that give him an often completely different appearance. The PC version The Last of Us Part 1, Joel and Bill in an old church underlining the quality of the makeover And here we are finally talking about the PC version of The Last of Us Part 1 and its problems, starting from the aforementioned shader precompilation phase, which although important for performance purposes in this case takes a long time (half an hour) and we were forced to restart it several times as it implies an abnormal use of the processor, making it jump to very high temperatures. It seems that the first patch has somewhat mitigated this phenomenon, but for the moment it does not touch the other critical issues of a port which, we repeat, arrived on the market in frankly unacceptable conditions due to commercial logics that conflicted with obvious organizational shortcomings. The watchword is optimization, and it is a concept that those who edited the PC version of The Last of Us Part 1 would do well to review. The Last of Us Part 1, one more look at the scenarios Let me be clear, on the Windows platform it is certainly not the first time that we find ourselves in such a situation: unable to adjust the graphics of the game on the basis of the desired performance due to the lack of reference hardware (apart from Steam Deck, which however must make do with minimal presets here), developers often rely on the ability of more powerful GPUs (and drivers tweaked by someone else) to make up for their shortcomings. In this specific case The Last of Us Part 1 simply can't run at full capacity on video cards equipped with less than 12 GB of RAM: the graphics options screen is extremely clear in this sense and shows the use of memory based on the adjustments made on the front of the resolution and the presets and/or the individual items. Forcing the hand leads not only to experiencing obvious frame rate drops in the busiest situations, but also and above all to crash and freeze. The Last of Us Part 1, the settings we used for 1440p at 60 fps with an RTX 3070 Being limited by the 8GB of memory of an RTX 3070, we tried to carry out several tests to understand what the compromises were within our reach. Well, the sequences that you will see shortly in the video review of The Last of Us Part 1 for PC were captured at 1440p and 60 fps using the max preset (which corresponds to the traditional ~high~) in combination with a DLSS on ~quality~ which brought the starting resolution to 960p. If you want to settle for a slightly lower frame rate, from 50 to 60 fps, you can opt for 1800p again with DLSS on quality, while if you want to fall back on 30 fps you can play the 2160p card always with the max preset and DLSS, but without obtaining a very satisfactory frame pacing. Considering the performance of the game su PS5 and the use on the Sony console of presets often matching the ultra on PC, it is clear that these are bad results. The Last of Us Part 1, a sequence of Left Behind Having said that, we would be lying if we said that at 1440p and 60 fps The Last of Us Part 1 is an ugly game to look at or has problems that go beyond performance: in our experience, preshading aside, the crashes have always occurred due to attempts to force the hand to use combinations of resolution, quality presets and frame rates above the possibilities of the GPU. Even though we eventually exceeded those requirements by about 1 GB, we were able to enjoy a fluid and visually impactful experience. However, we know that not everyone went so well and that, in general, rewarding such work would send a bad message . At the same time, the review evaluates the product as a whole and the goodness of the conversion, in this specific case its optimization, is only one of the aspects that make up the small number you find at the bottom. How much and how to lower it compared to the evaluation of the PS5 version is not an exact science, and above all it frames a situation which, as written at the beginning, is inevitably destined to change.", "date": "2023-03-30", "grade": "7.5"}
