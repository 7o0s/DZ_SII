We are not simply talking about the DLCs that continue to follow each other regularly as per tradition, but rather for all those numerous changes to the gameplay and the structure of the menus useful for improving the general gaming experience. Coming back to the servers these days you will find quite a few different things: first of all the headquarters has been completely integrated into the initial interface, so you can receive the crates or go to the quartermaster or even go to the cinema and accept new orders without having to waste time in the general game HUB every time, a choice that we like and that is perfectly fine to remedy a feature never fully appreciated by the players. To the delight of warrior artists, the Paintshop is also here, allowing you to create custom skins for your weapons, as well as a host of new emblems, tags and collectibles. There are also massive changes to the divisions, aimed at giving more flexibility and choices to players, as well as a complete overhaul of sprinting for all soldiers who can now run non-stop as they please, a change that further increases the pace of the game leading to an almost exasperated speed in matches. However, it is not a bad news given the good size of the maps already present and which paves the way for the arrival of The War Machine, the new DLC that we are preparing to review and whose contents, yes, are linked to the purchase of the add-on package. There are a sphinx, a beach, a missile and a dog The maps in the DLC, only three from this year we remind you, offer a considerable variety, not only in terms of settings, but also in terms of gameplay and level construction. The first good news is that the new play areas are new this time around, not featuring any re-propositions of past maps. Dunkirk is a rather classic map, aesthetically speaking, but it will certainly make players argue for its atypical construction. We could almost define the new addition as a clear fusion of two different maps, one dedicated to close combat in the ruined rooms of houses and the other perfectly prepared for snipers and long-range shooting lovers, with very little cover in between for protect the assault. The respawns in this case then tend to always put the two teams face to face, letting the players contest the result of the match head-on. However, it is not a map that lends itself perfectly to all divisions and, unlike many other locations, here the composition of your team seems to have a much more important role than usual: you will find someone on Call of Duty willing to talk and change divisions to fit the needs of the team? We strongly doubt it. V2 instead offers a simpler and clearer design, especially in the objective modes, with the central area dedicated to the heart rocket of the most ferocious and bloody clashes of the matches. With the new movement speed, however, V2 is perhaps excessively restricted and you have to expect a fast pace of play and non-stop shooting. The map set in Egypt is instead much more complex and we particularly liked it for two main reasons. Meanwhile, the sand and the colors used for the textures help to give a completely new aspect to this additional content, and a really exaggerated amount of scenic elements make their appearance on the playing field between downed planes, ruined statues and buildings wrapped in grains of sand. It is possible to arrive in the central area from four different points, as well as from a hole in the ceiling that will catapult you right in the middle of the room. Together with the three maps also comes Operation Husky, a very interesting diversion from the usual infantry fights as it introduces exciting dogfights for the first time. We were quite scared, to tell the truth, to find out how Sledgehammer would have inserted the fights on the aircraft, but once you get the stick in hand you have fun and manage the propeller planes with extreme naturalness, so much so that you want more and more. Indeed, it is a pity that the third phase of Operation Husky is so short, becoming a sort of lightning team deathmatch between the two sides. However, Husky remains one of the best deals entered so far. The first phase will require you to steal documents and bring them back to the base, with the possibility for the defenders to erect the usual barricades and place explosive wire anywhere on the map, while in the second phase we will have to conquer ordefend, depending on the deployment, a pure dominion-style radio station. Some tweaks to the balance of the capture the flag and control of the points have been made to make everything more interesting, so as to transform the matches into games that are always fought but never frustrating or impossible for both factions. Let's go to Berlin, Sledge! Finally, a new zombie map also returns, which continues the story seen in the previous two chapters with the usual four protagonists. The Throne of the Shadow will take us this time into the heart of Nazi Germany, in a capital set on fire by the Allied attack. Here, locked up in the basement of Berlin, we will have to try to find the way out to get to the city and then pave the way to safety. Unlike the expansion inserted with The Resistance, the structure of the map is much better, wider and with extremely more beautiful panoramas. The fog mechanic disappears, for a zombie experience extremely similar to that seen in the original game without any revolution that could make the new DLC particularly desired. It's a way like any other to extend the longevity of the title but it clashes a bit with the rest of the contents of this decidedly better and braver extra package. Ultimately Call of Duty: WWII - The War Machine is a DLC of absolute value for all fans of the series. If you have the season pass, it is one of those contents that you just cannot avoid playing, especially Operation Husky, and offers excellent reasons to return to the servers even for those who only have the base game given the numerous changes to the divisions that have arrived on the servers for the occasion. For the first time we will have three new maps without any rework and the addition of aerial combat, which we hope at this point will become a real stand-alone mode. Too bad only for The Throne of the Shadow which rests a bit on its laurels by daring absolutely nothing, pleasant to play but perhaps not necessary a more of the same.", "date": "2018-04-13", "grade": null}
