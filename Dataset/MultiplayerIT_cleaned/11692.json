{"name": "Aircraft Gear", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aircraft-gear.html", "text": "Aircraft Gear is the latest video game created by Funmobile, a company that has been active for some years in the field of mobile entertainment. It's a rather classic vertical scrolling shoot'em-up, in which we find ourselves controlling a fighter plane in four different scenarios, in a continuous battle against hordes of enemies. The game uses the already proven automatic fire system and the usual boosting through the collection of objects dropped by destroyed opponents, which in this case, however, are of two different types. In fact we will have two weapons: one with a rather large range, which shoots in a fan, and another which uses a single beam of energy. Upgrading the first translates into an increase in the number of shots fired and the addition of homing missiles, while upgrading the second simply increases the effectiveness of the beam, which becomes capable of eliminating even the largest enemies in seconds. Unlike many titles of the same genre, in Aircraft Gear we won't have to fear the blows of enemies too much: our plane is equipped with its own energy bar, capable of withstanding various attacks and which can be restored by collecting objects . When we find ourselves in a corner, however, we will be able to press the 0 key on the numeric pad to resort to a smart bomb, which cleans the screen from simple opponents and manages to significantly damage even the bosses. Four settings correspond precisely to four great end-of-level opponents, who, as per tradition, literally fill the screen with bullets and energy beams in an attempt to hit us. Before meeting them, however, we will find ourselves facing hundreds of vehicles that act in groups, following pre-established and quite predictable patterns, but characterized by a sufficient variety in appearance and characteristics. The technical realization of the game contrasts a good design work on vehicles and bosses, albeit without shining, with at least questionable color choices. The first level, in particular, sees the presence of a background and some enemies of almost the same color, which are difficult to distinguish. In general, the backdrops are the weak point of Aircraft Gear, as they consist of patterns that repeat themselves too suddenly, really giving the impression of being faced with an amateur production. The sound sector is very ~Amiga style~, with finally catchy and well done MIDIs, which effectively accompany the action and make up for the lack of sound effects. As far as the control system is concerned, we can move the plane using the joystick, change weapons with the # key and use the smart bomb with the 0 key. It's all very immediate and simple, even if in some cases there are some hitches in the response to commands.
