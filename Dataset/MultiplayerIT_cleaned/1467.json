{"name": "Dino Crisis 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dino-crisis-7.html", "text": "Put a Tyrannosaurus in the hold... As you all know by now, Dino Crisis saw its beginnings on Playstation as an alternative to the Biohazard/Resident Evil saga. Immediately branded as a ~KING with dinosaurs instead of zombies~, the Capcom project drew heavily on Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park, filtering it with the typical canons of survival horror. However, there was no shortage of technical revolutions, given that an attempt was made to develop a completely polygonal engine, the value of which was however significantly reduced by a cinematographic setting that followed the fixed shots of RE. The hardware of the console also did not prove to be totally up to the situation, with excessively bare settings. Perhaps precisely for this reason, the sequel represented a step backwards, with the return to pre-rendered scenarios and a general setting more focused on action. This third exclusive chapter was a good opportunity to glorify the partnership between the talent of the Capcom coders and the indisputable technical potential of the Microsoft console, but something definitely went wrong. First of all, the plot has undergone a bizarre upheaval, moving the action to an unspecified, science fiction future, and eliminating the historical protagonist, the redheaded and attractive Regina. The spotlights are this time focused on a team of space-marines in charge of investigating a gigantic vessel headed towards the earth. Since bad luck is always around the corner (as the RE Alpha team teaches), following an attack our people are forced to enter the sinister space vessel, destined to reveal its mysteries. So far so good, and the phantasmagorical cuts (among the best ever seen) help to identify with the story. You breathe the atmosphere of the aforementioned Alien, but also of videogame classics such as Project Firestart by Electronic Arts. But it only takes a few minutes of play to discover the ship haunted by none other than hungry dinosaurs (!!!). There wasn't much else to expect considering the precedents and the title, but the combination is so geeky that it really verges on involuntary ridicule. Clapperboard... Action! The mature and optimistic user is able to look beyond these aspects, especially if they are balanced by valuable playability. But we can't rejoice from this point of view either, soon a seriously incomplete gameplay is added to the killing of the atmosphere. To overcome the high offensive power of the voracious reptiles (fast, lethal and fairly intelligent) the programmers have rather markedly modified the game mechanics, equipping the character with a dorsal jetpak integrated into the suit, which allows physically unthinkable leaps. In addition to this, the war paraphernalia has been enhanced, which includes a Metroid-style charge beam submachine gun, plus numerous offensive support trinkets. The predisposition to the shooter is therefore obvious, but especially to the platform thanks to the skills conferred by the Jetpak. In relation to this, the level design develops along huge rooms and corridors, full of apparently unreachable platforms. There would be reasons of interest, for a whole series of winks at famous titles, not least Metroid. However, everything is mortified by the usual system of shots still obtusely linked to a filmic conception, but which in this case is completely out of place and not at all facilitated by the screen relative control system. The camera is preset and fast-changing, with an unfortunate tendency to shoot the character head-on, making basic actions such as locating the enemy or a crucial platform almost impossible. It is easy to lose one's sense of direction, and the only way to understand something is to use the subjective point of view. However, the latter is totally unusable in fights, which require immediate and rapid action, forcing the player to scurry furiously around the screen in an attempt to ward off the attacks. Frustrating to say the least, and not even an above average puzzle design plus a few interesting bosses manage to lift the fortunes of a decidedly bad born title. Then the respawn of the dinosaurs is very annoying, appearing out of nowhere in honor of the more prehistoric (staying on the subject) action games, and which can be evaded simply by leaving the room. A metallic world The only aspect in which the title has shown us its qualities is from a technical point of view. The cut-scenes as already mentioned are of excellent workmanship, sviluppando a story worthy of interest, albeit canonical, with the usual survivors to protect and the biogenetic disasters to which Capcom has accustomed us. In game the graphics are much more moderate, with a polygon count that is certainly not breathtaking, but decent, a sufficiently fluid framerate and metallic settings that well convey the idea of a futuristic cargo. The translucent effect on walls and objects is used excessively, giving the sensation of aseptic metal which is soon annoying, considering the general monotony of the settings. Ultimately, even if there are no fatal style drops, it was reasonable to expect something more, especially considering the graphics capabilities of the Xbox. The sound accompaniment is only medium and of variable quality, with the usual mix of ambient tracks in the exploratory moments, which culminate in frenetic sessions in conjunction with the encounters with the beasts. Comment Dino Crisis 3 represents a double disappointment, not only for a saga that has now lost its compass, but also because it comes from the same house that gave us jewels like Viewtiful Joe. The potential for an excellent title is drowned out by a plot that is a euphemism to define weird (a habit destined to persist in the next Onimusha 3), a gameplay seriously undermined by the bad camera system, and a whole series of confused winks at the great classics, without ever touching its depths. A mediocre, boring and atavistic game, which represents little more than an excuse to admire the Capcom brand on the Microsoft console. But its users definitely deserved more. Pros: Graphically decent In certain situations there is no shortage of atmosphere Splendid cut scenes Cons: Impossible framing system Ridiculous plot Frustrating and boring The year was 1979. The slogan of Ridley Scott's revolutionary Alien thundered ominously: ~In deep space, no one will hear you scream~. Updating it today to the latest Capcom effort we could change it to: The cries of the hapless Dino Crisis 3 buyer can hear even the neighborhood! All this to anticipate the questionable value of the latest exponent of a saga that has taken on problematic implications, to say the least, but let's start from the beginning...", "date": "2003-12-01", "grade": null}
