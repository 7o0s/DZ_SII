When a game unknowingly becomes a spiritual model for its other similar futures, something in the intimate video game must have left it by force and it is undeniable how Dark Souls has been a source of inspiration for many. The creator of Oblitus is called Connor Ullmann, he is American, he is 22 years old and has a great talent in development; moreover, he is ambitious and definitely intends to be talked about again in the future. Well, the moral of the story is that despite the two-dimensional matrix, Oblitus definitely belongs to the Souls-like genre and Ullmann is a huge fan of the From Software saga. Alchemy gives a title with undeniable flaws but with a heart and courage that make the sum of its individual parts count. We're reviewing it today, more than a month after its release on Steam, and the reason is obvious: the original code suffered from serious problems on release that made it necessary to undergo immense post-launch refinement work. We do not hide a certain underlying annoyance for the now usual fashion of launching games that are not ready but Ullmann - honor to credit - has always been present in the dozens of open threads, responding with humility and interest. After all, it's still his game. Arrives on Steam Oblitus, 2D platformer with Dark Souls in mind: good ideas, but just as many flaws Throw the spear The playful matrix of Oblitus is rather spartan: an important roguelike part blends into a two-dimensional system with static levels. We're not just talking about the level design of specific sections: Ullmann has chosen to throw the upgrades obtainable in the current session into the cauldron of randomness, mixing the cards on the table to intelligently get rid of the hindrance of all the typical RPG progress . With each attempt, the amount of collectibles is therefore different, opening the doors to the obvious and by now abused concept according to which each game is different from the previous one. Real? Absolutely yes. But is it a worthwhile choice? Frankly, only partially. As in Souls, death is the beating heart of Oblitus, even if Ullmann has an approach once again justified by the production values which, although high, visibly fall within the sphere of the indie world. In Oblitus, every time you die you start over, with no upgrades or experience. Have you just defeated one of the four area bosses but died soon after? All to be redone. The idea behind it has an arcade aftertaste that can fascinate, the problem is that Oblitus is enriched by many small defects that make death something that doesn't always depend on the player. With the result that with each session - even those in which mistakes have actually been made - the frustration increases, causing the curve of interest in trying one's luck again to gradually decrease. Dying to discover the mistake is the beauty of Souls; what makes this paradox such is From Software's ability to weave every angle, enemy and attack pattern with the expertise of those who created the genre. It is precisely the abyss that separates the ambition of the projects that makes Oblitus a title that would like - and could - be much more if only it gets rid of certain punitive traits that block it to the ground. I got you? Ullmann's title makes a spear his only weapon; you can hit here and there by piercing the air, or throw it, certain that as if by magic within a few seconds it will be back in your possession. Jumping and somersaulting cannot be missing, of course, as well as a response to commands that is precise and responsive. On paper Oblitus has everything it takes to shine, the problem lies in the management of collisions. Souls have a formidable advantage: using the three dimensions as a tool for studying frames and polygons to ensure that each fight is the ideal combination of technique and ability in reading the enemy's movements, in the hope of thus providing all the elements to move, evaluate and hit. A slow and sometimes cumbersome, but honest approach. Oblitus is more frenetic, clearly more alluring towards the platformers of the old Japanese school and therefore less inclined to the technicalities of the pad that would be so useful in such a product. It is the proximity combat that is the main problem of the game: there is no clarity in the collisions nor in the frames of movement and attack of the enemy. The feedback is therefore not very galvanizing and deliberately caged by the uniqueness of the weapon and the attacks available. Let's also add the fact that in almost all situations what you can do in the beginning you will be able to do in the end, therefore without a focus on learning new styles of play and fighting thatmore suited to your needs. The game provides a shield, plus every enemy killed grants a modicum of life recovery, the thing is, you won't even notice it. When they hit you, however, you will realize it all right, since Oblitus remains a product with a difficult and merciless DNA. Open your ears Precisely because of its difficulty, we would have appreciated greater care for collisions and exchanges of blows. Assuming that the standard enemies will enrich the death stat, the ground on which Oblitus is founded is more fragile than expected. Truly a pity: recognizing the obvious needs of an indie developer, we don't feel like sticking our finger in the wound more than necessary, but where understanding ends, the annoyance begins to see what with more funds and staff could aspire to be a real own pearl of the independent panorama. To stay on the subject, however, let's break a spear in favor of the stylistic choice: the graphic stroke of Oblitus is pleasant and inspired on an artistic level, helped by an apt chromatic choice. However, Ullmann had to pay more attention to the management of parallaxes: in fact, it is not always clear whether the element or platform on which we are jumping is actually usable or if it is instead part of the background and as such does not exist in practice. You will think about these words not so much at the beginning, but as you progress through the adventure; the ~trial&error~ therefore also extends to mere level design, not always clear in the visual offer and therefore a hidden and unexpected trap. The sound sector, on the other hand, deserves a thumbs up: minimalist and filled with powerful basses, the title pleases the hearing with a mixture of dark ambient tracks and in line with the climate of omnipresent tension.", "date": "2015-04-03", "grade": "7.0"}
