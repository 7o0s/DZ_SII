A year that actually began in a somewhat turbulent way after the arrival of the new Demon Hunter class, greeted by all with enthusiasm but accompanied by major balancing problems in the weeks following its debut. The members of Team 5 were therefore forced to intervene several times with the nerfs to stem the excessive strength of some cards, bringing some order back to the meta stormed by Illidan Stormrage. An experience that according to game designers Alec Dawson and Dave Kosak has made developers want to be more proactive in managing the meta, to avoid similar problems in the future. The common hope of all is obviously that when it happens after Ashes of Outland it won't have to happen again for Scholomance Academy, or at least that there may be only some small physiological adjustments in order to preserve the fun of Hearthstone from the first days of life of the expansion. Exactly one week after the new group of cards from The Academy of Scholomance arrived on the square, let's go and see how Hearthstone has changed with the first decks that appeared after the collective unveiling that took place on August 6th. The news of the expansion As has become tradition for all Hearthstone expansions, Scholomance Academy introduces one hundred and thirty-five new cards into the game. The idea behind this new set collects the setting of the popular World of Warcraft dungeon, Scholomance, before it became the cursed place home of the wizard Kel'Thuzad turned lich. It is therefore a real school of magic, populated by more or less dutiful students dealing with magic of all kinds. Compared to Ceneri delle Terre Esterne, L'Accademia di Scholomance therefore presents itself with a lighter and more witty tone. A contrast expressly desired by Blizzard, to give the new cards a more playful cut than the serious Demon Hunter.As regards the game dynamics, in theory the biggest novelty introduced by The Academy of Scholomance is the presence of some bi -class. As we have already seen a few weeks ago, these are cards that can be used in decks of two different classes, such as the Thief of Wands. This can be used by both the Rogue and the Mage, merging the dynamic combo of the first class to activate the chance to recover a spell of the second, thus giving Valeera the possibility of obtaining a spell of Jaina during a match. While dual-class cards undoubtedly add a touch of unpredictability to any game, it was the Studios that impressed us most favorably. In this case we are talking about spells with a mana cost of one, thanks to which it is possible to find a card of a certain type, reducing the mana cost of the card of the same type that we are going to play later. Even if it seems like an unsuccessful tongue twister to write it, in reality the functioning of the Studies is simple and adds to the various decks that can make use of them some very interesting interaction dynamics. The most popular Study-type card we've seen these days is the Studies on the Primordi of Wizard and Shaman, which allows you to find a minion with Magic Damage. Studies on Warrior Athletics with the possibility of finding a minion with Assault also seemed quite interesting to us, but we do not exclude that with the evolution of the meta, other cards of this type may also find their place. The latest addition to the cards is the new Magic Surge ability. By playing a minion who carries this keyword, after casting a spell it is possible to make him earn a personalized bonus. However, this bonus is linked to a single spell, so even casting more than one does not result in any accumulation. By placing the combo at the right time, the Magical Impulse can give the player the boost he needs, but in practice this novelty of The Academy of Scholomance presents itself in our opinion as the least appetizing of the package. The meta and the new cards While on the one hand a week is still too little to fully evaluate the impact of any expansion on the Hearthstone meta, on the other hand it is a sufficient interval of time to at least get an idea of what we will see in the coming months unless and its twists and turns. At the time of writing, the impressions provided by L'Accademia di Scholomance are undoubtedly positive. Notably, the meta feels real right nownte full of alternatives, with several new options both in terms of archetypes and for the classes that populate Hearthstone. First of all, we note the achievement of full maturity by the Libram Paladin, which is greatly enriched thanks to the arrival of cards such as the First Day of School (two random minions from a zero-cost mana crystal), Blessing of Authority (+8/ +8 to a minion, but can't attack the opposing hero in the same turn) and more. Immediately behind the Paladin we find the Magician, certainly the class that currently benefits most from the novelties of the Scholomance Academy in terms of variety of decks present. If the Highlander Mage is always hard to die, the Spell Damage Mage has also asserted itself with arrogance thanks to the characteristics of the expansion, which with the presence of low-cost spells and randomly generated cards go perfectly with other cards already present such as Chenvaala and Mana Giant. Among the decks linked to Galakrond, that of the Sorcerer is the most popular, enriched with the new expansion of the dynamics linked to Soul Fragments (in common with the Demon Hunter) usable both for healing and for inflicting damage. While there are already those who are clamoring for the Guardian Druid nerf, we have to say that the speed of the current meta makes this deck particularly lethal only when the drawn cards really spin in the right way. we brought up the other classes doesn't mean that there aren't interesting alternatives for them too, effectively making the current Hearthstone meta an open construction site with a lot of potential. The side effect of all this is represented by the amount of dust required to create any missing cards after the initial bagging: as far as we are concerned, after the generous package related to the preorder we had to integrate the bags with a further addition of packages purchased to try a bit of everything that interested us among the first decks that came out. Today more than ever, it is therefore worth carefully evaluating how you spend your resources.", "date": "2020-08-13", "grade": "8.0"}
