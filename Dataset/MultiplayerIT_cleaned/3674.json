It is interesting, for those who have lived through the whole saga, to retrace its origins and understand how certain ideas and mechanics were introduced for the first time, see for example the extremely painful X-ray kill cams which illustrate in great detail the path taken by our bullets when they impact with the German soldiers, piercing their skeletal structure and internal organs in a way that is as crude as it is spectacular. In the same way, of course, trying your hand at the Sniper Elite V2 campaign again highlights the limits of an experience which in fact hasn't changed very much, which has been feeling the weight of the years for some time now and lives in the hope of a qualitative step in progress which has not yet been accomplished. History and approach As mentioned in the opening, Sniper Elite V2 Remastered tells the story of Karl Fairburne, elite soldier engaged in a seemingly impossible mission: to infiltrate the devastated Berlin of the final stages of the Second World War to obtain documents relating to a technology that could give the Nazis a last chance to win. The engineers working for the Fuhrer have in fact developed a series of sophisticated missiles with very wide range, the launch of which could reap numerous victims among the countries of the alliance, making the conflict even more bloody than it already was. The campaign consists of eleven increasingly complex missions, to which three DLCs with extra tasks are added in this remastered edition, one of which will see us intent on eliminating none other than Adolf Hitler. The total duration of the experience is expected to be around ten hours, proceeding without hesitation, in line with this type of production, but the structure of watertight compartments reveals an old-gen connotation right from the start, surpassed in the last few episodes of the franchise by a very freer and more airy. In fact, what the game offers is a series of situations that often refer to trial & error, given that the stealth setting admits very few errors: let the enemy soldiers discover you and you will quickly be surrounded, without the possibility of defending yourself much due to the continuing shortage of ammunition. In short, that is not the way to proceed: you have to plan your actions carefully, open fire with the sniper rifle only when an ambient noise covers the sound of the shot and use the silenced pistol or the knife when you are close enough to the guards. Gameplay and structure The approach used by Rebellion for Sniper Elite V2 Remastered therefore does not in any way distance itself from the original edition, proposing also in this case a fairly demanding challenge which however is placed in the context of a very linear and controlled progression. The developers have tried to enrich these aspects of the experience later, for example in Sniper Elite 3 it was possible to create your own diversions while in Sniper Elite 4 you could move and approach the missions in a different way, therefore playing with this remaster you have to force of things the feeling of taking a couple of substantial steps back in terms of gameplay and level design, which is also quite limited. However, the shooting remains solid when holding the sniper rifle, using the breath bar to stabilize the aim and giving life to the X-ray sequences we have already mentioned. Definitely less brilliant and often imprecise is the use of the silenced pistol and above all of the machine gun, which must be activated with short bursts so as not to immediately lose effectiveness and waste the few available bullets. The equipment naturally includes some classic pieces for the series, such as the standard grenades, dynamite to be detonated with a targeted shot and stumbling mines, perfect for setting traps for soldiers who are about to approach our position. However, there are still big problems with the artificial intelligence of the enemies, which often do not detect our presence even if we are stationed a few centimeters from their backs: they perform a discreet task as silhouettes to be shot from a distance, ingeniously changing their position and responding to fire, but close combat managementleaves a lot to be desired. Playstation 4 trophies Sniper Elite V2 Remastered includes the beauty of forty-eight Trophies, distributed between the base campaign and the DLCs included in the package. Most of the achievements revolve around performing specific actions: silently killing a certain number of enemies, landing a long-range shot, destroying specific body parts, and so on. Then there are clearly the Trophies that are obtained simply by progressing in the campaign and completing the missions that make it up. Technical realization As underlined in the test of Sniper Elite V2 Remastered, Rebellion has done an excellent job in terms of remastering, which finds in particular on PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X (as well as, obviously, on PC) an extra dimension represented by the option to enhance resolution or performance. In the first case the game runs at real 4K and 30 frames per second, but the frame pacing does little justice to this solution and gives the experience a general feeling of jerkiness that does not go well with the precision required by the gunplay. Therefore, it is better to visibly give up some details and switch to 60 frames per second, which appear rather stable and give the game an edge, while reducing the charm of certain landscapes. In fact, it is the scenarios that benefit most from the graphic improvements, ranging from the replacement of the textures to the enhancement of the effects: the comparison with the original edition clearly highlights the differences, which however become more nuanced when you go to analyze the polygonal models of the characters, inevitably dated for angularity and animations. The sound sector takes up the good old dubbing in Italian, seasoning it with the now classic soundtrack of the series.", "date": "2019-05-13", "grade": "6.5"}
