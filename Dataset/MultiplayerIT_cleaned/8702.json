Among the games in the initial PlayStation Vita lineup, this role was certainly played by Little Deviants, a nice compilation of mini-games based above all on the peculiar control systems of the handheld that did not fully convince us, showing its side several times with imprecise controls and minigames that are more frustrating than fun. With Frobisher Says! the developer Honeyslug tries again to propose the same concept, but in its own way. The result is a very entertaining compilation that takes full advantage of the PlayStation Vita features with hilarious microgames to say the least. Easier said... ~Frobisher says...~ is the catchphrase with which each of the more than fifty mini-games invented by those lunatics of Honeyslug begins. Frobisher is an absurd little character with a round face and triangular nose, bow tie and protruding ears, who will have no problem insulting us or commenting in absurd ways on the minigames themselves and our performance. Dubbed entirely in Italian, Frobisher's wacky voice will briefly suggest the goal of each minigame, while a small animated icon at the bottom right will explain in its own way how to behave in every situation. Unfortunately, the visual instructions are often unclear or misleading; in reality there is an icon for each type of ~control~ that we will have to exercise on the console: if the screen of the small PlayStation Vita shown flashes it means that we will have to touch it, if instead it is the rear touch-pad that lights up it means that it is precisely what we will have to use. The problem is understanding how to use it: is a single press on the screen enough or do you have to move your finger from one point to another? The instructions aren't very clear and the absurdity of the various minigames involves a certain amount of ~trial & error~ in order to assimilate the various challenges to learn how to complete them as quickly as possible. For this purpose, the ~Fixed length~ mode helps us, which precisely has a dual objective: it allows us to train with the various games that will be offered to us in sequence and to score points based on the speed with which we solve them, points which can then be loaded onto a leaderbord and which will allow us to unlock even more challenges. The ~Fixed length~ mode is contrasted by the ~Instant death~ mode, which is far more difficult and at times even a little frustrating: in this case the mini-games will be offered to us in the duration of a handful of seconds each and it is enough to fail once for finish the game. It is essentially a ~survival~ mode in which the player must complete as many challenges as possible without ever losing. Each mode can only be tackled locally by up to eight players, who in practice will pass the Sony console from turn to turn. It's not exactly a practical solution, but it's certainly fun if you play with a group of friends or relatives. PSVita trophies It is currently not possible to unlock Trophies in Frobisher Says! but it would appear that Honeyslug is seriously considering adding them in the future. ... what to do! But what exactly are the Frobisher Says mini-games! and what is so special about them? Well, imagine that women and badgers (yes, badgers) in bikinis parade in rapid succession in front of you: your job is to wink (yes, wink) only at the women, and avoid doing it with the badgers. In another minigame we will have to smile at the PlayStation Vita camera while it takes a picture of us; in yet another we will have to look nearby for an object of the color indicated by Frobisher and frame it with the external camera. Such eccentric and original mini-games alternate with other slightly more traditional challenges, such as for example the one that will ask us to press some random keys in the right order to load a powerful laser cannon or a simple boxing match that we will have to fight by pressing the lats and the left analog stick. Between short levels that recall platformers and scrolling shooters and ~sound~ mini-games that challenge us to find the correct frequency of a radio, there really is something for everyone. Most importantly, the challenges are all extremely short and lend themselves to quick and fun sessions of just a few minutes. Frobisher Says! takes advantage of practically every feature of PlayStation Vita: in addition to the already mentioned camera-based games, there are numerous that rely on the accelerometer, for example those in which we will have to shake the console to wave a fan or shake it to deleft and right to ring a bell and wake up a village, or to the microphone or rear touch-pad. The minigames based on augmented reality are also inevitable, even if not among the most incisive. The challenges denote enormous creativity and are proposed with colorful graphics, framed by cheerful whistles and tunes. There is nothing particularly complex, there are no polygons or amazing special effects: Frobisher Says! it is made entirely in 2D and if the style at first may be a bit grotesque, it is certainly full of imagination and originality.", "date": "2012-03-03", "grade": "8.3"}
