{"name": "Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-2.html", "text": "When the game is hard... Inserting the S2 cartridge into the GBA was for me an event I hadn't foreseen, so imagine my emotion when I was able to hold a piece of history in my hands, I thought I would have been very satisfied with the game (let's call it conversion), but instead ... Speedball is a bloody game where only the strongest wins, two teams made up of nine elements (plus three reserves) face off in a metal arena in a sort of handball where, however, the ball is made of steel, the players are all artificially enhanced and the playing field is full of strange devices and bonuses that can decisively favor victory. In the Year of Grace 2100 this 'sport' is the only one legally recognized. As players we will be able to choose between different game modes. We have the Quick Start, in which to challenge any of the available opposing teams, the K-O, in which to face all the teams that the computer will choose for us (by winning we will make these teams selectable in the Quick Start). Then there are the Cup, which is a four-round knockout tournament, and the Championship, where you start from the last position in Serie B and you have to finish first in Serie A, over twenty-eight matches. In each game mode we will control the Brutal Deluxe, rookie team and therefore very weak. While in the Quick Start we are immediately catapulted into the arena, in the other three modes we will have access to an appropriate screen through which to buy and sell players or train them in our gym to enhance their skills (which are divided into numerous classes); all this has a cost and the only way to adequately finance us is to win. Now is the time to take the field. The action is fast, violent and varied. Not necessarily to win we will have to score into the opponent's goal, but by causing fouls (obviously not sanctioned), turning on particular score multipliers and collecting temporary power-ups randomly scattered on the field, our final score could still be a winner. Especially at the beginning, when overcoming the defense and its guardian will seem impossible, resorting to an alternative strategy could be the best choice. However, as in the best tradition of the Bitmap Brothers, as the difficulty level progresses it will reach a considerable infamy that very few will be able to keep up with. ...The tough guys don't play anymore However, my emotion (which I told you about a few lines above) soon gave way to discouragement: in the first hours of the game it was impossible for me to win any match, having to face both an exaggerated level of difficulty (for the beginning) and the controls at first impractical. So imagine my disappointment. The idea of nipping the game was already flashing through my mind and now (after many more hours of practice) I find myself rewriting a large part of the review that I had written more as a vent than a vocation. What immediately leaves you flabbergasted is the total absence of any tutorial that instructs you on the game, but in a production of over ten years ago this was normal and therefore an acceptable sin, however a very troubled learning follows. The opponents don't care much that we are newbies and will give us sound lessons in the game while we will still be trying to assimilate the simple yet complex control system. The fulcrum of the action is the omni-functional A key, in fact with it we will carry out shots, passes, slides, tackles and interceptions (on the shots of our teammates and opponents), furthermore the more prolonged its pressure, the more energetic the maneuver will be. The B key is limited to ~cancel~ in the game menus, while I would have preferred to devolve some functions to him even in the arena. It will happen at the beginning that in the improbable attempt to score any score, we will wander disorderly around the pitch by pressing the A button like madmen, without the slightest lucidity, we will be so confused; in these circumstances, having discriminated against some actions between A and B would certainly have been convenient. But, after a better considered analysis, I believe that assigning each task to A was the best choice: with a little practice (and a lot of stubbornness) we will be able to use it with the utmost precision as it was conceived, i.e. capable of offering the immediacy as possible. The L or R shoulder straps should allow players to run, but I don't think I've seen any speed boosts yet, bha!! However, the real sore point of the controls turns out to be cdirectional rock, absolutely incapable of managing the movements in a streamlined and precise way, however the demerit does not go to Crawfish Interactive (author of the GBA port) as much as to Nintendo itself which could have opted for a real eight-way cross, if not even a small stick (I don't think it would have cost more) when he designed his new handheld. Just as the feat of performing a spin shot and simply weakening the diagonal movement is practically titanic, soon the phalanxes of the left thumb will ask for a truce! Continuing in the wake of the defects, I could add that another reason for discouragement is the chronic lack of our players on the displayed playing area, there seems to be no way to quickly recall them towards the ball when it is in opponents' hands or abandoned on the ground and if our they are controlled by the computer they always keep away from them. Attempting a slide intervention is extremely risky: if we miss the target, our player will continue to slide for a long time before the computer assigns us a new one to check. Disheartening. Finally, I would still like to congratulate you on the excellent artificial intelligence demonstrated by your opponents. Each team has different values for each characteristic of the players and of the various compartments and so each one applies a particular game tactic. In fact, we will see breakthrough midfields aiming straight at goal by relying on their aggressiveness and brute strength, others less handsome pretending or waiting for us to let their teammates filter the ball, dribble and score. All this is good for the show and the complexity of the game, which, I repeat, at the beginning can dishearten many. However, it will often happen to face less irresistible teams than the previous ones, which is very welcome to easily recover money and ease tension, especially in the left thumb ;-) . summing up Speedball 2 for GBA has remained the same as the original: same unmistakable graphic style, same captivating sound accompaniment, same complex playability. Nothing new has therefore been added to this latest entry and while many of us who loved the original might enjoy it, many probably wouldn't love interfacing with the GBA. With the controls made available we will often find ourselves, especially at the beginning, wandering in a rambling manner on the pitch, pressing the multifunctional A key like madmen in a desperate search to score some points or to knock out the very fierce opponents. Therefore, every attempt to strategize fails and not even a 'head down and go' approach is paid off, only by persevering and accepting the initial humiliations will it be possible to gain the experience necessary to win and discover the fun inherent in the game. Measuring each maneuver is of vital importance, it almost seems to be faced with a puzzle game rather than an action one. Of course the Game Boy Advance takes its to oppress us: the dark and metallic colors chosen by the graphics do not blend well with the darkness pervading the LCD screen of the machine and only in summer, under the scorching midday sun could we perhaps have a clear vision . The little d-pad (and I'll never get tired of saying it) is really the most terrible thing that can exist to deal with certain genres of video games. One would think that certain emotions would be better left to our memories instead of resurrecting them and risking being disappointed. summing up Pros: Outdated graphics, but still fascinating Pleasant music and sound effects Two-player mode with both one and two cartridges Completely in Italian Who does not give up is adequately repaid by an admirable gameplay Longevity ensured by numerous game modes ... Cons: ...and from a high level of difficulty Controls that are not immediately learned In the long run repetitive The GBA once again shows its realization flaws (it's too mini!!) Dissertations on the time that was After so many years (10/12) rediscovering a game like Speedball 2, now for Game Boy Advance, reminded me how at the time when the original was released on Amiga and PC we had fun with those few titles that came out from time to time and that, without exception, they were all of considerable thickness. Speedball 2 belongs to an era, a time when every video game enthusiast knew every title released and being released and could even afford to own them all (not because they were cheap, but precisely because of the reduced annual releases). In short, a situation that is far removed from the pace and current market offerings. Speedball 2 was one of the best, most famous titlesand played by the Bitmap Brothers, historic team of brilliant and prolific developers up to a decade ago, together with the excellent Gods and the never too much praised Xenon 2: Megablast (yes, I admit it, I can still play a little game every now and then .. .). Then came Z, Z2 and the recent Speedball Arena, but clearly the verve of the glorious past was weakened, also crushed by a market that has now incredibly changed and disrespectful even of those who have strongly contributed to its own development (who said SEGA?!), so today the name of the Bitmap Brothers echoes only in the minds of the most mature hardcore gamers. Such a pity. Therefore, I advise anyone to do a search to recover any of the titles listed above, they will live a unique experience, perhaps never equaled in some respects (the unmistakable graphic style is something that still fascinates and conquers at first glance).", "date": "2002-10-23", "grade": null}
