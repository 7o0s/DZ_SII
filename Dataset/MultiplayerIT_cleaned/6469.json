The guy, Kouichi Inui, out of gratitude and moved to pity by him, offers him a job and accommodation in his bar. In reality, the bar is just a front for a private agency that deals with cases that the police can't solve. The protagonist will obtain the code name ~Haru~ and will slowly enter the most secret mechanisms of the agency, starting however from the role of apprentice bartender. Part of the cast This is broadly the plot of No, Thank You!!!, an erotic visual novel developed by Parade and distributed in the West by MangaGamer. As you will have understood by looking at the images, the protagonists are homosexuals. Don't make those faces. Imagine that the Japanese use a specific name to define similar works: ~bara~. Visual novels with ~bara~ content should not be confused with ~yaoi~ ones, the latter created specifically for a female audience. It is true that both genres tell love stories between men, but the ~bara~ visual novels have an approach to homosexuality more linked to gay erotic stereotypes, and have as protagonists completely hairless or with different levels of body hair, in honor to public tastes. Having said that, don't think that these are B-series products, because indeed they seem to have a large following, to the point that a work like No, Thank You!!! seems to be comparable to the best heterosexual erotic visual novels, both in terms of drawings and options. Indeed, to be honest, it also has a few more options than the competition, with some truly specific ones such as the possibility of deciding how and where to make the protagonist ejaculate, how many hairs the characters must have, and many others linked to the personalization of use such as the possibility to remove subtitles from dialogues or to change the size and scrolling speed of the text. How to find it? no thank you!!! it can only be purchased from the official website of the publisher, MangaGamer, for the beauty of $39.95. We do not provide you with a link because it is a work with pornographic content, some of which is shown on the store page. However, if you want to find it, all you need is a quick search on any search engine. We have reviewed for you No, Thank You!!!, the ~coffin~ visual novel that has recently arrived in the West First-rate manufacturing At this point it also seems silly to point out that it is obvious that you have to have a certain sexual orientation in order to really appreciate No, Thank You!!! Moreover, you have to be of age because it has highly erotic scenes, indeed, really pornographic, cleaned up from the classic mosaic, mandatory in Japan. Others may take this review as a way to add to their visual novel culture. In truth, enthusiasts of the genre are usually open and tolerant people, who have few problems with the contents, admitting titles suitable for any sexual orientation. But let's go back to No, Thank You!!!. Moments of seduction As we said, it is a title that is very full of options and also of choices to be made, usually linked to the men with whom you want to have a love story. In addition to the classic crossroads that ask us to decide what to do to continue the story, the ~No, Thank You!!!~ button appears from time to time at the top of the screen, which must be pressed to resolve some situations. If you don't do it, you risk putting an end to the narrative in a brutal way, witnessing one of the negative endings. The plot itself is a hodgepodge of clichs that leave a little the time they find, although the richness of the cast, really large, and the length of the game compensate for the situation. Also noteworthy is the quality of the drawings and the quantity of places that will be visited in the course of history, with values that go far beyond those of the visual novel media (especially the western ones). The soundtrack is also very accurate, made up of well-played and strongly evocative accompanying songs. In short, it is a first-rate title, also equipped with super deformed animated microsequences designed to underline some moments of the narrative, giving it breathing space and adding a touch of variety which in some cases does not hurt.", "date": "2015-03-23", "grade": "7.8"}
