{"name": "Driver 76 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driver-76-recensione.html", "text": "The GTA emulator The adventure, from the classic ~3-D guide/exploration~ scheme, is divided into six chapters, each of which is introduced by very spot-on videos and which take up the theme of American comics. Within each of them the gamer is called upon to complete a whole series of illicit missions ranging from the stalking of an individual disliked by the mafia to robberies complete with a car chase against cash vans, from the theft of car in the escort of some boss. Nothing that hasn't already been seen before, in short. In some cases, then, a time limit will establish the period within which to complete a ~job~, making the game session a little more difficult. What has been said up to now could lead one to believe that this Driver 76 is all roses, but in reality it is not so, unfortunately. Due to some programming and development errors, in fact, the playability itself on balance turns out to be below expectations. While on the one hand we have a differentiated and realistic driving model of the cars depending on the vehicle available (motorcycle, truck, car), on the other hand there are limitations that partially ruin the gaming experience. The walking sessions and the free exploration of the neighborhoods, for example, are rather limited: the characters cannot jump or run, and during the firefights we will witness moments of absolute panic when we discover that to shoot down an enemy it will be necessary to empty the entire magazine of a weapon, not even the enemies were Terminators Even the AI of the police often leaves something to be desired. The agents, in fact, seem to have a double personality between an insane indifference and excessive severity, given that sometimes they will intervene decisively for the simple and short-term exceeding of the speed limit in an area, others will stay perfectly calm even if the gamer destroys half a neighborhood Multiplayer However, the multiplayer is different, which includes different game modes such as Street Racing, Destruction Derby, Pink Slip Racing and Swap Meet in which to challenge each other locally with friends. This element significantly raises the positive final judgment on the Ubisoft title. It will also be possible to download new decals for your cars. Graphically Driver '76 turns out to be a fairly good product, despite everything. The districts of the city, even if not very rich in details and with few people on the streets, are well reconstructed and the car models faithfully reflect those of the time, even managing to exalt the most fanatical video gamer with carefully customized details as you unlock new items and accessories. On the other hand, the polygonal models of the characters are ugly, a little rough, with some rather evident drops in frame rate during the more chaotic phases. On the other hand, the sound is splendid, certainly one of the best ever in the sector, with the beautiful music of the 70s (from David Bowie to Iggy Pop, other songs are downloadable) as a soundtrack to the actions of the protagonists, and a dubbing entirely in Italian with lots of well-maintained dialogues worthy of a film. Conclusions The imposing shadow of Grand Theft Auto inevitably stretches over all the titles inspired by it. And almost always they are pains for others. Driver 76 does not escape the ~law~ (just to stay on the criminal theme) of the Rock Star Games title and while defending itself at times with honor, it has to give way to the most illustrious rival. In fact, the Ubisoft game is not too bad, imperfections aside, and indeed in the driving phases it manages to be pleasant and satisfying. However, a certain repetitiveness of the action and some technical limitations make Driver 76 one of those hybrid titles, halfway between ~beautiful~ and ~could have been done better~. Pros: Good reconstruction of the different driving systems of the vehicles. Gorgeous soundtrack. Great variety of means. Cons: Limited walking section. Side missions a little too repetitive. Level design not always inspired. Police AI to be reviewed. A few years ago, at the end of the ~mythical~ '90s, when GTA was still a title with two-dimensional graphics, a software house offered the Psx general public a game that was inspired by RockStar Games production, but with some slight modifications and above all, a three-dimensional engine that gamers liked so much. His name? Drivers. In the following years, however, while Grand Theft Auto made great strides turning into a real saga, the Atari and Reflections Interactive title was unable to repeat itself, evolve, consequently becoming a secondary product for most. Now, a year after Driver: Parallel Lines (Playstation 2, Xbox, Wii) the series, passed into the hands of Ubisoft who has acquired itI sell the rights, try the relaunch and make its debut on the PSP with this prequel/sequel entitled Driver '76. Also this time, therefore, the protagonists of the story will be the likeable Slink and Ray, in New York in the 70s, busy as always among beautiful women and roaring cars. Just the passion of the two friends for the former will create some problems for them. Ray, in fact, falls in love with the daughter of a boss of the Chinese Triad, Chen-Chi, and to win the sympathy of the ferocious father, a certain Zhou, decides to enter the circle of great crime with his usual companion.", "date": "2007-07-05", "grade": null}
