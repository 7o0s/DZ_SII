Created by a team of three people, it was born from a small Kickstarter campaign launched in 2011. The money raised was just enough to start the development, pay for the licenses of the software used by the three and to calmly arrive at the launch of the first act, which took place in 2013 The console versions have instead been distributed in recent days, already complete with all five chapters that make up the adventure. On PC, however, those who follow him from the beginning had to wait a good seven years before trying the last act, with the fourth which was launched in the now remote 2016. Already these brief chronological notes should have made you understand how much Kentucky Route Zero is a troubled game, with ideas that have added and subtracted over the long years it has been on the Cardboard Games work table. In reality they don't give the slightest idea of how the project has evolved and of the problems that there have been to close it. Close it well, we mean. Along the road Kentucky Route Zero tells the story of old Conway and his surreal journey in search of an address that will lead him to take Route Zero, a road as magical as it is real in a Kentucky that seems to have come out of a Borges story co-written with Kafka . Part Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Joyce's Ulysses, part son of the Cohen brothers, Conway is accompanied by his faithful dog, who can be called Blue as a sentiment (or a musical genre) or Homer in honor of the main literary referent of the work, with whom he will live, together with other characters he will meet along the way, a series of seemingly meaningless and completely unrelated situations, which however take on a completely different dimension when read in their dreamlike and fluidly metaphorical key , where the impossibility of grasping a purely narrative meaning becomes the springboard for abstracting the signifier and showing it in its polymorphic nature. It is difficult to summarize the very simple story of Kentucky Route Zero, made up of a series of events that take place in scenarios that look like many theatrical acts of different comedies and tragedies, chained together by the will of the authors and the curiosity of the player, to form a single vision, how fragmented made up of moments, rather than a single 'narrated'. Until the end of the game we are led to wonder if what we are experiencing is a real or proper story, or if we are faced with the reconstruction of a life, made up of shreds of memory and which is expressed in the absolute of allegories out of time and from space, shifting from the particular to the universal with undoubted effectiveness. Bureaucracy, feelings, sexuality, history, religion, a sense of infinity or a simple drunkenness are all pieces of an on the road video game in which the journey becomes revelation, complete with a Trojan horse transformed into a night club. The peculiarity of the whole reinterpreted by the globality of the message, in which scenarios and characters become only the comedy parts of something already written, which can only be relived within a staging without precise boundaries, as in Orlando Furioso by Ronconi, in which spectators could only watch parts of the show, having to choose from time to time where to position themselves in relation to the scene. Or is it not? The greatness of Kentucky Route Zero is not so much in the questions it answers, but in those it poses, leaving the player with great interpretative freedom, while perfectly fulfilling its ending. Never has a game that left so many questions unresolved been so complete in what it wanted to tell and, above all, express. At the end of the road there are no easy answers that encompass the universe, but only other questions which one can only sadly indulge in, agreeing on the impossibility and absurdity of pretending that there is any truth other than death. Gameplay In strictly playful terms, Kentucky Route Zero is a point and click adventure focused more on dialogues and situations than on puzzles. As mentioned, the gameplay is divided into five acts, lasting two hours each, in which the player decides where to go by selecting his destination from a different map from act to act, where geography becomes an ephemeral reference like the story itself . Although each act has a starting point and an ending point, you are not forced to face the various scenes in sequence, except at certain moments. In any case, when we talk about graphic adventures, don't let yourself be fooled, because it's just an excuse to give the player a certa mental predisposition. For the rest Cardboard has bent the genre to its needs, adding or removing systems where necessary, to try to make everything as essential as possible, so as not to distract from what was its main objective. For example, the fourth act is constructed in a significantly different way from the others because it puts the concept of binary choice at the center of the gameplay, working on the subtraction of experience rather than on its sum, where each path deliberately denies part of the understanding of the whole, leaving a unfillable void. It is a pleasant choice compared to the other acts, which however takes into account the production process of the game and the admission of ideas in progress, so much so that the fifth and final act, the shortest, is almost alienating in its formal perfection.Some the low-poly graphic style also deserves a word, one of the distinctive elements of Kentucky Route Zero. In this case it is not just a choice due to production issues, but a way to leave what is shown as undefined as possible, despite the richness of detail of some scenarios and the obsessive compositional care of the same. It seems as if we are constantly being told that what we see shouldn't distract us from what we live, even leaving the image itself at an interpretative level 0, like the road one takes to reach the end of the game.", "date": "2020-02-03", "grade": "9.3"}
