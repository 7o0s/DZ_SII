Curious to note how between indie and small Japanese studios, genres such as shooters, graphic adventures, platformers and beat'em ups have instead always been produced, albeit far from the spotlight. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a sublime return to the two dimensions of the arcades of yesteryear and - let us tell you - there are never enough titles like this done right. And it is not even a coincidence that the production of WayForward has merged with Inti Creates, precisely those ex Capcoms counted - listen, listen - among the developers of the Mega Man Zero and ZX sagas. An excellent combination, exactly the ideal union of intent in bringing American technologies with the level and gameplay design of the Japanese, a sign that when they want, the extremes of the planet can still collaborate, and well. If you don't know who Shantae is then get ready to go back to the early 90s, when the first episode of the brand peeked out on the Game Boy Color, creating an icon destined to remain in the shadows but without dissolving in it. To be a third episode, the product defends itself very well: the many ideas and the exclusive prerogative of the two Nintendo platforms make Shantae's new adventure a graft of caliber in the eShop library, finally strengthened by an exclusive weight. An excellent platformer for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS: let yourself be taken by the beautiful Shantae! Platforms of yesteryear The narrative assumptions are the simplest there is: evil is returning to threaten the lands of our heroine, who will have to leave to remedy it. To help her the beautiful pirate Risky, an old enemy and now a precious ally, who happens to have lost precisely those parts of the equipment that we will have to find here and there in the sea. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a 2D platformer of clear 16-bit derivation: the gameplay emphasis however manages to evolve during the course of the adventure, passing from a focus on careful jumping between platforms to a more intelligent management of the inventory and skills acquired in the final stages. WayForward accompanies the player in progress, one step at a time, creating a never difficult learning curve and balancing everything with a level of difficulty that is always at the limit of feasibility. Let's get our hands on it right away: we're not talking about a complicated game, but rather the developers' ability to maintain a balance while ensuring a request for constant attention from the player. The exploration draws its inspiration from roguelike dungeons, with the difference that in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, there is nothing procedural: the WayForward product is a tribute in all respects to the great classics of the 90s , in which the backtracking component is real, studied, part of a level design that does not leave the creation of environments to aseptic generation engines. The maps are and will remain, with a set of puzzles and patterns to unlock the obstacles that entrusts the resolution to the use of the right object. We know that reading the lines you are thinking about how much the team has fished from such sacred monsters: there are many assonances, but we still feel like proudly applauding the choice. The shortage of such software is too heavy for nostalgic gaming fans of a couple of generations ago to bear, so some relief is welcome. 3D effect Shantae and the Pirate's Curse makes a barely sketchy use of depth, linked solely to an aesthetic effect. The artistic sector of the backdrops certainly benefits from it, giving a further dimension to the proposed environments, but it is the only advantage. Therefore, making the whole title slide down is absolutely not a crime against the work. Castletroid For a download title, the production values are decidedly above average: from an artistic point of view - on Wii U the sprites are in high definition - but above all from an audio point of view. Kaufman's work (a certain Shovel Knight on his curriculum vitae) fully reflects the characteristics of the eclectic American composer, with a touch of originality on each sound accompaniment - absolutely over the top in some situations - combined with a careful study of sounds and effects sounds of each setting, helping to give personality to one of those factors in which the industry, in an incomprehensible way, is losing more and more interest in investing. Apart from what has already been indicated, we can confirm that the two versions do not differ too much: the GamePad is treated on balance like the lower screen of the Nintendo 3DS and therefore hostsnte inventory, map and context menu of items. Off-TVplay? Present, as well as a 3D effect that passes the exam sufficiently, bringing with it just a touch of parallax to give that extra something to a very pleasant scenario. A small drawback can be found in the activation phase of the objects: on Wii U as on Nintendo 3DS, the action of searching with the eye and then double-clicking the desired object, given the frenetic action, is rather uncomfortable. Instead, the complete use of all the keys provided by the standard Nintendo 3DS is good: each new island will give away a new piece of equipment to be used in the most disparate ways and intelligently assigned in a unique way. Have we already told you about the RPG base implemented? The blows inflicted by Shantae will have their damage value printed on the screen, as well as the gems recovered in the adventure will allow you to improve weapons and moves. And like any good tribute to The Legend of Zelda, the search for innocent squid to be grouped in packs of four to earn new hearts could not be missing, or the extra evil Tinkerbats, a sort of secret prey to complete the game 100%. . Objective that will keep you a little busy, yes, but unfortunately we conclude with the real, real thumbs down: longevity. A dozen hours will be enough to collect the whole offer, with an additional mode designed specifically for rather insipid speed-runs. For the asking price, we would have liked a little more.", "date": "2015-02-17", "grade": "8.5"}
