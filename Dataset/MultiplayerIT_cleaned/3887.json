{"name": "Looney Tunes: Il Mondo del Caos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/looney-tunes-il-mondo-del-caos-la-recensione.html", "text": "Since the strategic RPG has defined itself in some specific sub-genres on mobile platforms, titles have begun to flock which, essentially, limit themselves to embroidering details around a predefined structure. This is what happens everywhere in the gaming market, you might think, but in this case we are dealing with games so codified and canonized that they have very little room for maneuver to introduce variations within the given structure and often the greatest characterization derives from the surrounding elements , such as the setting, story or license used. The latter case, in particular, is what this Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem is based on as we see in this review. The game takes up the mechanics of RPGs based on the collection of characters in a slavish way, but somehow manages to find its own identity thanks to the rich Looney Tunes license, being able to exploit a world so charismatic that it cannot go unnoticed. The story practically doesn't exist, barely providing a premise to explain the need to gather an army of characters to be deployed in battle, but from such a cross-over it was difficult to expect anything else. Instead, what has been perfectly reproduced is the typical atmosphere of Warner Bros. animated productions of the time, from the excellent representation of the characters in cartoonish 3D to the style of the settings, up to the crazy animations that characterize the fights. It is this atmosphere in full Looney Tunes spirit that elevates the game above a good number of completely identical productions in terms of gameplay and that could be enough to make it an interesting choice. Although the mechanics are rather trite, in fact, the charisma of the characters is indisputable and the chaos that emerges during the combat sessions manages to make them enjoyable even in the obsessive reiteration of the same game actions. Looney Tunes to war Marvin the Martian has come up with some plan to conquer the Earth, however the usual Bugs Bunny intervenes in a rather clumsy way to block everything and from this event a sort of dimensional upheaval is unleashed which is resolved with the usual need to recover a large amount of missing characters. Looney Tunes: World of Chaos takes place on different game levels: a general menu from which you can access fights or character management and a sort of city builder that allows you to rebuild the typical world of the cartoons in question, donating a house to each recovered character. The focal moment remains the combat, which takes place in turns between two teams of characters, using a style drawn from the tradition of RPGs. Each creature has its own fighting style and a set of possible actions that can increase and evolve based on the investment of the collected bonuses and it is remarkable to see how each fighter has several rather complex moves that reproduce many of the typical cartoon gags of Looney Tunes and if you think of the huge amount of characters present it is easy to imagine the variety of situations that can occur on the screen during the clashes. This is a great thing, considering the continuous repetition we are forced into in the inevitable grinding sessions, fortunately with the possibility of speeding up the action up to 4x and using automatic combat. The other large sector of the game in which we find ourselves investing a lot of time is managing the various characters: these can be unlocked once you have reached the right amount of fragments concerning them, but this step is only the beginning. The use of recoverable vials as loot after the fights and of the materials allows the progression of the experience level, the unlocking of new skills and the enhancement of these, in a system that turns out to be surprisingly complex and profound, considering the subjects in question . As for the city builder-style component, it is clearly an additional element that is rather marginal in the basic mechanics of the game but which nonetheless represents a good diversion, as well as increasing the classic cartoonish atmosphere of Looney Tunes: The World of Chaos. Into all of this the inevitable prize boxes are grafted, here the protagonists of a system of continuous ~thefts~ or attempted such by online users, so it becomes necessary to put a team in defense of their boxes waiting to be able to open them or try to assault those of the other players, generally full of materials, money and objects useful for the evolution of the characters. The free-to-play mechanic, at least for the initial hours of play, seems to be essere decidedly balanced, with a not too severe energy system and a moderate use of grinding, which however is not too burdensome also considering the pleasantness of the clashes.", "date": "2018-12-19", "grade": "7.2"}
