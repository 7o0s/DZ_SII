The mention is due, given that NetherRealm Studios and Phosphor Games have in fact cloned that product to make another title, precisely WWE Immortals, which uses the exact same mechanisms, the same structure and even the same interface, allowing us to participate in three-on-three team-up or face off against a single, powerful boss at the end of each of the six tournaments available in the single player campaign. Campaign that starts from interesting assumptions, which reinvent the WWE superstars in a different context, a sort of multiverse in which various versions of each wrestler fight for supremacy. This aspect undoubtedly represents the flagship of the production, which manages to invent really fantastic things (see Daniel Bryan in an ~angry goat~ version, John Cena in a superhero costume or The Rock with rock skin, just to to name a few) starting from a tantalizing plot, with Bray Wyatt who finds a powerful magic lantern and the evil members of the Authority who take possession of it, unleashing a space-time paradox and opening the door to the invasion of characters from parallel realities. So here is the Big Show in giant fantasy style, Roman Reigns in gladiator armor, Sheamus in druid version or medieval Celtic warrior, Paige in a vampire costume, Kane in an even more demonic form and so on. An interesting idea, able to make the most of the various nuances of each wrestler (even the ridiculous habit of ~predicting~ Brie Bella's moves...), which will not fail to excite WWE fans and which is supported by a technical sector of excellence, extraordinary in the creation of polygonal models and their animations, where instead it would have been possible to do something more to characterize the scenarios or to give a minimum of personality to the music. Despite an excellent presentation, WWE Immortals proves to be an inconsistent and lackluster fighting game Yes or No? The merits of WWE Immortals are undeniable and certainly represent the reason why the new title produced by Warner Bros. should be downloaded and tried in any case; however they are not enough to cover the flaws in a gameplay that has very little in common with match fighting games, the real ones. Let's say that the experience arises in a very ~casual~ way, giving us a narrow repertoire of moves (a fast but weak combo, a slow but powerful one and three special moves that charge up as we fight) which is performed through simple taps or slide forward, whereas to block you have to press on the touch screen with both fingers; but only if we manage to do it before a combination starts, and equally suffering damage if the attacks are powerful, which makes the block almost completely useless. So you can't move, you can't jump but above all you can't dodge attacks, which represents the most annoying element of an interpretation that clearly focuses on freemium mechanisms to push us to upgrade characters or unlock new ones (using the expedient of decks of cards or by buying the single superstar, but with not exactly affordable prices), given that the standard matches are won in an extremely easy way (even with a single element against all three opponents, therefore without ever carrying out the ~tag~), but then the boss arrives and the difficulty soars. The online multiplayer mode, based on an asynchronous system, can act as an alternative to single player tournaments to earn a few more gold coins, but in all cases don't think you can waste: the action points will limit the duration of the matches and you will have to wait a few minutes before you can continue.", "date": "2015-01-21", "grade": "6.5"}
