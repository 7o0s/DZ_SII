{"name": "World Soccer Winning Eleven 8", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-soccer-winning-eleven-8_a.html", "text": "The new Master League One of the aspects that in WE8 more than any other has undergone substantial changes in the game structure itself is undoubtedly the Master League. It has been completely redesigned to offer a whole series of innovations designed to make it more ~attractive~. First of all, before starting a complete season in this competition, it will finally be possible to choose whether to play with the Default team (i.e. the one made up of the usual Njords, Cellinis, etc.), or with the aforementioned plus three champions already on the team, or even directly with your entire heart team. Once you have selected your favorite team from the 40 available and entered this mode, you immediately notice the significant differences with the old editions of Winning Eleven. Dozens of menus (strictly in Japanese), introduce us to a grueling game within the game. In fact, there are hundreds of things to do to better manage our society. It will be essential to pay greater attention to the managerial component. The market, which as in reality, for the various Divisions, is only possible at certain times of the year, and not always, provides for loan exchanges, advantageous economic offers to the club from which a player is being sought away and for the player himself. All seasoned with the possibility that your offer will not be accepted by the competition, given that even here the advanced CPU will give you a hard time. In short, it won't be easy to snatch Zidane from Real or Vieri from Inter. Players are also subject to the so-called ~growth~ factor, i.e. the actual passing of time during tournaments with consequent aging of the players. In this case it is normal that they will try to get you a respectable engagement to protect themselves. Too bad that once retired, the older players will reappear among the new talents at ridiculous costs but with the same or almost the same technical parameters, which does not seem very realistic. Another novelty is the introduction of the My Best Eleven mode as a complement to the Master League, in which it will be possible to memorize the best players with whom one has worked, in order to form a very personal Dream Team to be saved on the Memory Card and used in challenges against friends. As if that weren't enough, to make the gaming experience even more complete, Konami has included other goodies. A ~man of the match~ will be chosen by the system after each match, while the WEFA, the hypothetical international body that controls and organizes the various WE8 competitions, will draw up the so-called ~WEFA Chart~ every year, where the ML teams will be classified in relation to the performance of the season just ended. Ball in the center, let's start The latest effort by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, better known by the acronym of KTYO, seems intent on reaching even higher peaks than what has been achieved so far. Since everything, even if apparently free from defects, can be improved, so to make perfect a series that already had practically everything perfect in itself, it was thought well to fill the only remaining gap: that of the authenticity of the competitions and of the teams present in the game database. Having said that, the Japanese software house has made the last effort and finally acquired the official licenses for the Dutch championship, the local Serie A and the Spanish Liga, on the model of EA's Fifa, which translated into a nutshell means official jerseys and rosters for all the clubs in these tournaments, even if contrary to what was leaked at first, the official shirts and the teams present in the various competitions are updated to the season that has just ended. However, it seems it is possible to unlock some secret teams such as the newly promoted Palermo and Atalanta thanks to the WE Shop... The competitions present in the game this time are many, at least three times as many as WE7I, which suggests the willingness of the Japanese softo to create an even more long-lived and varied title than in the recent past, as also highlighted by the new Master League, to which we have seen fit to dedicate a specific and more exhaustive paragraph later in this article. But let's proceed in order. The brand new main screen is more reminiscent of the Fifa series than that of the title we are about to review, with a simple and quick interface to use. In this screen, the various game modes are available for selection, represented by simple icons, ranging from the standard friendly match between national teams or club teams (full game or penalties) to cup modes (also including the Champions League and the WEFA Cup CHECK), League, Master League and the traditional Allenament, Options and the Editor. Among the competitions available, the one that immediately catches the eye is the League. Here, for the first time in the history of WE, it will be possible to compete not only in the traditional personalized League for Nations, but also in the brand new most important international championships in Europe. From our local Serie A to the Spanish Liga, passing through the Dutch League up to the English Premier League, the Bundesliga and the French D1. The dream of millions of enthusiasts can finally be considered fulfilled. There is also a ~phony~ tournament for all those clubs, Besiktas, Dinamo Kiev, etc, whose official leagues are not present. The structure of the various tournaments obviously includes two-way matches and more or less faithfully reflects the originals. It should be noted that KTYO have decided to differentiate the various menus that accompany the user throughout the championship with the symbols of the respective Leagues (that of our Lega Calcio or La Liga just to name a couple) clearly visible on the screen and the colors background of the backgrounds that vary from league to league. Cracking gameplay But above all, as always, what makes the difference between the WE series and the competition is not so much the tinsel, the outline of the football event itself, but the playability. And here, for a change, there is none for anyone. Once on the field, you immediately notice the obsessive care with which, for the umpteenth time, the KTYO boys have packaged this product. The teams enter the field guided by the referees while the formations and pre-match statistics appear in graphics on the screen, including information on the weather (degree of humidity in the air, wind force, etc.), all elements attributable to a real game broadcast on TV. Even our good Jon Kabira appears more professional than usual in his comments, and his voice is a little muffled, as if he were really connected from some stadium to comment on the match. While chants from the curve start in the background (many clubs have customized chants like in WE6, even if of much lower quality than that title) the teams line up in midfield, and with the usual R2 key we can admire the behavior of the fans in the stands and above all to see the innumerable banners that they have displayed all around the bleachers. For the first time, as has been the case for some time in FIFA, also in WE there are customized banners for each team. In practice, if you play against Milan at San Siro, the stadium will be for three quarters Rossoneri, as it is logical, while if you face Inter, the banners will change and will be nerazzurri with lots of writing and photos of the ~local~ idols . Here we cannot fail to appreciate the work done by the Konami graphics: while maintaining the same engine as the previous chapter of the series, WE8 can boast an unprecedented aesthetic detail, with authentic touches of class that will delight the most demanding fans, such as the lowered under the calf as Camoranesi loves to wear them, Zidane's gloves for the cold, C. Ronaldo's ~patches~ to cover earrings and the shirts which, beautifully made and very realistic, will even tend to get dirty when playing on fields made heavy by the rain. Once the race begins, we can immediately see the first changes made to the gameplay itself. The gameplay is articulated in a slower, more reasoned way than in WE7I. The very behavior of CPU-controlled teams appears more logical, less frantic than usual. Rarely will you see your opponent stealing the ball from you in the middle of the pitch and running like mad towards the goal, unless the situation that has developed, such as a counter-attack, does not allow it. All of this has a positive impact on the game, as we will now be facing more intelligent and less predictable opponents. Think of a Zidane who caracolas in midfield and then suddenly opens on the opposite side with a throw of 30 meters for Beckam who is inserting himself on the wing and you will have the slightest idea of what we are saying. Precisely because the teams on the field move with almost perfect and rational synchronisms, the insertions of the players in the offensive phase are devastating for those who suffer the attack. One of the aspects that make the experience of a gamer in Winning Eleven 8 very realistic consists precisely in the behavior of the opposing players managed by the CPU, whose AI has undergone, as you may have guessed, a strong increase towards the other, in the phase of attack. A winger like Figo or a full-back like Caf, just to give another concrete example, tend to make very constructive insertions and diagonals. The SThe basic control system has remained almost unchanged, in principle, but still presents many interesting innovations, first of all that of being able to carry out customized feints, such as for example Ronaldinho's so-called ~elastic~, whose functions go well beyond the mere aesthetic aspect. In fact, dribbling is more accurate and faster to perform, which makes them much more useful and effective than in WE7I. With a little practice, it is possible to literally jump over an opponent who has attempted a sliding tackle, leaving him stunned on the ground as he prepares to run towards goal. In fact, contrary to what happened in the past, after the wrong intervention the defender will not get up from behind as fast as the wind, but will take precious seconds to get back on his feet. A fatal period of time for him and his companions. However, what has just been described must not mislead you. Thanks to the more elaborate physical impact management system, jumping the man in WE8 is even more difficult than in the recent past, also because the opponent always tends to stand on you and stop in front of you, or to put his arm between you and the ball, at the cost of committing a foul by holding you back in order not to make you advance too much, and this will involve us searching for more reasoned strategies in developing effective offensive actions, such as to be able to undermine the attentive opposing defenses. Also in this eighth episode of the saga, the KTYO boys then wanted to overdo it by implementing a whole series of brand new animations and movements, which, as for the feints, are present in customized versions for the most celebrated champions, and an innovative system of passes and crosses totally recalibrated, which allows the user even more control over their virtual pets. Just think that there are five different types of cross and that it is much easier to miss a low pass precisely because of these innovations. In short, if you miss a deep cut in WE8, it will no longer be due to an inaccurate control system. With the dozens of new animations added, then, it is possible to create a whole series of new and more satisfying plays (various types of crosses, shots from inside and outside the area). And this is precisely the thing that struck us most when playing WE8: the absolute sensation of real and effective control of the players. By pressing the various keys you have the real sensation of making your player do what you want. Lastly, the introduction of two other very important aspects of the game should be noted: two-way free-kicks and the referee terna visible on the pitch. Set pieces offer the user total control over what is happening on the pitch at that moment, as never before seen in any other video game. When you are about to take a set piece, just press the Select button to change the way you take the free kick and be joined by a teammate. Once this is done, you can proceed to the conclusion. Our buddy will think about feinting the ball just before our movement on the ball or passing the ball to us in the case of a free kick. If we then want to try to surprise our opponent, by pressing the L1 key the man near the ball will suddenly kick himself on goal instead of feinting. As anticipated also in the preview, in WE8 the referee is finally present on the field. He not only has a purely aesthetic function, but a decisive role for the evolution of the match, so much so that there is also an option to set the level of severity of the black jackets and a personalized AI to diversify the behavior of the various directors race (be careful not to catch the Moreno on duty). Lastly, the addition of animated interludes during the match, such as brawls on the pitch after a dubious episode, the desperation of an attacker who has missed a goal or the gesture of the referee calling an overly aggressive defender to order. which add further realism and sense of participation. Conclusions We have dreamed of it for years, the official licenses, a more television setting combined with the playability and realism of Winning Eleven. Today the dream has come true with WE8. Konami has succeeded in the difficult task of surpassing itself by packaging an even more beautiful product. With the acquisition of the licenses, the definitive leap in quality was made, even six of the kids from Tokyo didn't want to stop there. While being able to cradle themselves on a now almost perfect and inimitable gameplay, they wanted to change, perfect, revolutionize their masterpiece, and once again they made the gameplay more realistic. How they do it every time remains u", "date": "2004-08-06", "grade": null}
