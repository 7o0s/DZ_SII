Being a niche genre, therefore not obsessed with running after the latest market trends, the development teams competed to interpret it in the broadest and most inspired way possible, also taking advantage of new distribution systems, such as Early Access, to get feedback during development so as to adjust the shot on the run. To say, in the last two years or so we have been able to play jewels such as Stellaris, Civilization VI, Galactic Civilization III (recently expanded in an excellent way by Crusade) and others, while only in the last few weeks have valuable hybrids such as Starpoint Gemini Warlords or Northgard been released . In a framework so full of choices, Amplitude Studios played a particular role with its Endless, starting from the first Endless Space with which it developed the interface that we then saw refined in Endless Legend and which we find, still improved, in Endless Space 2, the subject of this review. Being able to navigate through the many menus with just a few clicks is essential in order not to burden the training phase too much, which in 4x is very important in order not to let the player run away. The learning curve of the various mechanics, especially those related to technological development, is in fact very steep and being faced with a heavy and cumbersome interface would further aggravate the difficulty of entering the game. In short, we are talking about an essential feature of the genre, a feature that Amplitude has studied with painstaking care and which it refines from title to title. Arguably only Firaxis' interfaces are as well crafted, which is saying something given the pedigree of that development team. Will Endless Space 2 have something new to say in the 4x genre? We reviewed it to find out! Exploration and colonization Describing Endless Space 2 in its fundamental concept is not difficult, because it shares it with all the other space strategic players mentioned (and not): at the command of one of the eight available races, you have to explore space and expand as much as possible, establishing colonies or researching ancient artifacts produced by the now extinct race of the Endless. Technological development follows the classic tree diagram Obviously we are not alone in the universe and we will have to suffer competition from other civilizations, which have the same goal as us. Having chosen our faction, we immediately find ourselves in deep space. Initially we know only one planetary system, the one where our mother planet is located and, globally, our resources are very limited. As tradition dictates, we are given a unit to start exploring, and one of settlers to establish an outpost in case we manage to find another habitable planet, an eventuality less remote than it seems. The management of the units is similar to that of Endless Legend, apart from the customization options, and allows you to quickly merge the spaceships that are in the same system into fleets, perhaps assigning them a hero unit to guide them. The exploration itself takes place on pre-established routes that connect the planetary systems: the destination is selected and our fleet, or the single spaceship, sets off on the journey. The planets offer very different environments. At the beginning there will be few that can be colonized (let's say those similar to the mother planet), but with the development of new technologies, which takes place by selecting them from the classic tree diagram, in this case divided into four macro categories, it will be possible to establish colonies even in previously inaccessible. The map of the universe is functional and always readable As we said, our galactic empire can develop along four directions, which greatly change the approach to the game: for example, a society strongly focused on militarism will expand faster but will be constantly at war, while one focused on the economy will make better use of the resources of various planets, but it will be weaker and so on. Be careful because some races are intrinsically specialized and work best following a certain type of development (for this we recommend starting with humans, the most versatile race). Closely related to the style of play is the political management of the empire. In fact, every twenty rounds there will be elections that will modify or confirm the previous institutional set-up, changing some balances. For example, an industrial society with a militaristic government can generate some internal conflict, as well as a society focused on scientific research that allows religious groups to take too much power. In general, it is never advisable to have an scome into conflict with your own policies, if you don't want to have negative social reactions. Still speaking of politics, it is important to consider the role of the colonies, inclined to rebel over any problem. For example, if a distant colony was continuously attacked by marauders and we did nothing to stop them, after a short time we would risk a great revolution. Military problems You will have understood that in Endless Space 2 there are many issues to deal with, not least the military ones, ranging from the customization of the spaceships, to the management of the fights, which take place almost completely automatically and which are the worst part of the whole game. to the point that we often skip them to immediately return to the strategic map: so, once started, we cannot influence them in any way, therefore, after having seen some of them, they become tedious, when not annoying. A land battle This is true both for clashes between spaceships and for land battles, those for the conquest of colonies. We are aware that this is a compromise solution and that one could not expect to have complete control of the clashes (otherwise it would have been another game), but at this point one could have opted for an even more agile representation, given the uselessness overall to watch an entire battle. Not that there aren't things to do in the military sphere, far from it: we can improve our ships, equipping them with ever more powerful weapons researched or discovered by exploring the planets; we can build advanced ships and we can modulate the human resources available to increase our defenses. Yes, in short, the management of our forces is satisfactory and it works. Let's say that we would have liked a few more tactical options during battles or a solution, perhaps less spectacular, but more functional like that of Stellaris. Of course, it must also be said that a more complex system would not have made much sense, given that there are so many problems to be faced and they multiply in the advanced stages of the game, that is, when the universe is completely revealed, it has expanded a lot and there there are a multitude of conflicts going on. Fighting for hours with dozens of outbreaks in progress risks losing sight of the general picture of the situation. From a technical point of view Endless Space 2 does its thing and nothing more. Obviously no enthusiast of the genre will pay too much attention to it. Let's say that the menus are stylistically well done and that the many animations make even the coldest and text-filled screens come alive. The battles are woody, although the spaceships are not ugly, while the star map is there: functional, very readable and very agile, but it certainly doesn't leave you speechless. It doesn't matter: no one would ever buy a 4x looking for technical marvels and, from this point of view, Amplitude has done more than it should.", "date": "2017-05-25", "grade": "8.5"}
