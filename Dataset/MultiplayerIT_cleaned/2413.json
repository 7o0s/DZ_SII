{"name": "Sudden Strike", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sudden-strike.html", "text": "Europe, 1942 The driving force of this game is undoubtedly the campaign mode, which offers the player the opportunity to take part in the Second World War by taking control of one of three different sides: through 12 rather varied and original missions, you will have to reach the final objective, that is the military conquest of the old continent. As for the variety of missions present, it must be said that it is not just a question of overcoming the enemy, but in some of them it will be necessary to free an allied village, escort a supply truck or even go through a minefield trying to arrive safely on the opposite side of the map. Unfortunately, one of the few weak points of the title should be noted in this regard, that is the presence of a briefing that is too concise and brief, which precedes the start of the mission and which does not always illustrate the objectives to be achieved in great detail. The main mode is accompanied by a dozen maps designed specifically for single player training and, of course, the multiplayer part of the game, which over the past few months since the game was released (which reached our territory with considerable delay , not localized and little advertised), proved to be very popular. Once you become familiar with the game system, slightly slower than most of the other rts in circulation (don't expect another Emperor...), you can grasp the first element capable of guaranteeing the title a particular appeal: the general atmosphere of the All. The representation of infantry units, vehicles and weapons in general has in fact been created with historical precision, giving a rather unique feeling to the title. If some of you, like me and many others, began to appreciate the RTS genre with Command & Conquer, you probably know what it means to finally play that same game (i.e. with a military setting) from a more realistic perspective. The result is absolutely satisfactory, also because it is far from the simulation rigorousness of other titles (The Operational Art of War among all), the prerogative of a more pretentious community under the simulation aspect. Different is beautiful The second element capable of distinguishing Sudden Strike from the rest of the RTS in circulation is the variety of units available, which (an element that could make purists of the genre turn up their noses which in the long run actually turns out to be a rather coherent choice, as we will see with the general setting of the game) are only of the land type, as no attacks of an air or sea type have been contemplated. Needless to list the many units present (more than a hundred), but we need to cut out a quote for some of them (even if, this is the beauty of a game like SS, this evaluation is strictly personal and certainly varies with the player) : the Nebelwerfer, a German missile launcher with explosive potential and great visual effect; soldiers in sidecars; the Soviet Katiuscia, slower but more devastating rocket launchers; the Churchill, a tank complete with a flamethrower to flush out opposing soldiers from bunkers. What is important to understand is that the variety and uniqueness of the troops available guarantees a different tactical approach for each player, leaving the latter to discover the best solution for each mission. To confirm the extreme flexibility of the different tactics that can be adopted, the graphical interface also seems to be in line with the rest of the game, adapting every time a tank or an infantry unit is selected, showing the different possible actions characteristic of that unit. The soldiers will therefore be able to shoot, run, but also place anti-tank mines in the ground: the tanks will be able to fire with the turret, but also rotate their tracks to seize the best position: and so on. Reflexively... furious! Sudden Strike could fall into the category of mainly tactical RTS, as neither the accumulation of resources nor the creation of units is foreseen, which are instead assigned to the player at the start and upon the achievement of some objective during the mission. Having said that, it is clear how the importance of each unit is decisive, as finding yourself without even the smallest jeep, which is essential for the exploration of the terrain and therefore for planning the battle, could lead to a negative outcome. The enemy's position can in fact be anywhere on the map: imagine you are patrolling a forest or a villaggio, and you realize that the visual area of the troops is completely faithful to reality and does not allow you to see behind a tree or a building. Behind the bush there may be a nest of machine guns or a mortar, your advancing tanks may end up in an ambush of a few but lethal well hidden anti-tank weapons, your soldiers may be shot by enemies hiding in houses. Sudden's philosophy therefore seems to be that of a slow and reflexive start, which however lasts until the encounter with the enemy units, when an epic battle is unleashed on the battlefield involving hundreds of different units: looking for a comparison in this sense, one could say that SS is the two-dimensional answer to Shogun, who has a (much) less variety of units on his side anyway. However, the option to pause at any time has been implemented in SS, a detail that allows the player (in the style made famous by the first Baldur's Gate) to issue orders to units even in what appear to be the most confusing situations: probably without this chance the title would have lost much of its tactical appeal and would have aligned itself with most of the classic RTS, where it is enough to produce as many units as possible to get the better of the enemy. In this case, however, a movement or fire order given without thinking can compromise the outcome of the mission. Finally, a small RPG element included in the game deserves mention, which leads to a greater enhancement of some units: in fact, when they gain experience by killing enemies, their characteristics of power, speed and precision increase. For the first time in this genre of games (I repeat, SS is not similar to simulation titles, such as the Close Combat series, but shares only some realistic aspects making them more immediate), precisely for what has been said above, the units of infantry possess a significant importance, and no longer constitute the ~cannon fodder~ to which Sensible Software was dedicated some time ago. Officers, for example, poorly armed but equipped with a wide range of vision, when they manage to place themselves in a building by giving it the order not to attack, offer the player the possibility of keeping large spaces of the map under control (which is generally really huge). A few steps from the masterpiece ... here is Sudden Strike. Although it is difficult to find negative elements of Sudden Strike, it must be said that some minor features of the game place it below the maximum threshold. First of all, a rather backward pathfinding (i.e. the ability that units have to move around the map looking for the best way) should be noted, and it is not difficult to witness typically summer queues in front of a bridge, with the result that the units further back detach from the group and move haphazardly looking for another way (who named Baldur's Gate?). Furthermore, in most cases it is necessary to repeat the given order several times before seeing a vehicle move in the right direction. Furthermore, the impossibility of being able to create attack and defense formations takes away some of the tactical force that pervades the entire game: if I arrange the tanks so as to have the lightest and fastest ones to act as outriders and thus attract fire enemy, in order to create space for the heavy tanks, why does the formation scatter at the first attack, discovering the rear? Another uncared for aspect is that of the sound, as not only the background music is rather anonymous and does not do justice to the epic nature of the whole, but the sound effects, such as the water courses, turn on and off suddenly, not fading as slowly as expected when moving away from them. Lastly, an AI that is sometimes decidedly subdued must be recorded: among all, the most focused example is that of the use of long-range artillery. Once the area has been explored with a fast reconnaissance vehicle, the fire is concentrated on the point where the target was identified. The AI does not react by attacking our vehicles, but by moving its own very little, until they are destroyed. In this way, if you have to conquer a village or an obligatory passage, you succeed in doing so without engaging our army too much, and what is even more serious, our brain. Conclusions Having specified that this Sudden Strike is not a masterpiece, it certainly cannot be said that it is a bad game. From its side it has some notable elements (the graphics, the number of units, the fun it manages to recreate, the feeling and the atmospherefera, the realistic but not too rigid style of play), capable of capturing anyone who wants to approach a strategy game with this setting, but also some lightness that does not allow him to grasp the full success of the genre. If you are looking for a game dedicated to the great war, which absolutely recreates the realism of that conflict, my advice is to go elsewhere, towards Close Combat or even towards Combat Mission or Operation Art Of War; if, on the other hand, you are looking for a realistic but not too much realistic title, with accurate and detailed graphics, as fun as it is reflective, then Sudden Strike could be for you. Conclusions N.B.: a special thanks to Antonio TNT Strada, thanks to whom this review could be more accurate and precise. N.B 2: While writing the article, I had the opportunity to try the expansion of this game, entitled Sudden Strike Forever and recently available on the Italian market. While waiting for the review, just know that the editor alone adds a particular value to the game... Matter of style When you glance casually at the images of this Sudden Strike, the first impression is that of being faced with yet another real-time strategy game: in reality, this title hides several features capable of carving out the right space for it in the crowded RTS landscape, such to guarantee him a place of honor among the pages of M.it. It is probably since the days of the Age of Empires saga, which will soon see the birth of the third chapter, that we have not been faced with a game with such a well-finished historical setting (of course leaving aside the ~serious~ titles such as Operation Art of War et similia): in SS you are projected onto the battlefields of the Second World War, in a Europe prey to conflicts between the Allies, the Germans and the Soviets. Positioning itself in the right middle between Command & Conquer and Close Combat, between Combat Mission and Total Annihilation, Sudden Strike is capable, due to its characteristics, of attracting both the player who is passionate about ultra-realistic war simulations, and the one more inclined for furious action and less realistic: let's see how.", "date": "2001-08-27", "grade": null}
