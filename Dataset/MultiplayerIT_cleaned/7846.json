Basically, the opinions were divided between those who appreciated the work of Born Ready Games, sharing the return to a forgotten genre accompanied by a level of difficulty at times rather high, and those who instead, precisely because of this peculiarity, found the game too frustrating for your taste. We at Multiplayer.it, as you will surely (true?) have already read during the review phase, liked the effort of the London-based team enough, to the point that the writer continued to follow the news coming from the minds behind the game creation, waiting for interesting news. News that, not without a certain surprise, did not take long to arrive, given the announcement and the arrival on the market in a short time of Strike Suit Infinity, a title we find ourselves talking about today. It is to all intents and purposes a spin-off of the original, which however does not require the installation of the latter to be played on your PC: once the purchase and download have been made, just start it to start the space fight. In deep space For the benefit of those who do not know what we are talking about, while referring to the main article dedicated to Strike Suit Zero to learn more about the subject, let us briefly recall the basics of the game in question: inspired by various classics of the past, the title created by Born Ready Games belongs to the dear old category of space dodge fighting, and therefore makes aerial combat its main feature. Strike Suit Infinity does nothing but extract the arcade heart of Strike Suit Zero's mechanics with full hands, putting the player in the middle of what is a full-fledged horde mode. In fact, divided into 18 different levels, it presents itself as a sort of prequel to the events narrated in Strike Suit Zero, introducing a training simulator for the troops actually employed by the forces of the U.N.E. (United Nations of Earth) in the base campaign. Edition in which the contents we are talking about today could have been included from the outset as a separate modality, which however did not happen, we imagine for reasons of time and money. However, moving on to what is Strike Suit Infinity, once again we find a mission mode, however all structured in the same way: on each occasion, the enemy forces will be divided into three different waves, during each of which we will have to make our way to the sound of laser cannon shots and missiles. Arcade full force Having abandoned the intention of telling a story, Strike Suit Infinity therefore puts us in the middle of raw combat, claiming nothing more than to be an arcade based on waves of enemies and on collecting points to then show off on the online leaderboards. The dead times of some Strike Suit Zero missions are absent, just as the strategic component leaves full scope for more immediate action. However, some elements arrive from the base game, such as the possibility of enriching the team to support you both in number and in upgrades, thanks to the credits acquired by playing, and that of unlocking new units to be used in missions. The points are obviously collected based on the success achieved in battle, emphasizing the time and any combos: this implies that compared to the past it is inadvisable to save on ammunition and missiles, going down hard right away with your own armament. At the same time, an optimized use of Flux and Strike Suit becomes important to get a high score. The types of enemies also come from the original, with the presence of fighters similar to the one controlled by the player in Pursuit Mode and larger ships, to be shot down in a short time. As far as the technical sector is concerned, however, all the good things said in the Strike Suit Zero review remain, including the highly inspired creation of the backdrops and the contribution from expert people such as the ~mecha-designer~ Junji Okubo and the composer Paul Ruskay, as well as singer Kokia.", "date": "2013-05-09", "grade": "7.8"}
