{"name": "eRacer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eracer.html", "text": "Action Driving The number of computer controlled cars in Championship mode varies from 5 to 7 and before you can unlock all the tracks you will have to practice a lot. The opponents aren't very smart (but we don't expect these qualities from an ~arcade~ driving game), but they know how to do their job: go fast! Even before going on, I underline the first big flaw of the game: the difficulty. Despite having chosen the ~easy~ mode, in some tracks it is almost impossible to dominate the race and only after many attempts (and why not, thanks to a stroke of luck) do you manage to emerge victorious. The biggest flaw is perhaps the ~angularity~ of the maps. A corner taken badly or a door can make you wedge against some element of the map and make you easily lose 20-30 seconds and therefore the group of opponents. In that case, unfortunately, the quickest solution is to start the race over. As for the arcade mode, there isn't much to say except that it doesn't offer any particular ideas. Online Competition On the other hand, the multiplayer game which is structured in INTERNET GAME and LAN is very interesting. As regards the first, the novelty is that, thanks to how the login is structured, the game will allow you to participate in organized competitions and view the results directly on the manufacturer's website (if you visit the ERACER homepage you could see some competitions already carried out ). I can speak from firsthand experience regarding local network play (which supports up to 8 players). Tested with eight people, I must say that it proved to be very funny and immediately playable even for those who hadn't practiced before. The maps are built with a particular eye to the gameplay (ramps, crossroads, jumps, shortcuts, fast sections that alternate with slow sections, bottlenecks) and the results are that in LAN the game gives its best. But the more important question is: is this eRacer worth buying? The answer, as usual, can only be very personal. However, if I have to express an opinion, I would say that if you don't have an internet connection, the single player game doesn't offer enough ideas to deserve the purchase. If, on the other hand, you have a modem and a connection, then eRacer can offer you hours of online entertainment, without however claiming to be a driving simulator (although the physical engine of the car is discreet), but only a ~simulator of counters~. Raaaaaaage (pronounced with Doppler shift) La Rage returns to the market with a driving game, halfway between simulation and arcade. Let's talk about eRacer. Immediately the pure data to then comment on the quality of the game: 14 tracks to unlock through the classic Championship mode, 5 game modes (championship, arcade, timetrial, online and lan), 8 cars to unlock, 4 skins to change the appearance of your bodywork (if you look on the eRacer homepage you will notice the download section: later you will be able to download new maps and cars). The maps are very diverse and note good work. The settings are decidedly imaginative: the center of a shopping mall, a landfill, a chemical plant, an aircraft carrier, a parking lot, the Indianapolis oval, various tracks immersed in nature (in Colin's style, to be clear), snow-covered tracks and the last it's a toy car track. To unlock the cars and tracks you have to play the game in championship mode (there are two difficulties). Only victory will get you access to the next track (that's not big news).", "date": "2001-05-13", "grade": null}
