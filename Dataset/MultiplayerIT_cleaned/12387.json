Mind Quiz, Your Brain Coach aims to rejuvenate and make our brain younger through a series of exercises divided into four categories: mental speed, mental use, readiness and elasticity, each of them supervised by Dr. Kajimoto of the University of Osaka, one of the pioneers of studies on the functions of the human brain. The scientific method used by this brain trainer, as well as the one made by Nintendo and the numerous clones that appeared later, is always that of the ATMT therefore each exercise contained in Mind Quiz will not turn out to be so different from the other exponents of the genre, if not in form and visual style. Less minimalist than Brain Training, more colorful, lively and funny with its cartoon style Dr. Kakimoto VS Dr. Kawashima: Who Will Win? In Italy Mind Quiz was distributed by Ubisoft, which also edited the portable edition for PSP; the title was programmed entirely by SEGA which gave a strong Japanese imprint to its visual style. Less minimalistic than Brain Training, more colourful, lively and funny with its cartoon style and our trusty little dog who will follow us through all the exercises. The audio has also been greatly improved over the ~original~ brain-stimulating games made in Nintendo. Almost all the menus are dubbed by a beautiful female voice and the music is certainly more varied and nicer. A certain sense of dj vu The parallels with Brain Training are unfortunately not few: Mind Quiz is practically an almost identical clone of the best seller Nintendo. Anyone who has played Brain Training at least once will not be able to notice that every detail, from the exercises to the menus, from the game mechanics to the functions, is taken by weight from the latter and redesigned like an old title that does its trick. Starting for the first time we are asked for the date of birth and a signature to ~brand~ the save, through which we can then access our statistics which will gradually be recorded in order to observe the progress made. Every now and then the Mind Quiz doctor reminds us of something that probably had escaped us, inviting us to make more use of our memory, or he gives us valuable advice to improve the efficiency of our mind during normal daily activities. Every time we complete an exercise, a red brain-shaped icon appears on today's date: it is possible to access a calendar to check how much we have trained and if we have missed a few days of exercise. The various mini-games that Mind Quiz adopts to stimulate our mind have mostly already been tested in Brain Training and Brain Academy: doing mathematical calculations, pronouncing what you see rather than the writing that appears on the screen, playing memory games and lots of logic. All identical, except for the form in which they are proposed: for example, instead of saying into the microphone the color of what we see, we have to pronounce the name of the fruit that appears before our eyes. The various mini-games that Mind Quiz adopts to stimulate our mind are mostly already tried in Brain Training and Brain Academy Some exercises are also new, such as the one to stimulate readiness that requires speed and precision to touch each dog running on the screen, or the one in which we have to blow on the microphone to get a soap bubble to its destination without colliding and bursting against some obstacles (among other things already seen in Yoshi, a DS launch title). Others, especially the new ones, are relatively easy and even uninspired, often being boring and unattractive. For example, the mini-game that should increase reflexes by taking the largest number of dogs requires such a speed as to make the touches with the stylus all too rapid, confusing and random. Speech and handwriting detections don't work very well and aren't always as accurate as one should expect from a ~smart~ game. The number eight often generates zeros, while the number one becomes a nine many times, but the cases are much more numerous: in any case the figures must be written in a perfect and impeccable way, after having understood how the CPU wants to ~see them ~ and how they don't go well. A little too forced. Even the speech recognition is not at all convincing. In the test where the names of the fruits that scroll on the screen must be pronounced, we almost always find ourselves yelling and repeating quickly what we want to make them understand. Even by spelling out words well, Mind Quiz is almost never able to understand what we want to communicate to him on the fly, and this is a problema bad enough for a game that is currently trying to evaluate our reflexes and our mental resilience; the results thus obtained risk being constantly compromised and distorted. Final comment. Mind Quiz builds on the huge success of educational titles that stimulate the mind launched by Nintendo with its Brain Training. The scientific method that the Ubisoft title uses is the same, so most of the exercises are almost identical to those already tested in other titles of this kind. That said, Mind Quiz doesn't try to bring any innovation by proposing a game identical in all respects to those already released more than a year ago, only changing the stylistic aspect and the form of its contents. Moreover, it suffers from some serious problems in detecting writing and understanding what we are trying to say on the microphone, a factor which heavily affects the actual usefulness of the exercises and their reliability. Pros: Good number and variety of minigames Pleasant graphic and audio style Cons: Almost identical to Brain Training Imperfect handwriting and voice detection Some exercises are not very inspired More than ten years have passed since the pioneer of brain aging studies, Dr. Kajimoto, invented a revolutionary method to calculate and rejuvenate one's mental age: he called it ATMT (Advanced Trail Making Test), and it was the the beginning of a revolution in medicine and science. Instead, less than two years have passed since his colleague Dr. Kawashima collaborated with Nintendo for the debut of the ATMT system in the videogame field, immediately becoming an incredible phenomenon of custom and bringing the first exponent of the genre, called ~Brain Training~ , to reach sales of over million. Could other software houses not ride this great media wave that has hit any age group and anywhere in the world? Obviously not, and here is SEGA showing us its way of training our mind: will it be even more effective?", "date": "2007-04-03", "grade": null}
