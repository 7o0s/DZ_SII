These are stratospheric numbers for a product that can in fact be downloaded for free but which, apparently, interprets the freemium model in the most profitable way possible for developers. A few months after its release on iOS devices, with various updates behind us, we wanted to touch this phenomenon first hand to understand what are the reasons for such a striking success, as well as whether or not it is possible to play without necessarily having to put a hand in your wallet: here is our review of Clash of Clans. Within a fantasy setting, the game puts us in charge of a village we have the task of expanding over time, by collecting resources, constructing new buildings, upgrading existing ones and training troops for the conquest of neighboring territories (as well as to challenge other online players, defend ourselves from their possible attacks and even become part of real organized clans). A gameplay divided into two phases, therefore, a solution that is increasingly gaining ground in the casual management genre and which we have recently appreciated in titles such as Kingdoms & Lords, Men in Black 3 or the excellent Battle Nations, the latter actually capable of introduce substantial innovations in a vein that now seemed to have nothing more to say. Build and conquer The management phase of Clash of Clans is practically identical to that of many other similar productions. On the right side of the screen there is an icon that allows us to access the various buildings, each of which has a cost in gold coins and drops of elixir. We can order the creation of a building and wait for the minutes necessary for its completion or spend the available gems, in practice the real currency of the game, so that the result is immediate. At the beginning we are provided with a sufficient amount of gems to keep going for a couple of hours, after which we will necessarily have to be patient or allow ourselves some in-app purchases, even if at rather steep prices: we are talking about 4.49 euros for just five hundred gems , 8.99 euros for 1200 gems and so on, up to the package of 140 thousand gems sold at the price of 89.99 euros. In short, the Clash of Clans price list immediately made us understand how Supercell collects 500 thousand dollars a day. For the rest, the resource collection mechanics, by touching the relative icons, is what fans of the genre know well, even if fortunately less interventions are required of us than the average, i.e. we don't always have to be there to touch the buildings that produce coins or elixirs to be able to collect them; which is good. Then there is the second phase, the one that the developers define as ~strategic~, in which you have to train a certain number of soldiers (of various kinds, each category must be unlocked as you level up) to wage war on neighboring clans and thus raiding their wealth. Unfortunately, the action immediately reveals itself to be extremely simplistic and without depth: given a specific enemy camp, our only move is to place the troops in a point on the map, thus relying on their sense of priorities to proceed with the destruction of the positions hostile. Not being able to direct attacks on cannons first, for example, is a huge handicap and makes it virtually impossible to successfully carry out some campaigns unless you really have a huge amount of units. Finally, as for the technical realization, the touch controls work well and it practically never happens to select one object rather than another, and the graphics are well designed and colorful.", "date": "2013-01-22", "grade": "6.5"}
