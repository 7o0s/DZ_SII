{"name": "Escape from Paradise City - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/escape-from-paradise-city-recensione.html", "text": "Street life Even if one feels a little superficial writing it, the dubious quality of the initial menu that welcomes you to the world of Paradise City already manages to give a preview of the average - rather low - quality of the title. Once the type of game and the level of difficulty have been selected, we will quickly be catapulted into one of the many neighborhoods of Paradise City. The plot that forms the background to the game is simple and very schematic: the NSA (National Security Agency) needs three moles able to infiltrate the slums of the city and, therefore, be able to manipulate the outcome of the bloody battles between the gangs that they infest it. In exchange, each of these characters will be able to receive a pardon and abandon what, rather ironically, is called Paradise City (a one-way journey, with no return except by flight). While proposing the same game mechanics, the use of each of these three characters during the game will be the starting point for the re-proposition of three different styles of play  or at least it should, according to the intentions of the developers. Using Nicholas ~Nick~ Porter, we will have to deal with automatic weapons and rifles, a real wrecker who, by virtue of his past as a bank robber, is able to juggle perfectly even in street shootings. Angel Vargas, on the other hand, raised in the slums of the city and used to earning a living mainly with illegal street fights, will put a specialist in white weapons and, when needed, punches in front of us. This quick overview ends with ex-policeman Boris Chekov, not very useful when you need to get your hands dirty but able to defend himself with a good use of pistols and thanks to the help of his henchmen. The three characters cannot be used at the same time but, passing from level to level, they will represent the protagonists of the various missions and the main means by which to achieve the proposed objectives. Except for the character used, the starting experience level of the same and the degree of difficulty, the player will therefore be led, along a very poor and rather poorly told plot development, to climb the steps of power of the local underworld through a series of missions that in practice do nothing to feel different from the previous ones. 'mbutu As mentioned above, the gameplay of Paradise City provides for the seamless inclusion of elements of action titles, RTS and management titles. The managerial section, undermined from the outset by a cumbersome menu system and poorly integrated with the rest of the real-time interface, offers a system that potentially, despite its simplicity, would be able to offer a certain depth. On balance, once you have taken control of a neighborhood, the choices available are almost always obligatory. In summary, the player has to take control of one or more districts of the city by defeating the local boss. Once you have conquered one of the areas in question, depending on its characteristics, you will come into possession of some special abilities (ability to move quickly using cars, medical reinforcements and so on), points of interest (such as bars where you can buy additional items and weapons ) and, above all, money from illegal activities. The money can then be spent on recruiting a certain number of fighters (up to six per district) or on upgrading the equipment in their hands. The type of hireable unit is rather small even if differentiated: there are men armed with machine guns as good as cannon fodder, rather than scouts able to identify the attacks of the opposing gangs or support units that can heal their comrades and so on. These fighters can then be used to protect the territory or alternatively to attack a nearby area. That's all. Don't expect to be able to command them to, perhaps, implement some sort of urban warfare tactics. All you can do is send them into disarray while you play the main character accompanied by up to two additional bodyguards. The main character can be controlled in two ways, the default ~RTS~ type - select, point, click - and the alternative to GTA which allows us to directly control the protagonist with a view behind him. For practical matters and also for immersion, the second mode would be the best, if it weren't for the fact that the control system is complicated, not very immediate and not at all intuitive even after several hours of play. Camera management, combined with motion controlin fact, they give life to a sort of Chinese torture where the direction taken by the character on the screen never corresponds to that desired by the player. Instead, using the isometric 3D view, we will have to deal with the imprecision of the pointing system that shows the side especially during the evolution of the most crowded and excited fights. The firefights represent the heart of the game but - unfortunately - their implementation did not appear to us up to expectations. Confusing, monotonous and with the opposing NPCs who, apart from the characteristic of running away when they are about to die, certainly do not have noteworthy AI scripts, the clashes proposed by the game fail in the slightest to reproduce the feeling of titles such as Freedom Force. In the end it all comes down to clicking on an enemy and, when possible, selecting the type of shot and activating any additional skills, rather than calling for external help waiting for the selected target to die before us. The discriminating factors between life and death are numerical superiority and the availability of power ups. Certainly not the positioning of the fighters, rather than the exploitation of the territory and of the covers or the synchronicity of the game actions. The quick overview is concluded by the possibility of enhancing the protagonists with an RPG-inspired system. By conquering districts and concluding additional missions not directly related to the achievement of the main objective, experience points are earned that can be spent to improve physical and mental abilities and to acquire special skills. Also in this case, the choices available always seem to be guided towards a funnel that impoverishes this aspect, making it accessory and practically useless. Shaders for everyone! Unexpectedly, the technical component perhaps plays the best part of the whole title. If we exclude a subdued sound section, the graphics of Paradise City is able to offer an adequate visual impact even with systems that are certainly not powerful. On the contrary. The graphic style then, rather cartoonish and lively, appears successful even if we are faced with monotonous and repetitive scenarios. The attempt to differentiate the three playable characters both with a personalized set of animations and with a range of ~themed~ phrases is to be applauded, but it is just a small thing. The streets of the cities then teem with characters and vehicles, while the cycle between day and night dynamically illuminates the scenario that will be the backdrop for our raids. the technical component perhaps plays the best part of the whole title Shaders for everyone! Even on the multiplayer front, the title manages to raise its fortunes a little. If only for the fact of being able to play both in LAN and through an ancient 56 Kbit using the now ubiquitous GameSpy service. Up to 8 players can battle it out for control of the city. At this juncture, the paucity of the strategic component and the monotony of the clashes are less felt, by virtue of the human component and the rather peculiar type of game. Halifax has informed us that, contrary to what was previously written, the game is entirely translated into Italian. PC - System Requirements Processor demands aside, even systems from several years ago will be able to run Escape from Paradise City with acceptable fluidity. Minimum Requirements Windows 95 with DirectX 9 64 MB Graphics Card 2 GHz Processor 512 MB RAM 1.5 GB Disk Space DVD Player Comment Difficult to find really positive elements in this Escape from Paradise City. And we are very sorry about it, because the basic idea - although already presented at the time with Gangland - immediately seemed fresh and interesting. Unfortunately, questionable design choices and a sometimes insufficient game interface significantly undermine the overall result. We find it equally difficult to recommend the title to any type of player because, given the total absence of strengths, both strategy enthusiasts, action titles and managerial enthusiasts would risk being disappointed. At the same time, however, it must be recognized that the title is still sold at a budget price and therefore if you are looking for something different or have loved Gangland madly ... you can also spend a few euros. Pros Popular system requirements Attempts to (re)purpose something new Interesting multiplayer mode Cons Unchallenging and monotonous game mechanics Game interface could be improved Escape from Paradise City is available for PC. Although it was developed by an unknown software house and the information prior to publication certainly did not make theand crazy, Escape from Paradise City (from now on more simply... Paradise City) was a title awaited - at least by whoever is writing - with a certain curiosity, with the naive hope of finding the proverbial title in one's hands which no one expects but which on balance manages, despite the lack of high-sounding publishers and billionaire budgets, to present a solid and well-structured gaming experience. After a rather positive debut with Gangland, for their second chapter the developers of Sirius Games have in fact once again tried to merge at least three usually heterogeneous genres into the same container. In fact, the recipe followed by the designers provides a solid base inspired by strategic titles, with the addition of mechanics more typical of RTS, a large sprinkling of RPG elements and, finally, a certain aftertaste of free-roaming action titles a la GTA . But as even the most inexperienced of cooks knows, when the individual ingredients turn out to be first-rate, if the amalgam fails, the resulting dish risks not being up to par: here, this is the case of Paradise City . Imagine what can happen then, when even the ingredients aren't exactly of the highest quality...", "date": "2007-12-05", "grade": null}
