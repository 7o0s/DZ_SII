Less rigorous than in the early days, the game had more action veins and spectacular killings, but purists did not particularly appreciate the many defections on the stealth side, such as the impossibility of hiding enemy corpses. A sort of creative crisis followed which led to moving the works to the Ubisoft Toronto studios, led by the charming Jade Raymond, to bring the franchise back to its former glory. After three long years we have finally arrived at the fateful moment, Sam Fisher is back with a brand new adventure that reconnects to the events narrated in the previous chapters, including the relationship with his daughter Sarah and the return of historical colleagues from the series; even if it is possible to follow the events without knowing these references, it is clear that the story is essentially a continuation of Conviction, from which it takes its tone. A new threat risks obscuring the serenity of the country, that of the Engineers, a very dangerous terrorist organization equipped with cutting-edge technologies. After a bloody assault on the military base in Guam, the group informs the authorities of their evil intentions, a series of terrorist attacks punctuated on what is called the blacklist. A new anti-terrorist group called Fourth Echelon is therefore set up, able to move aboard the technological Paladin airplane and which sees our good Sam Fisher among its members. Taking advantage of the main panel of the Paladin, we have to face a long series of missions in disparate places to investigate the operations carried out by the Engineers, in order to discover their identity and put an end to the nightmare of their threat. Show me how you play and I'll tell you who you are As already ascertained in our preview, the Paladin is reconfirmed as one of the most innovative features of Splinter Cell: Blacklist, so much so that the game doesn't even have a main menu, but is entirely managed inside the plane, a real area freely explorable and which gives access to the various parts of the game. In this way the chapters of the campaign mix with the co-op missions, the online versus and the challenges proposed by the Ubisoft servers, all seamlessly. The player is therefore free to choose how to approach the game and benefit from each of its parts as a single ecosystem. Each mission leads to an increase in the internal currency that we can invest in increasingly sophisticated technological gadgets; the internal shop is directly linked to the briefing settings, along with an experience clearly gained in another Ubisoft production, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. But not only that, the Paladin himself can be upgraded with the money he earns, offering a number of sizable mission benefits that come in particularly handy at higher levels. A very stimulating structure that reinforces the statements made by Raymond regarding the importance of online modes. Despite this aspect, the developers have not neglected the single player campaign, one of the longest, most varied and replayable in the series, about ten hours depending on the level of difficulty and the approach used by the player. The other novelty is represented by the three combat profiles examined by the evaluation system: Ghost, Assault and Panther, where the first represents the stealth purist, the second who prefers frontal combat and the third something in between. The functioning of this system is as simple as it is effective: once the mission is completed, both online and offline, the game assigns scores on each of the three profiles and an adequate monetary reward. In this way it is possible to compare your results with those of your online friends, while there are specific score targets that force you to face the levels in order to meet the requirements. The idea is to stimulate the replayability of the scenarios, a feature already amplified by the presence of different ways and methodologies to reach the goal. Despite a substantially already established execution, the scenarios are open to personal interpretation and offer various ideas for interacting with artificial intelligence and the various gadgets made available, freely selectable from a practical ring that can be recalled with the directional cross. The last word on the line to follow is always up to the player, starting with the choice whether to kill or stun enemies, while the recovery operation of the characteristics of the franchise contemplatesto both the newfound concealment of the bodies and the multiple executions already seen in Conviction. The campaign enhances these prerogatives at all times by offering ever-changing situations: in a level clearly inspired by the Hitman saga we have to exploit a remote-controlled drone through a dedicated minigame, while in a section set in Philadelphia we find ourselves using the first-person view in place of the third canon. This unique feature is an introduction to one of the most surprising returns in the history of the franchise, the competitive mode Mercenaries against Spies which we will discuss later. Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a big comeback for the series A caged Sam Unfortunately, not everything works as it should in Blacklist, despite the commitment and ambition in wanting to build the most beautiful Splinter Cell ever, the historical defects of the series remain which translate into an artificial intelligence that is not always convincing. The control patrols are relentless in examining traces, identifying Sam or the bodies abandoned carelessly, but they move much less effectively once the alert dynamics have started with outcomes that become as variable as they are unpleasant in the moments in which the game drops the constraints of stealth. It is not uncommon to see enemies stuck behind doors or be totally unable to track down Sam, excluding types that move on pre-set patterns, such as armored soldiers or special forces, which are easily predictable. There was no shortage of more or less hilarious curtains in our sessions when not expected, even if in the average of the best titles of this generation, but the fact remains that similar gleanings take something away from the experience. The title apparently seeks a compromise between the rigor of the old episodes and more action-packed openings, however the dominant nature is that of stealth, with a system that ends up rewarding discreet conduct and precise game situations that force you not to be discovered, otherwise immediate game over. Absurdly, it is precisely these scenarios (fortunately few) that have exalted us the least due to the rigid trial & error structure, which forces us to repeat the same step several times in an attempt to find the right method to overcome them. All online Legacy mode of the old chapters and inexplicably eliminated in Conviction, Mercenaries against Spies returns in both classic and modernized form, still presenting the characteristic of asymmetrical multiplayer. Two teams of four elements compete in specific maps for the conquest of certain objectives; spies benefit from the most advanced technological equipment, are agile and enjoy both the ability to climb and a clearer general vision thanks to the third person view, on the other hand they are disadvantaged in head-on collision, the ideal field of action for mercenaries, which compensate with the high offensive arsenal and the first person view, the lack of incisiveness in the movements. Nostalgics can relive the emotions of the old modes seen in Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory, planning extremely tactical matches between two teams of two players, but the focus is on the Blacklist review which raises the number of participants to eight and relates the classes with the equipment already seen in the main campaign. This means being able to take advantage of the high amount of equipment and gadgets made available by the game to set up matches with completely different rhythms. Our tests confirmed the goodness of the servers, with matches that took place without particular impediments, but the online experience it certainly does not end here, the developers have prepared fourteen additional missions to be tackled both alone and in a cooperative, using Sam Fisher's trusted right-hand man, Isaac Briggs, among his collaborators. These missions go hand in hand with the main campaign, often revealing specific background or insights. Also in this case the variety is the master demonstrating the enormous work done by Ubisoft Toronto, from the classic checkpoint-based raid mode to the resistance ones, where we have to defend a position from growing hordes of enemies. This particular mode creates another link with Future Soldier, and is a pleasant diversion from the rigorous spirit of Splinter Cell. Grim's missions then carve out a place of honor, which even refer to the dawn of the saga with their rigorously stealth approach. In these cases we return to appreciate more than ever the pleasure of moving in more focused contexts where environmental analysis is stimulated, checkpoints are eliminated and fthe ghost approach is fundamental, essentially a gift that old enthusiasts will not fail to love. Xbox 360 goals Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist features a total of 47 objectives for the canonical 1000 player points. It starts from the most basic ones, which require the completion of the main campaign and the various modes, to the more complex ones which require you to master the three fighting techniques, the completion of all upgrades and so on up to the most coveted goal, the one which requires the completion of the game in Perfectionist mode, the most fearsome difficulty level, which will reward you with the beauty of 100 player points. Good luck! Remade cells Technically Splinter Cell: Blacklist follows the encyclopedic character of the project, trying to align with today's graphic standards. Compared to the build we tested for preview, the retail version features a high-resolution texture pack, which must be installed separately on Xbox 360, which however does not further increase the visual impact. Sam Fisher returns with the old animations that distinguish him, managing to charm with his elegant kills, however some details have left us perplexed, such as the use of the Unreal Engine. Ubisoft is famous for its proprietary engines, so it's surprising that a production run by the Toronto branch doesn't use them. Even if we will never know the reasons for such a decision, unfortunately we are forced to recognize some not very pleasant consequences, such as a certain woodiness of the controls and a not particularly high interaction. The detail is then very variable along the various missions: in general, we never go below certain qualitative thresholds, but we would have liked a less plasticky Sam Fisher in terms of aesthetics. Even the faces defend themselves well only when covered by motion capture sessions, especially the protagonists, where it is also possible to recognize the actors who play them, less so in the more generic realization of enemies and supporting actors. The image quality on consoles is not very satisfactory, a factor which leads us to think that the title operates at a sub HD resolution, suffering from the bottleneck of this end generation, a factor aggravated by some sporadic slowdowns. The sound sector is at its lowest levels, reduced to a mere ambient accompaniment, while the Italian dubbing is of a much different thickness, which sees the return of Luca Ward in great dust. As foreseeable, the result is of considerable impact.", "date": "2013-08-14", "grade": "9.0"}
