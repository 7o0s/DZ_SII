{"name": "Paradise Marsh", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paradise-marsh-recensione.html", "text": "It doesn't happen often, but in some rare and magical cases the video game can turn into a meditative experience, to discover oneself and one's place in the world. It happens with Paradise Marsh, in which the silence of the marsh invites the player to rediscover the slow pace of what really matters in life, immersing him among frogs, crickets, bees, snails and butterflies. Not extraordinary animals, but ordinary beings, simple as poem by Umberto Saba: like the ~hackneyed words that no one dared to~, ~worn out and conventional words that no poet dared to use anymore~, the critters that populate the swamp by Etienne Trudeau are charged with magic and a beauty that releases them totally from the dimension of the ordinary, projecting them into the firmament of the starry sky. Here their capture with a modest net takes us back to the wonderful dimension of childhood and the contemplation of nature that is around us, giving calm and inner peace. We tell you about this indie gem in our review of Paradise Marsh. The swamp is not what it seems A Paradise Marsh sunset A shower of shooting stars brings the protagonist an unexpected gift: a net to catch insects and small animals. We find ourselves in a swamp, we are completely alone. Except for a few scanty traces of human presence - an abandoned bicycle, a few axes for chopping wood, icicles, a soccer ball - only the little creatures who populate this iridescent place keep us company, where heaven and earth pass from day to night, and the seasons change in a matter of minutes. As you will soon discover, the objective of Paradise Marsh is to capture all the critters that live in the swamp. It's not about griffins, fire-breathing dragons or other out of the ordinary beings: our travel companions are spiders, toads and dragonflies, humble and ordinary animals, but capable of awakening our inner child and making us live an intensely poetic adventure in the its brevity. The lyricism of Paradise Marsh unfolds in about three hours, but this quiet and peaceful swamp can be rediscovered when needed, when you feel the need to return to a safe and soothing virtual place, and will be procedurally generated with each new game. We don't want to tell you anything about the developments of the plot of the game created by the Canadian Etienne Trudeau, because revealing its surprises would lead to an alteration in the players' experience: we can only say that in the swamp nothing is what it seems, and that the greatest wisdom comes sometimes from the humblest of animals. Owls, crows and sparrows always have a poem for us, while bees illustrate their hard work ethic, snails their cosmic pessimism, and toads invite us to free our minds to welcome the truths of the cosmos. Each dialogue with the little creatures of the swamp is intense, full of irony and a harbinger of introspection, as are the messages in bottles that emerge from the waters and give us snapshots of life and contemplation. Paradise Marsh invites players to follow the rhythms of nature and to appreciate its changes, and sometimes the best thing to do is sit on a wooden log and meditate on the transience of existence. How do we want to live it? What are our values? Are we sure we're giving the right weight to things? The swamp questions us about this and much more, but it's up to us, and only us, to find the answers we think are right. Catch them all! The screen is the main tool of Paradise Marsh As mentioned, the goal of Paradise Marsh is very simple, and so is its gameplay: through a first-person view, you have to wiggle your net and capture all the little animals that populate the mysterious swamp. All of this takes place in an artistic setting of absolute value, visibly inspired by the colors and pixel art of A Short Hike, in a mystical accord of terrestrial and celestial colors that live in a constant and wonderful change. One crosses a small but capable world to renew itself continuously, and there are numerous biomes, well characterized and distinct from each other: the humid forest, populated by snails, the Japanese garden, favored by butterflies and tadpoles, the snowy expanse, and many others. All the senses are important: we have often managed to catch an elusive snail or discover a toad that had stuck in a well thanks to the excellent acoustic clues, the result of an excellent audio design work curated by Disasterpiece (author, among other things , from the Fez soundtrack). The compositions help to maintain a state of tranquility and meditation, within the framework of a video game in which what matters is not so much the completion of the assigned mission, as the existential reflections that can arisewaxes in the player's mind. Normal is exceptional in Paradise Marsh Born from a game jam in 2020 and gradually expanded by Etienne Trudeau, Paradise Marsh has become a poem by Umberto Saba, capable of giving value to the most humble things, trivial only in appearance, because what matters is the ability to marvel in the gaze of those who observe them. The swamp is a family of creatures that are reflected in the firmament and their kindness inspires a similar state of mind in the player: we have discovered the beauty of small gestures that are only seemingly unimportant, such as throwing seeds around to give birth to yellow flowers and reds, and then the sense of sweet tension given by slowing down and uncovering our net to ensure that a butterfly does not fly away from its vegetable perch, catching it by surprise. Some small technical problems of the Nintendo Switch version do not affect the very high overall quality of the adventure, but we still have to report slight drops in frame rates and, on one occasion, we were forced to close the application and restart it due to a sudden freeze. Nothing that is able to affect the experience, mind you. We advise you to take a tour of the options to try out the various choices on pixel grain: the aesthetics of the swamp is in any case of an extraordinary beauty. At the moment there is no Italian translation and in Paradise Marsh there is a fair amount of texts, absolutely necessary to fully appreciate the plot of the game and the reflections of our animal companions: a good knowledge of the English language is therefore required.", "date": "2022-11-06", "grade": "8.5"}
