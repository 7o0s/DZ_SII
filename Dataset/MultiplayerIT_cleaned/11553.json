{"name": "Sam &amp; Max 204: Chariot of the Dogs - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sam-amp-max-204-chariot-of-the-dogs-recensione.html", "text": "With Night of the Raving Zombies we had left Sam and Max grappling with a rather serious problem, namely understanding where their friend Bosco had really ended up and saving him from what had all the guises of a kidnapping. The fourth chapter of Season 2 therefore begins precisely where the previous one ended, forming a sort of single great story that represents an experiment never tried before by the Telltale guys. The unedited setting is decidedly unexpected and, just when one had sweetly resigned to continuing the tour around the world, it comes in the form of an alien spaceship: a perfect starting point to talk about conspiracies and unpronounceable secrets, obviously without losing the occasion for a series of references with a strong parodistic flavor to the most abused clichs and cultural references. There will also be other themes and even crazy ideas, especially when it comes to time travel in a series of more or less short, really hilarious skits. Very precise choice The Telltale team, when it came time to collect the written material for this Chariot of the Dogs, must have realized how good the narrative cue was and the ideas for creating noteworthy puzzles were valid, consequently deciding not to include the now famous arcade sessions. No mini-games therefore, in favor of a more traditional structure which is also reflected in a slightly higher level of difficulty; nothing transcendental or causing excessive headaches, but still a clear request for greater use of gray matter, even at the cost of getting stuck in some points and having to make a few attempts before being successful. The beginning of the adventure takes place right inside the emporium of the disappeared Bosco and first asks to find the combination to open an armored door complete with laser beams to protect the lock, and then to complete the classic scientific experiment from middle school, complete with a model of a volcano to erupt using a precise chemical reaction. In both cases, the intelligence of the requests and the perfect balance of each situation, crazy in the way they are posed but extremely reasonable in the solutions, never fail to amaze and set a standard which is then maintained throughout the four-odd hours of longevity. The presence of the T.H.E.M., the alien life forms that kidnap the detective duo, and the time travel fit perfectly within the chosen drier gameplay. The seconds lead, from time to time, in the 70s, 80s, in an alternative present and also in the future, mixing references to historical facts that really happened with other invented ones and perhaps taken from other episodes, in which to intervene to change the course of events. All perfect, tastes permitting PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 3 800 MHz RAM: 256 MB Video Card: 3D 32 MB Disk Space: 240 MB Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 1.5 GHz RAM: 512 MB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core QX6700 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTS 320MB Comment The day Telltale misses an exit we will not fail to point it out; for the moment the quality is usually very high and although some variables have changed, the result of the equation is the same as always. Chariot of the Dogs is more ~point and click~ than the other chapters, but the greater emphasis placed on reflection does not clash or bore, partly for the goodness of the same, partly for the support guaranteed by the beautiful jokes and the crazy plot narrative. If we add to this the alien spaceship and the space-time paradoxes, it's not hard to come to terms with how much the not even nine dollars required to take it home is an amount that can be spent with pleasure. Pros Aliens, time travel and Sam & Max Longevity above average in the series, as for the previous chapter The puzzles are articulated and always well thought out Cons Mini-games are missing The next chapter will be the last in the series...", "date": "2008-03-18", "grade": null}
