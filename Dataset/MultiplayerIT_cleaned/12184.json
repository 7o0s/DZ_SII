{"name": "Championship Sprint - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/championship-sprint-recensione.html", "text": "Basically Championship Sprint is a simple two-dimensional driving game with four Formula One-like cars competing on fantasy tracks. During the races, especially in the advanced levels, some obstacles are introduced to make life more difficult for the pilots: we are talking about oil spots, puddles and even hurricanes. Going off the road at high speed, the car explodes, and a rescue helicopter immediately replaces it with a new one, however wasting precious seconds. By collecting the wrenches that appear randomly at the beginning of each new lap of the track, it is possible to access the screen which, between one race and another, allows you to increase the car's performance, intervening on acceleration, maximum speed and helicopter speed. rescue. The Sixaxis controls, even in the case of the analog sticks, are managed as digital, and this could create some problems for those with less control sensitivity, making the cars turn too sharply. After a short period of apprenticeship driving becomes decidedly less difficult, but the lack of the steering wheel continues to be felt in any case. The game has no real ending, and continues indefinitely until the player is defeated. Online multiplayer is a good addition, but perhaps not enough for Championship Sprint to be considered a ~must-buy~. Graphics and sound In cases like this it is almost embarrassing to have to write the paragraph dedicated to the technical sector, since both the graphics and the sound have not been ~refreshed~ at all, and are presented exactly as Atari did them back in 1986. The sound effects and above all the music, however, has the merit of being part of the history of video games by right (impossible to forget them). It must also be said that although a graphic update would have been more than appreciated, in particular cases such as these reissues of old classics it doesn't make much sense to stick too much on the technical aspect. Championship Sprint is a game very far from modern dictates, and consequently it could be absolutely bland and not at all interesting in the eyes of the new generations. The title is penalized by the fact that it cannot rely on the original and specially designed control system, and this limits its potential. In any case we are talking about an absolute must for those who have spent a fortune in the arcade cabinet, who will at least partially relive the emotions of the mid-80s. And let's not forget that it costs less than 5. Pros Online multiplayer A must for the nostalgic Cons No track editor Without the original control system it loses a lot of appeal Championship Sprint made its first appearance in bars and arcades in 1986, when there were world championships in Mexico, Spain and Portugal entered the European Community and probably many of the readers who are reading this article were not born yet. Championship Sprint, together with its ~twin~ Super Sprint, also branded Atari, was the predecessor of other games of the same genre that had great success, such as Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road or Bad Lands. The cabinet housed two steering wheels (that of Super Sprint three) which had the particularity of being able to turn indefinitely, without mechanical limitations and without any force feedback. This translated into sharp, lightning-fast turns, with the steering wheel left spinning until the car pointed in the right direction.", "date": "2007-06-19", "grade": null}
