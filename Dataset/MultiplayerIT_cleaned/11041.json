{"name": "Football Manager 2009 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-2009-recensione.html", "text": "Certainly there is no need to present a series like Football Manager nor its creators Sports Interactive, given that year after year the game has changed its name and publisher without losing practically anything from its supremacy while the competitors took turns in the unfortunate attempt to steal the king's scepter of football simulators. Like every year, the SIGames guys are attentive to the requests of their fans by introducing a 3D engine dedicated to matches as the main novelty, as well as obviously a whole series of new additions to the game mechanics that surround the true beating heart of the series: the huge database of players and technical staff, among other things in these days adopted by Everton to find talent in the real world. The graphics engine If the classic lineup of reviews sees the technical sector at the bottom of the article, for once it's worth making an exception to the rule by talking about the expected 3D engine that replaces the 2D one we were used to by now, which can however be activated at will. choice in case the 3-dimensional one doesn't like it or doesn't allow the game to run decently on your PC. Although obviously we are not faced with the graphic detail of a Pro Evolution Soccer or a FIFA, Football Manager 2009 is also appreciated from this point of view, not without some small hitches probably due to the inexperience of the developers in this area. Most of the qualities of the graphics engine come out when you start to notice the coupling with the engine that instead moves the game actions, already from the 2 dimensions practically corresponding to reality: seeing your players move and exchanging balls now crosses a new frontier , bringing the gaming experience closer to the livable one from a real bench with a new fundamental element. Someone could object that the competition has been using for some time what is presented in FM 2009 as a novelty: true, but the absence of a certain level of realism in the movements of the players reproduced by the engines of the other games must in any case be taken into account, difference from what we are now facing, supported as we have already said by a well-tested artificial intelligence that really leaves very little room for comparisons with other managers. We were talking about a few small flaws: first of all the animations don't always fully convince, especially those of the goalkeepers who in certain situations are somewhat reminiscent of sacks of potatoes rather than agile and jerky men. On the other hand, the removal of one of the two sliders to regulate the speed of the simulation is inexplicable, now reduced to just one concerning the speed of the passage of time: at the expense of the very useful one that regulated the speed of the salient actions, now necessarily viewable when scrolling normal of the time. A success beyond the brand The history of Football Manager is quite recent, dating back to a few years ago when Sports Interactive and Eidos suddenly divorced, after the Championship Manager brand (Scudetto from us) had already been on the crest of the wave for several years now. For copyright reasons, after passing under the banner of Sega, the development team had to abandon the CM brand, now in the hands of an internal Eidos studio, switching to the current Football Manager brand: all this without losing in the least its loyal group fans, who every year contribute to the search for data to be included in the game database, a real treasure of this title together with the many years of experience accumulated by SIGames. Not just 3D Limiting the FM2009 news to the graphic engine alone would be a mistake, given that, like every year, SIGames gives us some new adjustments here and there which usually embellish parts of the gameplay already summarily introduced in previous years: this is the case of relations with the press, now transformed into real conferences from which to try to motivate one's players while perhaps managing to scare the opposing ones at the same time. A valid support is constituted by the assistant coach, effectively neglected and relegated to a marginal role in previous versions of the game: now our trusted assistant will offer us valuable information and evaluations on our team, directing us on the right path even during the games, trying to suggest what goes and what doesn't in the performance of the team. Precisely with regard to the conferences, it is also possible to play the Mourinho and feed Baresi of the situation to the press, experiencing the risk that he may say something wrong or, vice versa, that he proves to be a skilled communicator, even better than us: in reality this also becomes one chanceto skip a phase which, once the initial enthusiasm has passed, could prove to be a bit boring, also because the risk of running into some misunderstandings is quite high, with consequent disastrous effects on the morale of one's team. Long ball and pedal One of the most welcome additions to the tactics management system sees the possibility of telling your players how to behave, actually teaching them how to stay on the pitch by showing them the behaviors to adopt in the various phases of the game, abandoning an attitude we do not like or vice versa trying something new: nothing that can make a bad boy a champion, but it's still nice to try to shape one of your pupils by correcting their flaws in tactical vision. Unfortunately, one of the defects most often encountered in recent years in FM returns, namely the high rate of injuries that often affect the more technical players and therefore targeted by opponents' kicks: patch 9.1 has arrived just in these days 0 of the game, intended to correct this problem and others encountered, something that SIGames has shown to be able to do very well even in recent years to correct the shot in the running. Another small flaw is the leveling of the players' statistics values downwards, but it must also be said that some could see this as a positive element towards realism, given that in the past, especially after a certain number of seasons it was possible to witness the birth of champions as if they were mushrooms. The most annoying bug is perhaps the one that when typing characters from the keyboard ends up replicating some of them: the name of the undersigned, for example, has magically become RRosario or Salatielllo. Market bombs Another cornerstone of a football manager is obviously that of transfers, which has always been a real cross and delight for us virtual coaches, also in FM 2009. The rumors about transfers fully reflect reality, sometimes bringing our name closer to that of characters we have never heard of or sometimes instead taking us, which in an online game can greatly benefit the other players. The transfer market system itself has been improved to make trading more like real life, especially from CPU-controlled teams who are now more flexible and closer to the behavior of their real life counterparts. ultimately always the best manager around Comment Also this year Football Manager proves to be at the top of its genre, leaving very little room for its competitors. However, the crossing of a transition phase is made evident by the 3D engine, which is not without some flaws which prevent it from being promoted 100% but which undoubtedly do not jeopardize what is an excellent basis for future editions, in which perhaps to implement new parts of the gameplay just by exploiting the possibility of seeing the games in 3 dimensions: which would only benefit the entire game, which perhaps begins to suffer a little too much from the presence of the same mechanics from year to year to which they are added contour elements. In any case, returning to the present, the rest of the additions go as usual to make some tweaks here and there, improving the great view already present, although a little something, as by now tradition, will need some patches to fully enjoy what we are facing: in definitive always the best manager around.

Multiplayer.it: Give us a little introduction about your work and your background. Miles Jacobson: Hi I'm Miles Jacobson, I've been with Sports Interactive for about fourteen yearsn years and I've been the studio director for seven. I'm not a programmer or even a designer, my job is also to give ideas and suggestions for our titles but above all to evaluate the quality of the team's work and manage relations with SEGA which publishes us. M.it: Management is not a genre in which it is easy to innovate and maintain freshness in the proposed contents. How do you manage this need? MJ: We work in a rather unique way. We don't have real designers, we make sure that everyone can contribute their own ideas to the creation of the next chapter and to do this we have divided the team into different sub-groups, by type of work, so that each of them can move independently and suggest possible news related to your field of interest. Then of course we follow the community of enthusiasts, directly and on the forums, trying to figure out what they liked and what they didn't, as well as obviously analyzing what they would like in the future. All these ideas and these suggestions are entered into a special database and used in special meetings that last about a week and are temporally positioned upstream of development: on these occasions we simply vote on each possibility, until we come to understand which ones are the best and therefore we develop them. It's a rather particular way of proceeding, it works with us, for example this is how the idea of including the press conferences was born. M.it: What relationship do you have with football? Are you all fans and is it a fundamental requirement to work with you? MJ: Football is not essential for everyone and not required. Those who work on the flow of data and their management, for example, are often not a big fan, but for other positions related to the development of game dynamics it is instead a fundamental requirement. In general, therefore, we are big fans: I have a season ticket for three teams and it happens very often that team members send me emails on Wednesdays to tell me that they leave work early to go and watch the games. It's not critical, but it's very important to us. M.it: Speaking of technology, for the first time this year you have a 3D engine that allows you to view matches in this way too. Combined with the algorithms and artificial intelligence you already have, do you think in the future you can also include the possibility to play the game directly? M. J.: No, and the explanation is simple: usually, although set to realism, football action titles offer gameplay made up of evolutions, spectacular shots and a whole series of options that make matches extremely faster and more spectacular than they are in reality. reality; we use a totally and exclusively realistic approach, which would badly adapt to the demands of the players. I don't think a good product would come out and we prefer to leave this task to the various EA, Konami and SEGA (during the day he made several references to SEGA Sports, who knows if he knows anything about a new Virtua Striker; Ed.). After all, it's a matter of context, ours is different: if you take Call of Duty and Gears of War and reverse them in the settings and atmospheres, the result will never be as good as the originals. M.it: You have a project in the pipeline that will push the accelerator to online, Football Manager Live. Can you tell us something about that? MJ: The regular series will grow from this point of view with the increasing diffusion of broadband, for the moment we have launched this title, FM Live, which allows about a thousand users on each server to create their own fantasy team and launch it in leagues against other users. On the one hand, in this case too, we have the management and trading options, which have however been lightened so as to make room for the customization of the team, which everyone will have to feel like their own creation in all respects. Then there are tournaments and leagues that can be customized as desired, in short, there are many tools for interaction and sharing which, while not making it a true MMOG, make it truly the best in terms of social gaming within our reference genre. M.it: This year's edition will be released on PC, Mac and PSP. Why didn't you also focus on consoles? M.J.: Last year we released the Xbox 360 version and despite the efforts we put into it - in not forcing hard drive installation, for one thing - it just wasn't good enough that even the ratings were several points lower than the Xbox 360 version. to the PC version. The problem is mainly to be found in the controls, which were not good enough; when we decided not to go down the same path this year we found, even unexpectedly, the support of SEGA which", "date": "2008-11-19", "grade": null}
