Simpson is still able to build a popularity based only on this degree of kinship rather than real artistic skills! Reviewing such a title was our moral obligation... even if we don't know exactly what it means! LOL Kim Kardashian: Hollywood teaches us that the road to success can be very boring... K everywhere!!11!!1 It is immediately clear that Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is a game dedicated to us young people: there are Ks used inappropriately instead of Cs, something never seen in a mobile title! Following this concept, the initial character creation screen is titled Kustomize instead of Customize (super karino!), and it is also the first approach to the fairy world of the star system of which the legendary Kim is a part: here it is possible to model our alter ego by choosing gender, skin color, hair type, etc., thanks to a simple but complete editor at the same time. Once this is done, we are introduced to the plot that forms the backdrop to the adventure: usually we young people don't like history at all - especially the one they teach at school - but fortunately here it is very trivial and is liquidated in a few screens. The protagonist is a simple clerk in a Los Angeles boutique, and as he is about to close the shop he runs into none other than the legendary Kim, afflicted by a very serious problem: she has to go to a party and doesn't have the right outfit! Between ~oh my God~ in profusion, with our good heart dressed up in a really super fashionable t-shirt we manage to get Kim a dress suitable for the occasion (among other things by giving it to her, because we know she doesn't have much money to part, poor thing!), and to thank us so much, she offers us the possibility of pursuing a career as a model, arranging a meeting with a photographer who will create our book! This is where the real game starts, which could be defined as a sort of cross between an RPG and a management system, but don't worry, young trendy friends: these loser definitions simply mean that in Kim Kardashain: Hollywood you pass the time clicking on menus and boxes, moving from one setting to another, accumulating experience, money and all sorts of cute and shiny things. In addition to Kim, there are many characters to talk and interact with, and you can even start a love relationship with a boy or a girl! Every action can have positive or negative consequences on our status as a rising star of showbiz, an element that is reflected in the number of followers we manage to accumulate in a social network similar to Twitter within the game itself. Unfortunately, the title doesn't give us the possibility of dramatically increasing our notoriety by posting amateur porn online like the legendary Kim did, and this is just the first in a series of really nasty flaws. :( If on the one hand Kim Kardashian: Hollywood can boast a more than discreet technical sector, with well-designed two-dimensional graphics and an audio accompaniment up to the situation (with some lines of dialogue even dubbed by Kim herself!), on the other song it takes very little to realize that under this glossy surface there is little substance. Some might see in all this a mocking metaphor of the vacuity of the Hollywood star system, but we boys are bored just writing something like that! We'll just say that, as you'd expect from a free download, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is a money-eating machine, with a shameless emphasis on in-app purchases. However, we must give credit to the Glu developers for having built a remarkable infrastructure to achieve their goal: every action you perform consumes energy, and to recharge it you need to go through the dedicated shop if you don't want to wait the time necessary for it to regenerate alone. Furthermore, the game requires disbursements of virtual currency at a dizzying pace (after all we are in Hollywood, not in Cerignola!), and it is difficult to satisfy all the needs of the case without using the real credit card. Finally, the most valuable items that often and willingly prove to be indispensable to continue can only be purchased through K-shaped emblems, which must necessarily be bought with real money given that very few can be collected during the adventure. All things that would be even remotely acceptablei if the game were really exciting and fun: it's a pity that, instead, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is reduced to a mere repetition of the same actions (posing for photos, visiting your agent, buying new clothes, going to a party and starting over from 'beginning), in a trend that some may even find hypnotic but that we boys of the Multiplayer.it staff have only bored. We only regret that poor Kim has received death threats because the application is subject to some crashes: it must be the usual mud machine of the haters, since in our experience we have not encountered major problems.", "date": "2014-07-22", "grade": "5.0"}
