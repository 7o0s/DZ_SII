{"name": "Star Ocean 3: Till the End of Time", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-ocean-3-till-the-end-of-time-2.html", "text": "Freediving in Space The narrative plots have never been the strong point of the Star Ocean saga, and the players of the confusing and yet exciting Star Ocean: the Second Story will remember it well, but it must be said that this third episode manages to excite and capture the player, after a rather slow start, in a spiral of twists, mysteries and revelations. Also in Star Ocean 3 there are references to the prequels, albeit in minimal quantities, so not having played the rest of the trilogy will not compromise the understanding of the events, which will end up reconnecting to another famous and unthinkable Enix production, which we will not mention not to spoil the surprise. The story of Star Ocean 3 stars the combative and listless nineteen year old Fayt Leingod, who at the beginning we will find on vacation on the exotic planet Hyda IV with his parents, renowned scientists, and best friend Sophia Esteed; everything runs smoothly, until the complex where the holiday is taking place is attacked by a mysterious military fleet, which seems to have nothing to do with the Empire, a tenacious opponent of the Pangalactic Federation. In the escape, Fayt is separated first from her parents and then from Sophia, finding herself lost after a few days on an unknown planet, with the desire to be reunited with her parents and her friend. But it seems that his role in the big story that is about to begin will not only be that of a lost boy... The best RPG of this generation? The first impression from Star Ocean 3 is that it is a simple game after all. The combat system, as it is presented at the beginning, is nothing so surprising or innovative: no random encounters, total freedom of movement on the battlefield, real-time battles based on pressing various keys to launch normal and special attacks that vary according to the distance from the enemy, three characters, one of which is used directly by the player and the other two by the PlayStation 2 AI. But it only takes a few hours to understand that the whole thing is much deeper than what think, indeed it is enough just to open the main menu and take a look at the various options to realize that everything is destined to get complicated. Returning to the fights, they become more complex and strategic as the player is offered new skills, special attacks, spells and options: a system similar to the Chinese pen will force the player to timely select the right attack to launch and combine with others for executing devastating combos of magic and special shots, all while giving simple orders to the other two party characters, perhaps switching to controlling one directly with the simple press of a button. With a little practice, you end up with a sort of fighting game grafted into an RPG (it is no coincidence that you can play a sort of ~Versus Mode~) that competes with the Tales of Symphonia combat system for the best seen for a few years now. And as in the Namco title, the fights are also influenced by external options that affect the performance of the heroes involved: by spending particular Skill Points earned in battle, it is possible to combine each character with a series of additional skills of various kinds, to improve or vary them war performance. These Skill Points, however, will be useful for enhancing statistics, becoming the fulcrum of a truly varied, deep and well-crafted character ~customization~ system, which even includes the possibility of creating objects, weapons and armor . Other goodies characterize Star Ocean 3, such as the Trophies System, which assigns ~trophies~ depending on the performance in combat (unlocking secrets and bonuses), or the rewards for the complete exploration of the game maps: after all, secondary elements , but which allow you to fully enjoy a title full of respectable playful elements. Technically Stellar? Star Ocean 3 is a title from three years ago, this must be remembered when you notice the woodiness of some animations or the approximate detail of facial expressions. As a premise it suggests the worst, but that's not the case: everything else is excellent. Not only the character design, clearly Japanese and captivating, but also and above all the care taken in the creation of the environments, graphically amazing. Another honorable mention deserve the special effects that flood the battles with light trails, lens flare, distortions and spectacular visual elements that embarrass the luminous esoteric formulas of XenoSaga Episode I. So if we find ourselves graphicallyfaced with a product that counterbalances some defects with numerous advantages, while not reaching the artistic peaks of Final Fantasy X (let's say that Star Ocean 3 is placed between the tenth Final Fantasy and the third Suikoden), on the sound side one is seriously mediocre and approximate dubbing: in Japan dubbed by famous voices in the field of Japanese animation, the characters of Star Ocean 3 in the western version are presented with unsuitable and listless voices, badly synchronized with the lip movement. On the other hand, the soundtrack is splendid: composed by Motoi Sakuraba, former author of the soundtracks of Valkyrie Profile and Star Ocean: the Second Story, it presents a great variety of themes that are always suitable for the moment in which they are listened, whether it is a fight, a dramatic sequence or a funnier one. It had been a while since PlayStation 2 owners could not find an RPG worthy of the name on the shelves: fortunately, even if a little late, Star Ocean 3 fills this gap wonderfully. A worthy heir to its legendary prequels, the new tri-Ace effort is undoubtedly one of the most complex and profound products ever made in the field of J-RPGs, thanks to a fun combat system and great customization possibilities that offer options, skills, objects and much more. Together with a not very intricate but fascinating and engaging plot, which unfolds over 2 DVDs for about 40 hours, and the multitude of secret and optional quests, we find a fluctuating technical sector, which is divided between questionable audiovisual choices and other excellent ones, however without undermine the general quality of the product. All fans prepare their wallets, the others give Star Ocean: Till the End of Time a chance to start loving the genre, because it undoubtedly deserves it. Pros: Excellent combat system Stunning environments and great soundtrack Complex, deep and long-lived Cons: Some graphic choices show the weight of the years Mediocre voice acting Once upon a time there were two Japanese software houses, Enix and Squaresoft. The two companies were contending for the title of best J-RPG producer for consoles, and it was a tough fight between the Final Fantasy saga and that of Dragon Quest. One fine day, the two companies realized that they could not continue to live off the infinite sequels of their most famous franchises and so, considering that both were not doing well economically, they decided to merge into a single softco with a highly original name of Square Enix. This happened in 2002. The merger of Square and Enix will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the crucial moments in the history of the video game market, also because it involved consequences that are not to be laughed at: one of these concerned the third episode of one of the most popular and famous sagas of Enix and the developer tri-Ace, or Star Ocean, born on SNES and continued on PSOne. Announced to the great surprise and happiness of fans in 1999, Star Ocean 3 underwent appalling delays due to the problems Enix was going through before and after their marriage to Squaresoft, and when it hit the market in 2002 it made a disastrous bang, due to the countless bugs that plagued the entire programming. However (Square) Enix believed in Star Ocean 3, and the same was true for all the fans, who a year later saw the glitzy Star Ocean 3 Director's Cut appear on the shelves, essentially the same game with a lot of extra elements (dungeons , playable characters, quests) and above all private from the bugs that had undermined its reputation. So, a year later, we Westerners find ourselves in our hands a splendid package (the American edition comes in a double package) which includes two DVDs containing the Director's Cut version, in English. At a time when RPGs abound on the console market, between Tales of Symphonia and Phantom Brave, X-Men Legends and Megaman X Command Mission, one wonders if the wait has paid off.", "date": "2004-10-13", "grade": null}
