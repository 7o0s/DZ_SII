{"name": "Nano Breaker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nano-breaker.html", "text": "The game In Nano Breaker we will take command of Jake, a cyborg equipped with a weapon that allows him to destroy his opponents at a molecular level. On the island, now invaded by monsters of all kinds, all this will be very useful to us: Jake can perform a huge number of devastating combos, even capable of eliminating enemies with a single blow. Obviously the fulcrum of the game is made up of the fights: the two attack buttons, to which a back button is added, must be pressed in certain sequences to give rise to as many attacks, more or less effective. Along the way we will find chips that it will be possible to ~assemble~ to access new, increasingly powerful moves, starting from a list divided by type of attack (frontal, vertical, jumping, etc.). The end result is impressive, at least in numbers: Jake can eliminate opponents in so many ways that in the end it becomes difficult to describe them all. Unfortunately, however, the spectacular nature of some maneuvers does not translate into a satisfactory result, and so we will soon put aside the more spectacular combos, which make us show our side, in favor of more banal but ~practical~ moves: a real Sin. Through the fights it is also possible to enhance the character or even gain some vital energy, so don't be surprised by the incredible amount of opponents you will face and who will not fail to reappear when you cross areas you have already visited. And then there are the bosses: huge but not exciting in terms of design, they will try in every way to tear you apart, but it will be enough to learn their ~habits~ to defeat them... Technical analysis Nano Breaker is a title absolutely devoted to action, and this is not denied by the sporadic ~missions~ present, nor by the interaction between the characters. Unfortunately, however, the developers have done everything but a good job as regards the management of the view and above all the collision detection: playing with Nano Breaker brings to mind the ingenuity of the first 3D action games, and in this there is no nothing good. In fact, it is not possible to look for competition with Devil May Cry or God of War when the fights are cumbersome, the camera struggles to follow the action and the shots don't go well. The presence of numerous moves cannot remedy the crime, which unfortunately heavily undermines the playability. And everything is somewhat reflected in the technical realization: the settings are not at the level of current PS2 productions, and the engine in general struggles to manage the most crowded situations. The design of the enemies, then, varies from sufficient to poor (the bosses are really bad, for example). The soundtrack is well made and has very beautiful and atmospheric music, too bad they don't fit the action at all: a piano-based theme would be fine during the explorations of a survival horror, but it cannot be a soundtrack to a series of fights between Jake and the biomechanical monsters Comment The new Konami product cannot possibly compete with the other illustrious exponents of this genre, for sure. Blame the numerous design problems: the developers perhaps wanted to put together something different, but for one reason or another they failed. And so Nano Breaker is a mediocre action game, with a soft charm that will conquer only the less demanding gamers. Which is a pity, because certainly some ideas (such as the ~to be built~ combo system) are valid and should have been better thought out for a screen transposition. Fighting against dozens of monsters with no rhyme or reason, mostly resorting to the same moves, can only be entertaining for a very short time Pros: Lots of moves available Cons: many of which prove to be ineffective Sparse and poorly detailed settings Linear and cumbersome Given the potential of nanotechnology, the United States government decides to finance a long-term project which, within a few years, revolutionizes technology as we know it. An entire island, with its inhabitants, is set up as a site for experimentation: nanomachines capable of combating or causing diseases are introduced into people, depending on the area of use. The electronic brain that controls them, however, suddenly goes crazy, and so the nanomachines begin to reproduce in a reckless way, taking possession of the bodies of the inhabitants of the island, transforming them into dangerous biomechanical monsters. Sending a team of cyborgs does not solve the situation, and so a researcher decides to reach the island alone, in an attempt to deactivate the computer responsible for the accident. The numerous threats present, however, convince the resresponsible for US military operations to send a mighty warrior to escort her: Jake", "date": "2005-04-07", "grade": null}
