Born way back in 2012 on Kickstarter thanks to a microscopic crowdfunding that asked for less than 7000 dollars, the project was funded for the skin of the ear and went out on the market in early 2013. But that was only the beginning. In fact, the video game was based on that episodic structure made famous by the works of Telltale Games - The Walking Dead above all - but, despite the excellent premises, the development began to expand dramatically to the point that from the initial idea of a quarterly release, we find ourselves in these weeks with the fourth chapter of the five planned, three and a half years after the debut of the first part. Here on Multiplayer.it we have thought several times in the past of reviewing individual episodes but the strongly indie nature combined with this so rarefied distribution method made us initially lean towards a review of the complete product only when we had the final game, complete in all its parts. However, it is evident that we have changed our minds for a whole series of reasons: it is not known when we will be able to see the fifth chapter and considering that by now the contents are abundant, it did not seem very intelligent to deprive you readers of our opinion on Jake's work Elliott and Tamas Kemenczy. So that we can maybe convince you to proceed with the purchase of this incredible jewel: a very small pearl that if it will be in your ropes will make you fall madly in love. Before leaving you to the description of the title, however, it is important to point out that the game is sold at a single price, quite substantial to be honest, of  22.99 including all the episodes released so far and the fifth that will arrive no one knows when. It is therefore clear that today this price is certainly more justified than one or two years ago since there is much more substance but keep in mind that each episode lasts an hour at most and therefore let's talk, today, approximately four hours of gameplay. Kentucky Route Zero is the indie adventure you have to buy, no ifs, ands or buts Under the banner of originality Let us immediately try to explain what Kentucky Route Zero is, but above all what it is not. It is a graphic adventure, in the literal sense of the term: an adventure experience completely oriented towards narrative. There are no verbs to click or puzzles to solve; there is no possibility of dying, nor are there moments in which we will have to make decisions that will jeopardize our moral integrity; there are no quick time events or action sections. It's a simple, pure, fascinating adventure where the protagonist will have to travel a lot, a lot, starting with a small pickup truck on the desolate roads of Kentucky and meeting new characters who decide to accompany him in his long epic. In this journey of a lifetime he will discover new, incredible scenarios where fantasy and reality, illusion and concreteness will mix, leaving the player completely ensnared and amazed. The game joins the vein of the so-called, in a disparaging tone, walking simulators in the style of the splendid adventures of Tale of Tales (The Graveyard or The Path in particular) or like the more recent Oxenfree, Firewatch or Fragments of Him, not to mention sacred monsters such as Journey, Gone Home or Dear Esther. The player must ~limit~ himself to go forward, to follow the course of events according to his own rhythms, observing them and remaining involved and fascinated by them, limiting himself to a very limited series of interactions with the objects and elements of the scenario but above all participating in the very long and splendid dialogues that represent the true backbone of this video game. In fact, the player will be continuously given the opportunity to interact with a fairly classic system of multiple-choice conversations but the true connotation of originality of Kentucky Route Zero is that it will not always be about ~classic~ dialogues. Indeed, to be honest, the normal answers to a question represent the least number of possible interactions because for most of the time, we will have to choose between the thoughts of the protagonist, between the discussions of characters that we may have never seen and that we will never meet and who comment what is happening on the screen from offstage, between descriptions of environments or objects, between multiple choices that determine our progress within simulated text adventures and even between fake loud conversations involving animals that obviously cannot answer us. We realize that said in this way we only risk confto give you ideas but the exceptional work of Elliott and Kemenczy is a truly atypical and very difficult video game to explain in words and, in this regard, we hope that the videos in this article will be a valid aid to clarify the situation. Concretely, then, is Kentucky Route Zero an adventure limited to just wandering around places going from one multiple choice of a dialogue to the next? Wanting to reduce it to a minimum, yes, but it is the incredible artistic quality of the game world set up by the Cardboard Computer guys that amazes, as well as the splendid variety of environments that will show themselves to your eyes and, most of these, will give also gives rise to atypical, surprising and incredibly original game situations. It's not just about narrative crossroads and scenarios that will open up based on your choices but about continuous, small surprises where your role as a player will often be canceled or re-proposed in truly anomalous interpretations. An audio-visual continuum However, Kentucky Route Zero is, first of all, a wonderful visual experiment that contains an artistically incredible imagery. And it's really incredible to think that all this can emerge from a development team made up of just two people. Graphically, the game offers a sort of pixel art with wireframe elements and which presents very sparse characters and environments modeled with few squared polygons and clear lines. Almost a sort of evolution of the style of the old and never forgotten Another World and Alone in the Dark. In terms of atmospheres we are instead faced with a mixture of what was seen in the very first Tron film and a series of science fiction productions of the time, especially as regards the use of computers, terminals and imaginative machinery with absurd capabilities, with some influence of Twin Peaks but more generally of the early works of David Lynch in the use of colors and in the feeling of claustrophobia that combines well with the mental and imagination imbalances of the protagonist and some supporting actors. Let it be clear that we are absolutely not dealing with an adventure with a dark or even horror atmosphere. Exactly on the contrary, Kentucky Route Zero is a physical and psychological journey that moves from the country made of dusty roads and desolate meeting places to fantastic environments and strange psychedelic scenarios where it is difficult to understand who is observing the scene and above all what they really want to convey to us the two creators. But the result, and this is what really matters, is simply wonderful and incredibly evocative, also thanks to a soundtrack composed of a splendid musical carpet including a handful of sung songs, which combines country with impactful electronic rhythms. The sound effects are also excellent, all absolutely themed and able to perfectly recreate that technologically backward atmosphere that the game brings to the screen, alternating it with situations of absolute desolation and great intimistic strength. Despite the numerous dialogues there is no dubbing, with the exception of a few rare sections that must and want to stand out above all the rest. It is also essential to point out in these lines that Kentucky Route Zero is everything, completely in English and this element must be taken into great consideration because the enormous amount of text that the player will have to face, often quite complex for the issues addressed, it will not be easily understood by those who do not know the Albion language properly. Unfortunately at the moment a translation is not even planned but we do not struggle to imagine that some willing compatriot of ours can approach the development team to try the path of amateur translation.", "date": "2016-08-05", "grade": "9.5"}
