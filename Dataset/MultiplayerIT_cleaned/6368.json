In addition to facing the three bosses that the immense dragon has prepared for us, the class challenge for the paladin also awaits us and, as promised last week, we will draw up a special ranking of the best of the 31 cards in the adventure, asking you to share your thoughts on this in the final comments. In short, lots of irons in the fire: let's go! Laboratio Segreto concludes our experience with Massiccio Roccianera The ultimate adventure The first boss you will face is the Omnotron Defense system whose hero power summons a different robot with particular abilities at an ever-increasing casting cost. We will start with Arcatron, a robot with the special ability to assign both players two magic power, Toxitron which will do damage to all other minions at the start of each turn, Electron which will make both players' spells cost three mana down and Magmatron that will deal two damage to each player every time they play a card from their hands. In heroic mode Omnotron will have, in addition to the canonical 30 life points, also 15 armor points and the costs for summoning his robots will be reduced. This clash is not particularly complicated and you can easily overcome it in both modes, building a deck with many spells in order to take advantage of the summoning of Magmatron and the reduction in the costs of the spells that follows: we have drawn many cards with the Auctioneer of Mechanic and free spells of the wizard. Our second opponent will be Maloriak, in possession of Alchemist, a passive power rather easy to manage with any deck in normal mode. In fact, every time a player summons a minion under his control, the attack and defense will be reversed, precisely as the effect that activates the Mad Alchemist minion when it comes into play. Things will get very complicated in heroic mode in fact, in addition to the aforementioned effect, Maloriak's minions will benefit from a +2+2 when they come into play: we passed the battle after many attempts with a deck for the sorcerer mixed between 'Zoo' and Demolock adding Kezan Mystique due to the secrets Maloriak plays and Technocontroller due to the high number of minions the opponent will tend to play. Third boss and perhaps easier than the whole wing is Atramedes, the blind dragon that in World of Warcraft we had to defeat using the gongs scattered around the combat arena to confuse him. His hero power, Echolocation, makes the boss equip the Dragon's Tooth, a 0/6 weapon that increases his attack score every time we play a card. In addition, his attack will also be increased by three points from Sonic Breath, a special boss card. In normal mode at the start of the game you will receive three copies of a special card, the Resonant Gong which at the cost of one mana will destroy the boss's weapon making the fight very easy; in heroic mode there will be no gongs to help you however it will be enough to insert cards in your deck to destroy or weaken the opponent's weapon such as the Velerosse Corsair, the Marsh Slime or Harrison Jones. The final version of Nefarian, which is announced with a resounding ~Nefarian... again!~, is a challenge for which you will have to build a deck especially for heroic mode: his heroic power, for two mana, will put field two 2/1 or 4/2 Bone Servants depending on mode; to complicate matters, the moment you remove the armor from the dragon, his sister, the dragon Onyxia will arrive in his place with a 2/6 weapon and the Nefarian Attack power which will rain more and more balls on the hero of fire to single damage, as the rounds go by. In heroic mode the boss will have 30 armor instead of 10 and Onyxia's health will be 30 instead of 15: this fight, not very difficult at normal level, was completed in heroic both without bringing Onyxia into play and by beating her too . You will have to try to do a lot of damage in one go and play a particularly defensive game waiting for a minion who has accumulated enough attack to destroy Nefarian with a single attack; we used the paladin with Bolvar Domadraghi who, while still in your hand, increases the attack by 1 point every time one of your minions dies. The class challenge of the week will see the paladin face Omnotorn on a normal level and will be a very easy and not very particular challenge, perhaps the least fun of all the classes. We completeour collection with the last six cards that this adventure will make available to us: four are neutral dragons and let's start the analysis from these. Occultist Dragoid, for four mana is a 3/5 that gets a flat +1 +1 whenever he's the target of one of our spells. This dragon could find space in a deck, not necessarily dragons, which plays many cards to enhance its minions such as those of the priest or the devices of the robots; however we don't feel like going too far, for now it seems less strong than, for example, the Piloted Log Sawmill or other four-mana minions. The Volcanic Dragon costs six mana and is a 6/4 but it is possible to reduce its cost by one for each dead minion in the turn it is summoned: this dragon has excellent potential to be played even in decks without dragons given its ability to enter the field at low cost. In tests, it has happened more than once that its cost is two after an area spell; to take into consideration. The Draconid Destroyer is a six-mana 6/6 that if summoned when the opponent's life points are 15 or less, gets +3+3: we don't think you'll like to face a 9/9 when you're low on life or after the dragon Alexstraza has brought you to 15. Certainly used in ~mid-range~ decks. This week's legendary is his majesty Nefarian, an 8/8 at the cost of nine mana who, upon entering the field, puts two random spells of the opposing class into your hand: nobody likes the random component but imagine him in a priest deck that he already normally 'steals' six cards or more from you, do you really want to give him two more? Frivolous considerations aside, we don't know how much space it will find in competitive decks but it is certainly much less strong than Kel'thuzad the legendary Naxxramas or Ysera ultimate which is not attackable by the Hunting Expert. The Blackwing Corruptor is a minion similar to dragons, in fact he is a five-cost 5/4 who, upon entering the field, deals three damage to a target of our choice if we have a dragon in hand: he seems to us a very useful minion in a deck dragons, much stronger than the Bomb Thrower. To close, we have the spell for the paladin, Solemn Vigil which for five mana draws two cards and can reduce its cost by 1 for each minion that died in the turn in which it is cast: at first glance it doesn't seem miraculous, however we have tested is the Solemn Vigil will never cost five mana, considering its synergy with cards like the Military Rally. Our top three cards With the conclusion of Massiccio Blackrock, the time has also come to sum up the thirty new cards inserted. Here are our favourites, of course let us know which ones are yours! Thaurissan: this legendary is depopulating among Pro-Player decks, by far the best card of the adventure; Hungry Dragon: playable in any deck, we will certainly see her play in the future; Imp Bandleader: card that is helping to revive the zoo deck in a key of greater control. Looking forward The second Hearthstone adventure comes at a different time in the life of this game, Naxxramas had introduced the first 30 new cards and it seemed like a rather poor loot despite the excellent execution of the clashes which, even in the Blackrock Massif, underline the great attention that Ben Brode and company have put Worlf of Warcraft's most famous raids into a card game. After Goblins vs. Gnomes, adding ~only~ 31 cards is satisfying and will move the ~metagame~ just enough to create dragon decks or vary the most famous already existing decks (let's not forget that at the end of the year we will have over 100 new cards as stated by the developers themselves during our interview). In terms of gameplay, there are many novelties, in fact, there are now mechanics linked to the reduction of the launch costs of some cards in relation to the dead minions in the turn in which they are played or linked to the presence of dragons in the deck: still no particularly violent mechanics such as those that make the opponent discard cards but still new possibilities to build decks. Unfortunately the same goes for Naxxramas: the real limit of these adventures is the very low longevity and you will hardly go back to playing them again after completing them in Heroic mode; will be remembered as a fun way to get new cards. A final consideration concerns the difficulty of the heroic mode, which is generally rather prohibitive for players who don't have many cards (fortunately the new ones are obtained by beating the normal versions of the bosses).", "date": "2015-05-04", "grade": "8.0"}
