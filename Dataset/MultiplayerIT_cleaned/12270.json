{"name": "Two Worlds - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/two-worlds-recensione.html", "text": "Yet another unsung hero Every self-respecting role-playing game, at least those released on the computer, all have a big logical deficiency: in this Two Worlds we will play the role of a rude bounty hunter, who arrived in the Antaloor moors not to save the world, but only to bring up his (cool) sister who just happened to be mixed up in something big. As a side dish, the southern part of the continent has been invaded by peaceful (as much as an irritated Prussian) Orcs, who for the first time have been brought together under the leadership of a charismatic but unknown Messiah: you, willy-nilly, will find yourself not only in having to bring home the fur, yours and that of your little sister, but while you're at it you will also save the world from the new, repetitive and imminent catastrophe. However, the plot conceived by the creatives of Reality Pump, although it may seem like the usual heated minestrone, is actually unraveled in the best way, without ever falling into absurd twists and turns, but carefully pondering every single narrative element: it will never seem of fulfilling the classic ~go to A, do missions, get the reward~ system, but you will quickly be captivated by the vast world available. We do not hide from you that, at the beginning, we started off a bit biased: the resemblance to Gothic 3 is absolutely evident, even just for the appearance of your alter ego, and for the omnipresent presence of the Orcs: however we were pleasantly surprised to see whereas Two Words manages to distance itself from its competitors, showing its own refined personality: moreover, we don't run any risk of spoiling anything if we say that one world was not enough for developers, but you will even have two available! (hence the title, right?) Is this waiting for us in 2007? The most painful aspect of the entire game, unfortunately, is also one of the most evident: the graphics. Despite having promised marvels in the preview phase, Two Worlds actually presents a decidedly fluctuating engine, offering you breath-taking glimpses and views at the same time, with particularly realistic water rendering, mixed with low-resolution textures and decidedly visual effects. shoddy, which make our evaluation ruinously fall. If we can somehow overlook the poverty of some textures and the many problems in rendering the trees and especially the shadows, which are particularly squared, even the most inexperienced user cannot fail to notice some decidedly poor animations. Is this waiting for us in 2007? It may seem a contradiction, since the animations themselves were taken using the motion capture technique, but the final result leaves nothing short of desired: your character will move with the same agility as a piece of seasoned wood, and the same can be said of your opponents; if you add to this that the animations for each action, especially in combat, are counted on one hand, you can easily understand how the whole atmosphere is irreparably compromised; the sensation is that of excessively noticing the detachment from a single animation to another, a particularly unpleasant effect when repetitive sequences such as running or fighting are performed. However, despite being light years away from the amazing graphics of Oblivion, the aesthetic aspect will quickly fade into the background: after a few hours of play you will be used to these shortcomings, and you will be inexorably captured by the adventure packed by the creatives of Reality Pump and its background. Note, however, that Two Worlds makes extensive use of the HDR effect to simulate the phenomenon of glare, in this case limited exclusively to the reflection of light off metal surfaces (such as armor): however, although this setting can be customized from the options, we advise against changing the default setting: you risk finding yourself in front of blinding torches, capable of producing a decidedly excessive glow. The Duel In Two Worlds some of the arrows shot reach the target, as happens for combat: it is useless to hide it, you will spend a good part of the time exploring the map and mauling your enemies, either with the mace or with the magical arts: this will happen with a such a frequency that you will almost seem to be in front of a Diablo-style Hack n' Slash rather than a role-playing game in the pure sense of the term. however, despite being light years away from the amazing graphics of Oblivion, the aesthetic aspect will quickly fade into the background The Duel The combat system, which so disappointed in Gothic 3, in the title of Reality Pump is very wellstructured: to the eye of the superficial player it might seem that it is enough to furiously press the attack button (the left one of the mouse) to win any fight, following the axiom of ~the faster I click, the more damage I do~. We don't hide from you that, initially, we too fell for it, completely ignoring the strategies offered by the developers: if you have the patience to learn the most hidden secrets of combat, you will discover that your character is not only able to automatically block blows from your opponents (as a percentage of your skill, of course), but also resorting to dirty tricks like throwing sand in your eyes to gain a few useful seconds, or burning your opponent's face with a torch. The Duel The good thought of the developers was the introduction of a convenient lower bar that shows all the actions that can be performed by the character, which automatically changes according to your needs: if you draw the sword, all the special attacks you have learned will be made available, while when once you put it back, you can choose from other possibilities, such as moving silently or placing traps: this greatly simplifies the choice of which actions to perform. So it goes without saying that, having a little more patience, the fights you will face will become much more engaging, adding a small touch of strategy that will allow you to get the better of even enemies much stronger than you (the back dodge is very useful ), without obviously ever falling into the absurd (a farmer, armed only with his fists, will never kill an armored knight), which instead happened in the competitor produced by Piranha Bytes. Stupid Horse, Stupid! If the combat turns out to be much deeper than one might imagine, the same can be said of the general level of the gameplay: perhaps taken from an excess of zeal, the programmers of Pump Reality have excessively pushed the level of difficulty of the game, especially lower levels; a striking example is represented by the first bandits armed with bows and arrows: with a single shot they will be able to take you to game over, without you having any chance to defend yourself. Unlike what happened in other RPGs, if your life bar is reduced to zero you will not be forced to reload your last save, but the game will place you back at the nearest Altar of Rebirth (a high-sounding name to indicate a respawn point) where the your alter ego will be reborn with full energy and as if nothing had happened, without suffering any penalty. It is, of course, a ploy used by the developers to make the game less frustrating for future owners of the 360 version, considering that the lack of this introduction was absolutely not felt on PC. However, we don't feel like penalizing this choice excessively: if at the beginning you find yourself cursing the game too often, as soon as your character acquires a few levels you will start to get the upper hand, bringing you just as much satisfaction that will reward you every time you a mangy wolf cub brought you to game over. You pass the particularly high level of difficulty at the beginning, but the real point where Two Worlds collapses disastrously is represented by that same strength it boasted of in the preview phase, namely exploration and combat on horseback: in addition to having a delay of a few seconds from any of your inputs, your faithful equine will present many problems moving around the game environment, getting stuck against 99% of the objects in the scenario, sometimes showing absurd reactions, as you can see from the images below. Stupid Horse, Stupid! The programmers, incredible to say, have also thought of implementing your mount not only to facilitate your movements, but you can also use it as an attack ~platform~, launching deadly blows against your enemies: on paper it is, without a doubt, of something that was missing in all previous RPGs, but unfortunately it was made badly: in addition to being practically impossible to hit something while running, given that if you hit an enemy with your horse, the model of this will be moved a few meters from you, you won't even be able to try to ride and mow down a camp of galloping enemies, since your steed will stop even if you have a small stone in front of you, forcing you into disastrous reverses, which will lead you to a premature death. Our advice therefore remains to use the quadruped only if you have to move on flat stretches or for long distances, butHowever, it is still possible to explore the whole world on foot, given that your alter ego will move at a rather high speed, equal to that of a doped athlete: a negative point which, however, fortunately, is also easily resolved by a new, imminent patches, Why me! However, it must be said that Two Worlds represents one of those titles that no editor would like to review: the continuous ups and downs, typical of the Reality Pump title, make it extremely difficult to formulate an objective evaluation; if free roaming is undermined by a few too many bugs in movement, as highlighted in the previous paragraph, one can only be favorably impressed by the developers' choice to introduce different factions into the game: this will force you to think which side you will side with (two or more) and many of the quests you face will lead to repercussions, both favorable and negative, for one rather than the other. The concept, although not new, is undoubtedly very well integrated with the gameplay: a greater reputation will bring you considerable benefits, which will grow as it increases; initially we will talk about simple discounts on items for sale, but progressing you can also get to unlock new customized weapons and armor, as well as get the support of your guild members. Particularly apt is also the choice not to constrain the spending of your experience points: during the game you can come across Sanctuaries that will allow you, upon payment, to modify the XP spent on certain attributes, making them available again to enhance other skills: one a choice that deviates considerably from the classic concept of RPG, but which allows for greater malleability of your character (today a warrior, tomorrow a necromancer, the day after tomorrow editor of Multiplayer.it... A great career). The other absolutely positive aspect is represented by the variety of quests and the freedom of choice that the developers have left you: in addition to having to deal with investigative and exploratory missions, which differ from the usual ~go and kill the target~, many of these can be solved with different approaches, all equally valid, and ended by choosing which faction to prefer: it may happen that a quest, assigned by a member of a Guild, requires you to deliver a package of vital importance to a subject; you will be free to choose whether to deliver it, fulfilling your assignment, or sell it to the competing faction, perhaps obtaining a decent monetary gain, but a considerable loss of respect with the original employer. Multiplayer too? Continuing with the ups and downs, here comes another negative point: multiplayer. Essentially, by accessing the Great Network, you will be able to choose between two modes: a cooperative one, where you will face a series of quests with other players, but in any case tying free roaming to small, well-defined areas, and one called Arena, for those who wish to face off against other players in a terrifying version of Capture The Flag or Team Deathmatch. The ideas, like all those of the title, are potentially excellent, but are poorly implemented: in addition to suffering from significant problems of a technical nature, such as a particularly pronounced lag, the idea of facing quests based on the teamwork could be rewarding, were it not that unfortunately in reality the same problems of the single player campaign recur, i.e. excessive movements of the enemies, accentuated by the lag due to the connection, which make it particularly difficult to be able to hit an opponent, both with weapons and with your spells. A further negative aspect is represented by the forced choice of the class: you will not be free to create your own character from scratch, as happens in the single player, but you will necessarily have to opt for one of the eight proposed by the developers, only to then modify it in the future by obtaining experience points : also forget about being able to upgrade a character in cooperative mode and then make him beat up some unfortunate opponent in the Arena, since you absolutely cannot use him outside the mode in which you created him. Perhaps we will see this mode implemented in an upcoming patch? There is no shortage of hope and technical support either. Comment In the end, the guys at Reality Pump managed to churn out an excellent game, dispelling any doubts that arose during the preview phase. Two Worlds presents continuous ups and downs, but fortunately the positive aspects clearly outweigh the negative ones: a fluctuating aesthetic aspect is contrasted with a sufficient plot", "date": "2007-05-17", "grade": null}
