This, in addition to maybe pushing us to some reflections on videogame ethics, can also lead to alternative and ironic interpretations of the assorted crime, in an attempt to match brutality and macabre taste with particular contexts, styles and situations, which dilute the impact or on the contrary, they push him to paroxysm. Just staying within the last few years, we were psychotic murderers with identity disorders in Hotline Miami, intolerant killers towards revelers in Party Hard, even without bothering superstars like Grand Theft Auto V. However, until now we had never been involved in cleaning up crime scenes, and this gap is the basis of the brilliant idea of iFun4all, which has decided to dedicate an entire video game to the neglected figure of the professional cleaner. Little explored but present in the criminal imagination, always outlined with a particular charisma as in the good old Victor of Nikita or (above all) in the unforgettable Mr. Wolf of Pulp Fiction, the figure of the ~solver~ has a strategic role in the organization of the crime , counteracting the chaotic violence of the killers with a more reasoned and tactical attitude, actually ideal to stage within an action with stealth elements. Having found the original idea, as befits an independent production, it was important to stage it in an equally peculiar way and what other setting would have fit perfectly with a wild theater of murders, career cops and criminals (in a word: the ~pulp ~) like the one offered by the 70s? And so, here comes Serial Cleaner. I'm Bob, I solve problems Bob, the protagonist of the story, is a strange guy, with an almost schizophrenic personality and yet not without a certain ethics, both at work and in private life. Long sideburns, mustache and Ray-ban, our hero is the stereotype of the shady 70s type but endowed with a dark charm, which dissolves in his ~normal~ identity as a thoughtful son who still lives at home with his mother. The domestic skits with the latter always intent on cooking, tending the garden and following the local news act as a glue between the missions to reveal something of Bob's personality and providing a sort of hub of connection between one assignment and another. When the phone rings, Bob abandons the role of the good boy of the house and becomes a very professional serial cleaner, screeching with his American station wagon towards the address indicated by some local mafia boss. Serial Cleaner is a stealth game that relies on the most classic canons of the genre, requiring you to perform various actions without being seen within a map with narrow borders and dotted with enemies and adverse elements. Once we reach our destination after each call, we find ourselves having to dispose of a certain number of bodies, collect any incriminating evidence and possibly clean the scene of blood as much as possible using the practical vacuum cleaner that can be extracted at any time from nowhere. . With a practical shot from above, which if necessary can be expanded to show the entire playing area through the ~senses of the cleaner~, we must therefore juggle between the elements of the scenario trying not to be seen by the various guards and security systems security arranged in the settings. Once the required amount of bodies have been eliminated, sensitive objects removed and a certain amount of blood cleaned from the crime scenes, all that's left to do is get back behind the wheel of the trusty station wagon and rumble home, waiting for a restorative dinner with mom and a new call from the boss. Simply stealth The visual cone of the enemies is clearly visible, allowing us to find blind spots and hidden trajectories on the fly, also because the continuous movements and the amount of guards make the preventive planning of a precise route rather difficult, however do not expect the most refined stealth complications advanced: Serial Cleaner is a very simple and immediate title, so if you are discovered it is often enough to find a hiding place to disappear from view, despite having several guards on your heels. Things obviously get more complicated by continuing through the levels but beyond a greater number of enemies, greater complexity in movement patterns and narrower spaces for movement, there is no further study of the game mechanics over the course of about thirty missions to which we are subjected, of which about a third are nice themed digressionscinematic to unlock by collecting collectibles. The duration is however commensurate with the complexity of the game mechanics and also with the price of the product, all in all, therefore Serial Cleaner is overall a rather balanced title even in its conceptual simplicity, without running the risk of boring or being pulled by the hair. The reference to Hotline Miami also returns when speaking of the continuous, almost obsessive repetition of the attempts to complete the levels, given that being discovered immediately sends us back to the beginning of the mission ready to leave for another round, and this absence of breaks and waits, as we have seen, knows how to give a fast pace to a ~trial and error~ that could otherwise be frustrating. That seventies show The 70s characterization is something more than a simple aesthetic solution in Serial Cleaner, providing the mood and a real soul to the story of Bob and his adventures. From the gameplay point of view, such a choice is reflected in an inevitable underlying simplicity, not being able to count on advanced technological instruments and solutions for the players on the field, but it is in the creation of the settings, in the background music and in the interlude narrative phases that the particular pulp world takes on a life of its own. In those brief minutes spent at home, suspended in what is almost a daily normality, one can breathe the 70s from the small scattered details and brief side-by-side dialogues, but above all from the news arriving via television or radio, which actually they bring us back to a vision of the world in line with that historical period. There is also no doubt that the graphic style adopted is perfectly suited to the characterization chosen, with those angular and strongly caricatured lines that recall a cross between the Hanna-Barbera and Tartakovskij productions, all accompanied by the ever-present funky bases that seem to come directly from vintage cops. In short, as often happens in indie productions, the stylistic choices end up deeply permeating all the elements that make up the game, characterizing the entire experience, and from this point of view Serial Cleaner appears to be a perfectly composed product. At the limit, the strong stylization can bring out some problems in precisely discerning some elements of the scenario and the sensitive objects scattered around the maps, as well as some chromatic combination between the orange visual cone of the guards and some colors of the environments that tends to create confusion.", "date": "2017-07-17", "grade": "7.3"}
