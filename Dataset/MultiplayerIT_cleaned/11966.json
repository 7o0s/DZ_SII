{"name": "Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-recensione.html", "text": "Anyone who has completed the entire story of Horizon Forbidden West knows well how the second chapter of Aloy's adventures ends with a huge cliffhanger that serves as a possible prelude to what will be told in the inevitable third episode of the series. However, many of us had taken for granted that this first DLC, Burning Shores, a substantial additional content that takes the form of a real expansion, could somehow carry on that narrative and act as a bridge with the future chapter. It is with these assumptions that we launched into the review of Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores which, in addition to offering a new main mission and various novelties on the gameplay front, is presented on the market at a price of  19.99 and is exclusively available on PlayStation 5, where the base game was also playable on the old PS4. A marketing decision or dictated by technological needs? Also on this front we will try to have our say in this review; and now make yourself comfortable and enjoy reading! A story that is a bit of a filler Aloy aboard a Dive Plane, the new flying machine of Burning Shores With a particularly unprecedented decision for our sector, to play Burning Shores it is essential not only to have finished Horizon Forbidden West, but you must be in the post-final open world because only in this way will we be able to receive Sylens' call on Aloy's focus and give the la to the narrative plot of the expansion. If for some strange reason you chose to start a New Game+ at the time and you didn't keep a previous save somewhere, be prepared for a wild ride to be able to finish the original title again, otherwise the DLC will remain a downloaded component, but will not bootable. With this choice, we said just above, quite atypical in a market where developers and publishers constantly try to put players in the best conditions to let them try (and buy) any additional content, Guerrilla was able to assume that anyone approaching the expansion was well aware of the particular ending with which Forbidden West ended. Nemesis is preparing to approach the earth and our people must find a way to counter this terrifying artificial intelligence that has escaped the control of the Zenith. It's a pity however that this terrible threat is there in the air, but it doesn't move an iota since in Burning Shores we will have to deal with a Zenith that jumped out of nowhere and which, coincidentally, everyone had given up for dead when in reality he was holed up on an island busy taking the cult of his personality to new levels of imagination. We clearly appreciated the ability of the Dutch software house's writing team to stage an interesting character, Walter London, a dispersed fringe of the Quen shipwrecked following a naval expedition and, above all, a supporting character who will follow Aloy for practically the entire main story, Seyka. However, without wanting to risk any kind of spoiler, we must admit that we were not particularly satisfied with the narrative sector. The twists and turns are telephoned, on the hasty way in which it was decided to evolve Aloy's sentimental relationships a separate article could be written, and more generally the idea that we have of Burning Shores is of a filler, if you pass us the term of comparison with series and anime. A sumptuous, rich, showy and appreciable filler, but still a filler that does not move the main narrative arc of the series by a single millimeter, postponing any response and real evolution of the plot to the inevitable third chapter of Horizon which, who knows when, we can play. The new map is set in Los Angeles, complete with a Hollywood hill Guerrilla's ability to design the main mission in an unprecedented way compared to the past is certainly to be rewarded, with Seyka who will practically always be by our side, ready not only to lend us a hand in the fights and to chat with Aloy in the dead moments, but also to solving a handful of environmental puzzles while generating an admittedly fascinating co-op-like feel. However, speaking of missions, we cannot help but highlight that the main tasks will be only 5 and, although there is a cloud of secondary activities, some of which are unpublished (such as the Pangea figurines that have generated many problems in the Italian localization) , it took us less than 10 hours to see much of what the DLC has to offer in terms of story. An enriched gameplay With the Dive Glider we will be able to fly and quickly go underwater For thisAs far as gameplay is concerned, it is clear that we cannot expect revolutions or major changes of course from additional content and we must also recognize that Guerrilla has gone far beyond the simple homework, enriching the main elements of Horizon Forbidden West with a trifecta of tasty introductions .First of all there is the new island, a cross-section of Los Angeles, with the Hollywood hill on display in the central area of the land and some ruins of Downtown and Santa Monica (there is even the famous wheel overview). This unedited area, connected from the main game map via a very fast boat trip, is clearly smaller than the Forbidden West area (about 1/3 in terms of size), but it is extremely dense in geographical terms. There are beaches, many areas of the sea that can be explored, mountains, forests, volcanic areas with lava and steam geysers that can be exploited to soar in the air with Aloy's Alascudo and more generally there is a lot of verticality, useful for exploiting it properly the Plane Dive, the new flying machine introduced with the DLC. And speaking of robots, some new artificial threats have been introduced with the expansion starting with the Plane Dive just mentioned which replaces the Skywalker and is crucial to be able to soar among the splendid clouds of the add-on. We will also find drones that are activated if unfortunately we bump into the ~eggs~ that guard them and a sort of gigantic frog, as well as various enhanced versions of the dinosaurs already encountered in the past. Hollywood Hill is a focal point of the new map To all this must be added the final threat that we will face during the final battle of the DLC, which despite not having the features of a prehistoric animal, adheres perfectly to the imagination of the series. However, all these introductions have unbalanced the pace of the action towards a more distant combat given that the new adversities will tend to remain very much in the air or to move quickly on the battlefield, among other things with a particularly high life reserve that will bring to intense and frenetic fights where it is not always easy to deal with the crazy camera and with the need to move extensively on the ground. A great pity given that the third main introduction of the DLC concerns a substantial addition to Aloy's talents given that 2 active skills and a valiant charge have been added for each skill branch, clearly in keeping with the focus of each tree. We appreciated the portable shields that can be put down to protect yourself from enemy projectiles, the mines and some bonuses related to smoke grenades as well as the new energizing shot combined with the grappling hook that can be inflicted on stunned machines and which in more than one opportunity was shown during the trailers. But above all else, we were delighted by the ability to charge Aloy's spear with elements, so as to exploit the weaknesses of the machines even in close combat as well as Seyka's ability to attach flame tanks to the armor of opponents, allowing then to our arrows to generate huge explosions during battles. A technically indisputable exclusive In the Burning Shores there is a great variety of explorable environments Given all the debate that arose during the first demonstrations of Ratchet & Clank due to the ~miracle~ PS5 SSD, we are quite convinced that there will be a lot of talk about Guerrilla's need to run Burning Shores exclusively on the latest console from sony. Without going into technical details that require much more in-depth analysis than ours, there is no doubt that Burning Shores offers an even better overview than Forbidden West, further reinforcing our thesis according to which Horizon is the best open world available on console from a mere technological point of view. And both the new island, with its density, and the unpublished non-player characters once again extraordinary from the point of view of facial expressiveness and body animations, and the whole question of the clouds that can be reached and then traversed with the Dive Plano, do not nothing but reinforce this thesis. Not to mention the ability of the development team to continue to create truly splendid and evocative scenarios that mix reality and fiction, a radiant past and a dystopian future, placing points of interest here and there that make you jump and amaze when they come crossed for the first time by the player (the Hollywood hill with the ~stuck~ Horus is simply extraordinary), and without going too far into the details of a combtruly amazing final act as regards the amount of elements staged and the beauty of the scenario in which the long confrontation takes place. So is all this enough to justify the non-existence of the DLC on PS4? We struggle to answer about it, but what we really haven't been able to explain is Guerrilla's choice to make the clouds their own, which required the additional power of the PS5, an accessory element to the narrative of Burning Shores, an absolutely optional component of all the exploration we stumble upon quite by accident. There is not a single mission that guides us towards the altitude flight or some specific objective if we exclude an absolutely free and useful fight to put some loot in your pocket. If the clouds really represent the spearhead of the DLC (among other things, the new technology has made them static), why not focus more on them making them an integral part of the story? The evolution of the relationship between Aloy and Seyka is hasty and perhaps even obvious However, nothing to say about the general glance which remains extraordinary once again in the face of some small compromises in terms of interpenetrations, pop-ups and pop-ins and an absolutely positive opinion also on the front of the soundtrack perfectly in line with the sonorities and the themes of the past, together with some pleasant introduction of synthesizers and electronic music. Just as we applaud for the umpteenth time, Sony's ability to implement an exceptional dubbing in Italian with excellent interpretations of all the protagonists and a good mixing of sound effects.", "date": "2023-04-24", "grade": "7.5"}
