From Canabalt onwards, but probably even before, something clicked in the minds of gamers who apparently immediately found a particular harmony with these games that only require you to run, avoid obstacles and get as far as possible. When escaping from the real world into a game universe becomes a real escape, one might say: it is probably the action all legs and little brain to create that particular alchemy that has allowed the genre to proliferate in a few years so massively, although the relative ease of development may have been another determining factor in this respect. Whatever the psychological mechanism underlying this mass phenomenon may have been, the fact is that we have now seen racing games in any sauce, from simple Canabalt reskins to titles that have tried to add new elements, from Temple Run clones to games that have effectively sought a mediation between the classic structure of the platform and that of the endless runner, with varied results. In such a panorama, ReRunners presents itself with at least a couple of strong points: at first sight it is the crazy and cartoonish graphic characterization that makes it stand out compared to the great mass of similar games, but it is then its fundamentally multiplayer structure that represents the major element of characterization for this Game Alliance title, which represents the classic example in which a single well-implemented idea manages to bring out the entire project. Instead of racing alone against the clock, in ReRunners we find ourselves racing against the rest of the world, with a handful of ~ghosts~ recorded from the performances of other players randomly launched within our game, in order to pit us against always different and formidable opponents. It's a simple idea but one that perfectly manages to enrich and characterize an otherwise trite gaming experience, as well as giving a particular sense of challenge and liveliness. Challenge the whole world at once to a crazy run with ReRunners Race against the world That ReRunners is a somewhat crazy interpretation of the classic endless runner is evident simply by looking at the images of the game, with its stylized graphic style, crazy and grotesque shapes and a tendency to paroxysm in the representation of the elements of the scenario. It sounds a bit strange but in all of this the absurd pre-Columbian atmosphere with which we are initiated into the race also finds an excellent place, which in this way becomes a sort of mystical event in which the whole world participates, we don't know well for what reason. In short, from a stylistic point of view ReRunners is endowed with an unexpected coherence, even superfluous if we like, but which assumes a fundamental weight in the creation of the game's identity, an element which becomes of great importance in an overcrowded panorama such as that of the mobile titles of this type. The mechanics are simple and classic by now: with two keys you give the direction (right and left), with one you jump and with another you use a special ability to choose before the race. Note the fact that there are not only levels to face in a hurry but also scenarios that can be explored more calmly, without the need for a timer and with the time to find the various secrets and hidden bonuses, which manages to enrich a the structure with diversified situations, as well as pointing out that there is a truly enormous amount of content crammed into this small title. There is some progression in the game, given that you can invest money in upgrading various runner stats (speed, acceleration, jump and double jump) as well as special abilities. Great space is then left to character customization, with a large amount of cosmetic elements to buy, unlock and apply to make the protagonist as crazy as possible. Obviously, the classic mechanisms of micro-transactions also intervene in all this, since it is a free-to-play title: there is an energy bar that is consumed with each run and therefore forces you to wait between one game and the other. other, just as it is necessary to wait some time to be able to apply the chosen boosts to the various statistics. Waiting can be eliminated by spending gems, with these obviously being able to be purchased with real money and this closes the classic cycleof free-to-play, to say the least less invasive here than in many other situations.", "date": "2016-08-03", "grade": "8.0"}
