Released in 2013 on the App Store and Google Play, it immediately established itself as one of the best drag racers for mobile devices, with excellent graphics and sufficiently multifaceted gameplay to guarantee a solid and lasting experience. Two years later, in conjunction with the arrival of ~Fast & Furious 7~ in cinemas, here is Kabam trying again, with a product that starts from the same assumptions but tries to enrich the original gameplay in various respects. We therefore move from speed races only, those in which only the power of the engine and the precision of the gearbox count, to a wider range of events, which include endless runner-style sessions and drifting challenges. The incipit is the usual: in the role of a skilled driver, we will have to deal with some characters from the series and we will find ourselves traveling the world to participate in numerous clandestine races, treading the streets of Los Angeles, Miami, Tokyo and Rio de Janiero. In addition to the main mode, Fast & Furious: Legacy also offers a couple of interesting extras, such as single challenges and ranked matches against the ghost of human opponents. There are also some social facets, which take the form of the possibility of being part of a ~crew~ and thus obtaining useful bonuses to minimize the wait between one attempt and another, given the presence of the usual energy indicator that it empties as we play and recharges over time. It must be said that, thanks to a progression system that is particularly generous at first, rewarding our efforts with frequent level increases, we did not suffer from this aspect of the freemium format during the tests. Fast & Furious: Legacy offers more variety than the average drag racer, and knows how to entertain On the track As already mentioned, in the previous Fast & Furious 6: The Game it was limited to drag racing, with two cars having to face each other along a course and the emphasis placed on power-ups and the precision of gear shifting. In Fast & Furious: Legacy this component remains, but has been joined by other variants, in this case the races with a traditional view from behind the car and those of drifting. The first phase is the same for all: you need to accelerate by keeping the rev counter in a specific range so as not to lose momentum, then immediately press the Start button. Once the car is launched, things change depending on the type of race: in drag racing you simply have to change gears at the right moment, keeping an eye on the engine revs, until you cross the finish line; in ~standard~ races, on the other hand, you have to change lanes often (by touching the right or left side of the touch screen) to avoid other vehicles, use the nitro and take advantage of any ramps to perform spectacular jumps; finally, in the drift challenges, you are asked to slide on the screen to adjust the inclination of the car and avoid excessive loss of speed during curves. This mix of different approaches guarantees the game an unprecedented variety, which is supported by the ubiquitous upgrade system and by the possibility of buying other cars during the adventure, using the virtual money earned with each victory or putting your wallet in hand to speed up a little things. As already mentioned, however, during the first few hours you don't feel the need to spend real money at all, which means that you can enjoy the Fast & Furious: Legacy experience completely free. On the technical front, an excellent job has been done once again: the cars are detailed and reflect the surrounding environment in a convincing way, the scenarios are varied and well done, the effects give a further cue and the musical accompaniment is in line with the atmosphere of the film. The only unknown is the sound effects: the rumble of the cars was initially very annoying, but with an update it has been reduced and is now more bearable, albeit far from convincing.", "date": "2015-04-04", "grade": "7.7"}
