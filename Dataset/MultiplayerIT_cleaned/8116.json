Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Daredevil and the X-Men were all born from his pen and share the same characterizing element, that of the ~super problems~ that made them closer to sympathies of many readers. At the ripe old age of 89, Lee still wants to get involved, and so here he is collaborating with Moonshark for the creation of Verticus, an action game for iPhone and iPad in which we take on the role of a completely new superhero, equipped with a which allows him to cross the various layers of the planet's atmosphere without suffering damage and even to go underground, until he reaches the earth's core, in order to remove a powerful bomb planted by the alien race of the Obliterators. A name that does not bode well, and in fact our character will have to move in the air during the fall and dodge numerous obstacles before reaching his destination and saving the world, finally also facing a boss using the only weapons that the costume makes available to them, i.e. a swarm of homing missiles that we can upgrade between one game and another using a traditional-type credit system, which rewards the best performances with more coins and which also extends to other Verticus capabilities, such as the shock resistance and the regeneration factor of his energy shield. In free fall It can change its shape, because in Verticus the goal is to control the fall of our character, collect bonuses and avoid obstacles that can be fatal at first after a single impact, but the substance doesn't change. And the substance is that of a running game, neither more nor less, which on the one hand focuses on the spectacular nature of the context, supported by the speed with which the scenario flows while we fall towards the center of the Earth starting from the clouds, on the other it chooses an approach which must inevitably stand out and, in this way, deviates dangerously from well-tested mechanisms. The touch control system implemented by Moonshark, for example, works very well, is reactive and reliable, but the type of view and the ~three-dimensional~ interpretation of the gameplay make it not easy for us to distinguish the obstacles that are approaching very quickly, dodge the bombs (often following set, mundane routes) and seek contact with ~speed-up ramps~ and power-ups. When the clouds run out and you go to the depths of the subsoil, things change very little: you move to avoid rock spikes, but even in this case it is quite difficult to understand where exactly an obstacle will be positioned in relation to the character. Once these uncertainties have been overcome, we will be able without too much effort to reach the end of the path and face the boss using the missiles, but only for a momentary rescue and the resumption of a ~race~ that had already given everything in the first lap. In short, the attempt to eliminate the word ~endless~ from the genre to which it belongs and, therefore, to insert some element of progression is commendable, but the limits of the experience are too many and too obvious. The contribution of Stan Lee, who pronounces a series of ~suggestions~ in his voice as we fall, obviously does not change the degree of enjoyment of the product.", "date": "2012-12-13", "grade": "6.0"}
