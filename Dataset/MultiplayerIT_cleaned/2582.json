{"name": "Giants: Citizen Kabuto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/giants-citizen-kabuto_a.html", "text": "History The action takes place on an island, a fragment of what was once a huge planet one fine day 5 very unlucky Meccaryns (Meccs for friends and for short, one of the 3 races at our disposal) to go on vacation on the planet Majorca (the equivalent of Palma de Mallorca in Spain?) when Gibbon, a gigantic fish, swallows their spaceship!! Left alone Basil (Baz for friends) has as its first purpose to look for his lost friends, namely Reg (whose voice actor is Alberto Olivero, the same as Junior/Piccolo from the Dragon Ball TV series), Tel, Gordon and Bennett; throughout history the smarties make their appearance, a people who aesthetically recall the Spielbergian creature E.T. and that on more than one occasion will make you smile (the scene of ~Reggie~ who, er, does dirty things with a straight lady in the bush disguise is priceless!!); however, these beings have enemies, namely the Sea Reapers, once rulers of the island! Of this breed, the figures of the cruel queen Sappho stand out (really bad, as can be seen when she wants to beat up the aforementioned straight woman) and the peaceful Delphi (not affected in the European edition by censorship as in the American one, showing off a not bad topless), his daughter, trained by the famous straight samurai Yan. In the intro of this review there was talk of 3 races at our disposal but, perhaps, it is better to say 2 races and a new emulator of Godzilla and Gamera, given that, ladiessss and gentleman, here is Kabuto, the true protagonist of this production ! This monster with a distinctly Japanese name (surname of the director of the Great Mazinger science fortress!) was created by marauders to defend the island but the funny guy (like the robots in the Terminator bilogy) rebels and even puts himself against his ~parents~ who, perhaps foreseeing such a thing, have endowed him with a weak point in his stomach which becomes visible if someone approaches him! The game consists of 15 missions for each type of being, to be carried out in 25 different locations on the island. Game mechanics The most important thing to point out for this Planet Moon game is the type of game to which it belongs which automatically determines the group of enthusiasts it is aimed at and therefore, consumerist speaking, who will pay out the money for any purchase. From the screenshots it may seem like an emulator of Black and White (although it hasn't come out yet!!), due to Kabuto, some backdrops seem to have been taken verbatim from the wonderful Sacrifice and the first impressions of the game suggest Mdk's bilogy (always from Interplay, whose second episode was reviewed by yours truly during the heat). Let's say that the blasting component is a prerogative of the Meccs, able to use rifles, pistols, as well as a very useful jetpack (available in 2 versions) even if honorable mention is for the aforementioned bush disguise, which however does not deceive as it should guards! Still speaking of Mecc it is good to say that having 5 of them at your disposal (although not immediately) you can command your friends by pressing ~ctrl~ who will be able to attack a specific enemy or place (pressing the first mouse button) or hide ( second key); the good interaction with the game environment is commendable, given that you can blow up a bit of everything even if, strategically speaking, it is good to always leave something standing behind which you can hide! Going forward in the game it is also good to underline the importance of building a base which, thanks to the Straighttons, will be able to have pubs, workshops, shops and everything that can be used by these 5 rowdy Meccaryns, as long as they don't prefer to take a tour in the beautiful (how much extensive) game locations with their helicopter (Gyrocopter), certainly more worthy of jetpacks! Game mechanics Decidedly less technological are the marauders of the sea, or rather the sexy Delphi, whose armament seems reduced to various types of bows and arrows as well as a vast selection of magic (we name the one for grabbing and, lo and behold, the one to shrink!!). Like the sister of the good Crash Bandicoot (protagonist of a series of successful platform games for the Playstation), Delphi can use a jetsky (perhaps inserted for a level playing field, having the Meccs the Gyrocopter?) to move faster on the waters adjacent to the islands and, more slowly, also on the mainland!! Like the Meccas, the raiders also have their own base, since the Straighttons are so subject er easily enslaved by cobuild a base for the masters of the island; unlike the Mecc base, here we also have structures obtained through magic and inside the base we have various types of shops, magic schools (defended by force fields), party room and more! For his part, Kabuto can devastate everything that comes within range with his body (including, er, his butt), as well as feast on big bucks with his powerful jaws (there is also a view for this purpose!!) ; not only that, what he eats becomes a projectile that can be thrown even at a considerable distance from the place where Kabuto claimed yet another victim! The Vimps, the last link in the food chain of this game (they look like huge sheep), as well as being a source of food for the straights too, serve, if swallowed in large numbers, to give life to a scion: Kabuto, in fact , deposits an egg from which a scion of his will be born who will deal with minor enemies or bring food for his ~daddy~. As mentioned before, however, Kabuto has a weak point in the chest that is visible if an enemy approaches him just enough, making it impossible for the beast to lead a peaceful and safe life, as he is not invulnerable. Everything that has been said so far is united by a very funny plot, full of scenes and jokes bordering on the comical, which gives meaning to the various missions that you will gradually have to complete, Meccaryn, Delphi or Kabuto that is! The difficulty level ranges from very easy to extremely difficult, so some times you will activate the map, you will see where is the location to reach, the straights to save or the enemy to shoot down and you will get there without problems (a couple of times, running without turning around, I didn't take out a single enemy!), other times in no time you'll have already been defeated without even realizing it, even though every enemy you shoot down (especially if you play as Meccs) you release a object capable of restoring a certain amount of energy and, believe me, redoing the same mission even 20 times is not fun at all, especially if you think that you can only save at the end of each mission and that when you use the map the game is not paused, leaving the enemies a very tempting opportunity to kill you. Graphics and sound Let's start, as usual now, with the minimum and recommended requests to make Giants work, directly from the exhaustive manual enclosed: P2 266, o.s. Windows (from 95 to 2000, passing through the M.E.), 8mb accelerated video card fully compatible with the Direct 3d standard, 64 mb of ram and half a gig of hd space while a P2 350 is recommended, a video card with twice as much of onboard ram and 700 mb of hd space; I tell you that on my P3 500, Win 98, 256 mb of ram, 1 gig of hd space (so as not to waste time on various swaps) and GeForce DDR as soon as I started the game I moved the mouse to the right to orientate myself and I saw a snap, not funny a few minutes later I realized how the game is decidedly jerky, whatever the resolution used, since I used 800x600 and 1024x768 with all the color depths, with all the details at maximum (and not ), enabling (and disabling) the T&L the nice thing is that the read-me file included in the game says that whoever owns a graphics card from the GeForce family would have seen a real feast for the eyes a spectacle that can perhaps be obtained by standing still, admiring the beautiful backdrops, the mountains made with a very high number of polygons and textures, the beautiful seascape with the waves that bathe the feet of our alter-ego but certainly not the one in motion, certainly not the one with 3 rippers on screen (Rippers) and 2 Meccs drops the game below the threshold of 15 fps per second (whether you play in third person view a la Tomb Raider or in first person view of 3d shooters)! Our ears are luckier than our eyes: the excellent music (which is calm, relaxing, cheerful when there are no enemies, fast, pressing when we are in the middle of a mission) is made by undoubtedly convinced people, the sound effects range from the most absolute norm (rustling, jetpack in action) to the sensation of well done (explosions, roar of engines). The dubbing in Italian is really well done, fun and witty, certainly the voice actors have identified well with the characters. Bugs, I hate you! It had happened with Sin it was repeated a year later with Ultima Ascension for the third year in a row a highly anticipated game appears on the shelves of shops during the Christmas period with lots of problems! Beyond the scarsissima fluidity I have done and redone some missions a dozen times due to some crashes in the code! To be clear, in a mission it was necessary to save 4 straights to move on to the next well, I had saved almost 50 and I was actually wondering when the mission would end, having had to complete it instead a good half hour before; in another in which it was necessary to reach a trapdoor, after starting the mission I become strangely invincible, not suffering the slightest damage from the ferocious enemy attack and, having reached the trapdoor, the usual real-time video did not start aimed at concluding a mission and introduce the next! If you don't believe what I say, you can always have a look at the list of bug fixes of patch 1.1, available in our files area and fully compatible with the Italian version of the game (thank God, pandemonium would have ensued otherwise!) . Once patched, Giants definitely earns 20% more of its value, going from a poorly maintained game to a fairly fun title. Multiplayer One of the best features of this Planet Moon production is certainly the multiplayer mode, whose completeness of options is truly remarkable! Through Lan or TCP/IP protocol you will be able to make the Meccs, the marauders and the terrible Kabuto play together, even if obviously (as recommended by the same instruction manual), it is good to keep the various factions well balanced between them (Kabuto of sure is already 2 Meccaryn in itself)! Through the many options available, you can name the game, play Capture the Smartie with and without a ready base, deathmatch, play mecc against mecc, mecc against Kabuto, choose the map where to play, decide whether to leave the entrance open to other players or not, set the score for the various game modes present, decide how much energy the Vimps can give back to your stocks as well as set the time limit for each battle! Conclusions Giants Citizen Kabuto was potentially an exceptional game but the poor fluidity, poorly implemented artificial intelligence, the level of difficulty sometimes too easy, sometimes too difficult, the terrible number of bugs present (which makes the installation of patch 1.1 mandatory ) ruins a story that captivates thanks to its amusing protagonists and which at times is truly original and fun to live; the multiplayer mode helps a lot but, to those who still intend to buy this video game (therefore ready to make some compromises), I recommend downloading the patch right away, resisting the most frustrating missions and playing with some friends in the fun multiplayer mode. By now you have understood it: yet another exceptional title, ruined by the desire to release the game in time for the holidays and by bad playtesting, it becomes, properly patched, a more than decent title a real shame! Something gigantic A couple of years have now passed since the announcement of the development of this Giants Citizen Kabuto, distributed by Interplay and created by Planet Moon Studios. Finally after so many postponements, screenshots, previews, movies and so on and so forth, the coveted title is finally among us. A very unique thing about this title is that it is difficult to give it a precise classification: it is certainly not a shooter, obviously it is not an RTS and no one would classify it as an RPG. None of this? Maybe it's a bit of everything listed above, together with something of its own that makes this Giants look like an excellent ~shake 'n shake~ but also a title in itself, a bit like the wonderful Sacrifice, a bit rts , a little rpg, a little shooter. So let's go into the story behind the Planet Moon title, and then analyze the 3 races at our disposal, the game mechanics (or rather, the 3 mechanics), the audiovisual component, the multiplayer mode and, alas, the bugs it brings below", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
