Turbine has succeeded in this difficult undertaking with The Lord of the Rings Online, earning the further merit of being able to manage such a heavy and edgy license, full of enthusiasts ready to stick to every gap, and has recently launched its first true expansion, The Mines of Moria, which continues along the excellent path taken by the game, with absolutely valid content, consistent with the world in which the action is positioned and enveloping. Manna for the more experienced One of the strengths of The Lord of the Rings Online has been and still is the great free support players can count on, so why did we decide to change course on this occasion? Simple, the amount of additions made is simply exceptional and goes beyond the classic increase in the maximum level that can be reached by one's alter ego, now passed to 60, winding through practically every corner of the production. The general interest is obviously concentrated on the gigantic unpublished underground area, a set of tunnels, caves and cities far from sunlight but full of charm and capable of giving the constant feeling of uncertainty typical of places where every corner behind which you turn hides a surprise, linked to a robust amount of new missions and an engaging storyline, capable of culminating in cinematic and well-crafted moments. The product's tendency to wink at solo-gaming is partially dampened here, rather favoring the composition of small groups of adventurers, always and rigorously of a high level given that, major and among the few defects of The Mines of Moria, additions to the end-game are privileged. Two classes have been introduced, not stratospheric additions from the point of view of innovation - they are prototypes of heroes already seen elsewhere - but still interesting alternatives. The Rune Hunter is a very versatile wizard, capable of great damage in attack but also of placing himself behind the lines to heal his companions, always being careful not to be attacked as he has minimal defenses. The Warden, on the other hand, is a tank clad in medium-level armor, not very powerful in single attacks but capable of combining several to create devastating combos - they are called gambit, gambit, like the opening sacrifice of chess - and inflict huge damage . Fascinating the introduction of legendary weapons to level up, able to receive part of one's experience and customizable through special skills. Little or nothing new on the PvP front which, however, has never been the strong point of a title that does well in any case to concentrate on what it can do, letting the specialized Warhammer Online deal with World of Warcraft on that front, which it has the numbers to be able to have its say always and in any case, whatever the subject matter. Not just tunnels and caves In addition to Moria and the underworld, there are two unpublished areas, Eregion and Lothlorien, both on the surface and, like the rest of what has been drawn, truly beautiful to look at, not only technically thanks to excellent modeling, but also and perhaps above all as suggestions, always perfect to act as frames in which the stories of the six new books of which you are the protagonist are then set. In the underground areas, what stands out is the excellent level design, capable by itself of avoiding the risk of excessive repetitiveness, keeping the exploration always enthralling and not limited to filling the spaces with enemies - and their movement routines , which indeed mix well with a soundtrack with a predictably epic tone, perhaps a little obvious but perfect in giving rhythm to every situation as it should. The new weapons and spells are beautiful, even if the sector that can be reported under the effects item settles overall on the previously expressed values, as it was easy to hypothesize. Comment Unmissable for already experienced players, The Mines of Moria does not limit itself to adding some areas and raising the level that can be reached, but offers a breath of fresh air to the entire production that expands and improves practically from every point of view, including new classes and unmissable underground realms. The purchase is unreservedly recommended if you already have a well-developed character, while you can wait - but promising to buy it later - if you are new to the game.
