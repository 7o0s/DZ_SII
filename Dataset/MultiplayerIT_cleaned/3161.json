Capcom, after all, was a blinding star for much of this generation, and its now numerous successes made it virtually certain that the worst practices of the bygone era would be completely abandoned, as well as confirming the glorious resurgence of the house's most talented directors. Even the only preview event dedicated to the game had gone wonderfully smooth: an hour and a half of testing with a very fast pace, which had made us think of a potentially more ambitious and elaborate product than the return of the second chapter, also by virtue of the enormous possible improvements to the formula of the original Resident Evil 3 and the development that started partially in parallel. Instead we are here, incredulous in front of the screen, trying in every way to shape our thoughts after completing the campaign of this long-awaited survival horror. Because Resident Evil 3 - although supported by granite foundations taken on by the remake that preceded it and based on extremely similar design philosophies - represents a half-disappointment from many points of view. First among all? The duration, because, after our London test of about ninety minutes, we certainly couldn't imagine having already passed a third of the entire adventure... A problem of duration Approximately five hours of gameplay. Only five hours for us the ~effective~ duration of Resident Evil 3 and the adventures of Jill Valentine: a number that in 2020, for a full-price title, makes the blood freeze in the veins more than any horror. And there are undoubtedly some sensible reasons why Capcom may have made a similar choice, directly related to the way the new Resident Evil 3 is conceived, but we think it's worth coming back to more detail later. Now it's better to focus on the basics and on the positive sides of this work, because in reality there is no lack of valid characteristics when analyzing its technical and mechanical sector, and it is if nothing else enough to partially save the cabin. Let's start, for example, from the game system, given that the fundamentals of this remake are largely taken over by the very successful ones of the two. We therefore speak of a movement speed that is not excessive for the protagonist, weapons with practically zeroed autoaim and very little precision when moving to make the shootings more tense and difficult, extremely difficult and bullet-resistant basic enemies so as to increase tension and danger, and a progression largely built around the exploration of the maps and the management of an inventory that practically always forces you to make some sacrifices to advance (unless you play on the minimum difficulty, which immediately unlocks all the slots). However, Capcom did not limit itself to copying the ideas of the previous remake and, following a philosophically very similar path, tried to revise those mechanical bases so as to make them conceptually very faithful to the original chapter. To obtain a result not too far from this that made ~Nemesis~ unique, a series of gimmicks were therefore implemented, all capable of moving the balance needle away from a markedly horror experience to bring it closer to the action. Watch out: before turning up your nose, you need to realize how sensible this choice is, given what the entire project is based on. Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a controversial game by its nature, in practice a product born as a spin-off then found to be part of the main chapters of a historic series, which already at the time - while still using tank controls and remaining structurally very attached to its predecessors - it pressed the accelerator on the action element, resulting significantly more focused on the fights and on the pressing figure of the sinewy humanoid monster that gave it its name. This makeover therefore seeks only to resume the same concept in a modern key, with much more evolved systems to facilitate the work. A more than sensible plan, which if carried out with the right courage could have peacefully eliminated all the shortcomings that plagued the ancestor. Gameplay: Roll away from that zombie The changes made to change the pace and favor the clashes are not so preponderant as to completely transform the gameplay, but they are immediately evident, and lead, if nothing else, to significantly change the approach. In Resident Evil 3, for example, there are interactive elements in the environment that are often very useful for quickly getting rid of large groups of enemies, more precisely in the form of explosive barrels and generators (the former understandably eliminate anything nearby, while the latter stun zombiesie and the like for a few seconds). In addition, Jill has an indestructible combat knife, which is less harmful than the consumable ones in Resident Evil 2 Remake (and does not allow you to free yourself from grips), but at the same time represents an excellent way to waste fewer bullets by injuring enemies at Earth. Not that it's all that necessary to economize on lead, as the other change is represented by a seriously significant mass of ammunition scattered around the maps, which should fill the inventory of even the most daredevil of the players. However, the central mechanic of this more action vision is only one: dodging, a maneuver that in the original was extremely unreliable, and here has instead been revised to allow the most savvy players to avoid and counterattack almost any enemy attack, so much so that they can conceivably allow knife-only runs for more skilled users. The window of time to convert this dash into a roll isn't particularly large, and the erratic patterns of certain enemies make it difficult to land a perfect dodge every time (when you don't get the right moment to change the animation, the mechanic offers only a quick movement without invulnerability), but we assure you that it greatly facilitates life in certain situations even if used occasionally, however, giving great satisfaction when you manage to place a series. As we have already mentioned in the previous paragraph, however, it is not these changes to the gameplay that surprised us in the negative: they are perfectly logical if you know the title that forms the basis for the remake, and above all by virtue of the increase in enemies on the screen. The real problem arises from the structural revisions to the game, which were implemented worthily only in the first few hours, to then partially decline in the central phase and towards the closure with chapters that give the impression of having been developed in a hurry. Run, escape, there is the Nemesis, or stop One of the primary defects of the title when compared to the Resident Evil that immediately preceded it, in fact, is the much greater linearity, primarily related to a simplification of the maps which partly betrays the spirit of the operation. We specify it again: for a makeover of Resident Evil 3 a more simplified structure could have made sense, if exploited properly, however the potential can be glimpsed right at the beginning, after which the design changes for some reason, and gets lost without being able to take advantage of its best features or reach the levels seen with the remake of the two. Precisely for this reason it is really difficult to criticize the game's intro and the immediately following phase (which correspond in part to what was played in the demo and during our preview event): they are strongly cinematic moments, capable of presenting the Nemesis as a real threat and to scroll great, also thanks to the limited but functional map of the Raccoon City neighborhood - designed to require a bit of healthy exploration without breaking the rapid progress of events. Afterwards, however, two paths could be followed: either the spectacular one and managed around sudden scene changes, or the classic one supported by the complexity of the map design. Instead, the team opted for something in between that really shines only in certain moments, and is unable to fully satisfy. Where Resident Evil 2 boasted perfectly calculated maps and exploration represented one of the most enjoyable parts of the experience, Resident Evil 3 simplifies the plan of each location, and makes it clear almost immediately what to use and where, limiting with it also forces the number of puzzles (in the campaign the puzzles are very few and seriously negligible). The level could rise significantly thanks to the use of specific ~set pieces~ capable of diversifying the experience, but outside of a couple of very pleasant alternative sections, the only real variation on the theme is represented by the aforementioned Nemesis, which it surprises at the beginning of the game with its aggressiveness only to then lose strength over time, so much so that it is now of the end much less impactful on the experience than the good old Tyrant was. Let's go into more detail: the Nemesis is initially a version on steroids of his old incarnation, i.e. a bloodthirsty beast practically unstoppable with normal bullets, able to gradually modify the chases that see him as the protagonist, or giving shape to particularly annoying special zombies, or leaping around the map like a cheetah, or even using Weapons. At a certain point, however, its function changes, it becomes more deeplytrivial, and causes the pressure associated with its presence to disappear almost completely. We obviously don't want to spoil exactly how the creature's behavior varies; simply, we believe that the design choice concerning it made by the developers is quite trivial, and leads to some of the playfully weakest moments of the entire production. A serious mistake, because if on the one hand the initial appearances of the Nemesis are easily stemmed with ~explosive~ means - a couple of grenades are enough to stop it, even if only temporarily, and doing so allows you to obtain useful surprises for your firearms such as in the original game - it is undeniable that they manage to drag the introductory chapters to a great extent, and to surprise for their wickedness at the highest difficulties (although there are serious general imbalances when it comes to the more brutal ones). Raccoon was bigger than I remembered At this point it's time to go back to longevity, because it's a not indifferent point against, even if as you may have understood it's certainly not Capcom's only stumbling block in the development of its latest creature. As mentioned, in fact, we are talking about five hours of play, and to be exact of a timer which at the end of the campaign counted for us about 4 and a half hours of actual play. ~Effective~ because the timer does not count the cutscenes (not particularly long overall), nor the deaths, yet we assure you that we have not faced Jill's raids in Raccoon in any hurry. To give you a precise idea of the duration of Resident Evil 3, know that the completion timer of Leon's A campaign alone in the second chapter marked 7 hours and 15 for us, with the exact same counting limitations. There is talk of almost three hours of difference from half of that single player, and while aware of how the two predecessor campaigns were repeated in many aspects, we cannot however ignore the significant differences in content between one game and another. Oh God, we understand the desire to maintain a general structure suitable for speed runs for Resident Evil, and also this chapter is calculated with replayability in mind, complete with the final score (affected by the number of saves, deaths and playing time), achievements to be completed to buy numerous goodies in a special shop at each run, and additional difficulties obtainable by completing the campaign at the highest challenge level (we sincerely wanted them right away, but that's it) with more difficult opponents and a slightly different positioning of the objects... only that even taking this into account, the duration remains negligible, especially with Raccoon's enormous potential available. Some locations of the original third chapter have been totally cut, others completely replaced, and the most serious problem lies in the fact that, now of the end, only a specific advanced area is up to Resident Evil 2 Remake, while all the others are precisely too elementary, as well as deprived of a good dose of tension due to the action elements mentioned above and the large number of weapons and projectiles. The management of the speakers therefore becomes more basic, the sound design seemed to us in general more crude (as well as less useful given the lack of a threat like the Tyrant that is really worth ~listening~), and the atmosphere is much less oppressive, for a title inferior in practically every single aspect compared to the previous one outside of the technical sector. Sad, given that a slightly more coherent overview and less haste to complete the campaign would have been enough to obtain a videogame of very similar quality, but probably the team that dealt with the third chapter could not count on the talents of the main one, and it fell on the most beautiful. The online with REsistance: to resist, but not to exist At least from the point of view of the narrative there have not been major upheavals, despite the fact that the improvement operation has also in this case been considerable and many characters have obtained a lot more dignity in their characterization (Carlos in primis, complete with sessions in his shoes beautifully enlarged). The fact is that we are not listing all these defects to destroy the game, but only to carefully describe our disappointment, because Resident Evil 3, even with all the shortcomings listed above, remains a more than enjoyable experience, which is not never really bored or annoyed us. However, the partner of this remake is something less striking than other additional modes seen in the saga, and aimed only at a certain audience: Resident Evil REsistance, an asymmetrical competitive online part of the game, which sees you in the role of one of four survivors , or of a cruel mastermind eager to", "date": "2020-03-30", "grade": "7.5"}
