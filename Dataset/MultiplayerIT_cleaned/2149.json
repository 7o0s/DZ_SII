We immediately received the first positive note of this title by opening the luxurious hardcover packaging of this game. Inside we will find a beautiful color map representing the playing area, a full-bodied manual in Italian and obviously the game CD that contains the game completely translated into our language too! A note of thanks to Infogrames. The second comes from the audiovisual component that comes in the guise of Sunday: a clever use of the good old two-dimensional graphics places this title at the highest levels with regard to this genre of games, where the current standard is represented by titles such as Europa Universalis and Civilization III . When we start playing we can decide to come across a series of Tutorial missions which, although well done and recommended to everyone, fail to immediately convey the impressive level of complexity that the player will encounter when they come across this title. Once the tutorials are finished we will finally be able to come across a predefined campaign or one created on the basis of the starting parameters defined by us. These parameters include rather obvious settings such as the level of difficulty, our name, the starting city and the game objectives. Basically our goals to be achieved will be the achievement of a certain social status which will reach its peak when we become Eldermann, i.e. president of the entire Hanseatic League. Playing Patrician II we will be catapulted directly into the fourteenth century when a number of port towns, overlooking the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, came together in a commercial and political organization called the Hanseatic League. However, not everyone could participate in this association, membership was in fact usually reserved for the so-called patricians, a ~caste~ of wealthy people who sought, with their economic and political power, to counter the powers of the aristocrats linked to the Holy Roman Empire. We will have to impersonate a young merchant who, starting to trade with a small ship from London to Stockholm, aspires to establish a real Economic Empire within the Hanseatic League. And we assure you that it is certainly not simple. On the contrary. Vote Antonio, vote Antonio, vote Antonio LaTrippa. Most of our wealth, at least initially, will come from sea trade, however as you progress further and further into the game, land based activities will also prove to be very useful. First of all, once enough wealth has been accumulated, we will be able to build houses to rent or small manufacturing industries capable of manipulating the raw materials arriving at the port to produce new merchandise to be placed on the domestic and non-domestic market. Furthermore, in our hometown, we will be able to establish a whole series of relationships, legal or not, which will help us in our social life. Yes because, as already mentioned, in addition to becoming rich in Patrician II we will have to become very popular to first become burgomaster of our city and then the undisputed head of the entire Hanseatic League. So here we will be able (should we?) join the local merchants' association, we will have to go to the town hall, the public baths and the church ... the choices are really many and we will have the pleasure of discovering them as we proceed with the progress of the game. And if we like the dark side of the force it will be possible to go to the most infamous suburbs of the city and enter the taverns to get in touch with informants, thieves and even pirates to whom we can decide to ~donate~ one of our boats in exchange for a part of the booty obtained from any raids. In short, Patrician is certainly not to be considered a role-playing game, however it must be admitted that this game tries in every way to put us in the shoes of a greedy merchant of the late Middle Ages Let's set sail on the eastern routes. Especially initially, however, all our energies will be absorbed by the planning of trade by sea. Patrician II implements one of the most complex economic systems ever seen in a video game. In fact, each city of the Hanseatic league has its own specific production and specific needs in terms of raw materials, it is up to us to fit into this mosaic and always take full advantage of it. And we assure you that it is not as simple as it may seem, as already announced, in fact, the economic system is complex to the point that we will not be able to rely on simple routine routes because first of all we need to give the cmanufacturing companies have the time to produce the material in large quantities (otherwise the price would be too disadvantageous) and then because if we saturate the purchasing market with continuous arrivals of goods, our profit margin will always be lower. We will also have to try to supply our base city with the rarest and most sought-after goods (in this way our fame will be significantly increased) and, similarly, we must never dare to buy goods in high demand from our fellow citizens from the local markets. We must also not forget that we will not be ~alone~ and therefore a lot of business may be stolen from our direct competitors. Remaining with Patrician II's hands in hand means being with half a foot in the grave therefore, especially at the beginning, we will have to go almost crazy to maximize the performance of our sea voyages always being careful to follow the golden rule which belongs to the simple principle of the supply/demand relationship. Let's set sail on the eastern routes. Of course, sooner or later, we will also be able to entrust some of our boats to skilled captains who, on the basis of certain directives, will buy and sell in certain cities with certain price levels and quantities, but this operation, as well as being difficult, will in any case prove to be less profitable than a possible our direct work and therefore it is useful only in the presence of a fairly large fleet where the lost earnings are leveled with the highest number of trades that can be managed simultaneously. Trade is not everything, in fact sporadically you will have to defend yourself from the attacks of the opposing pirates. Although not the predominant part for the purposes of the game, the naval battles prove to be a more than pleasant diversion, exploiting the wind, boarding the opposing vessels and setting fire to the gunpowder proved to be much more fun and playable than facing the maritime battles in the famous RTS true as Age Of Empires. The multi-trade. We could not fail to open the usual paragraph regarding the multiplayer modes supported by the game. Patrician II supports two types of multiplayer games, the first is the classic game played over the TCP/IP protocol. A computer acts as a server and a certain number of other participants (a maximum of 8 players are supported) connect server to server and then configure their personal attributes and those of the game that will be created. The second, however, provides for the possibility of everyone playing on the same computer, transforming the game into a more classic turn-based strategy game. It goes without saying that obviously it will be possible to save / load the game even in Multiplayer sessions. Concluding. I really appreciated the effort of the Ascaron designers to make a game genre typically oriented towards a niche of enthusiasts accessible also to a different type of user. The well-finished graphics, the various expedients designed to immerse the player in the game atmosphere and the clean and intuitive interface, manage to make this goal almost fully achieved. I almost say because (and I would add ~fortunately~) Patrician II is a game with a truly impressive depth that still requires truly constant attention and dedication from the player. The game was then structured so that many features of the game become available only at a certain level of play. This, if on the one hand ensures a truly enviable longevity and variety of game, on the other it will risk discouraging the more inexperienced players who in the initial hours of each game will have to fight with repetitive actions, perhaps boring and at the same time demanding. Patrician II is therefore highly recommended to experts of the genre and to those who would like to become one, all the others know that, under a friendly and winking patina, this game hides a brain cell torturer, but do you want to put the satisfaction of becoming Eldermann? Intro. It is a decidedly prolific period for German developers who, together with our cousins from across the Alps, are trying to respond to the Anglo-American dominance in the field of videogame production for Personal Computers. Today we analyze a title from Ascaron Software, a name that will not sound new to the ears of the more elderly players and which today offers us an interesting strategic title: Patrician II. Patrician II resumes the current recently inaugurated by Paradox with Europa Universalis and utIt uses real-time to implement game mechanics that, only until recently, would have required the turn-based structure in full Civilization style. Each of you will have noticed that ~II~ immediately after the name of the game, if you had missed the first chapter, however, you don't have to worry because it dates back to the early 90s when the Amiga was still the gaming HomeComputer par excellence. A title much closer to Patrician II, and not only for the name, is certainly Merchant Prince but also titles like SimCity or the aforementioned Civilization can, from a certain point of view, be somehow compared to this title. Patrician II is in fact a commercial simulation with a hint of RTS soul and a strong strategic/diplomatic vocation.", "date": "2002-04-26", "grade": null}
