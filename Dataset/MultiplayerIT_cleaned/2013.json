{"name": "Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-taxi-3-high-roller.html", "text": "Graphics Perky graphics, full of colors, lights and above all fluid like water!!! Forget the hiccuping frame rate, the pushed pop-up and any other programming opprobrium that normally annoys and saddens the poor gamer. This title is not based on a ~port~ and it shows!!! The graphics engine does its job admirably, free from problems such as ~blind mole~ textures or ~moon tan~ light effects, it will only occasionally present polygon penetration problems (for example, when squeezed by a wall of a building, the customers magically stand with their legs ~inside~ one side of your car). We may not touch the highest levels of detail and graphic purity, but the care put into characterizing all elements of this game is truly exhilarating. The protagonists then, are really the best; twelve characters all super characterized: from the forty-year-old with a Hawaiian shirt GUS, to the fat black Venus (ahem no offense to fat women of any color), from the hotness of the moment Geena, to the revised version of ~Taurus~ of the best Interstate '76, without forgetting the spry ~old man~ who is so reminiscent of the Genius of the Turtle of ~Dragonball-iana~ memory. Some ~improbable customers~ deserve a separate discussion, completely out of their minds and dressed in the most absurd ways as clowns, mascots (rabbits), Moulin Rouge dancers, majorettes, handsome businessmen and anything else funny and demented you can load into your car! The only real shortcoming, are the reflection effects on cars; are implemented in a very simple way, the bodywork of the cars does not reflect what surrounds them and even the windows of the dashboards tend to look like simple graphic artists, inserted just so as not to clash with the context. I assure you, however, that during the game you will not have time to notice them! sound After producing the fantastic Jet Set Radio Future, Sega decided not to disappoint us from this point of view, inserting pieces from OFF SPRING, CITIZEN BIRD and BAD RELIGION. Almost all the pieces are adrenaline-pumping and pressing, and only after many games can they become repetitive. Too bad they forgot to insert a ~juke box~ in the game, where you can listen to the compilations we have inserted on the large XBox hard disk. Such a shame. Even the sound effects are in line with everything else... but perhaps in this case it would be more correct to say ~outside the lines like the whole game~! The customers who get excited during your stunts with shouts and gestures, who yell at you for being too slow, car-slamming, engines roaring and tires squealing; In short, it seems that nothing is missing! Gameplay To those approaching the successful Crazy Taxi series for the first time (but where have you been? On the moon?!?), we can say that the game mechanics are very simple, our aim is to raise as much money as possible within a certain time limit, taking the various customers from one place to another in the city. The more stunts you perform, the greater the extra money that will be given to you, reverse speech for the time, the more you will use for ~delivery~ and the lower the gain. To facilitate the task there will be an ~indispensable~ arrow that will change direction and color to show you step by step which road to take ~to go where you need to go~ (as Tot would say). Of course, to make everything more ~peppery~ there will be rivers of chaotic traffic, always ready to slow you down at the most beautiful... luckily you can count on a series of stunts worthy of the best circus, such as the Crazy Hop (a leap towards the high, very useful for jumping on raised platforms or various obstacles), the Crazy Drift (capable of making you rotate on yourself, for very rapid changes of direction) and the Crazy Dash (when you say burning shot! Look at the photos and you will understand what I mean !). To those who have had the opportunity to ~collide~ with this series, we can only reiterate that Sega knows how to make really fun games! The Crazy Taxi formula has always been successful in terms of fun and immediacy; the levels of ~videogame pleasure~ and exaltation are truly stratospheric, especially when you learn to drive like a skilled ~stuntman~ and manage to insert the shortcuts carefully scattered in the various locations one after the other, as well as trampolines and ramps, a real boon to perform the most spectacular and profitable stunts. In short, pure fun, without limiting worries (with the exception of time), such as damage to the car, the police, pedestrians (don't worry you will never put one under! At least I don't comean me with GTA!). As in the previous ~releases~, also in CT3, there are numerous mini-games included in the Crazy-X mode (on DC it was called Crazy Box), very useful for practicing the commands and for incredibly honing your ~taxing~ skills. I said ~incredibly~ just to underline the most disparate situations that you will be called to overcome; you will find yourself in sports environments such as a baseball field (while you will be intent on making a Home Run hitting a giant baseball with your car!), an American football field (where you will have to get to the ~touch down~ dodging hordes of angry cars !), or in extreme ~transport~ situations, such as the very long series of piers overhanging the sea or the Egyptian ruins joined only by increasingly ~narrower~ trampolines (the last one is barely as big as your car!) , and many other variants (in total there are 25). The commands, even if not configurable, are well studied and almost always respond in a precise and immediate way (except for performing the Crazy Dash, which is not always precise when we use the right trigger combination to accelerate and the B key to change gear) . Longevity: here you risk! The real Achilles heel of all the various ~episodes~ of Crazy Taxi has always been longevity. How long will you play a title, so fun and immediate, but which in the long run can be repetitive in the game mechanics? The Sega ~technicians~ didn't stand still waiting in the pits for their racing car to run out of gas (that is, the desire to play it), but they worked hard to make their game more varied and attractive, inserting an extra mode like the Crazy-X or the introduction of two other locations in addition to the one already present in the previous chapter. Now, in fact, we will find ourselves able to ~roam~ in three distinct metropolises (West Coast, Glitter Oasis and Small Apple) each characterized by different settings and characters. For the characterization of the environments, please refer to the photos taken (which can describe better than hundreds of words). Again to make the game mechanics more stimulating, the ~group~ of customers has been introduced, i.e. no longer just single people to ~accompany~ from one place to another, but ~packages~ of 2,3 or 4 people, all with different destinations. A simple, yet effective expedient to increase the level of challenge and therefore lengthen its longevity a little. Comments Quite simply the BEST version of Crazy Taxi ever created! Ideal for ~nerve-free~ matches, all focused on fun and light-heartedness. If you are looking for something that will entertain you without stressing you out, now you know what your cure is! If you have never had the ~pleasure~ of playing this title, released in various forms and in as many different systems (from arcades to consoles, and recently also on PC, even if only in its first incarnation), run and try it. , could win you over with a stroke of the accelerator! The only real flaw lies in the game formula itself (in its limited longevity), which in long sessions could tire you. However, I'm sure that if you play this title not as a Project Gotham (where pursuing the goal at all costs (even in terms of nerves given the surgeon's driving style sometimes required) is the only ~fair~ way to unlock extra tracks and cars), but as a true ~anti-stress~, it risks lasting for a very long time. Pros: The best version of Crazy Taxy ever produced; Pure fun and adrenaline; Excellent as an anti-stress and for carefree matches; Formidable audio, thanks also to songs by Off Spring, Bad Religion and Citizen Bird; Fantastic and immediate playability; Graphically it is a storm of lights and colors (especially in night locations); The graphics engine ensures a smooth and constant frame rate; Some mini-games are a blast; Ability to save and review replays of our performances. Cons: It may not last long if played from the wrong point of view (just enough time to finish Crazy-X mode and little else); The graphic engine sometimes suffers from ghost effects (mostly in particular situations between pedestrians and the taxi); It is not possible to listen to your own compilations (but does it take so much effort to insert this option?); No multiplayer mode (given some minigames, they could have inserted a sort of Olympics!); It is not possible to reconfigure the keys to your liking (even if given the great immediacy of the controls, they are less missed); Materials: Image gallery Movie 1 Movie 2 Let's discuss it in the Forum Packaging & Presentation What could we expect from the ~guys~ of SEGA if not a ~frea~ lookkkettoni~ and so much madness! ~Scratchy~ cover, ~branded~ manual, ~ingrifata~ presentation (ahem... maybe this is not the most correct term). In short, just look at the introductory videos to understand that Crazy Taxi 3 is a riot of colors, adrenaline, psychopathic taxi drivers, impossible acrobatics and ultra pumped music!!!There are three introductory films, made with the game engine, one for each ~taxi-slaughterhouse~, each one presents its own 4 ~flying~ freakkettoni. less careful: this is the American version, therefore all ~only in English~.", "date": "2002-09-11", "grade": null}
