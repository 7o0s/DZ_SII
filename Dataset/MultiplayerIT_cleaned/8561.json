By now there are so many around that it is hard to keep up with a fermenting market that is probably the real future of the gaming industry, for better or for worse. Let's clarify one point right away: Blacklight: Retribution is one of the best titles of its kind, with ideas taken almost everywhere but reshuffled with great skill. The graphics engine is worthy of a single player shooter and puts several triple A titles for consoles and PC to shame. We can even go so far as to say that we are facing one of the most beautiful titles to see released in recent years. Obviously we are talking about online games, but the work of Zombie Studios is able to leave numerous titles for solitary players behind by different lengths. The result becomes even more impressive if we consider that we are talking about the sequel to a certainly not very successful title: Blacklight: Tango Down, shooter for PC, XBLA and PSN from 2010. In battle Blacklight Retribution is a competitive shooter with all the elements that have become typical of the genre: avatar customization, inventory management, leveling up and so on. The action takes place in a rather typical way and is very reminiscent of the multiplayer of the various CODs, but with ideas borrowed from titles such as Crysis 2 and beyond. In short, it is a semi-tactical shooter in which the ability to work as a team and to deceive the opponent with various tricks is rewarded, rather than the actual skill, enormously mortified by the design. The idea is that, like it or not, everyone must be able to score some frag and, above all, everyone must be able to grow their character so as to unlock advanced equipment... and maybe decide to buy it. But let's go slowly. As in many other titles of the genre, growth is very slow when you are at a low level. However, the game takes care to give us experience points even if we do practically nothing, except hang around the maps. You get points if you win and you get points if you lose. Each kill yields a certain number of points, which increase or decrease according to the frag's circumstance. For example, if you kill a player who has scored a killing spree, you get more points than if you kill a player who is playing the role of cannon fodder. The game modes are very classic: deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, domination and so on. Each has a scoring system set up a little differently than the others. From this point of view there is little left to say, given that we are faced with a slavish re-proposition of the stylistic features of the genre, albeit of excellent workmanship. Maps and gameplay Blacklight Retribution's maps are large and have a certain twistiness. Let's say that the general design is very good, even if in some environments there are plenty of staging points for campers and you can take advantage of some excessive angularities. But, as we have already said, everyone must be able to fragga... and buy. The spawn points are well placed in the larger maps, where you always start in points away from the enemies, while in the smaller ones you can find yourself surrounded by enemies. It's frustrating to die moments after respawning without even having the time and opportunity to look around. Fortunately it doesn't happen very often, but the developers should do something not to send some maps deserted, which risk being dodged by the most shrewd gamers. Free2play mechanics Think for a moment about any free2play title you've played in the last few years and you'll understand how Blacklight: Retribution's microtransactions work. There are two currencies in the game: CP and Zen. The former are accumulated by playing, the latter by paying real money. Usually many more CPs are spent than Zen to buy a single item, except in cases where the CPs are not really foreseen. Obviously the best items are those that require real money, while in other cases so many CP are required that you want to shorten the time by spending some Zen anyway. The system is perfectly integrated with the game, to the point that you understand the many customization options just by taking a look at the internal shop, where there are hundreds of items for sale, divided into categories, with goods updated at a constant rate. At this point we would like to be able to tell you that paid items do not facilitate the game and do not create imbalances, but we would be lying: those who pay simply have a better chance of winning. Let's take the case of an equipped characterof credit card placed in front of a smooth one. In the case of equal hits, the second one will fall first. Playing we have experienced games in which monsters who accumulate points have been accused of using cheats and, instead, have turned out to be just spendthrifts. Each purchased object gives a small relative advantage, which can be compensated with one's personal skill, but by adding dozens of different objects, the advantages accumulate and the compensation becomes gradually more difficult, also because the rhythm of the movements is rather slow and the more who is rewarded purposely waiting for the enemy who faces him head on. The human machine Equipment aside, you can really buy everything, from recharging energy to doubling the speed of accumulation of experience points obtainable by playing. If you start spending, you never end up, with the approximately 5000 zen obtainable by chasing around fifty euros which become the minimum to withstand the arrogance of some players transformed into Visa or Mastercard tanks (although then, given that the equipment has a time of use, you will have to pay again to become competitive again... so in a sense it is a snake that bites its own tail, because after getting used to the best, it is difficult to go back to playing smoothly). It is often difficult to distinguish a cheater from an ultra-equipped regular user, to the point that it is easy to wonder what the difference is between those who use an aimbot and those who buy invisibility or those who pay for a robot that allows you to cheat with great ease. The problem is that in many cases, especially when playing at a high level, the differences between paying players and non-paying players are very noticeable. When you are a lower level and you face other low level players you feel less, but as you accumulate experience you start to feel an almost compulsive desire to buy something. Either because in the last shootout we found ourselves at a disadvantage due to an armor of little value, or you want because whoever spends can recharge energy faster and can truly exploit all the options offered by the game. So you find yourself spending a lot of time in the shop and coming to terms with what should or shouldn't buy, also based on your style on the battlefield. It is here that we understand that the perfect free2play game is simply a psychological machine designed to induce purchase and that it has nothing to do with competitive online gaming. Sure, it looks like it, but in reality it lives on a completely different level, made up of small frustrations that create a sense of inadequacy that cannot be eliminated. Slowly we find ourselves entangled in a system that can be traced back to a kind of videogame classism, where skill takes a back seat. Blacklight: Retribution does nothing to mitigate this system, which is perverse in more than one sense and, indeed, is its magnificence.", "date": "2012-04-30", "grade": "7.5"}
