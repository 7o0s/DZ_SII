{"name": "Silent Hunter 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/75351-silent-hunter-5-tre-metri-sotto-il-mare.html", "text": "From 1939 to 1945, Nazi submarine technology, as terrible as it was fascinating, did not spare ocean liners and rescue ships and had allied supplies as its primary objective. But the imagination of submarines remains distant from the atrocious one of the battlefields. As terrible as war is always, the aura of mystery and strategy that has always enveloped them and their silent war is what matters, at least staying within the confines of the video game series produced to date. The campaign therefore, after the parenthesis of the fourth chapter, puts us again in command of a German submarine, a U-boat engaged in the invasion of Poland. The first objective is three almost helpless ships waiting for us in the middle of the Baltic Sea. Once the weak threat has been easily eliminated, we just have to return to Kiel to then face a new mission... Periscope share From now on it gets serious. Opponents move and above all defend themselves. The hunt begins. The best way to spot enemies is to stay on deck with the captain and two lookouts who physically indicate any sightings. Once in full swing or during silent approach attempts, it is instead advisable to keep below the surface of the water, entrusting the view to the periscope. In both situations it is possible to give orders to the crew or act directly on the commands to launch torpedoes or to fire the external cannon if some enemy has caught us unprepared while we were staring at the wrong horizon on the upper terrace. The indispensable tools are always present in the lower left and upper right. We find the depth indicator that allows us to dive slowly or quickly, the rudder, some direct orders, the progress of the game speed, the selector that allows us to let the engine room know whether to speed up or slow down and the map, fundamental to navigate towards the objectives and to set longer or shorter navigation routes. The series has already accustomed us to a radical change in gameplay as the difficulty varies and Silent Hunter 5 makes no difference. At the lowest degree of simulation, the title is almost an arcade, although there are still immense expanses of sea to cross and it is always necessary to calculate the route well, observe the horizon carefully. But we find no other obstacle. Torpedoes almost always hit the target while countermeasures are almost infallible in saving us from enemy attacks. By raising the simulation level, the question becomes decidedly more complex but the customization allows you to keep a high difficulty without having to know the submarine mechanics by heart, as instead happened with the previous chapters. In short, we can enjoy a high degree of simulation during the clashes, without including the need to recharge batteries and compressed air which, although it increases realism and there is still the possibility of increasing the game speed, often translates into long and senseless pauses . Submarine or submarine? Many of the diving vessels used in World War II were not submarines but submersiblessurface vessels with the ability to stay underwater for a limited time. Today the two terms are equivalent as submarines are in disuse. Despite German technological supremacy, during the Second War only two U-boat models were submarines capable of performing long missions while remaining hidden but only one, the XXIII class, was actually used during the Second World War. Novelty Ubisoft Romania introduced the human dimension inside the submarine with the third Silent Hunter, but only in this fifth chapter are we actually inside an underwater vessel. While above us the waves stir up a dark and inscrutable sea, we find ourselves observing the sailors who move along the vessel, physically carrying out the orders we have formulated. We live with them the drama of a canned war, made up of disturbing noises and screaming bulkheads. And the crew now has a mood that goes up when we hit a hit but goes down with tension and fatigue. In short, these are rather substantial additions even if largely almost exclusively aesthetic. Furthermore, due to the need to keep the submarine simulation intact, we are always allowed to act on the commands directly, wherever we are, and this possibility can make ~life on board~ superfluous. On the contrary, a dynamic element returns to the campaign that allows us to choose objectives and see the result of our defeats evictories in the current strategic situation. Nothing that upsets history of course and no crossroads that allows Germany to upset the destinies of the world, but even the mere choice of coasts to patrol is a fundamental element to immerse ourselves in the world of those years and make us feel that the coasts of England are there, a few steps away. Furthermore, at the mooring, made with particular care, it is possible to hear about what is happening in the world while the crews chat and prepare to set sail. Very rough sea The atmosphere is more than good, the volumetric clouds aren't bad, the waves and the foam from the engines defend themselves with value. In addition, the campaign and missions offer notable historical insights such as the defense of the Bismarck, the legendary German battleship hunted by an entire fleet. If we add the more intuitive interface and the new life on board to this, the result should be more than good. It should, we said, because the graphics engine is starting to show too many weaknesses and this incarnation of Silent Hunter is unfortunately full of bugs, problems, graphic defects and flaws of all sorts. The only noteworthy improvements seem to be those related to the models and are functional to the novelties of the title, but they even become harmful when we realize that on board the frame rate loses too many hits, touching 19 fps even on our test configuration. The explosions seem even worse and while the ships wallow calmly like ducks, the rough sea often badly submerges our submarine which sometimes sails worse than a punctured raft. In fact, it happens that the waves sweep the outer deck even while the crew occupies it, with an unpleasant effect that sees the sailors disappear underwater and emerge carelessly despite tons of water having just hit them at dizzying speeds. And we are only talking about the tip of the iceberg because during the game sessions we have seen things that you humans cannot even imagine. Burning battleships travel in reverse. Phantom torpedoes. Missions aborted. And all of these moments will be remembered as flaws that detract from a potentially incredible experience. Not to mention that we haven't mentioned the worst inconvenience yet. In fact, the protection of the title forces you to synchronize your saves with a Ubisoft server and forces you to always remain connected to the internet in order to play. Well, in the first few days of the game we can assure you that communication problems with the server prevented us from playing more than once and for considerable periods of time (At the moment the problems seem to have been resolved, Editor's note).", "date": "2010-03-11", "grade": "7.0"}
