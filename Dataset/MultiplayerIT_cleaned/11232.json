The gaming world has always divided tennis games into two simple categories: simulations and arcades. Only a few examples can demonstrate the mixing of the two genres, with Virtua Tennis, for example, which tries to add more realistic and refined mechanics to an immediate and fast base. Smash Court Tennis 3, on the other hand, tries the path of pure simulation, precisely the basic idea that the competitor Top Spin also follows, even if the latter with clearly superior results. After countless titles dedicated to tennis, it might be time to have new ideas and a fresh gameplay that doesn't try to mimic what has already been seen and played in the past. Namco, instead of proposing a potentially new title, looks for an easy way out by offering the player a large number of options, characters, stadiums and objectives, without worrying about - how - to create the game structure and the mechanics of the main shots of this sport. After countless titles dedicated to tennis, it might be time for new ideas What can a modern tennis game offer nowadays? Smash Court Tennis 3 is the encyclopedia of every tennis game, containing practically every mode or challenge that has ever appeared on every console in the past. There is the classic ~arcade~, where you start without too many thoughts or choices after selecting our athlete. Free exhibition instead allows us to set the game parameters, options and anything else to our liking to start a single or double challenge. The editor section, the Xbox Live section and finally the World Tour complete the picture. It is possible to create a player from scratch using an effective and very complete editor: once the modeling of our character is finished, you can start with the career mode, which is decidedly varied and deep. Through a notebook you keep an eye on appointments, matches to face, tournaments to participate in and workouts to enhance your physical and technical characteristics. Just like in an RPG, experience makes the character grow, increasing all the various values assigned such as strength, endurance, serve, volley, dunk, run, precision and so on. Is my character slow, or just underleveled? Through challenges called ~sponsors~ we get the support of one of the big brands that represents us in competitions and makes us earn money. By winning matches and tournaments, a certain amount of money gradually accumulates which we can reinvest to buy accessories, rackets and sportswear for our digital alter-ego. The impression one gets right away is that Smash Court Tennis 3 is decidedly slow and cumbersome: the characters struggle to reach one part or the other of the field, they don't dive to collect dunks or opposing volleys, they seem clumsy. The Namco title works as a sort of sports RPG, so to get to see minimally decent performance you have to work hard, earn points and level up your character a lot; the initial frustration is very long, but our tennis player will never reach a fluidity of movements and quick shots as one might expect. The ball itself seems to move too slowly compared to reality, as does the running motion of any selectable athlete. Going a long diagonal to get a short shot is practically impossible, given the biblical travel times. The impression you get right away is that Smash Court Tennis 3 is decidedly slower and more cumbersome than any Virtua Tennis Another point that leaves us perplexed is the system with which we can vary the player's mood: after each action, by pressing one of the four main buttons, we can decide whether to make him stay calm, whether to make him angry or gassed him through exuberant gestures. Well, deciding to use these options does not change the behavior and performance in the game in any way, does not reduce the possibility of error, does not increase speed or strength. The idea behind it is interesting, but without seeing any practical changes it is totally useless to use this feature. The World Tour is the most appropriate part of SCT3, with which, through a busy calendar of events, you start participating in qualifying tournaments, sponsor competitions, challenges or training sessions. The latter follow a bit what has already been seen in other titles of the genre, and include mini-games of all kinds with the aim of refining the main shots and earning points to level up the character. By winning competitions and races, our ranking rises slowly, up to the goal of seeing us in the number one position in the world. The possibilityPlaying online via Xbox Live or going head-to-head with a friend completes the Namco title package. Comment Smash Court Tennis 3 stands as an alternative to the sacred monsters Top Spin and Virtua Tennis, with a purely realistic and simulative imprint. Namco stock suffers from the worst evil that can strike a sports stock: anonymity. The polygonal models of the players themselves are not very realistic, the graphics sector does not excel, the audio is not memorable. Other problems arise from the structure of the game that derives from its RPG-like setting, with characters that are too slow and cumbersome, as well as game actions. The World Tour is the bright spot, with tons of different competitions, challenges and workouts. An effective customization editor completes the picture. The advice, before any purchase, is to try the possible alternatives currently on the market. Pros Lots of modes and options World Tour Editor Cons Character look Gameplay too slow Some graphical issues Goals Namco's Smash Court Tennis 3 provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to unlock. The latter are mainly divided into two categories: those to be obtained in the World Tour and those to be conquered by playing online or against a friend. Going up the positions in the world ranking, they gradually accumulate more and more points, until we reach number one which will earn us 100 points. Winning on Xbox Live unlocks more points, relatively quickly and easily. Finally, almost 300 points are distributed through secret objectives, and are obtained simply by continuing to play SMC3 for a long time. The third wheel As in any self-respecting tennis game, in Smash Court Tennis 3 it is possible to play on grass, synthetic or red sand, on many fields scattered around the world such as the Garden City Arena in Sydney, the Court de la Contribution in France or the British Royal Tennis Center, each reproduced with many details and well characterized. Great care has been taken in making the greatest number of locations and tennis players available to the player, even if there was not as much precision in the general implementation of the same. Graphically, SCT3 is detailed and very varied, but from an aesthetic point of view it is too anonymous: the players have an unrealistic and fake look, resembling soulless mannequins. While there is a real resemblance to the real-life counterparts, the feeling that the polygonal models are unrealistic remains strong. The environments are detailed, but with a (stable) frame rate of 30fps we could have expected more, even from the point of view of aliasing, quite marked. There are not many effects on the screen, since it is a title that seems to be the result of a perhaps too long gestation and a development derived from the first generation of next-gen games. The animations, well made, however, are too few for us not to notice the fact that they are repeated all too often. Finally, the audio sector suffers from the same defect that the whole game seems to suffer from: anonymity. The accompanying music contributes to the too dated idea of the Namco title, making it seem like an old coin-op from the 90s. Better as regards noises and background voices, which also include numerous customizations: seeing Sharapova on the pitch, someone will murmur from the stands: ~Maria!~.", "date": "2008-08-29", "grade": null}
