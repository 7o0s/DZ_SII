{"name": "Devil May Cry", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry_a.html", "text": "Dante in Hell A day like many others for Dante. It's just after 9 in the evening and he's still in his Devil May Cry office (the same name of the game) when a beautiful woman with breathtaking curves named Trish gets on her bike, breaking through the shutter. This will be the opening scene that you will face as you start this new Capcom adventure. Thanks to the space offered by the DVD support, in which the game is made, the programmers have spared no ~expenses~ by inserting an initial, very long, CG movie worthy of a Hollywood film. The mysterious Trish invites Dante, a demon hunter, to go to Mallet Island, where there is the only space-time door that allows access to the underworld. Let the descent begin!! A classic concept to the nth degree In recent years Capcom has ridden the videogame wave thanks to its horror games (Resident Evil in primis but also Dino Crisis) which have had the merit of giving new life to a genre that had always remained a niche until then. This Devil May Cry touches this trend only marginally (we will explain the points of contact later) going back to the world of action games, with the declared intention of bringing a realistic and three-dimensional world within a classic concept such as the one of games like Castelvania. The title is divided into missions in which our hero will have to fight against terrible demonic creatures (we go from puppets to giant spiders) equipped with mythological weapons and at the same time with the latest technological discoveries such as rifles, pistols and so on. But that's not all, the developers have seen fit to introduce variations to the genre, so much so that at the end of each stage you can spend the red spheres acquired during the adventure to upgrade or to recover the energy lost in combat. Without wanting to anticipate much, I can tell you that each mission has different objectives as well as the settings will vary as you continue in the game, giving a very pleasant and enticing sense of ~never seen~. A strong point of this title, compared to many similar productions, is the level of difficulty. Never and never will you be gripped by a sense of frustration for not being able to unlock a door or defeat an enemy, thanks to a progressive and well-calibrated level of difficulty. Obviously this well-calibrated difficulty could lead an expert player to finish the game within a couple of days, but I can assure you that the satisfaction we get from this parallel life will reward us for the money spent. DMC: RE + ICO? Upon closer inspection, you can see how the developers have borrowed some typical elements of other productions such as Resident Evil and Ico. The pointing system is very similar to that used in Capcom horror games, in which pressing the R1 key was accompanied by the x button. Here the procedure is the same, but we will finally dispense with the loading times between one series of shots and the next since we will have infinite ammo for our firearms. Another point of contact can be found in the dynamic management of the cameras which, if in most cases it performs its task admirably, on certain occasions it contributes to losing sight of the enemy with consequent discomfort in the fight. A similar situation can be found in the third mission, when Dante is grappling with a giant spider (hit him on the sting if you want to win). Certainly noteworthy are the settings, which draw heavily on the Gothic style of which the game is based. Faithful reconstructions of the settings and furnishings also thanks to an abundant use of textures that give a remarkable sense of reality to the adventure. In the wise reconstruction of the environments and the atmosphere, the echoes of ICO can be found. The locations are very similar to the initial castle in which ICO begins its adventure and this is absolutely not a bad thing, on the contrary. Most of the objects on the screen are in real time, so much so that we can have fun breaking crates, tables and bookcases, making us believe for a few moments that we are in a Final Fight game.-). A notable use of polygons has also been made for the creation of the charactersprotagonist whether it be the enemies. We'll have to fight about twenty different monsters, each with its own characteristics that we'll have to learn quickly if we don't want to succumb to their blows. An ~Italian~ adventure It's been a long time since I've been playing with a product so simple and engaging at the same time. It is enough to see the control system to understand what kind of game it is. The character responds instantly to the commands given and a couple of keys will be enough to command our protagonist, all with a naturalness that will make us think of playing Devil May Cry for a lifetime. The action will be constantly accompanied by industrial and hard-rock tunes in real time, i.e. they will follow the action. The game's own sound effects are also commendable, which interact very well with the soundtrack and the settings. The presence of Italian subtitles in the PAL version should be noted, which will help make the plot understandable even to an audience ~non-English speaking~. Devil May Cry reaches Heaven (video game) More than a game we are dealing with a videogame art form. The characters, the settings, the gameplay clearly reveal the obsessive care that the programmers have lavished on the creation of Devil May Cry. Despite having identified a couple of slight flaws (sometimes chaotic shots and transparency effect of the walls), we find ourselves in hand a must buy, a game that should make a fine show in all gamers' homes. A life experience, in which the gamer will truly represent Good against Evil for a few hours, and will not rest until the terrible Mundus is definitively defeated and the World returns to peace again. Devil May Cry reaches Heaven (video game) Pros: practically perfect if it weren't for... Cons: ... transparent walls effect management of shots not always impeccable Official site Preview by Maxel Wallpaper Preview Screenshots It all began 2000 years ago An ancient and dusty manuscript preserves the echoes of a legend inside. It narrates the perennial struggle between Good and Evil, between ephemeral humans and immortal demons. Around the year zero, the quiet life of the world was shaken by the birth of a new and cruel demon in the underworld. His goal was to rule not only his equals but the terrestrial world as well, and he would have succeeded if a demon-knight named Sparda had not sided with humans. Good defeated Evil and the prince of demons was locked up in a cave deprived of his evil powers. The black prince Sparda ensured prosperity and peace to the world of humans and he himself married one of them giving birth to a child half man and half demon, whose name is Dante. But a dark omen is bound to undermine this idyllic world. But beware, humans! After a lapse of 2,000 years, the cruel emperor will be freed and will again attempt to invade Earth. Our protector will be the son of Sparda!~", "date": "2002-01-28", "grade": null}
