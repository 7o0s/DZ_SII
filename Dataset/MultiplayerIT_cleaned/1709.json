{"name": "Contra: Shattered Soldiers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/contra-shattered-soldiers.html", "text": "Old school carnage, highly strategic Shattered Soldiers is a game with an entirely two-dimensional interaction environment, where the polygonal graphics and the occasional changes in orientation of the cameras and action do not add any real depth or possibility of exploration. Put in these terms, the question might seem negative. Contra, on the other hand, is an ~old-fashioned~ game that works perfectly on two solid dimensions and which - proof of this are the two poor attempts to transport the saga in 3D on PSX - could hardly adapt to a three-dimensional conception while keeping its original appeal intact . By moving laterally or, more rarely, vertically, you will advance (even in two players, which greatly increases not only the fun but also the strategy) unloading billions of bullets and other types of ammunition on hordes of more or less aggressive enemies, in levels that add a dash of platforming action to a style of play where, essentially, the player requires thumb speed, quick reflexes and ability to direct shots in various directions. In addition to the canonical button for the shot and the one for the jump, in fact, it is possible to block the character, allowing the player to shoot in multiple directions without changing the stopping point; or block the firing direction, to allow the player to follow the same line of fire for any target to be hit without having to advance in a confusing manner in the same direction. The two techniques, used in conjunction, allow excellent control of the situation, allowing you to vary or block the position of the character or the line of fire to face any type of attack. It is also possible to change the weapon at any time, from a predefined set of the only three existing and always available: compared to the titles for the old 16bit consoles, here you will not find a vast series of different firearms and more or minus all effective for any situation but only three very different types of weapon available immediately. It is a decision that is reflected in the gameplay modeling it on the factor of strategy, necessary to deal with different situations: flamethrowers, machine guns and grenade launchers are absolutely heterogeneous in application, and each one suitable for an enemy or a particular moment. Old school carnage, highly strategic The same goes for the respective hyper-powered shot versions loaded by holding down the fire button of the weapon in use and subsequently releasing it. All gameplay is therefore built on the concept of challenging progress against a series of progressively more difficult challenges, with levels built to give continuous adrenaline rushes with brief moments of pause, and which generally provide for a mistral style of climax in the way in which the spectacular bosses of the middle, end and, sometimes, beginning of the level are presented, but also variations on the theme of the shooter conducted now in motion, now on missiles, now with alternating scrolling variants. In some sections, where you'll be hanging from a missile, the game practically becomes a ~ship~ shooter. What is more important is that, although there are two game modes, namely Easy and Normal (of which the first is already challenging enough and the second is very difficult), to see the ending you will have to go through the game in one breath, not there is the possibility of saving a passed level to resume later from that point. Although it is possible to choose in which order to face the first four levels and if the Training mode allows you to replay the individual levels (only if already finished in Normal mode and with sufficient Ranking assigned based on the enemies eliminated and the number of lives lost) , therefore, Contra is extremely difficult to finish. All the other extras, including the two secret levels and the Theater and Endings modes, can also be obtained with the sweat and training necessary to reach the necessary Ranking. Getting to the bottom of the game is a matter of not only cumulative but continuous effort, as you will have to pass all the levels in a row in a tirade that would crush even the most seasoned hardcore gamers. It is, in the simplest possible sense, a real challenge to the player. Antiemetics could help... We are therefore faced with a title that tests the player's ability, immersing him in a total challengeand gun cotton. Many of the players more inclined to ~easy~ titles or simply not interested in faster or more demanding genres could therefore find themselves displaced by the difficulty of the title; and the majority of gamers tout court could even be perplexed by the programmers' decision to assign only three weapons to be used strategically, or not to allow the save of the levels passed within the same game. Equally true is that old fans of shooters, of the Contra saga or, in general, gamers on the hardcore side could cry out for a miracle for such a title from other times, and find bread for their teeth eager for challenges at the limits of possible... also enjoying the pleasant quotes that the game dedicates to its illustrious predecessors. Contra: Shattered Soldiers is in fact full of quotes from the saga, often woven into a pleasant texture of crossed surprises that give the action a truly remarkable immersive quality. A decidedly enjoyable citation is constituted by the presence of the mythical fortresses of the very first Contra, complete with red patacconi on which to convey the arsenal supplied to knock them down. Antiemetics could help... But let's look at the first level. After making your way through a slew of enemies that try to block your advance and that you will have to eliminate by paying attention to the shooting trajectories you use, and after eliminating a menacing mechanical contraption and a huge a-la-Dune snake that emerges from a ice descent, a helicopter that has been following you since the beginning of the game will turn into a mecha. When it is ready to hit you, however, the mecha will be unexpectedly crushed by a huge biomechanical monster with the features of a turtle: the exact same boss of the first level of Contra for SNES. Once you have blown off its head with a flamethrower, you will believe you have finished the level, but the monster will rotate 180 revealing its side before beyond the screen, namely a disgusting and enormous face of living flesh that vomits very nasty liquids of various nature with lots of objects and people who navigate through it. Also in the first level, we will see the return of the mosquito men from the third level of Contra for the SNES. Other times we will recognize enemies already encountered. In short, already from the first game, Contra not only delights the veteran, but he presents himself with a remarkable scenic impact. Which introduces us to the discourse on graphics and sound. Aesthetically, Contra has class to spare. Post-urban backdrops with an apocalyptic flavor blend perfectly with enemies that borrow equally from cyberpunk, the mecha tradition of anime, the Alien saga and the worst nightmares of Bruguel, Bosch and Giger. Horrendous hybrids between fish and human faces, tanks full of minced meat that feed huge snakes, larvae that end up torn apart in very sharp fans or piles of meat with various eyes are just some of the surprises you will find yourself facing. The completely unrealistic and mechanical movements of the protagonists (complete with a rotating jump at fifteen thousand revolutions) or the sometimes small and not very detailed and animated models of the most common enemies count for little. They are, indeed, in a certain sense functional to the gameplay. The combination of speed of action, the quality of construction and presentation of the environments and the fantastic end-of-level bosses make Contra a remarkable visual experience, combined with a musical accompaniment that has been able to remain faithful to its predecessors and take advantage of the new technology at the same time tempo: the result is a very adequate and heavy mix of industrial metal and electronics, perfectly adhering to the gameplay and capable of keeping the player firmly glued to the rhythm. Crack, repeat, crack, repeat. Overcome, enjoy... It is, therefore, a game with a highly demanding concept, undoubtedly from other times. But which can also give much more satisfaction than the vast majority of titles on the market. It's the classic game to play as if you were learning the guitar: you'll have to ~get calluses~ to the control system, rework your eye-hand-brain cognitive system at the high rate of interaction, now weakened by too many games full of narrative sequences, try again and retry the same sections until you sweat them out. Just like with an instrument, as long as you like it, you won't get tired of it, because the difficulty will only act in the positive sense of functional pleasure, of progressive satisfaction. Truncating a parallelism that risks becoming forced, we could still say that Contra:Shattered Soldier responds to the ~classic~ imperative criterion, that of ~bringing into play~ an interaction system based on skill and not on guided observation. Crack, repeat, crack, repeat. Overcome, enjoy... No interactive film, no narrative show, no exploration, no sliding levels: the few and directorically laughable narrative sequences that link the levels are the only moments of oxygen for your heavy lungs, which you will skip to be able to play on the next level as soon as you catch your breath . Shattered Soldiers is the typical, old skill game where the continues are counted and the challenge is conceived as a job that must start well, perhaps cooperative in the common effort against the videogame monster; a game in which you will restart the game from the beginning once you lose two lives in the first level because ~if I start like this, I will never have enough for the boss of the third~. This also means that the game, once finished, will never remain in a drawer for too long because ~by now I've seen everything that happens~. However, reaching the ending is already a titanic undertaking in itself: at Easy level there is no endgame sequence given to you, while at Normal level the very few lives and continuous available will make you roll in the dust and decide not to play closer to fragile furnishings. Not to mention the various unlockable extras with feats beyond human possibilities, of which the most exemplary is the Konami superfinal guaranteed only for those who don't lose even ONE life for the whole game! On the irrevocable condition that such a challenge will galvanize you and not bore you, therefore, Contra's longevity is practically assured: it does not tend towards a certain number of things to ~see~, but towards continuous improvement. The Final Judgment Shattered Soldier is a shooter out of the ordinary. But the warnings are very evident and necessary: it is a game with high-speed action, seasoned with visual violence and frenetic interaction, which will greatly appeal to players who frequent fast and demanding genres, like to define themselves as hardcore gamers or enjoy overcoming the gameplay challenges and difficulties; specularly, it risks immediately discouraging, in the first game, all those looking for a game that ~lets itself be played~ comfortably, full of narrative opportunities, environments to explore, or with action at conventional rhythms. In Contra there is either concentration or you die like flies. And you do NOT continue at will to see the secret levels or the actual ending. Furthermore, controversial choices - such as the impossibility of seeing the ending without finishing the game all at once or the need to fussily know the levels to be faced in order to avoid losing the few, very precious lives - risk making Contra an experience that is not very fun and even frustrating for many players. Anyone who is not a fan of the genre should at least try it out before making a purchase. However, considering the large amount of easygoing and lobotomizing titles on the market, and putting aside the usual objectivity of reviewers for a moment, we would like to unbalance ourselves on a personal judgment: we therefore recommend a nice return to the glorious and stainless gameplay of yesteryear by purchasing a copy of ultra-luxury violence of Contra: Shattered Soldiers. And a good heart tonic. The Final Judgment Pros The REAL Contra returns after more than five years Frantic, precise, engaging action, even for two players Cybersplatter and biomechanics aesthetics, bone-crushing industrial metal soundtrack A challenge for very hardcore gamers Cons: The difficulty and refinement needed to pass the levels are unheard of for the average player The very few lives available and the impossibility of saving progress towards the end will outrage the most Objectively frustrating and very short-lived for non-enthusiasts Contra: Shattered Soldiers is a frenetic, aggressive, challenging shooter full of aliens to blast and hostile post-urban and cyberpunk environments that you need to know to the millimeter to be able to advance without dying. It is therefore adrenaline-pumping, impactful, exciting, with a strong aesthetic proposal; but it is also extremely difficult compared to the average PS2 game and, in its explicit presentation as a title with a gameplay from the past, a decidedly sui generis game in the Sony monolith's soft library, even far from the average taste of today's users. Shattered Soldiers, in fact, can easily be considered a kind of ultra-pumped 128-bit reissue of the best titles in a shooter saga that delves into the memories of the more ~older~ players up to the first Gryzor for C64 and NES and which certainly has", "date": "2003-03-25", "grade": null}
