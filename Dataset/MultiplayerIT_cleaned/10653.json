Definitions too proposals reflect those of the most common puzzles, touching on the most disparate topics, from history to sport, passing through science, the world of cinema and much more. ...and if the player still misses pen and paper, the manual writing mode and the eraser are available. In short, even the most nostalgic players will be satisfied! Can I get some help? As in the old crossword puzzles, the solution to the proposed definitions is not always immediate! Mistakes lurk around the corner, but the game helps the puzzler by highlighting a wrong letter in red. If even this expedient does not unblock the situation, the time has come to take advantage of the help tool, which suggests the exact letter in the position chosen by the player. But be careful, for each help requested, one minute will be added to the time taken to solve the puzzle, with the risk of compromising one's climb in the scoreboard. ... but you know, everything has a price! See clearly Despite the small size of the DS screen, the game offers various tools to facilitate the vision of the proposed schemes. With the ~magnifying glass~ tool it is possible to observe the image in three different magnifications: from the smallest, which allows a complete and general view, to the largest, which focuses attention on a single part of the diagram, also allowing a less eye strain. To further benefit the puzzler's eye, there are two different highlights by default, one for the row or column concerned (in gray), the other for the letter to be entered (in yellow). Clearer than that... Destiny chooses The flaw of the game is the random attribution of the schemes to be solved; we often miss being able to choose between different crossword puzzles, for example based on the degree of difficulty or length. Although at first this characteristic may appear as a sign of great variety, in reality it is nothing more than a race towards repetition. While the game provides a leaderboard of bests based on resolution times, in the long run you risk losing the ~challenge yourself~ aspect and the motivation to continue playing. Therefore, the player just has to rely completely on pure randomness and face, without a say, the choice of ~destiny~!", "date": "2009-07-07", "grade": null}
