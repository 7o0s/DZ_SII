The central dilemma that I placed myself finding this production in my hands can be summarized in the following thought: ~Action, platform, rpg, adventure: what genre do I have in my hand?~. I've always been in favor of the contamination of different videogame genres in search of the perfect blend, but evidently the alchemy didn't have the effect Midway hoped for. Let's take for example the ~rpg sector~. Despite the promises of the developers, the rpg echoes are really hard to find and it is certainly the depth of the game that loses them above all. Despite drawing heavily on games like Summoner or Gauntlet, we don't find echoes of some of the best strategic RPGs available on the market, such as Tactics Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics. Returning to the actual gameplay, you will find yourself impersonating a knight whose sole purpose is to defend Camelot from the attacks of the evil army led by Morgan La Fey. The game unfolds along twelve missions in which we will have to think not only of ourselves but also of the team (maximum 7 members) that we will gradually form and that will assist us throughout the adventure. At least initially we will only have our trusty sword available capable of performing two different levels of blows depending on the type of pressure exerted on the pad. A big problem derives precisely from the AI (Artificial Intelligence) of your companions; it will often happen to see your comrades launch into suicide actions (worthy of the best Japanese kamikaze) that you can simply watch as spectators. An example above all: sometimes I happened to see my companions dive into a cloud of enemies, not following my tactic of stalling. Surely the possibility of managing the team, even a minimum, would have been greatly appreciated by the undersigned who has almost always seen his party decimated due to the ~unscrupulousness~ of the allies. Last but not least comes the lack of save points located within the missions. The only way to be able to save is to finish the level. In the long run this becomes considerably frustrating, considering the difficulty of the game due to the swarms of enemies, and leads us to suspect that it is a mere commercial move to make a title longer lasting which, to tell the truth, risks being finished quite in hurry due to the few missions available. Technically speaking From a graphic-sound point of view we are faced with a production without infamy or praise. Discreetly made textures, well-characterized backdrops, good intermzzo scenes of a purely arcade style, delicious light and flame effects, but everything always smacks of already seen and not very innovative. The reconstruction of the medieval environments has been carried out admirably, and it will not be difficult to distinguish the various types of fortifications in use in that period. Even the music is discreet, albeit monotonous in the long run. A note of merit goes to the dubbing of the actors, who manage to give a touch of cinematography to the product. Conclusions If this Legion Legend of Excalibur hadn't had predecessors such as Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, Dual Hearts, Xenosaga Episode 1, Breath of Fire 5 I could also have recommended it to an audience that loves historical games, especially set in the Court of King Arthur, but right now I strongly advise against this production. Linear plot, high difficulty, sometimes ridiculous AI, senseless contamination of genres are some of the defects that undermine an idea that is in itself valid and original. PROS: discrete graphics appealing background CONS: Ridiculous AI lack of save points linear storyline difficulty miscalibrated A long long time ago... The problem of RPG-strategists in real time has always been a concern of the console world. Both in quality and quantity they have never managed to match their PC cousins, remaining for years in a sort of limbo of mediocrity. Unfortunately, I tell you right now, this Legion Legend of Excalibur follows this negative trend, reversing the good one that Interplay had done with Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, released last winter. Even greater inconveniences arise considering this LLoE as a rpg. The competition from giants such as SquareSoft (Final Fantasy to name one) and Enix (Dragon Quest) leave very little room for products that are not very innovative and technologically retrograde. Yet the prerequisites for a good game were all there, starting with a deep and engaging plot like that of the deeds of the Knights of the Round Table. Being able to impersonate the various King Arthurs, Lancelot, Guinevere, the magician Melrino is certainly a solid foundationfor the creation of an attractive title on the market, also thanks to the atmosphere of mystery and legend that characterizes the adventure. But let's find out why the title has disappointed.", "date": "2002-09-09", "grade": null}
