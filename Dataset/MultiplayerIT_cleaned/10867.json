{"name": "Unmetal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unmetal-recensione.html", "text": "Unmetal is a constant parody, a cheerful hodgepodge of quotations: it does everything to make you smile, it overturns some customs in its own small way, but it entertains just enough to make you continue even a fairly long story. We tried to gather some information on the developer, but we discovered little about Unepic_Fran, except that he is theoretically Spanish and perhaps works alone. He certainly appreciates making parodies, that's clear, but he's also good at it. There is a bit of Metal Gear, a splash of Hot Shots, a few grains of Full Metal Jacket, obviously Rambo: the Unmetal sauce draws liberally from war films, recreating a military atmosphere that takes the hand of the inside about ten levels between prisons, sewers, laboratories and jungles, all with healthy irony. There is another feature capable of attracting and it is the developer's desire to make fun of the player a little, making fun of choices that seemed natural to us for playful purposes but which actually - as sometimes happens in movies - have no a lot of sense. We give you a small example: we found a fireproof suit that we haven't used for two levels and it has therefore gone into mental oblivion. We are faced with a section in which we have to overcome some fires and our hardcore vein, in the wake of the gameplay, makes us do them all, at the cost of losing some health in the attempt: the game intervenes with funny dialogues between supporting actors, implicitly calling us fools and reminding us that instead of putting on the suit, we threw ourselves into the flames. We actually felt a bit silly. In any case, follow us in the Unmetal review to find out if it's the title that can get you off to a good start to the week. Part Snake, part Topper Unmetal will give you stealth phases, boss fights and lots of laughs Unmetal takes off like a rocket, throwing jokes and paradoxical situations here and there of a protagonist very by chance who finds himself a helicopter pilot, shot down by a rocket and ended up in front of an interrogation in which he will tell his story, all while mimicking the outfit by Naked Snake. Thus begins a long gameplay flashback in which you have to escape from prison, discover the fundamentals of combat, exploration and inventory, which can be assimilated to a very close circle. In the midst of a minimal but nice pixel art the adventures of Jessie Fox move, the protagonist who alternates moments of seriousness with others of complete idiocy, maintaining a good balance and even leaving the player, sometimes, to choose what actually happens in the story. Unmetal already mixes elements of stealth, survival, action in the first hour, leading to switching from one screen to another and putting the emphasis on stunning enemies without being discovered, gaining experience and leveling up. The rhythm is there and it is built well, there are no particular downtimes and saving urinating in a public toilet is always funny. So what does Unmetal add to a more or less established indie game equation? Definitely the laughs: some dialogues are really brilliant and the plot that slowly becomes tinged with seriousness (not too much) kept us glued for an important number of hours, without ever letting us get bored. The ambition of each internship is limited, yes, but it is to build a watertight compartmentalized structure with objectives and self-contained secondary missions, to which trophies can be added on conditions met. There are the bosses, the weapons, the cutscenes, the crazy Hot Shots moments in which, as new Topper Harleys, instead of the chicken arrow we will find ourselves with a flamethrower against a Cthulhu-style tentacled beast or humanoid piranhas sons of Mother Piranha. But the crazy thing is that everything works. A crime not committed Metal Gear DNA permeates Unmetal, with shameless but well-contextualized supporting characters and bosses Jessie's narration is deliberately balanced between lies and seriousness, in a crescendo of epicness that sometimes upsets the player's certainties, in crisis between believing his own actions or doubting their actual implementation. Thanks to the stealth matrix that is always present in the background, Unmetal offers a succession of gameplay gimmicks that add nothing, but break the habit for those few minutes and, trivially, differentiate the offer. Furthermore, Unmetal is not a simple game: it is not even difficult, but certainly challenging and sometimes frustrating. In a couple of cases we lost patience, perhaps the result of too many hours invested in a row, although it must be said that the game never exceeds the limit too much and always provides a small loophole to do things more quickly but less ethically. narrative exaggeration is a must and the crime theme does not commesso will be recursive, as will the reuse of names: it is as if Unmetal knew that it takes very little to make people smile and aimed at it with ever greater ardor, only that the result of the administration is not cloying, on the contrary, it is dosed with discrete skill. Fox is a character who could live in complete autonomy within the fake military stereotype, but it is our quotation projection that enriches him in spite of himself: there are so many references to historical works that it is impossible not to fill the protagonist with so many souls, a flow of memories that comes impetuous from the masterpieces of the past and pours into actions and dialogues. Perhaps this was the skill of the developer: having created a functional fabric on which each player can sow their moments, memories, phrases, giving a small indie an exponential and very pleasant parodic breath.", "date": "2021-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
