{"name": "State of Survival", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/state-of-survival-recensione.html", "text": "The State of Survival review comes a little late compared to the actual release of the zombie-based strategy developed by KingsGroup and available in the traditional freemium format on iOS and Android terminals. However, the time that has passed so far has given the authors the opportunity to refine certain mechanics, especially those related to microtransactions, and therefore to find a balance that allows you to enjoy this experience in one way or another, by investing money or not, without compromising its enjoyment. Gameplay: a strategy different from the usual At first, the gameplay of State of Survival seems identical to that of many other strategic and management games available in the mobile sector but which nonetheless boast a ridiculous depth, almost completely sacrificed on the altar of immediacy, so as to wink even and especially to casual users. Fortunately this time things go differently and after the first chapters of the campaign, which act as tutorials, the peculiar mix of management and strategy reveals new, interesting facets. they follow the rules of a now well-established tradition thanks to blockbusters such as the various Farmville, they never go so far as to become a simple tapping exercise on the various buildings to collect coins and resources. In short, this aspect is put into the background, causing the player to focus rather on the many available achievements and on the actual missions. The latter can take place in two different ways. On the one hand there are the expeditions on the map, which only take into consideration the strength and number of our troops compared to those of the enemy to determine who wins and who loses the fight. On the other hand the challenges, which draw on the fascinating sub-genre of tower defense to confront us with increasingly threatening hordes of zombies. The internships gradually become more articulated, and so the team of characters that we have composed (and that we can obviously enhance using the resources obtained up to that moment) requires direct management, the execution of special maneuvers at the right time (turrets from placing around, rifle shots, aimed shots, etc.) and even some movement on the fly. The depth does not reach that of a true strategic, but compared to the average of these mobile productions, there is something to be enthusiastic about. Technical realization More controversial is the discourse related to the technical realization of the game, which if on the one hand makes use of valid artwork for the protagonists (albeit derivative, often deliberately) and discreet polygonal models for the more action phases, in the management sequences it showcases textures of the ground frankly embarrassing and without providing us with options to increase the visual quality depending on the device we use. The music is functional to the action, without however going beyond it, while the touch controls always appear reactive and precise: unlike titles that they move with a certain effort, especially when they have to interface with the network to unlock achievements, in State of Survival these aspects have been implemented effectively and, above all, have benefited from the continuous updates of the application since the launch.", "date": "2020-10-22", "grade": "7.8"}
