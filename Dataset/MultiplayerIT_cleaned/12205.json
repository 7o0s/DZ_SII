Bust a Move (or Puzzle Bobble if you prefer) by the legendary Taito, can be considered as the last true ~immortal~ puzzle game in the history of videogames which includes titles such as a certain Tetris among its peers. The game mechanics are obviously always the same (with the introduction of characters with personal ~attack and defense moves~): you have to eliminate all the marbles from the area by piling up three of the same colour, while from above the ceiling descends menacingly and if our opponent performs a good combo, other bubbles will arrive in our portion of the screen, bringing us closer to game over. From the debut of 15 years ago (and the global success also in terms of female audience, something really atypical for those years...) and after countless sequels, variations, transpositions on any platform, this new version has finally arrived with the possibility of online game on pc. Beyond the online gaming, for the rest there are no particular novelties whatsoever in the title which provides for a single player game ~campaign~, in addition to the possibility of other variants. The connection to the network, on the other hand, provides the possibility of uploading the scores online and therefore entering the world high score and clearly the opportunity to challenge other players on the net in challenges to the last bubble. In this case, there are some variations such as playing with or without additional ~items~ or trying the team mode already tested in other versions released on consoles over the years. From a technical point of view, there is very little to ~declare~ except that the game can run both in full screen (but at a fixed resolution) and in a window and that the historical jingles of the series are also present in this version. after countless sequels, variations, transpositions on any platform, this new version has finally arrived with the possibility of online play on PC System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 200 MHz RAM: 32 MB Video Card: 3D 4 MB Disk Space: 80 MB Drive: CD-ROM Test Configuration: Processor: AMD Athlon64 3500 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Geforce 68000 Ultra 256MB Comment The last of the immortal puzzle games is back in this new PC version, enhanced by the possibility of online play. Beyond this aspect, there is absolutely nothing new in this umpteenth edition of Bust a Move which has its biggest flaw in its introductory price: 24.90 as a recommended price seems a little too much compared to what we found in the software. Despite this, if BaM is still in your hearts, give yourself over to the thousand colored bubbles of Taito's timeless masterpiece. Pros Finally online The last of the immortal puzzle games A hit and run game is a pleasant daily temptation Cons Price not so low compared to the product offered Nothing new under the thousand blue bubbles... Historical Truths Between the Wii's Virtual Console, Xbox 360's Live Arcade and PS3's PlayStation Network, it seems that the phenomenon of retrogaming is a phenomenon linked exclusively to the consular universe. In reality, longtime PC enthusiasts will surely remember how the ~vintage~ phenomenon of video games was born towards the end of the 90s with the legendary MAME and all the roms that were freely available on the net. Now the phenomenon has changed considerably and therefore also on our computers various timeless classics are back in commercial versions. Among these Bust a Move On Line is undoubtedly a nice surprise that we are going to get to know more closely right away.", "date": "2007-06-12", "grade": null}
