Zombies 2: It's About Time on mobile devices and more than four million copies sold for the two episodes of Plants Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare on consoles, the franchise created by PopCap Games has undoubtedly established as one of the brightest and most versatile currently on the market. However, the original tower defense formula needed a refresh and so, while waiting for a third chapter on iOS and Android, the developers have seen fit to create a spin-off with a different structure, which remains in the strategic sphere but introduces a system based on trading cards and turn-based action. Equipped with two full-bodied single player campaigns and an arena in which to challenge other users online, Plants Vs. Zombies Heroes uses the same narrative devices as the other games in the series, which see the factions of plants and zombies opposing each other. In this case, however, something goes wrong and a lethal tool created by the brilliant leader of the undead gives life to a different category of characters: heroes. Characterized by superior intelligence and a set of special skills, these plants and these zombies compete in a war that is fought with blows of tactics and careful planning, framed vertically on the display and somehow close to the atmosphere of Clash Royale , although as mentioned the mechanics that regulate the gameplay work through a turn-based system with trading cards. The element of variety certainly stands out, as each hero belonging to the group of plants or zombies has peculiarities that substantially change the experience, both from the point of view of special resources and from that of available units. Plants Vs. Zombies Heroes is a fun, challenging and long-lasting collectible art strategy game Plants or zombies? Having selected a hero and one of the two campaigns (at the beginning only the one with plants is available, but after a few missions it is also possible to unlock the one with zombies), our goal in Plants Vs. Zombies Heroes will therefore be to face opponents controlled by artificial intelligence, gradually more cunning and dangerous, with a view to scenarios composed of five different ~lanes~ on which to place our units. The two heroes position themselves in their respective rearguards and have a vital energy indicator that must be reset to achieve victory. In order to hit the opponent, however, your units need to operate on a lane clear of enemy shields, and this is where strategy comes into play. By collecting action points at each turn, we will be able to draw plants or zombies from the deck with different values in terms of energy and attack capacity, and once placed on the playing field we will have to act ~of remittance~, in the sense that the first turn will belong to always to the other party. Should one of our units be mortally wounded, however, it will still be able to strike back and deal damage to the direct opponent, and then vacate the post. A series of variants add depth to the experience, for example in the case of the sunflower hero there are daisies, which allow you to obtain extra action points and therefore be able to summon more powerful units within a few turns. From the point of view of the clash there is certainly a component of luck which is sometimes a bit frustrating, especially when the enemy uses random tricks that weaken our defenses or eliminate important pawns, but in general, rebut blow by blow and taking care of the deck a minimum, through the usual freemium mechanisms in some ways limiting, finally leads to victory. The system appears confusing at first, but with a few games it is possible to better understand the various mechanisms and the true value of the PopCap Games product, which combines solid gameplay with well-made technical realization as regards the characters, really various and well designed, while the scenarios move between ups and downs, sometimes proposing ugly settings.", "date": "2016-10-25", "grade": "8.5"}
