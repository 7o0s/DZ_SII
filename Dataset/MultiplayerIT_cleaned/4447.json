We must leave the past behind us and face the new challenges that await us with a different approach, because we are in uncharted territory, in an unknown land that will test everyone, veterans and newbies. Many things have changed, he says at one point, and then it becomes clear that Capcom is speaking, because Monster Hunter: World is the first title in the series that dares to address a wider audience. Selling Monster Hunter to the Japanese has always been child's play, especially on a portable console, but what about Western audiences? That's another story. In recent years, and especially after the transition to Nintendo consoles, Capcom has taken small steps and increasingly advertised a brand that until recently, and by its nature, was satisfied with a small niche of super nerds. Now it's time to try the big shot, move everything to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and PC at the end of the year) and convince even the casual western gamers that hunting giant slobbering monsters is a good thing even when you end up in the dust and swearing like Turks at a convention of vegan nuns. And that means changing the world and hunting in a land where the rules are less severe, where you don't need to take notes or consult a wikia while dodging jaws and claws. A simpler world, perhaps. Cozier, that's for sure. There was a lot of discussion about ~simplifying~ the formula in light of the desire to embrace a more casual audience, but now that we have spent several dozen hours hunting monsters in this new world, we have a precise idea of what he had in mind Capcom. This review is aimed above all at new players approaching Monster Hunter for the first time: in the first part, they will find out what kind of game it is but, above all, if it is right for them. The second part will go into a little more detail and address the thorny issue of content and difficulty: we dedicate that to the veterans who know Monster Hunter best. Finally, it is worth noting that testing the online component (and therefore server stability, mission balancing and all the rest) was almost impossible in these few days of testing that preceded the official launch. We will return to multiplayer next week with a dedicated special that will decide, once and for all, if Capcom is on the right path and Monster Hunter: World is truly the best Monster Hunter ever made. A world for newbies If you've never played Monster Hunter and are still trying to figure it out, let's put it this way: it's a game where you slay huge monsters and collect their pieces to make ever more sophisticated weapons and armor. The formula is essentially this, so you should already guess if it fits your strings. Does it tempt you to face the same monster over and over again until you've found all the components needed to craft the weapon or armor you want? Because in Monster Hunter you will do this from start to finish. Sure, there's an adventurous side of exploration and side assignments; there is a strategic management of resources and accumulated materials, necessary to build traps and other gadgets, and there are fourteen different weapons to learn how to use, but in the end everything revolves around the monsters and their sad demise. This is actually also true on a narrative level, since you will step into the shoes of a hunter who has just arrived in this new world to capture and study the monsters that inhabit it. The Zorah Magdaros, in particular, is a gigantic elder dragon who has decided to cross the sea, leaving a trail of destruction and attracting the attention of other extremely dangerous creatures. Don't expect a plot like The Witcher 3, because the story of Monster Hunter: World is a great pretext for hunting creatures. Despite this, it must be admitted that Capcom has structured it quite well, enriching it with dialogues dubbed completely in Italian and eccentric supporting actors: it gives a certain logic to the succession of missions, motivating the discovery of new regions and monsters in an organic and natural way. The player cannot repeat the story missions, but the discovery of maps and beasts, any captures and interaction with the various NPCs who live in the city of Astera unlock numerous secondary tasks, divided into various categories. Bounties, for example, allow you to face monsters in different circumstances: the more severe they are, the greater the reward when the hunt is over. Theassignments, on the other hand, are completed during any other type of mission, mostly consisting of collecting materials or killing certain monsters. And if you don't want to hunt for a precise objective, subject to a time limit, there is always the possibility of going on an expedition and freely exploring an already unlocked map: in that case, we will be able to face the creatures that invade it cyclically, spending inside it as long as we want. Each mission can also be tackled in multiplayer, forming groups of up to four hunters before setting off on the assignment, or by calling for help with the SOS flare during a game. The maps are huge, intricate, very rich in details and interactive elements that can come in handy during fights or represent dangerous double-edged swords. The hunter's fireflies will intelligently guide us towards the objective we have selected or to the closest materials to collect: this bizarre find, which unfortunately gets wrapped up every now and then, helps a lot to find the way without wasting too many precious minutes looking for the monsters that continue to move. Once the enemy has been engaged and the weapon has been drawn, Monster Hunter World challenges the player to assimilate an extremely technical combat system based on reflexes and knowledge of our targets and how they move, how they attack, how they run away. Each weapon is played in a completely different way and allows for a unique approach to combat: to learn how to really use one you need time and patience, but also a lot of practice. Naturally the rich crafting system offers an exceptional variety of equipment. Weapons can be ~evolved~ into more powerful versions that branch out with each new material obtained, but it's still possible to step back and try another route at any time. Armor, on the other hand, gives different types of bonuses which, in the advanced stages of the game, require a certain attention in the choice of weapons and accessories that take the greatest possible advantage from them. In short, Monster Hunter: World is an extremely complex title that overflows with increasingly influential content, parameters and statistics, but it is also a game that focuses heavily on skill and a good hunter is able to face any enemy naked. Fortunately, each new mechanic is illustrated through clear and timely tutorials, but in these few lines we have barely scratched the surface. The first few hours will make you understand if Monster Hunter: World is the game for you or not, it being understood that, once you enter its spiral, it is really difficult to get out of it. A world for veterans Monster Hunter fans who have played every installment that has made it to the West - and beyond - feared that opening up to a larger, more casual audience would end up distorting the series' stark, uncompromising gameplay. After playing Monster Hunter: World for a long time, we're happy to say that's not the case. Not exactly. Let's take the proverbial pebble off our shoe: is the new Monster Hunter actually easier than the previous ones? Yes, it is, but it's much more complicated than that. Most of the changes that Capcom has made to the game system have served to improve the so-called ~quality of life~ and our reaction, discovering some of them, was very simply wondering why they hadn't thought of it before. However, these improvements affect many other aspects like in a chain reaction. Let's take, for example, the possibility of disassembling weapons and recovering the materials used to build them to make others. This ingenious solution allows you to try out many weapons without having to go and procure the materials all over again, but at the same time it significantly reduces the total game hours. At the same time, we had never played a Monster Hunter by constantly changing weapons for the whim of trying them, using the same handful of materials to experiment, test and try. The new system reduces farming and makes the experience much more fulfilling and versatile than in the past. The interactivity in the maps is totally optional: the Vigorwaspes that heal by touch float lazily in the air and it's up to the player to decide whether to use them or not. Stubborn hunters might decide not to use those or animals or plants that spread paralyzing or soporific gases, relying solely on their tools as they did in the past, but these precautions make the already beautiful Monster Hunter: World maps still more lively and interesting. It is as if every facilitation - a word in our opinion much more apt than everlification, in this specific case - entailed a flip side that was almost always optional. The same, however, cannot be said of monsters. They are the flagship of the game, the absolute protagonists as it should be, but playing we realized that one of the reasons why everything seemed vaguely easier to us was the fact that many of these unpublished monsters, in a sense, we have already met them. The Nergigante moves like the Shagaru/Gore Magala; the Pukei-Pukei is a new version of the Yian Garuga; Radobaan is a lousy Uragaan, and so on. The veteran hunter will recognize each archetype within a couple of glances and will fight new monsters accordingly, adapting easily to new attacks, but supported by a wealth of experience that will undoubtedly make life easier. The much vaunted interaction between monsters, based on hierarchies, has a much less marked weight than originally announced: when two monsters meet, they fight each other for some time until the weaker one is forced to flee. The battles between these giants have little or no effect on their health conditions and, if anything, offer the player a brief diversion to run away or catch his breath. It must be said that the new mechanics in the moveset of each weapon also contribute a lot. By integrating the numerous ideas implemented above all in Monster Hunter Generations, Capcom has proposed the most versatile and fun paraphernalia of the whole series, even going to review the crossbow control system, now much more comfortable and practical. It is therefore a matter of perception that relies above all on the experience of the single player. If you have a good knowledge of the Monster Hunter universe, you adapt more easily to the perks that make the experience less frustrating for newbies and perhaps a little too relaxed for veterans. It was not easy to find the right balance between the two visions, but in our opinion Capcom has succeeded or, in any case, has come very close to it. We greatly appreciated the decision to implement a detailed analysis of the monsters in the hunting journal that reveals their vulnerabilities and even the rewards: it is a solution that almost completely supplants the wikias we have relied on all these years, even if it deprives the game of that aura of mystery that has forced hunters from all over the world to join forces to dissect each new Monster Hunter. Those veterans should also be the first to know that the first Monster Hunter of a certain generation never comes with the infamous G-rank included. Monster Hunter: World is no exception. We just need to figure out if Capcom intends to implement G-Rank in the free DLC it has planned for the next few months, or if we can expect a Monster Hunter: World 2 that introduces it. Playstation 4 trophies To win the platinum trophy you will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts and first unlock 36 bronze, 11 silver and two gold trophies. Most are obtained by progressing through the campaign or by performing certain actions for the first time, finding the various ingredients and crafting weapons and armor. And of course you have to hunt a lot of monsters, online and offline. Two words on the technical sector The technical framework has never been a deterrent for Monster Hunter fans, who have played this series mainly on PSP and Nintendo 3DS, on tiny screens that reproduced textures in very low resolution without a shred of anti-aliasing. For those fans, the brute force of the hardware has always interested little, as long as we went hunting and Capcom masterfully took care of the stylistic side, always inventing new and fascinating monsters, weapons and armor to show off, evocative and refined fantasy scenarios. Obviously with the transition to the generation of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in view of the famous opening to the general public that we have mentioned several times, the situation has changed and the spotlight has been on frame rate and resolution. It could only be like this, given that the first thing we have to decide when starting the game, even before creating our hunter with a very rich editor, is whether to set a resolution, graphics or frame rate mode. It being understood that Monster Hunter: World is a title with a splendid glance which is forgiven for certain aberrant textures and some camera uncertainty, not to mention the polygonal interpenetrations, it is important to underline our experience on PlayStation 4 Pro. Well, the frame rate mode is the one that struck us the most because, despite the name and the significant impoverishment of the graphics, it still struggles to reach or much less maintain 60 frames per second.
