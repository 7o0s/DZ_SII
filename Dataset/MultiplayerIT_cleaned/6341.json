And so with a shiver of excitement we finally found ourselves inserting the Blu-ray into the editorial debug PlayStation 4 to start our personal, very long adventure with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the final chapter of the splendid saga of Geralt of Rivia, transported with care by the boys of CD Projekt starting from the stories of Andrzej Sapkowski. What we have experienced, experienced and, in the end, judged, you can find in this long review which, we hope, you will find the desire and pleasure to read from beginning to end. And now space for the witcher! The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an outstanding title. What else do we have to add? Did you bring the justification? Wild Hunt is set six months after the epilogue of The Witcher 2: Assassin's of Kings. Geralt has fully recovered his memory and sets out in search of the woman of his life, Yennefer of Vengerberg, after breaking off his turbulent romance with Triss Merigold. In reality, from the very first moments of the game we realize that the real protagonist is Ciri, another woman strongly linked to our witcher, who however has paternal feelings towards her. She is a young student of his who due to various vicissitudes was never able to become a Witcher but who was still trained in their arts and above all has incredible powers in her blood. Precisely the latter will be the basis of his incessant escape from the Wild Hunt, justifying Geralt's long and intense raids in the Northern territories, between Vellin and Novigrad, passing through the boundless archipelago of Skellige and without disdaining some sporadic trip to Kaer Morhen, the old fortress where the Witchers train, and in Nilfgaard in the presence of Emhyr var Emreis, the ruthless Emperor of the lands of the sun. The links between the White Wolf and the three women in his life will be the basis of the deep narrative weaves of this third chapter and don't worry if these names don't tell you anything because The Witcher 3 is particularly clever with its plot. This is, in fact, quite unrelated to the other two chapters, thanks to the stratagem of rediscovered memory and the introduction of two new characters for the video game series (but not for the book) such as Ciri and the Wild Hunt, to the point of being easily approachable even for those who have never tried the previous chapters. And at the same time in the very long adventure we will meet an impressive number of old faces who will surely be able to give a smile to those who have stripped them of the previous two chapters, and in this sequel he will find a whole series of side quests that will allow him to deepen his knowledge, not only platonic, of these historical characters. Adequately avoiding spoilers, it is enough to know that the main story is divided into three acts, with the first terrifyingly vast and the other two more linear and ~short~. The quotation marks are a must since you will hardly be able to reach the epilogue in less than forty hours in case you decide to run and you can easily double this number even just by dedicating yourself, without exaggerating, to everything that the game can offer ~ accessory~. Paradoxically, it is precisely the main quest that perhaps suffers from excessive linearity, especially starting from the second act, which takes the form of an exploration quest and a simple move from one place to another. In short, it seems that CD Projekt has used a large part of the main plot to ~force~ the player to explore the world, move between the various main cities and get to know the characters without offering a real challenge or particular complex actions with the exception of some sporadic exceptions. And it's strange, considering how much all the secondary aspects, or as we defined above, ~accessories~, are extremely layered, dense and rich in variety. The activities that the game will offer us, just to give you an idea of the overall offer, are divided into three sections. On the one hand we have the real side quests, where the developer has really indulged. You will see all the colors, with often very interesting narrative lines, especially when they involve well-known characters from the saga and different variations on the theme starting from horse racing, to get to stealth-like sections where we will have to tail some characters to find their hiding places. Then we find the Witcher contracts, advertised for a long time during the game presentations, and which will force us to go in search of mmore or less rare monsters, studying them thoroughly to evaluate how to attack and slaughter them. We will be able to negotiate the price of our ~hiring~ (among other things it is the best way to accumulate money) and earn trophies to hang on the horse useful for unlocking small passive bonuses. Finally, there are treasure hunts: narrative tricks that will stimulate us to look for notes and documents in ruined buildings, caves and small dungeons to collect crafting schemes for Witcher equipment. Everything revolves around the dialogues with the characters and the announcement boards scattered throughout the game world: real mines of information for exploration and for the ~lore~. However, there is a small element that seemed unbalanced right within the quests, and it is the excessive use of the Witcher senses, rethought compared to the past. Now Geralt will be able to enter a dedicated mode by pressing a backbone which, by bringing the camera close to the witcher's shoulder, will highlight both the objects containing the loot and the interaction elements relating to the quests. This last stratagem is perhaps too much abused, given that many missions will require, at a certain point in the progression, to look for certain clues or to follow tracks. From a certain point of view, it almost made us think of the investigative mode of Batman: Arkham City, then tweaked in the following chapters. With all the pros and cons of this comparison. The gwent To replace the dice game of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, we find the Gwent. It is a full-fledged card game that will lead us to collide with all the merchants we meet on the street and with a series of famous characters in an attempt to maximize our card collection and create the definitive deck. The minigame is extremely accurate and perfectly implemented in the fabric of the gameplay and could take you away many hours of play between the deck preparation phase and the repetition of particularly difficult battles. A lot, a lot, too much If that weren't clear enough yet, what amazes about The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is its vastness and the incredible density of the scenario it offers. The game is at times overwhelming: wherever you move there will always be something to do and even just horse riding or embarking on a small boat and then diving into the sea, exploring ever-changing environments, crossing small country villages that pulsate with life, monster-infested swamps with a mist rising from the water, or climbing a hilly path is extremely satisfying. The game map is overflowing with points of interest and the more you go around the more you will find others in a constant iteration between completed activities and new situations to experience. Obviously there is no shortage of fast travel, provided you have first discovered the sign with the indications that usually delimits the boundaries of the most important points of interest. And, much requested by fans of the series, there is finally no more auto-leveling of monsters. This means that their level will be set according to the area where they stay and as Geralt grows and strengthens, it will be the player's choice to eventually retrace his steps to destroy a den of monsters now largely within his reach or go on raids to collect some reagents. And since we have mentioned the topic, let's talk about alchemy, a bit the emblem of the whole saga. The development team took advantage of the sequel to return to tweaking its alchemical system. Now it becomes possible to create all the products at any time through a dedicated screen of the game menu and the various potions, bombs, decoctions and ointments, must be ~researched~ a single time and are completely restored as soon as one meditates for at least an hour. This has allowed CD Projekt to significantly expand the number of recipes available, always with a view to increasing the variety of the offer, considering that they can all be upgraded by three levels, provided, of course, that the projects are found. We must recognize that, if in fact it is a significant simplification compared to the past of the series, primarily as regards meditation, which at this point only serves to make time pass quickly and to recover energy at the two lowest difficulty levels , everything is much faster and more satisfying to use. Especially during combat, the strategic component has significantly increased since now we will be really stimulated to use ointments to earn bonuses with the blades based on the enemies encounteredand properly manage the slots for quick use of potions and bombs based on the context and always taking into account the degree of toxicity of the liquids ingested by the witcher. We don't hide that we would have liked to be able to use the potions also from the inventory without having to go through the allocation of the two slots available by type each time, which soon become very few, but in practice this lightening of the system has convinced us a lot. The equipment crafting system has also been revised from the base with the producible items now divided into three sections. On the one hand we have raw materials ranging from herbs to loot related to monsters up to mineral reagents; then we find the weapons, and finally the armor. While the former can be dismantled and assembled by the player in the presence of any armorer or blacksmith, the actual equipment will require the specific non-player character: the armorer for the armor and the blacksmith for the weapons. The system is perfectly interconnected and allows you to really spend hours destroying and creating the right reagents to perhaps create a Witcher set collected in one of the treasure hunt quests. There is obviously no shortage of runes and glyphs to mount on the equipment and even the wear of worn objects is included which will force the player, perhaps more often than we would have expected, to repair them. Such an elaborate but very easy to use system manages, among other things, to keep the entire game economy at bay since the non-player characters will have a limited wallet and we will often have to run around the various villages looking for those with the right reagents for sale or maybe competent enough to be able to produce a specific piece of equipment. It's not Dark Souls! And we come to talk about the combat system, one of the most criticized elements of the second The Witcher and which also made us worry during our test a few months ago in Poland at the CD Projekt headquarters. In reality, after having held the joypad in hand for an incredible number of hours, we realized that, despite its shape defects, the combat system works and is also very satisfying. Unfortunately, the absence of feedback and a certain feeling of hitting too lightly remains but the alternation of slashing, dodging, the use of signs - now available in two different ~fire~ modes - plus the whole arsenal of bombs and potions, help to ensure a great variety and above all give the feeling of being able to manage the battlefield to face the greatest number of opponents that Geralt can encounter. It is obvious and obvious that here we are close to a pure and very ~permissive~ action RPG and, even if the addition of vigor for the protagonist and for the enemies is appreciable, so as not to overdo it with somersaults, runs and parries, at the same time at the same time it is obvious that the competitor of The Witcher 3 is obviously not any exponent of the Souls series but, if anything, a Dragon Age: Inquisition purified of the party component or a Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Geralt's adventures are not designed to generate a sense of risk in the player, to give him the idea that death could come around every corner and there has never been the will to create extremely different attack patterns between enemies with the perversion of forcing the player to memorize them. Artificial intelligence exists and can also be varied given that the types of different opponents bring very varied attack styles as a dowry: there are those who attack the player in groups, those who require the use of certain signs or bombs to protected from special abilities and who forces to perform a myriad of somersaults or dodges to be able to inflict a mortal blow. In short, the step forward compared to the second The Witcher is sensitive and the fights are much faster, more intense and above all satisfying, but at the same time we don't feel like fully promoting the system: something more could certainly be done and even the crossbow, a novelty advertised several times, it really has a limited use and is soon forgettable. Our advice, then, is to start already with the third level of difficulty to make the clashes particularly difficult even in the long run, when Geralt will be able to face adversity more easily thanks to the maturity of his skills and the increase in our proficiency with the pad. And while we are talking about the very few negative sides of the title, it is essential to mention an inherent flaw in the transition from a large but classic RPG to almost total free roaming. Wild Hunt is in fact composed of two maps of enormous dimensions: Vellin with annexed Novigrad and the archipelago de", "date": "2015-05-13", "grade": "9.5"}
