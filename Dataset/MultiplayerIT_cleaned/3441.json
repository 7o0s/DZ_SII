{"name": "Dead by Daylight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-by-daylight-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "It has become practically useless to go around the question: if you are here reading our review of Dead by Daylight for Nintendo Switch, it is because we live in an age in which any more or less recent video game must receive its conversion / its port / the its remake also on the hybrid console of the Kyoto House. It matters little if the title was already forgettable on its first appearance on the market; it doesn't matter if it lends itself badly to use in portable mode; the same quality of the conversion doesn't matter, which if you think about it should instead represent the backbone of the entire operation. We have reviewed a myriad of not excellent but still appreciable titles, which once arrived on Nintendo Switch turned out to be almost unplayable due to a sloppy, superficial and hasty conversion. Well, with Dead by Daylight we have one more to add to the list. Unfortunately. The conversion to Nintendo Switch You may not even remember what Dead by Daylight is about. We will see it later, now let's focus instead on its conversion for Nintendo Switch, since this is what it is: a video game that made its debut on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC in due course, and which now joins the family of titles for the hybrid console from the Grande N. The version we tested already had the dayone patch on its side, so there aren't many excuses or particular expectations for buyers: Dead by Daylight on Nintendo Switch isn't much of a port. The realization of the conversion presents very conspicuous defects, mainly graphic and technical. Now, it must be said that visually speaking, the graphic sector of Dead by Daylight did not make a miracle cry even on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while on PC it behaved a little more dignifiedly. On Nintendo Switch the level of general disaster depends on the game mode you prefer. On TV, the glance is merciless, even in those dark and sparse settings that usually manage to save titles that are in themselves mediocre (in the dark many defects are less visible, there is the atmosphere, and so on with many convenient excuses ). There are no such excuses here. In TV Mode we are on 800-900p resolution, with images at the limits of graininess, polygonal models to review, bouncing renders and other amenities. The frame rate almost always settles on 30FPS, when it goes wrong~ and in the most agitated situations we are practically certain that it drops to a value between 20 and 30 FPS. In portable mode, the graphic-visual sector improves, the technical one does not. The lower screen resolution, the smaller display and the necessarily contained glance mean that you are able to overlook many more smudges than in TV Mode. However, the frame rate shows a little more dancer than expected, and the gaming experience in general seemed less solid than on the home TV. We are sure that even if you simply take a look at some comparative videos, without the need to hold the Joy-Cons in your hand, you will more than agree with us. Among other things, holding the Nintendo controllers tightly is useless, because HD Rumble, the vibration system and company took to their heels like the survivors of the game. Maybe they did well. The gameplay Dead by Daylight does not have a main storyline, it is a title entirely designed for local or online multiplayer use, with friends and strangers. In theory there is nothing wrong with this, provided obviously the game in question does well what little it has to do. And if it weren't for the serious graphic and technical shortcomings mentioned (due to the bad conversion), Dead by Daylight would do its job well. The idea behind the gameplay is very interesting and nice: there are five players in total in a game. Four players are the Survivors, and must get to safety; the fifth is a ruthless serial killer/terrible monster, who must find and kill them all in order to sacrifice them to the Entity. Keep children away from Dead by Daylight as much as possible, because it is a blatantly 18+ game: splatter, violent, disturbing, dark and with the aim of impaling people on hooks to sacrifice them. Winning a game by impersonating the killer, among other things, gives great satisfaction. The style of play changes dramatically depending on the role chosen (it is possible to decide whether to play with the good guys or the bad guys). While the killer's job is simply to find all the other players and hurt them, the life of the counterparts is a bit more complex: the survivors are extremely fragile. They have to run away, hide, heal themselves in case of injuries, feed the generators to unlock the escape routes, and in any case finally be able to use the latter before the lurking death arrives. Of course, they can work together to slow down the killer or save each other in certain situations, and finally compensate for the weakness of their being human with numerical superiority. The lack of a game plot is compensated by a progression system that aims to improve the parameters, level and skills of the individual characters present: just spend the necessary experience points. One piece of advice we give you is to study the game tutorial well, which is extremely detailed and accessible, otherwise the first online games will end up in a general turmoil. Always assuming that on Nintendo Switch someone has decided to pay for online specifically to have fun with Dead by Daylight.", "date": "2019-10-09", "grade": "5.0"}
