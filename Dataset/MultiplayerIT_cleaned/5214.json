{"name": "L'evoluzione del genere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/175527-titanfall-2-levoluzione-del-genere.html", "text": "Among the many benefits of the critics - in addition to a cozy reserved place in hell - there is also the possibility of testing the most anticipated games well in advance. So, where the majority of human races are fighting over which is the best shooter of the pre-Christmas period to the cry of ~Call of Duty reigns!~ or ~Battlefield is a better game!~, many of us sneer, having already had quite a bit of direct experience with the aforementioned titles. The downside, usually, are slightly colorful comments under the articles, but it is a cross that is easily carried if you love first-person shooters, and is dragged with particular joy when you have the opportunity to try the title less discussed of this trinity of video games, namely Titanfall 2. And for the record, we do not consider it ~less important~ but only less known among the masses, since Titanfall is the series with which the team born from the old (and unforgotten) Infinity Ward now known as Respawn Entertainment has decided to advance the arcade shooter genre (where the word arcade does not mean cabinets, but the distance from simulation and tactical games in favor of action) and among them there are still some of the principal creators of what is considered to be the greatest staple of the genre to this day: Modern Warfare 2. As a result, in this fiery period their latest creation is conceivably the one under the most critical scrutiny from users, despite a lower commercial potential to the other two brands. Not an easy challenge for the developers, who have decided to forcefully put their hand to the already excellent systems devised for the predecessor and to also land on the shores of PlayStation 4. Obviously, we have tried these changes on our skin and analyzed them, and today we have the difficult task of evaluating them. We've thoroughly tested Titanfall 2 singleplayer and online - find our final verdict here Another way for the single player One of the most discussed elements of the new Titanfall is undoubtedly the single player campaign, the great novelty of this second chapter. Despite very promising trailers, the risk of sop in these cases is always around the corner, to the point that even with a renowned studio like the one involved it was impossible to express oneself before a complete test. Fortunately, the guys from Respawn Entertainment didn't sit on their laurels and decided to face the fierce competition by taking a path far from the classic one to which the blockbusters of the period have accustomed us. Titanfall 2's campaign is in fact a shining example of successful game design: it starts slowly, limiting the use of its own mechanics to gradually introduce the player to the systems; then it opens up in completely unexpected ways, unhinging the preconceptions that want military campaigns to be banal photocopies of each other. Moreover, everything happens by building on a narrative basis of rare simplicity: in fact, you play Jack Cooper, a simple but talented infantry soldier aboard the James Macallan ship, during an expedition to the mysterious planet Typhoon. Accompanying him is Captain Lastimosa, a veteran Titan pilot who takes a liking to him and decides to mentor him without official permission. After a clever tutorial phase in the company of the good captain, everything inevitably goes to hell, leaving Jack an orphan of his master and assigned to a powerful robot named BT-7274. Practically alone against an entire organization of bad guys, our alter ego is not, however, simply to kill one soldier after another: the developers have made the best use of the ~research center~ nature of the planet where the campaign takes place, inventing a long series of tricks that completely transform the experience from chapter to chapter. A story in the service of fireworks The advantage that allowed Respawn to experiment with the campaign was the immediate decision not to take itself too seriously. As mentioned, the story is essential and almost entirely built around the relationship between Jack and BT, which develops by dint of bewildered dialogues and involuntary jokes from the Titan, and manages with his humor not to bore despite an unforgettable background. In any case, it is the rhythm of events that really keeps the player glued to the screen, an unstoppable series of events that sometimes even makes the plot senseless, but whose follies are easy to overlook when having fun. On the other hand, the campaign of Titanfall 2, it must be repeated, contains elements rarely seen in a shooter: many of the missions are builton platform elements and changing maps, and the clashes - which usually see you killing soldiers of dubious intelligence - are certainly not its highest point. What makes the massacre of a somewhat stupid artificial intelligence amusing is the genius of the level design, to which are added intervals full of puzzles and cinematic moments capable of making Michael Bay pale. For the record, the campaign at times amazed us to the point of pushing us to avoid almost any kind of spoiler in this review. Impossible to have any other reaction when, convinced that we had to wait for a single player emulating Call of Duty, we found ourselves faced with levels that in some ways are more reminiscent of Guacamelee! or Deadcore. Not enough, everything rises further thanks to the monstrous variety of weapons: in Titanfall 2 there are an infinite number of assault rifles, shotguns and machine guns, which allow you to partially ignore the non-exceptional variety of opponents and their lack of cunning. The only negative note that we feel like making on the campaign therefore concerns the bosses: enhanced titans who are only useful as a tutorial for multiplayer and rarely have the verve that one would expect from such a fight. Oh, and there's also the fact that the adventure is about 6 hours long; a pity because, once completed, we would have liked to play many more. Gotta go slightly slower In short, the single-player adventure of Titanfall 2 is a very high quality extra, beyond the aforementioned smudges. However, the strength of the game lies once again in its primary element, that multiplayer we talked about a few days ago and which has bewitched a lot of online shooter enthusiasts with its incredible speed and the depth of its mechanics. With this title, Respawn Entertainment had to face a dilemma that was not easy to resolve: on the one hand, the mechanics put in place with the predecessor had been acclaimed by the critics, on the other, however, they presented skill barriers that had made it difficult to maintain a substantial community on platforms of belonging and at the same time had not been able to win back part of the audience of the competitors. Not wanting to distort a very successful formula too much, they therefore opted for marginal but significant changes, combined with a general expansion of the range of options available to players. Let's explain: Titanfall 2 features extremely similar movement mechanics to the first Titanfall, allowing you to double jump, quickly scale walls, slide with great speed or run up walls (and shoot while sliding on various surfaces). Sliding from wall to wall allows you to increase your acceleration, which can then be maintained with side jumps once you touch the ground (a maneuver known as ~bunnyhopping~). The original game gave the possibility to reach extreme speeds, which at high levels made it almost an obligation to master these maneuvers to perfection; Titanfall 2 does not decrease the game's base speed (a certain inertia in wall runs, which slowed movement, was eliminated after player protests during the test phases), but it partially limits the effectiveness of bunnyhopping and decreases the time needed to kill opponents, facilitating eliminations and emphasizing the use of basic movements. There's no doubt some veterans will turn up their noses at that choice, but it's a sacrifice that's well offset by the sheer amount of additional changes the system has received. Many enemies, much glory For example, soldiers now have countless tactical skills, which in addition to significantly changing their physical appearance also partially change their role in battle. They range from very useful grappling hooks to barriers that enhance the damage, even going through dimensional passages that allow you to disappear and reappear in another area, and all topped off with a long series of modifications to weapons and passive skills to customize even more the experience. The Titans then received an even more significant treatment, now divided into six classes each with unique abilities and powerful chargeable Core Abilities, to such a degree that they have become direct responses to each other. So if Titanfall already enjoyed a strong duality - it is still divided between spectacular and very mobile clashes in the role of pilots and more tactical and slow phases aboard the titans, mode permitting - this sharp increase in powers and techniques gives its systems an impressive variety , which drives us to constantly experiment with new solutions. Of the modes, however, we have already talked to exhaustion in our special dedicated to multiplayer, so it is only the case to renote that there are no fewer than nine, and that between classics like Attrition and Capture the Flag, and excellent new features like Bounty Hunt and Last Titan Standing, you'll be spoiled for choice (the only one that's a bit sketchy is the Colosseum, but it remains nice idea). We would also like to be able to guarantee the stability of the online sector, but unfortunately our review was held in a closed environment, face to face with the developers. We are not particularly concerned about the stability of the servers, however it should be noted that the introduction of networks that group players and allow you to easily organize games with friends (like guilds) creates a very slight possibility of seeing matchmaking problems at launch . In the meantime, we warn you. I look at you from above Having confirmed the quality of the mechanics and of the single player, and positively evaluated almost all the changes, the main remaining doubts are only two: balance and quality of the maps. On the first it is obviously very difficult to express yourself here, since it takes weeks before noticing actual imbalances in the combinations of skills in the hands of skilled players and a review session is certainly not enough to understand what needs to be changed and what not. Certainly the variety of available combinations allows you to answer more or less everything, as well as the choice to relegate the predecessor's Smart Gun to the Boost Skills menu (techniques that can be equipped separately and loaded during the game in a similar way to the Titan's Core Skills ) is undoubtedly excellent, as well as demonstrating a fair amount of self-irony. On the maps, the safeties are similar, with a few more flaws. The verticality of some of them, for example, is much more limited than in the previous Titanfall, and favors dry shooting rather than the witty navigation of spaces. However, this does not mean that well-designed maps are missing: there are locations very rich in supports, alternative passages and areas where moving slyly gives immense advantages, which bring the experience very close to the past. In other words, the presence of slightly more accessible and navigable maps shouldn't scare you, because the core of the experience remains rapid movement and quick reflexes, and also because new maps and modes will be added in the future for free, complete with the already confirmed remake of the beloved Angel City. On the other hand, we are less sure about the management of other DLCs: the skins in the game are numerous and well-finished, but there has already been talk of adding additional ones for a fee, and it is not sure whether any extra Titans will have to be paid for or will come for free. However, the contents present are already very commendable and Respawn does not seem to have thought of an aggressive expansion plan for the future. If there's one thing Titanfall 2 proves, it's that the studio has focused on the quality of the base game, rather than wasting time on the frills. A few closing considerations on the technical sector: the modified version of the Source used by the software house, while based on a non-modern engine, makes a good impression thanks to a textbook artistic direction and maintains an enviable fluidity both on Playstation 4 and on Xbox one. The graphic difference between the two consoles (we had the opportunity to test them both) is really marginal, with a slightly higher definition on the Playstation but some unjustified scatters during the campaign, and greater stability on the Microsoft console. The Respawn have managed to reach an enviable level with the means available, and both the titans and the enemy soldiers are stylistically impeccable and very detailed. However, don't expect incredible lighting effects, highly advanced shaders or excellent graphics over distance.", "date": "2016-10-24", "grade": "9.0"}
