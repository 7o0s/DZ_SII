And starting from these, evolution can only be constant and improving over time, adapting to new players, to videogame directions and making the most of the technological means available. Just as in the case of Naughty Dog, which entered the hearts of all PlayStation owners practically immediately thanks to Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, and then constantly strengthened this bond within which the quality has rarely fallen below guard levels. The arrival of PlayStation 3 imposed new aims and possibilities on the Californian developer, which materialized in 2007 with the Uncharted saga: the team was a great fan of Indiana Jones films, in particular Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it was therefore natural to think of a production that resumed its strings, with all the differences of the case due to the use of the videogame medium. And so this new saga, in the chapters that appeared two years apart from each other, started exactly from these assumptions, quickly climbing positions and becoming a cornerstone of the Sony monolith, as well as a simply excellent trilogy seasoned with humor. action, entertainment and a technical sector often able to excel among the productions present at the time. The fourth episode arriving on PlayStation 4 next year promises sparks and will (hopefully) be the worthy conclusion of the series; at the same time Naughty Dog has already created space for a further evolutionary piece with The Last of Us. These considerations, however, are the subject for a different study: the remastering work carried out to create this collection, operated by Bluepoint Games, is truly excellent, as you will learn in the next paragraphs. We tried Uncharted: the Nathan Drake Collection on PlayStation 4 and here's our verdict Uncharted: Drake's Fortune ~Every great adventure has a beginning, but it is the road ahead, the one that leads to its end, which holds true glory~: with this quote from Sir Francis Drake, dated 1587, begins the title that inaugurated this successful saga. We are in 2007 on PlayStation 3, eight years ago, with the title of Naughty Dog which introduces the character of Nathan Drake to the general public and an action and adventure video game which makes extensive use of the camera to offer the best glimpse, of brilliant dialogues between the main protagonists and a light-hearted and fun style. Starting from the initial scene on the boat with Elena Fisher, an assault reporter looking for a story for her network, up to the legendary Victor Sullivan, whose original meeting with Nate will be shown in the third chapter. An adventure that follows all the clichs of the genre, in which the search for treasure is interrupted by unexpected events, puzzles to solve, shootings with some fist fights. And then jeep chases, submerged cities, speedboat escapes, a series of evocative and graphically inspired settings, supported by an excellent artistic level; the Colombian forest in El Dorado, with its lush greenery and the ability to move the plants as the main protagonist passes. The shooter dynamics are the classic ones of third-person titles, with the possibility of hooking onto covers (using a circle), shooting from ledges, using two types of weapons simultaneously from a wider range, throwing the inevitable grenades. Perform in melee, with a couple of combos linked to the repeated use of the square key alternated with the triangle if necessary. The shady figures Navarro and Roman try several times to anticipate Drake and create many headaches for him, but in full American blockbuster style it will be the latter who wins, from a certain point of view, following a progression that in the last part of the the game actually ends a bit in ~caciara~ with the introduction of little credible paranormal events, above all the game does not elaborate on some mechanics and could have lasted a few more hours. Net of these defects, Naughty Dog's game was widely appreciated by critics and the public, revealing itself as a fresh and fun third-person shooter, a fundamental basis for building that great jewel that turned out to be the second chapter. Drake's Fortune, in any case, is the title of the trilogy that has benefited the most from the remastering work, if only because it is the one furthest behind from a technological point of view. Beyond the resolution increased to 1080p and a fluidity the vast majority of the time anchored to sixty frames per second, havei love improved character models, the complete elimination of screen tearing (the classic effect that splits the screen in two, which bored the original), the absence of important aliasing, the introduction of different particle effects, better detail as far as it concerns objects in the distance. There is also the depth of field, a typically photographic effect introduced with enormous benefits in the following chapters, with the possibility of blocking the focus on objects or in conjunction with the scenarios. All these changes translate into a pleasant adventure and even after eight years, which is combined with some changes to the control system aimed at making the game enjoyable. Aim and shoot are now associated with the rear triggers of the DualShock 4, which does not suffer from the grip and travel problems of its predecessor; the response to the commands is immediate thanks to the sixty frames per second, and the grenade throw animation has been revised, the release of which is delegated to the L1 bumper. In our view, superfluous elements have also been eliminated, such as the support for the motion sensor which was used to keep Nate balanced as he passed, for example on a slippery log. Obviously Drake's Fortune is the title that most shows the weight of the years with less detailed textures or explosions that are always the same as a comic, but the all-round work done on this episode manages to put this trilogy perfectly at ease in playing this trilogy in sequence , familiarizing yourself with the mechanics of the series then literally exploded in the sequel. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves ~I haven't told even half of what I've done and seen in my travels, because I knew I wouldn't be believed~: this time it's a quote from Marco Polo that opens the dance of the title Naughty Dog; where the first chapter was a tasty appetizer that introduced the series to the general public, Il covo dei ladri was the immediate and definitive consecration. An exceptional title that has moved the technological bar of console productions upwards, which has taken and enhanced the spectacular and gameplay elements of the first chapter to raise them to a new level. The initial cliffhanger on the snow is not only spectacular and fun to play, but finally restores dignity to an atmospheric element often hated in video games because it was done badly and with less care; in Uncharted 2 the particles, the soft shadows left on the snow, the explosions, the general impact make these white flakes look in a new light. Furthermore, this beginning is only a prelude to an extremely perfected formula by the developer, with memorable moments such as those of the helicopter, which chases Nathan Drake far and wide, the sequence aboard a moving train, simply incredible , an almost imperceptible transition between interlude sequences and gameplay, which defined the standards for subsequent productions in order to make video games more and more extremely interactive, enjoyable and spectacular films. Small changes have also been introduced regarding the gameplay, such as a greater capacity for weapons, new possibilities for grenades (including aiming and quick release with L2+L1) and an evolved melee, which now with the triangle button allows you to avoid enemy counterattacks. A crescendo of emotions up to the lost city of Shambala - memorable in the sequence in the water during a storm - with the only small drawback represented from our point of view by the bad guy of the moment, Lazarevic, charismatic up to a certain point and certainly not inspired in fights that see him as an antagonist. Other small improvements resided in the collection of treasures that do not interrupt the action and an even more aggressive and fluid progression between the various components. Il Covo dei Ladri has also seen the introduction of an interesting competitive multiplayer, with a not too frenetic pace and able to take advantage of the vertical extension of the maps, and an online cooperative version with some sections of the story or the classic horde mode . Multiplayer which however is not present in this remaster, but we will return to it in a couple of paragraphs. Uncharted 2 was acclaimed by critics and audiences, it won the game of the year on these pages too and is, in our view, the most representative title of the trilogy, an essential exponent of third-person shooters capable of entertaining, surprising, involve for its entire duration. As graphically said at the time it was sensational, not only for the technical solutions adopted, but also for the enormous and inspired variety in artistic terms, with each particular settingand textures fired to a thousand to enhance the objects up close and those in the distance. The protagonist forest this time was that of Borneo, darker than that of the first chapter, but even more impressive. For this version the work done by Bluepoint was easier: the only increased resolution and doubled fluidity allow for a better and cleaner image definition together with a perfect response to commands, but in reality here too we have particle effects and improved explosions, higher quality textures, distant models of objects and enemies with more polygons. Net of uninspired enemies such as artistic and polygonal realization, Uncharted 2 remains a gentleman title even in 2015: as gameplay it has aged quite well and if we only look at the visual variety and attention to detail, it is able to give still runs to several contemporary productions. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception ~All men dream: but not in the same way. Those who dream by night, in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake up by day to discover the vanity of those images: but those who dream by day are dangerous men, because they can put their daydreams into practice, to make them possible~: the quote from Thomas Edward Lawrence, also known as Lawrence of Arabia, inaugurates the third installment of the Uncharted series, which in its beginning in the James Bond manner begins in a London pub where Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan punch some people. The melee sees the introduction of the circle to throw opponents into the distance and perhaps use objects to stun them, or even to contend for an equal fight; it is also possible to hit enemies from above in flight with the square and the animations are further improved, especially when Nathan Drake touches objects or walls, placing his hand in between to give a greater touch of credibility. From a technological point of view, Drake's deception restores dignity to the desert, however, with a simply exceptional and even more refined impact than the previous title, albeit with a gap not comparable to what had been between the first two. It shares a small technical defect with the other chapters when Drake uses the torch, with the beam of light which instead of following the positioning of the latter, always projects itself in front of the camera: a poetic license operated by Naughty Dog perhaps to make it easier exploration in the dark. The protagonist forest is that of Eastern France, lush, lush and detailed, the bad guys of the moment belong to the past of Nate and Sully, with a parenthesis that delves into the past of the two protagonists shortly after the start of the game. Finally, the musical sector offers rearranged and some unpublished songs, for a soundtrack perfectly suited to the visual part, very catchy and certainly of quality, thanks to the notes created by Greg Edmonson. Uncharted 3 keeps the standards of the series high, improving even more from a technical point of view, but probably not comparable to the second episode, especially for a less memorable adventure progression and for a perhaps too unbalanced shooter part. It remains a Mr. game, mind you, and the multiplayer has also had good success with the addition of new maps and the strengthening of the cooperative part, including a mini-adventure to be tackled by several people and consisting of five levels. The enhancement work is similar to that operated on the second chapter, as the basis is very valid and dated 2011: greater definition, fluidity close to perfection, almost complete absence of aliasing, better quality of objects in the distance and particle effects, for an excellent impact in 2015 which highlights the good things made by Naughty Dog with the original title. Playstation 4 trophies Uncharted: the Nathan Drake Collection offers three sets of trophies and three sets of platinums, a little more complex to obtain than the original titles because they are also linked to the Speedrun mode and the new difficulty level. Between old and new there are those related to the killing of enemies with each weapon, the elimination simultaneously with the grenade, a sequence of blows to the head dealt. Good fun! The Collection in its entirety In the previous paragraphs we talked about each title of this Collection in detail, and about the novelties brought by the version on PlayStation 4; the complete package has further additions and thanks to a great painstaking optimization work it manages to be ~contained~ on a single Blu-ray disc.
