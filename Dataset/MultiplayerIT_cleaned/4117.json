Think for example of Fire Emblem Heroes, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius or Tales of Link, all more or less successful gachas that try to capture the spirit of the original titles by compromising with the app market and the reviled microtransactions. Shin Megami Tensei was also missing and Atlus has seen fit to fill the gap with Liberation Dx2: we played it for several hours and we concluded that it is probably one of the best gacha titles that we have had the opportunity to try, net some uncertainty. A little gacha gacha? The first thing you need to understand about this Shin Megami Tensei is that, conceptually, it is closer to the spin-off Devil Survivor than to another chapter of the mother series or even to the now much more famous derivative franchise Persona. Liberation Dx2 is set in the near future, in Japan, and tells the vicissitudes of a band of colorful characters, capable of controlling a wide range of demons, who oppose a faction that uses the same powers to achieve a much more left. Like any good self-respecting gacha, and with a nod to the Atlus series itself, the story - not particularly engaging - is told through long dialogues between one mission and another: a peculiarity of this Shin Megami Tensei, however, lies in the rhythm of the gameplay, because if it is true that the series usually prepares itself for decidedly long and demanding game sessions, Liberation Dx2 was designed to be nibbled a few minutes at a time. This choice obviously translated into a simplified approach to the historical combat system and a not particularly high level of difficulty. The combat system is in fact inspired by the traditional ~Press Turn~ that the Shin Megami Tensei series has been using for years. Each demon has one or more weaknesses and by attacking with the right elemental spells, or dealing critical damage, the target is stunned while the player, who controls a team of up to four demons, gains an extra turn. However, Liberation Dx2 implements a small difference compared to the previous Shin Megami Tensei or Persona: the Magic Points or MPs that the player consumes to cast spells are always ten at most and are recharged on the enemy's turn. The strategy therefore consists in deciding when to consume them and when to save them: in the first clashes it may seem trivial, but after a while we need to think more carefully about our actions. The dynamics of the outline are more or less the usual of the Shin Megami Tensei and it is even possible to recruit demons by conversing with them and choosing the right answers based on their bizarre personalities. The fusion of demons, a key mechanic in any self-respecting Shin Megami Tensei, takes the lion's share in this Liberation Dx2. The various entities are characterized by different degrees of rarity and power, of course, and the gacha model allows you to draw the various demons to add to our compendium: unfortunately the chances that the rarest demons come out are very low and discourage using this species of lottery and above all to give in to the numerous and somewhat intrusive advertisements which invite the player to spend the real money. Despite this, Liberation Dx2's fusion system allows you to recycle unwanted demons and obtain almost all the others, including the strongest ones: it's a long and laborious process, but undoubtedly satisfying for those who decide to engage in the game and dissect its lots of content. In this sense, however, we must be careful: the app is not very well optimized and gives some problems on older devices, draining the battery at a high speed.", "date": "2018-07-31", "grade": "7.5"}
