{"name": "Blitzkrieg", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blitzkrieg.html", "text": "What beautiful houses: raze them to the ground! Among hills cloaked in greenery and rural estates it is difficult to immerse yourself in a climate of warmongering tension, but such beauty will not last long because every architectural element is destined to collapse after a short time under the blows of artillery. In any case, as long as something stands upright, apart from the somewhat anachronistic lack of three-dimensionality, the landscape is all in all discreet, without, however, shining with either imagination or variety, with a rather limited chromatic range. The impact is discreet but there is nothing in particular that reveals style or inspiration, from the artificial arrangement of the elements to the general impression of poor graphic cleanliness. But what it loses in the scenario it makes up for in terms of the units which are carefully detailed and animated (considering their size); especially the special effects such as smoke, the dust that rises and the tracks of the tires restore joy to the eye. We also wish we could say that the soundtrack boasts a touch of class but we are dealing with motifs perfectly in tune without ever becoming memorable and with the sometimes banal phrases of our units. Conclusions Blitzkrieg could have been much more precise in form and balance, as well as in the technique which suffers from some bugs and an often frustrating artificial intelligence in unit movements. Despite this and beyond always being an average product in many respects, it offers enough tactical depth to involve the player, especially the lover of the genre. In short, the substance is not lacking but those who expected a great strategic game on the Second World War will be disappointed, because excellence is still far away. Pros: Over 200 units available Solid tactical and strategic component Lots of skills Cons: Missions are often badly balanced Troops struggle to find an optimal path Technically it could have been more accurate Nothing new on the western front You don't need to be a longtime player to have found the fate of the Second World War at least once in your hands and the same will happen to you with Blitzkrieg. After taking a position choosing whether to be on the side of the Allies, Germany or Russia, what you will find in front of you is an isometric 2D RTS that is struggling to take off. Fortunately, since he wants to consistently retrace the historical stages of the conflict, he won't force you to build improbable factories by trudging nearby in search of supplies. In fact, each mission puts you in command of a well-defined number of troops with which to complete the scenario, although the balance is not always optimal. On the other hand, you will have over 200 types of units at your command between infantry, tanks, artillery and support vehicles. From this point of view, Blitzkrieg shows its flagship, for the amount of skills made available for each individual element, allowing you to repair bridges, build trenches, occupy buildings, assault tanks with grenades or unleash hell aiming mortars even where the view does not reach. All this translates into a rather articulated strategic component, which involves the transport of troops, the use of scouts equipped with binoculars to reveal enemy fortifications, and an interesting variation consisting of air support with attack and patrol functions. However, many possibilities prove to be a thorn in the side when it comes to giving orders, considering that you will also have to deal with the supply of ammunition for individual soldiers, deploying the appropriate trucks on the field. The latter, like all motorized vehicles, are particularly clumsy in maneuvers, due to the continuous positioning and the army's artificial intelligence itself, which will often force you to have to take the troops by the hand even during the most basic adjustments. To confuse the situation is added a tiny interface full of options that take hours before they can be mastered and that lengthen the time needed to issue the desired command. Luckily, it's possible to slow down the action or pause the game while you sort through the commands. Furthermore, there are some fun ideas: it is possible to mine the land, request air support to bomb an area or parachute support troops, but the gameplay remains all in all devoid of innovations and often bored by the repetitiveness of many missions. In fact, beyond the campaign mode, and a multiplayer set to the usual options, all that remains is randomly generated scenarios or an editor for the most diehards.", "date": "2004-01-29", "grade": null}
