{"name": "Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sly-cooper-and-the-thievius-raccoonus.html", "text": "Gentleman thieves steal Kojima's soul The prerogatives necessary to create a captivating brand are as elementary (originality of the concept, solid gameplay, attention to the background) as they are rare in current productions. In terms of Platform then, theoretically the work is even simpler: far from realistic pretensions and particularly articulated backgrounds, the developer can move with more freedom, and, if desired, give vent to his most daring fantasies without too many worries. The only faculty required for those who decide to embark on this adventure (ergo, create a new Platform), is a pinch of originality, desired more by good taste than by a hypothetical official code of the Good Platform Game. Well, Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus fully respects these canons, and goes even further. Yes, because not only are all the indispensable elements present and clearly visible, but they are also seasoned, it is right to point out, with great class. First of all the plot, which is introduced to us with a brief flashback following a first game session, especially useful for becoming familiar with the controls and getting to know the fascinating (at least from the perspective of the protagonist) policewoman Fox. We will have to impersonate Sly Cooper, a young raccoon heir to a famous lineage of gentleman thieves, who, with the help of his fellow students Bentley, the ~nerd~ turtle and Murray, a mild pink hippopotamus, will have to recover the 5 fragments into which he was divided the family book, the Thevious Raccoonus, stolen by as many villains. As easily understood, it will therefore be a question of visiting 5 different locations, where the hideouts of the respective book thieves are located, each divided into various levels, which end with the recovery of a key that will be used to access subsequent levels. Each enemy and their respective hiding places are introduced to us through a cartoon film, accompanied by the narrator's voice of Sly Cooper. The play system structured by Sucker Punch aims to recreate an interactive cartoon in all respects, and we can confidently say that the experiment was successful. The balance that is established between the part played and the ~side dish~ is almost perfect, and the result is the pleasant sensation of being the protagonists of a nice cartoon serial, fun and light, which in any case does not fall into banality and boredom . To offer a not indifferent added value there are also the dialogues in the in-game phases between Sly Cooper and his fearful guide Murray. The reference, in a brilliantly satirical key, to the strange Otacon/Snake couple is much more than whispered, and by setting English in the choice of language, it will be possible to appreciate the excellent dubbing/acting work and further realize the links with the Kojimiana work, which are developed, as we will see, also in terms of gameplay. The parody, perfectly successful, will surely make you smile. Such an approach might appear overly linear at first glance; in reality, also thanks to the possibility of freely replaying the finished levels, which you have access to from the base of our dynamic trio through the maps of the various locations, you never feel the weight of this structure which always appears fresh and balanced. It's nice to look at... and you control it well! Without solid and fun gameplay, however, so much care in the creation of the background becomes wasted, the detractor could object. To similar insinuations, Sly Cooper responds dryly with a truly impeccable control system for precision and speed in response and a camera that follows the character in an optimal way, avoiding annoying headaches for the player, which can also be easily maneuvered with the right analog stick. With the X key the raccoon makes a jump, which becomes double with a second press in flight. The triangle allows a first-person view through binoculars (without the possibility of advancing or moving, as also happens in Mgs2). A pressure of the square will produce an attack, while the circle gives access to the grip function that can be carried out with the hook / stick received as standard, in addition to the special techniques, with a ~stealth~ flavor. When signaled, it is in fact possible to perform special movements (such as walking adherent to a wall on small support surfaces, or landing on platforms equally limited in size, or performing pirouettes, and so on); these extra actions can be unlocked by collecting various messages enclosed in bottles scattered throughout each level, which allow the decryption of a code for opening safes that ~contain~ these newve skill. These are not the real fulcrum of the gameplay, since they are limited to the simple pressure of a key at the right moment, but they undoubtedly constitute a peculiarity that differentiates Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus from the other competitors. On Sly's path there will also be numerous coins and icons of the protagonist (the equivalent of mushrooms in Super Mario), useful for increasing the 5 initially available lives, as well as horseshoes, which double our resistance to enemy blows: enough one to see us succumb. The design and the same succession of levels are characterized by linearity, with the exploration phase (of which objectively one does not feel a great lack) decidedly reduced to the bone. The enemies themselves are ~static~ and have little complex behaviors, and eliminating them (with a single blow) is not a big problem. Completing a level therefore means simply overcoming the obstacles placed in our path: Sly Cooper wisely draws from the traditional two-dimensional platform and re-proposes the simple mechanisms adapted to the evolution of modern times. Thanks to the precision of the controls, it is not problematic to face the frenzy of certain situations, especially when it comes to facing the Bosses, all excellently studied, and which also bring some innovation to the Platform genre, mostly the result of crossovers with other videogame genres. There's no shortage of sub-games either: aboard a van, if necessary also adapted to the aquatic setting, or riding a really strange machine gun, there really is something for everyone. Longevity, however, is certainly not at excellent levels (it took us about 13 hours to finish it); stimuli, actually rather scarce, to replayability can be found in the search to recover all the messages and thus acquire all the special stealth skills. The graphic component of the title is treated above all from a technical point of view, with an engine that grinds polygons painted with various and defined textures at 60 frames per second without effort, although some sporadic slowdowns are noted, even in not particularly crowded phases, which seem to us due to a lack of optimization of some parts of the code, especially in the final. Although therefore some levels are not made with the same care as the initial ones, the graphic value of the title is not questioned. The cartoonish design of the protagonist, partially covered with cell shading textures, and of all the characters in general makes the title inevitably attractive to a very wide range of users, and it can be said with certainty that we are in the presence of a cartoon ( interactive) not only from a conceptual point of view, but also from a purely audiovisual one. Comment Ps2 and Sony gain a new mascot and an important and original brand thanks to Sucker Punch. If in the sequel, in the light of the practically obvious ending, the class and qualities of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus are confirmed, perhaps with the implementation of a greater longevity and the elimination of some marginal defects, this newborn saga will probably collect the success that already now proves to deserve. A highly recommended purchase, to be combined with the other surprise in the field of Sony platformers, Ratchet & Clank. Pros + Nice and original background + Precise controls + Multilingual dubbing and Mgs2 parody Cons - A bit short - Fairly high difficulty - Linear You say Nintendo, and you think of Mario and his merry gang, you think of Link and Zelda, you think of Samus. They are icons, symbols; they are points of reference for the player about to buy a console, and as such they reassure him. The legitimization and enhancement of these names, which have become real brands, have gone hand in hand with the consolidation and success of Nintendo, verifiable by all. Sony, which acts as a rookie or almost, would seem to have understood that significant first-party titles and ~mascots~ easily recognizable by the general public are decisive in order to remain in this market for a long time. It is not enough to rely on third parties who can guarantee only temporary security, as recent events further confirm (from Bio Hazard who abandons Playstation, up to the Affaire Rare). This particular category includes projects such as Gran Turismo, Ico, Jak And Dexter, Ratchet and Clank, The Getaway, The Mark of Kri and the latest addition Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, whose development was supervised by Sucker Punch, known to the public for a single work on Nintendo 64. Despite theand sales, outside Europe, do not seem to reward him, we feel we can say that Sly Cooper has the potential to be one of those longed-for reference points to which Sony seems to aspire.", "date": "2003-01-22", "grade": null}
