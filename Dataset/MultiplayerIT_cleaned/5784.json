Experiments thus emerge that represent the backbone of videogame experimentation on a mobile platform, beyond the simple production of clones or ports from projects born on other hardware, which often find a form stitched around the main characteristics of the devices in question, i.e. the touch screen interface and their particular methods of use. The roguelike, for example, already represents a consolidated genre even in the portable environment after having been a sort of staple of the new indie wave on PC, but on smartphones and tablets it is taking on a particular declination, even more marked by a fast pace and with elements imported from different genres, as well as a basic control system that basically requires short taps on the screen. Rust Bucket manages to amalgamate the basic elements of the genre even with different puzzle-style features, so much so that it looks like a sort of ~Zelda roguelike~ decomposed to the minimum terms, with a protagonist who is essentially a wandering helmet that moves from box to box activating switches, moving levers, destroying objects and fighting enemies, all in the short span of simple directional taps on the screen. The interaction is simple and the puzzles to solve are often basic, but the mix between the need to hit the enemies first, keep the interactive elements of the maps under control and the constant threat of ending the game after a single hit, keeps the strange formula in a formidable balance that makes the game work, making it deep and balanced enough to advance even with frustrating game overs. Rust Bucket combines the elements of roguelike turn-based RPG with those of the puzzle in a good mix One hit and go The greatest difficulty posed by Rust Bucket obviously lies in its roguelike soul, according to which with a single hit the game ends and takes us back to the beginning of the level. This forces us to precisely calculate our moves, given that our turn allows us to move the protagonist/helmet of a single square in one of the four cardinal directions, before quickly giving way to the enemies and therefore returning after a moment back into action . The question seems simple at first, but when you find yourself moving within maps full of traps, forced passages and herds of enemies - however divided into different types, each characterized by specificity of attack and movement - it is clear how the game takes on the thickness of a sort of chess game, where every movement must be calculated with a certain strategic skill. This is particularly true in the main game mode of Rust Bucket, or the Endless Dungeon, which throws us into this huge multilevel dungeon essentially trying not to die among the countless dangers of which it is stuffed, where the Puzzle Mode acts above all from gradual and balanced introduction to the core mechanics of the game. Its very structure is based on the repetition and recomposition of elements to build an increasingly difficult dungeon to complete, with the gradual addition of further obstacles and an increase in the difficulty rate: a mechanic that is repetitive by constitution, but also stimulating long thanks to the constant climate of danger that is typical of roguelikes. Given the frequent need to restart from the beginning of the level, following the game over canon after a single shot, and the consequent obligatory viewing of advertisements at each game restart, the in-app purchase to remove promotional messages is practically obligatory if you don't want to suffer a nervous breakdown. For this reason, the free-to-play structure easily transforms into a premium one, given that those who intend to devote themselves intensively to Rust Bucket must necessarily pay the 3.99 euros useful for living in peace. However, the figure is still fair for this Nitrome production, which, as per the standard of the label in question, is also distinguished by a simple but clean technical realization and endowed with great personality.", "date": "2016-01-09", "grade": "7.8"}
