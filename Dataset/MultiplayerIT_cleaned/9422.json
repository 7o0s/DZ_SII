And in fact what better occasion for all lovers of the series to rediscover one of the most acclaimed works of the Ubisoft studio in Montreal, or for new gamers to come into direct contact with it? We are talking about Prince of Persia: Trilogy HD (also known as Prince of Persia Trilogy 3D), a collection containing the remastered versions in high definition of three of the titles of the now quadrilogy The Sands of Time of the popular Prince of Persia saga. Made exclusively for PlayStation 3 with full support for 3D and Trophies, the three games in the collection are Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within and Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, which, in this previously released only as downloadable content from the PlayStation Store in North America in 2010. Now, however, they also arrive in stores around the world in a package of Sony's Classic HD series contained in a single Blu-ray. With really interesting results. Let's see how. The Sands of Time is an action game with a third-person view that tells the story of Prince Dastan, younger son of the king of Persia Shahraman, who is involved by his father in the military campaign of conquest that he has just undertaken against the Maharajah of 'India. Supported by the old Vizier Zervan who betrays his ruler, the Persians manage to conquer the most powerful local city, sacking it and enslaving its inhabitants, including the beautiful Farah, the only daughter of the Maharajah himself. Magic sands Among the treasures recovered by the victors during the looting there are also some ancient artifacts among which a large hourglass containing the extraordinary Sands of Time stands out, a primordial substance that hides a great magical power thanks to which it is possible to alter the course of time, and a mystical Dagger capable of bending the same to the will of its owner, as well as protecting it from the aforementioned granular material. In fact, these cannot be used by ordinary mortals, and therefore have a destructive effect on those who come into direct contact with them: for them there is only death or transformation into a horrendous sand monster, unless, in fact, to have with him a magical object that prevents the ~contagion~. On their way home, the Persian army decides to stop at the allied sultanate of Azad. Here, with deception, the evil Zervan pushes the Prince to break the seal of the hourglass, thus freeing the fearsome Sands of Time. Just the possibility of interacting with time is one of the peculiarities that directly have to do with the gameplay and which is therefore one of the most interesting features of the game. Taking advantage of the Sand of Time, in fact, the Prince can slow down the action, to more easily extricate himself from crowds of enemies, always very numerous on the screen, or to turn back time, so as to be able to repeat certain movements. With this power the player therefore has the possibility of repeating passages misinterpreted and concluded not in the right direction, such as jumps that failed, holds not grabbed in time and ended with a premature departure, or paralyze the enemies in the hottest situations, having consequently the possibility of eliminating them more easily, or of planning the type of attack more suited to the context. Obviously the use of this power is not unlimited, and God forbid. It is strictly dependent on a bar that is consumed with each use. However, this indicator can be filled again by collecting the bottles of sand left by defeated enemies. Playstation 3 trophies There are 16 Trophies available in this version of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. They are divided into 1 Platinum, 5 Gold, 4 Silver and 6 Secrets. There are none of Bronze instead. For example, obtaining the Dagger of Time will reward you with the Sandbearer trophy, while rewinding time 200 times or killing 300 enemies will reward you with the Time Lord and Sand Warrior awards, respectively. The Prince and Farah The Sand of Time also plays a primary role in the development of the story, given that by approaching certain sources the Prince has real visions of the past, and therefore new aspects of the plot are revealed through them. As for everything else, game mechanics,between suspended platforms and pitfalls that will rack the minds and reflexes of the players in the constant and desperate search for a way to safety, buildings to explore and fights against the guards, it is practically conceptually similar to all the episodes of the series, even the original from 1989 The control of the Prince in these key situations is optimal, thanks also to the many animations that distinguish him and to the good response of the commands. And aside from some occasional camera glitches, jumps, wall runs and saber swings are pretty easy to pull off. Even the puzzles, almost always logical and never frustrating, and which are often accompanied by a quick tracking shot of the camera to indicate the correct path to follow, seem ideally taken from the old Prince of Persia titles and transported into the third dimension and into a more modern. The fights are extremely dynamic and represent a pleasant diversion, at least initially, from exploration. Especially when our Prince is joined by Princess Farah, the aforementioned daughter of the Marajah, as mentioned at the beginning of the article, kidnapped and enslaved after the siege of her palace by the Persian army, who allies with our main character to counter the Vizier and repair the damage caused by the Sands of Time. The young girl's bow skills become of fundamental importance in clashes with enemies since the girl offers excellent support in this sense. The ~sandy~ saga The Sands of Time is a quadrilogy made up of 4 games, all linked together by a compelling storyline that takes place in the same narrative universe. The first is Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (PlayStation 2, 2003), pseudo remake of the original Prince of Persia. The second in chronological order, i.e. following the plot of the series, is Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, PC, Nintendo DS and Wii, 2010), which however is the last as a production. The third episode is Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (PlayStation 2, 2004), the second in chronological order to have been released on the market. While the fourth and final chapter is Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (PlayStation 2, 2005), which is the third as a production. Couple puzzle However, it is true that its presence also requires a certain amount of strategy on the part of the user who is often forced to intervene to help it to defend it from attacks by opponents to which it is particularly weak. In short, it must therefore be protected, otherwise an immediate game over will result in his death. Farah is also fundamental in solving several puzzles, since the latter often require the combined action of the two characters to be overcome. However, the young warrior is not directly controllable by the gamer, and therefore her every movement will also be entrusted to the CPU in this case. With the new 720p graphics of the Prince of Persia: Trilogy HD edition, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, thanks also to the cartoonish style that distinguishes it, looks very good to behold. Brilliant colors, greater sharpness of the image and enhancement of effects such as dust and lights are embellished by the remixing work done on the original by Ubisoft graphics. Of course, the textures are what they are, none of them are particularly complex but overall the game scenarios are very pleasant to look at. The few polygons that make up the characters are counterbalanced by the excellent and numerous animations that distinguish the Prince and his allies in particular. The sound that limits the music to the fight scenes or interludes is beautiful, relegating the task of accompanying the player along the adventure to background noises such as footsteps, screams or other effects. Thus, thanks to the reverberation and echo effects, it enjoys an extremely suggestive and credible atmosphere. Finally, the dubbing is also good, which by virtue of the high number of jokes exchanged by the two protagonists also assumes a very important role for the player's involvement and for understanding the events.", "date": "2011-03-11", "grade": "8.0"}
