{"name": "La strategia di Toriyama", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blue-dragon-plus-recensione-lav.html", "text": "Before launching on Xbox 360, Blue Dragon was awaited as only the big calibers of the JRPG genre can be expected: after all, the premises were all there, starting from the exclusivity of the title up to the very big names that could be read in the list of the staff. In the end the game turned out to be, although not at all evil, little up to the expectations that had been created, perhaps precisely because these expectations had become too important, but evidently Mistwalker has no intention of giving up the brand immediately, and the Blue present here Dragon Plus is proof of that! At the tip of the nib In some ways, the rethinking of the game formula is radical, which was also to be expected given the transition to a platform as different as the DS. BD+ does not renounce strong RPG elements, but the genre in which it fits is to all intents and purposes that of Real-Time Strategy Games, a choice already made by Square Enix when it came to bringing names such as the Mana series and Final Fantasy XII. The battles therefore take place in real time, on 3D maps that are certainly not huge and not too complex: control is crucial in situations like these, and it must be said that the game performs very well. It is almost always easy to choose the right character and the move to make him do, even when the battle is raging and even if there is absolutely no possibility of managing one's party with all the calm that an ~active pause~ can allow. This result is obtained on the one hand with effective attention dedicated to elements such as the on-screen rendering of the PGs (which are in 2D), the calibration of the sensitivity of the touch screen and the possibility of rotating the map by 45 if necessary, but, on the other hand, with limitations of the game system compared to the more classic RTS. These limitations consist mainly in the small size of the party, which never reaches more than seven components - at one point you will control sixteen characters, however divided into four different groups - and in the behavior of the enemies, who never attack you in huge numbers , always leave you plenty of time between one wave and another to restore the health of the group, and which are equipped with an Artificial Intelligence that goes little beyond the simple attack. A partial exception to all this is represented by the bosses, who require a certain strategy not so much because they are particularly acute, but rather because they have very specific weaknesses and strengths that it is up to you to understand and exploit. The result is fast and intuitive combat, almost never frustrating, but which soon falls into the banal: although there are ~variations on the theme~ (chest boxes to open before enemies, characters to protect and so on), often the best tactic consists in selecting the whole group, sending it towards the enemy and unleashing, before physical attacks, the magical abilities of each one, including the Shadows characteristics of the series, perhaps keeping an eye on the health bar to reinvigorate it if necessary with a magic or with a Medicine, an object of which the game is never stingy. Lastly, some pathfinding problems should be noted, which given the structural choices we have discussed do not weigh too much on the experience, but which are felt and should have been treated more. Strategic planning As any self-respecting virtual warlord knows, battles are won more off the field than on it: it is in the pre-battle phase that the RPG elements of BD+ come into play. First of all let's say that, after a very first phase in which the battles take place in sequence one after the other, you will soon be able to manage each element of the party as you please, apart from the development by levels which takes place automatically. Exploration is up to you: although it is obviously necessary to complete the game, you could absurdly always stay in the same area to battle enemies in the ~free battle~ in order to accumulate experience, items and money; you can also dedicate yourself to careful analysis of the area just cleared of enemies to find any hidden treasures or passages. But the most important phase is the one that allows you to manage, as we said, the characters individually, starting from the skills through a system of slots (limited and to be shared with the use of objects, so as the number of skills increases available to the PG will decrease the number of objects to which the same PG can access), up to the equipment, which is on the field or can be purchased in specific shops. All these activities are perhaps not fundamental, but certainly very important for the success of a battle: given the number of characters, objects and abilities trwhich to juggle, we are not faced with the driest and most intuitive interface ever seen and you can also lose a lot of time between the various menus, but the stylus helps a lot, as usual in these cases, and it all ends up breaking the pace of the game without weighing too much; on the contrary, given the repetitiveness of most of the battles, some players could even find more ideas in this phase... A wrong story? Among the various things for which the first Blue Dragon has earned the label of game without infamy and without praise there is certainly the whole plot / storytelling / characterization department, not unbearable but not memorable either: decisive steps have been taken in the Plus forward, perhaps not in the narrative premise, which is the most obvious one can expect from a sequel, but certainly in aspects such as the characterization of the characters (few new entries and many familiar faces, to the delight of the fans) and the deepening, through epic and/or epically intimate moments appropriately underlined by exquisitely crafted and rendered FMVs, of aspects such as the relationships between the protagonists and the usual but never tiring ~universal themes~ typical of every Japanese narrative work. So let's not talk about the plot in the strict sense, which remains banal despite some appreciable twists, when we say that this is probably the most captivating aspect of BD+, but about some specific ~moments~ of the narrative experience, very well rendered, touching and profound, and upon which the approximately 25 hours required to complete are ultimately based. It is, moreover, the usual care that the Japanese place in what is usually defined as ~surrounding~ the gameplay, care that is also reflected in the graphics: we have already spoken of FMVs, impressive on small DS screens, but also in real-time the surprises are many, with the 3D part always very clean and detailed (in particular the evoked Shadows, a real show) and the 2D part that shines for colors, style (provided you like Toriyama...) and ability of the engine to handle a good number of sprites without showing sagging. Finally, the sound is a little less evocative, always well-kept and of high quality, but devoid, in addition to dubbing, of particularly memorable motifs and sound effects.", "date": "2009-05-05", "grade": "7.2"}
