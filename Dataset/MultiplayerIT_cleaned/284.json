{"name": "Sid Meier's Railroads! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-railroads-recensione.html", "text": "We are the story Like its predecessors, Railroads offers the possibility of immersing yourself in various scenarios reproduced in a way that is quite faithful to the story, complete with railroad tycoons present at the time in which you choose to play. In fact, the player has the possibility to choose between some scenarios set in the North and South of the United States and in Europe, within France, Germany and the United Kingdom, trying his hand at historical figures such as Charles de Gaulle, Otto Von Bismarck, Nicholas II of Russia and Napoleon III. Within the various scenarios it is possible to choose the level of difficulty and the possible presence of objectives, with the possibility therefore of taking part in a sort of free game with or without opponents led by the CPU. Since there is no career mode, the rest of the game is covered exclusively by multiplayer, for which additional maps are available, through which to challenge aspiring railway builders from all over the world. In the carriage! The entire game system is mainly based on trains, their routes and what they transport, overshadowing all the economic-management aspects present in the old Tycoons. Typically starting from a small city already in possession of a station and tracks, the player must therefore be concerned above all with providing all the connections necessary for the development of the urban area, providing the resources required by the population and taking what it instead has to offer to the others city, in such a way as to favor trade and, of course, benefit from the payments obtained for the transport of passengers and goods. Going forward in the game, the number of trains on the line will increase and, consequently, it will be necessary to take structural measures in order to allow the various cars to travel without particular traffic problems, thus reaching the stations in the strictly necessary time, or almost : having stalled trains on a line means above all wasting time and, therefore, also the income from arriving at the stations, not to mention that a stopped locomotive together with the rest of the carriages in any case has its own management cost, which can therefore cause the red within our account. However, laying new rails is very simple, especially with regard to bridges and tunnels, which are created automatically: the player only has to worry about efficiently positioning the lines he intends to create. Even the cities will follow the progress of the railway lines, growing thanks to the resources provided by the trains directed towards them: we thus have the possibility of allowing the small town to evolve until it becomes a new metropolis, with all the advantages and disadvantages that it can behave for a railroad magnate. The competition The real challenge provided by the game is obviously the presence of competitors driven by the CPU, who will try dangerously for the entire duration of the game to ~make shoes~ for the player, who must be very careful to thrive quickly, thus preventing the other companies can become part of their own, through the purchase and sale of shares. Particular relevance in the challenge with the other tycoons lies in the patents: depending on the historical period in which you find yourself, auctions will in fact be held to obtain various kinds of improvements for your railway network, which can be exploited exclusively for 10 years of the game, past which this invention becomes public domain. Obtaining this advantage can be fundamental, as well as choosing well which patents to focus on, since the auction prices will not be low. Another way to earn money is to buy or build city industries from scratch, thus obtaining income not only from transporting resources, but also from selling them. Although the game system implemented by the developers is conceptually very valid, after initially settling in it will become quite simple to beat your opponents even in the most difficult game modes, especially for the more savvy players and used to the old Tycoons: fortunately the multiplayer can meet all those who ask for more demanding challenges. Care for details The level of graphic detail offered by Firaxis is of the highest order: watching the trains that load goods and passengers, leave and arrive at their destination is simply mesmerizing, not to mention the cities and industries, which show their life through animals they graze, buildings under construction and passengers crowded on the station platforms, complete with a conductor to give the departure signal. The entire Railroads system appears on Thurser identical to reality, without neglecting any aspect, even the most insignificant for the purposes of the game itself, showing an economic apparatus completely linked among its elements without the annoying feeling of ~separation~ present for example in Caesar 4, citing one of the most recent. As for the audio, we can count on a catchy soundtrack, linked during the game to the nation that acts as a scenario, together with the typical noises present in the stations, complete with the puffs of locomotives and the noise of the trains on the rails. watching the trains that load goods and passengers, depart and arrive at their destination is simply mesmerizing Conclusions Without reproducing the depth of its ancestors, Sid Meier's Railroads! it is appreciated for its immediacy, thanks to which the player's main concern becomes that of efficiently connecting cities and industries, in order to reproduce an economy traveling on its own tracks. The game gradually becomes more and more captivating, offering a level of graphic detail of excellent workmanship, which will keep the player glued to the monitor as he contemplates his creation, observing all the activities of his stations. The negative aspects of the game reside in an excessive simplicity even at the most advanced levels and, for the old fans of Sid Meier's Tycoons, precisely in the absence of major economic-management aspects. Ultimately then Railroads! is able to satisfy both occasional players and hardcore gamers, provided that the latter compromise with the game system, which is not as deep as perhaps one could expect from a title baked by the mind of Sid Meier.Pro Spectacular graphics Immediate game Guaranteed fun Cons Not high difficulty The shallow depth could make more experienced players turn up their noses Little trains, what a passion Tell the truth: there isn't at least one member of your family, perhaps a little advanced in age, who remembers with great nostalgia the times when the children's favorite games were toy trains, then by chance throwing themselves against the video games? Indeed, the latest generations raised on bread and shooters have not known the golden age of non-electronic entertainment, times in which home-made railways depopulated among the little ones as well as adults. However, thanks to the fantastic world of videogames, already in 1990 a certain Sid Meier created Railroad Tycoon which, together with its two sequels and related expansions, met with predictable success by reproducing the famous ~train game~ on our monitors, but adding everything the electronic entertainment industry allowed you to create in front of a screen, thus making possible what in the games of years before were just fantasies. After 16 years it is still dear Sid who, after having given us the remake of Pirates, returns to the scene with a new railway simulator, whose name however abandons the word Tycoon: however, this choice is not an insignificant detail, as the new Railroads detaches itself, as we will see, from its older brothers.", "date": "2006-11-10", "grade": null}
