Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. ~Dark Reign~, for the uninitiated, is a relatively recent Marvel saga that sees Norman Osborn (yes, the Green Goblin) appointed head of US security after playing a key role during the secret invasion operated by the Skrulls. Despite the facade, Osborn remains a psychopathic criminal, who forces the original Avengers to operate in the shadows and uses the opportunity to assemble a team of super villains who are supposedly supposed to defend the homeland. However, it is only a narrative pretext, the one that prompted the producers of the famous Puzzle Quest to create an episode of the series based precisely on the Marvel superheroes and on this storyline. Developed by Demiurge Studios, Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign is available on the App Store and Google Play in the traditional freemium format, i.e. it can be downloaded for free but includes a series of ~in-app purchases~ that allow you to grow your characters and improve your skills. their powers more quickly. However, let's see how the various Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thor and company fit together with the ~match-3~ mechanics that we know well and which now characterize a huge number of puzzle games, not only in the mobile sector. The structure of the game features missions in which three of the heroes who are part of our roster (which is enriched by acquiring new ~covers~) face a variable number of opponents. Initially the enemies are anonymous thugs, but proceeding in the story (because yes, there is a story underneath, although it appears at least smoky and unrelated to ~Dark Reign~) here come dangerous guys like Venom, the Juggernaut, Doctor Doom and others Still. Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign mixes puzzle elements and Marvel characters in an interesting way Repulsor crystals Beyond the team connotation, which limits not exactly pleasant situations in which it seems that our opponent always and only receives ~good pieces~, the gameplay of Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign does not differ from that of the main series. It is therefore necessary to move the crystals on the board to put together series of three or more equal elements and therefore cause damage of a variable entity to the enemy. Ringing a certain number of eliminations of a certain crystal results in the loading of spectacular special moves that have their roots in the repertoire of every superhero, and which for example for Iron Man are expressed in the use of repulsor rays or other weapons of which comes with Tony Stark's armor. This type of maneuver often makes the difference between victory and defeat, adding a strategic underlay to the experience that is clearly lacking in many other puzzle games of the same type. However, it is the contour that represents an added value, even more so if you are a fan of Marvel characters, given that there are the aforementioned covers, experience levels, powers to unlock and so on, all through the use of two currencies (hard and normal, respectively gold coins and purple crystals) which unfortunately are released with relative parsimony. This forces players less inclined to spend money to replay entire sections to scrape together cash and gain the necessary power to be able to pass that particular mission and continue the story. The alternative, of course, is to dip into your wallet and buy a few packs of coins. Having said that, we are faced with a well-packaged product, full of attractions for fans, with quality artwork but less fluid and reactive graphics than we expected, as well as low-impact sound.", "date": "2013-10-19", "grade": "7.5"}
