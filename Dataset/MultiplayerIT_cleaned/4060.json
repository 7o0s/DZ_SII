With the ambition of creating a new soulslike, the developers have given birth to a tarnished product without its own light, which pays off its very nature, due to the inevitable comparisons that arise from playing with it. Immortal: Unchained is a river that never reaches the sea, but ends up getting lost in a thousand swampy pools. But let's go in order. Mechanics An immortal warrior is awakened from his millennial cell to carry out an impossible mission: to save worlds from an immense impending catastrophe, by reactivating an ancient and powerful artifact (a large black monolith). At the beginning of the adventure the player must select its class and give it an appearance using the editor provided by the game. And here already the first problem appears, which you realize only after playing a bit: some classes are practically useless, because they make Immortal: Unchained more difficult than it already is. We are thinking in particular of the sniper class, specialized in precision weapons with a limited range (we'll talk about it again) and overall counterproductive in the most agitated moments, because they are very slow to reload. Be that as it may, even the classes based on strength, which perform better in hand-to-hand combat, are strongly disadvantaged, because fighting hand-to-hand in some situations is simply madness, since all enemies are armed with rifles, pistols and machine guns. In short, ultimately it is better to choose one of the classes specialized in traditional firearms (shotguns, machine guns, pistols and so on), perhaps keeping the more exotic classes for a second game. In addition to shooting and punching, our hero can aim, dodge, run and interact with various objects in the world. As in any self-respecting soulslike, killing enemies accumulates anim... pardon, bits that can be spent on rescue fal... monoliths to improve weapons, powers and physical characteristics. From this point of view there is nothing too different from what is seen in any soulslike. Obviously when you are killed you lose all the bits and you have to try to recover them, avoiding being killed a second time before having them grabbed again. Enemies and bosses The enemies of them belong to three broad categories: melee fighters, light infantry and heavy infantry. Obviously there are also the bosses, but those make their own story. Unfortunately, the opponents' artificial intelligence is very poor and enemies often behave in an absurd way by shooting against walls, getting stuck in the walls or ignoring us completely, perhaps after running into some invisible obstacle. The difficulty of the clashes of Immortal: Unchained is therefore given above all by two factors: the quantity of opponents present at the same time in a certain area and the fact that they have weapons with a greater range than ours. Unfortunately, the firearms of the future, at least those of the heroes, can only hit within twenty meters. Shooting from a greater distance causes bullets to ricochet off enemies or disappear into thin air. Of course, including the mechanics, you take the right distances and you understand when it is convenient or not to shoot, but it is paradoxical to be in an open space with an enemy in plain sight and not be able to hit him because he is too far away. Another problem with enemies is repetitiveness: they all have the same weak point, whether you meet them in the first or twentieth hour of the game. Basically, hitting the bright areas behind their backs hurts them more. This should theoretically favor melee clashes, but in reality we inevitably end up ignoring the weak points and focusing on the head and other sensitive areas, because when you are surrounded by enemies or you are too far away it is practically impossible to implement tactics that allow to expose them. The result is flat, repetitive combat smeared throughout the game, which pretty much always resolves into the hit, dodge, hit pattern. They don't look bad at first, but they can get really tiring in the long run. Despite the repetitiveness, the combat still offers some positive aspects, such as the possibility of dismembering enemies, which favors manual aiming over assisted aiming and adds a pinch of tactics. Immortal: Unchained's difficulty is on average high, but that's partly due to the wrong reasons: in addition to the design issues illustrated above, there's also the nasty tendency to focus on enemies that appear out of nowhere behind the hero's back, which are tolerable in controlled doses, but frustrating when you realize they've been used for the entire game. The bosses of them are dand normal enemies enlarged and made stronger. They all have different attack patterns, but overall they don't make a big impression as they are monotonous in design. To say, it was better seen in The Surge, where the bosses were few and not very inspired. Other mechanics From a technical point of view Immortal: Unchained confirms the underlying mediocrity of the entire production. The three planets where the action takes place offer a certain variety, between jungles, frozen wastes, ruins of ancient civilizations, futuristic constructions, flooded caves and more, but in general there is nothing to cry out for a miracle. The best ideas are seen in the level architectures and their construction. The level design of his follows the principles dictated by the genre. There are therefore many shortcuts that allow you to quickly return to the save points after a new area has been explored. The exploration itself is favored by the presence of many small secrets, including chests to open, power-ups to find and ancient texts with the background of the game world to read. All in the norm, but it must be said that it works quite well. Less well the bugs, that is currently there are really many. Be that as it may, at the time of writing this article Immortal: Unchained has already been updated several times and many of the biggest problems have been fixed, so we don't feel like penalizing it too much from this point of view.", "date": "2018-09-14", "grade": "5.0"}
