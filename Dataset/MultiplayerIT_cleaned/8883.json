{"name": "Old School al potere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96428-shinobi-old-school-al-potere.html", "text": "There was a time, older gamers will no doubt remember, when video games were difficult, very difficult: the goal of a typical product of the 80s and the beginning of the following decade was not to tell a story or provide a whole series of settings to explore and ~experience~, but test reflexes, skills and coordination - sometimes even physical endurance! - of the player, who tended to achieve the highest score rather than completing the various levels. For this reason, together with the incredible success that the arcades enjoyed in those years and the much more marked sectoral accent than today that the videogame phenomenon presented, a typical game of that era showed off an average difficulty that is difficult to detect among today's standards , today that this industry is aimed at much wider markets, that the contaminations with other media are massive and that, in general, public tastes have changed. Of course, the overbearing entry into the scene of online gaming has again partially shuffled the cards, nevertheless it is always nice for the older of us to come across a title that seems to have the intention of taking us back in time. Back to the Future It was in this climate that SEGA's first Shinobi entered fully, in 1987 on the immortal System 16 bar card: over the course of almost 25 years between conversions, more or less direct sequels, spin-offs and various versions of the same game dedicated to different countries and radically modified from each other, of games that tell the story of the Musashi family, one can almost lose count. But what adventures does this family of Shadow Warriors have? Never anything particularly striking to tell the truth, and even in this new Shinobi for 3DS, where we embody Jiro Musashi, father of Joe protagonist of the first and many other episodes, it's not like we are faced with an exceptional plot: it all begins in feudal Japan, when the village of the Oboro clan, where Jiro lives and trains, is attacked by an enemy clan evidently implicated in some way with some strange techno-magical devilry, if it is true as it is true that after the assault the good Jiro finds himself catapulted into Japan a thousand years later, grappling with the same clan of villains this time however armed with the most futuristic technologies, and implicated in a strange and confusing story of genetic abominations, evil corporations, folklore Japanese and so on. However, the plot is only a pretext to catapult us into the action as soon as possible, as required by the noblest arcade tradition: after a series of three-dimensional digressions on PlayStation 2, Shinobi returns to its origins with a classic 2D Action Platform setting, in which the good Jiro through a whole series of (not many, but some very extensive) levels will have to face hordes of enemies of the most varied types, overcome obstacles of various kinds, juggle between platforms arranged at the human limit and face the inevitable end and sometimes even mid-level bosses. In this chaos of situations, Jiro has a vast arsenal of moves at his disposal: he can unleash his katana as well as throw up to five kunai (throwing daggers most likely derived from a simple gardening tool) consecutively before having to wait for him to recharge; he can double jump to reach the higher platforms, and in the same double jump use the aforementioned weapons in a more devastating way; again, he can jump on vertical walls, take advantage of the slide to sneak into the lower tunnels and sports a grappling hook that allows him to reach suspended ceilings and ropes, on which he can then climb or advance using his arms. And then again, four different types of magic, which also need to be recharged after each use, and the fundamental parry, assigned to the R backbone, without mastering which (it requires perfect timing and furthermore the key to which it is assigned can create small problems especially at the beginning) it doesn't go very far. The levels are generally well structured, with a good balance between combat and platform phases and with a minimum of exploration allowed by the considerable horizontal and vertical extension of some of them, and necessary if you want to collect the large number of power ups and bonuses present as well as finding the secret areas where the Skull Coins are located, which are essential to really complete the whole thing. Although enemies with different and gradually more dangerous abilities are introduced at regular intervals, towards the middle of the game a certain repetitiveness begins to be felt, which however fortunately never becomes heavy, first of all thanks to the high difficulty, and thenvia the clashes with the bosses, all devised in a very ingenious way. Finally, it is worth mentioning some phases on board the most varied vehicles, from medieval horses to futuristic jets, in a sort of subjective where 3D manages to give a great show: these are the ~intervals~ useful for breaking the rhythm, basically short and fast but not easy at all, where, however, it is enough to memorize the patterns of the enemies and the sequence of the obstacles. Among these phases, even one that takes advantage of the console's motion sensors, unfortunately probably the least successful. A difficult life We were saying about the difficulty: if at the easiest level of the four available, Shinobi allows you in a relatively easy way (and mind that ~relatively~) to enjoy the story and settings with infinite lives and continuous, check points scattered throughout the levels and a great resistance of the protagonist, already from the second onwards the game shamelessly spews all its hostileness at you, clearly limiting the benefits, starting from the autosaves, and starting the hordes of enemies that you will find yourself facing to get really hurt, gradually up to the fourth where already taking a few steps in the village of Oboro will make you proud to be a gamer. But then, let's say it for the less experienced, what sense can a title have that seems to want to prevent you from being faced at all costs? The answer lies in the complex scoring system, which, in short, provides you with a large number of various multipliers for successful actions, but which then punishes for every hit suffered, every life lost and also for every magic used . The rating as a result of the score varies in real time and is always viewable on the lower screen, and we sincerely wonder after so many hours of testing how many players exist in the world capable of obtaining the highest marks in each level at the highest degree of difficulty. This is the meaning of Shinobi, the feature that will make many users fall in love with it while many others will hate it at first glance; this very heavy emphasis on the ~old school~ philosophy of video games is also found in the StreetPass Challenges, a series of levels that recall Metal Gear Solid's VR Missions for settings whose scores you can then compare with other owners, in which you also receive a single hit from an enemy will prematurely end your life. In exchange for the total dedication that you decide to grant him, Shinobi is extremely munificent of satisfactions, apart from the natural one that always derives from a won challenge: a system of rewards and objectives similar to the Achievements that are popular on HD consoles and a whole series of bonuses, from news on the entire series to sketches of the game's development, from beautiful music to listen to whenever you want to unlockable cut scenes, will be the tasty rewards for those who successfully embark on the path of ninjutsu. The 3D effect In Shinobi the stereoscopic 3D doesn't do anything particularly surprising, except to give greater depth to the spectacular backgrounds of the first levels; although here and there we encounter elements whose position in theory it would be important to judge with respect to the game plane, we can say that the 3D contribution to the gameplay is nil. Slightly more complex for the phases with the camera from behind, which benefit from the effect to a greater extent; however, in the level to be controlled via the tilt sensor, it must be absolutely deactivated. It also tends to decrease fluidity slightly, but certainly not in a way that forces you to give it up. American Japan It must be said that the difficulty level is also ~artificially~ inflated first of all by a not always very precise collision detection, and then also by the 3DS itself and its small size: the control system, especially as regards parry, is penalizing for normal-sized hands, and moreover the programmers' choice to frame large portions of the level and consequently make the characters and weapons very small, on a screen that is not very generous, makes it more difficult to identify the important elements. Which leads us directly to talk about the graphic aspect: the first impact with Shinobi is sensational, there are many elements on the screen starting from the models of Jiro and his enemies. The protagonist in particular amazes for the amount of animations he shows off, from those resulting from the wide arsenal of moves at his disposal up to the movement of the red scarf taken from the episodes on PlayStation 2, and for their fluidity which is also found in the less numerous animations of opposing ninjas; the speed of the action helps create a beautiful ssensation of ~choreographed~ action, made even more effective by the effects of weapons and blows. In the first levels, then, even the settings are exquisite, very rich in details, colors, polygons and, also, various and spectacular effects: the technique used is essentially a cel shading that alternates very faint contours with decidedly clear ones, and creates an atmosphere halfway between modern American cartoon and traditional Japanese ukiyo-e, an atmosphere that gives its best in those cut scenes that exploit the polygonal engine; other films, on the other hand, are semi-animated and recall even more the prints known in the West thanks to the work of Katsushita Hokusai. Unfortunately, however, the backdrops that are so vivid in the first levels gradually fade away until they are almost completely absent in the final stages, and it doesn't seem like a justification for the fact that the subsequent futuristic setting actually requires darker and duller tones, just as it doesn't gains its fluidity. On the other hand, we can speak almost exclusively well of the musical front, with traditional Japanese instruments mixed with modern techno/electronics: the results are good even if in more than one passage, perhaps thanks to the American origins of the development team, it almost seems to listen to the soundtrack of a western rather than a game related to the history of the Land of the Rising Sun.", "date": "2011-12-06", "grade": "8.0"}
