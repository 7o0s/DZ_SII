Anyone who has spent the last two years under the Firaxis headquarters waving flags with the logo of the unforgettable fourth chapter drawn will not welcome the first real expansion released after a large number of DLCs: despite the two main additions, Religion and Espionage, watch to the past and suggest an evolution that can lead to an experience similar to that offered by Civ IV, the game remains firmly anchored to the systems developed through the addition of hexagonal boxes, the profound changes to military operations and introductions such as the Cities State. Victorian scenery tech tree In short, the setting remains, but new options are added and some long-discussed problems are fixed, leaving others uncovered. Assuming therefore that Civ V must have been liked even if only to take its purchase into consideration, it remains to evaluate the specific weight of the novelties and understand if all together they are worth the thirty euros necessary to take home the (virtual) package. Spies and men of God Set up a game, choose one of nine new civilizations - Huns, Celts, Swedes, Ethiopians, Byzantines, Carthaginians, Austrians, Mayans and Dutch - and launch the map, the most important novelty that distinguishes Civilization V: Gods & Kings is undoubtedly the introduction of the Faith resource. Accumulated in sufficient quantity allows you to unlock a Pantheon, therefore the first Great Prophet which leads to the creation of a new Religion: the symbols and names are taken from really existing creeds but do not imply anything specific and can be customized as desired, before leaving the player at the mercy of choosing a couple of bonuses. Depending on how you want to proceed, these, which can be selected a second and a third time, affect the accumulation of Faith or the other values necessary to prosper. Religion offers interesting bonuses and diplomatic options The result is that one has the feeling that the Religion system is subordinate to the others, not having specific purposes and not always having a decisive impact unless it is linked to the typical peculiarities of some civilizations, such as the Mayas and the Byzantines. This does not imply that it is not a valid mechanic, indeed the need to study the presence of followers in each city and therefore the potential in terms of cult expansion adds a new layer of depth that also passes through the management of units such as the Missionaries , the Inquisitors and the Great Prophets. The former are spent to spread the faith, the latter to remove that of others while the Great Prophets combine the two effects, converting the inhabitants of the cities on which they are sacrificed. Among other things, Religion is one of the strong reasons for interacting with the City-States which now relate to us in a more varied way, even if not yet complex. The other reason why the small neutral countries acquire thickness is the return of the spies: once the Renaissance period is reached, one is equipped with a first unit that can be managed, like all those acquired later, only through the appropriate interface. The use of the spies is clear and immediate Spies can direct the election of a City State, so as to increase goodwill towards us and ensure that these friendships are converted into goods that otherwise we would have to pay or earn hard. However, they can also be sent inside the centers of other civilizations, to discover any plans against us or steal scientific progress. However, if Religion adds an element of challenge, Espionage cannot be said to engage in who knows what reflections. It seems more like he has been put at the service of Diplomacy to improve it, although this still suffers from a not brilliant artificial intelligence. There was great anticipation for the two returns just described and the result of what was done depends on expectations: they don't revolutionize the game, which on the other hand remains as fun and engaging as at the beginning, only richer in new options and variety. Finally, it is interesting how Religion and Espionage alternate over the ages in terms of strategic importance: the former loses value in diplomatic relations as it progresses in modernity, while spies gain experience by becoming more and more efficient. CivPunk Firaxis has made every effort not to limit the scope of Civilization V: Gods & Kings to just major changes, adding and revising where necessary. Naval and land units can overlap The twenty-seven new units enrich specific historical periods, such as the first half of the 1900s and in particular the Prima GuerWorld ra, giving further depth to the civilizations and the three unpublished scenarios. In particular the Victorian one, Empire of the Smoldering Skies, is really successful, it has a Steam Punk-themed tech tree and civilization as well as interesting starting and victory conditions. Missionaries and Inquisitors: the armed wing of the Faith The remaining two, The Fall of Rome and Towards the Renaissance, enjoy less imagination but are just as well studied and replayable. The clashes take advantage of a rebalancing of the life points of the units, which now last longer in battle and favor the creation of more reasoned situations by giving an important assist to the artificial intelligence, which during the fights is ultimately convincing as in Civ V she hadn't managed to be yet. Among the unpublished units there is no shortage of gatlings And naval operations have also been revised in this sense, with a boat and a unit moving by sea free to overlap on the same square. There is enough material to convince those who had abandoned the title to come back to it, with the usual result of spending hours and hours almost without paying attention deciding seemingly insignificant moves and decisive strategies for winning the game. In this the formula works properly, accompanied after two years by a pleasant visual component, now even more varied thanks to unpublished characters, units, resources and boxes.", "date": "2012-06-21", "grade": "8.0"}
