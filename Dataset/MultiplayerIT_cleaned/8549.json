{"name": "Pionieri spaziotemporali", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102652-a-valley-without-wind-pionieri-spaziotemporali.html", "text": "A Valley Without Wind undoubtedly belongs to the subgenre defined (with an inelegant term) ~Metroidvania~. Apparently it is a two-dimensional action platformer, with the character reminiscent of the historical glories of the genre, but it is enriched by exploration, various RPG elements, the day / night cycle, crafting and the now inevitable possibility to play into multiplayer. Also, like many modern titles, this one relies on off-the-shelf, Terraria-style procedural worlds that can be saved and reloaded at will. The land cannot be destroyed or excavated, but there is no shortage of platforms to place, trees to cut down, objects to build and an almost infinite exploration. In essence we are faced with a mix between a dungeon crawler and a platformer, with the story narrated by characters and inscriptions scattered across increasingly vast and complex areas. The RPG component provides crystals to enhance life, mana and attack and a varied set of skills dedicated to both combat and movement. The latter are managed in a rather intuitive way with the mouse pointer to be used to target enemies and the double click of the arrow keys which activates the very useful sprint. In addition, the title also includes the possibility of playing exclusively via keyboard or gamepad with a more action and old-fashioned feeling. The attacks obviously have different ranges and effects and, with the right amount of tactics and an eye to the possibilities guaranteed by the surrounding environment and movement, allow you to face all threats which also include bosses of titanic dimensions. The combat is certainly not innovative or particularly calibrated, but it is functional and often fun and, as the difficulty increases, it is also capable of offering the player a fair challenge. Challenge that requires items and potions and that includes a varied set of objectives explained and listed with a comfortable hideaway interface. To go where no one has gone before The missions include, in addition to the obvious destruction of unusual amounts of enemies, also useful objects to find and build. Objects that are not always easy to recover, despite the exhaustive information provided by the title, but essential to face the challenges of a world completely transfigured by a cataclysm that has subverted the rules of space and time. In the title, in fact, futuristic areas flank prehistoric valleys and every place is invaded by dangerous abominations, hit by storms that make it difficult to move and scourged by waves of frost capable of killing even a hero protected by mystical energies. Our aim in this chaos is to survive and go where no one, not even those with magical powers, has gone before. Basically we find ourselves being settlers, pioneers of an unknown land, Environ, which is procedurally generated for playful needs and for this very reason always reserves that surprise capable of making sense of the exhausting exploration sessions. Fortunately, in addition to the dozens of suggestions engraved everywhere or provided by the tooltips, the title gives us a large map enriched by clear and recognizable indicators. An invaluable resource that simultaneously displays the room you are in and the entire dungeon you have entered. Each door then has a white icon that turns green once the room has been visited and this detail, when buildings and caves become real labyrinths, is essential for finding your way out. In essence A Valley of Wind, like many indie action RPGs that are satisfied with the side view, is a much deeper game than it may initially appear. A title that offers extreme satisfaction provided, however, to digest a particular graphic sector. In fact, this is composed of elements that are not very amalgamated and characterized by a fluctuating quality to say the least. Stylistically valid structures contrast with shapeless patches of colour, white lawns that look like aged fur coats and giant statues animated like Sicilian puppets controlled by a beginner. In addition, there are elements that are not cared for such as the general map of the world, literally unwatchable, and the movement of the character who has little physicality and has to be satisfied with a few simple animations. In part the above depends on the desire to displace the player, and the anomalous aesthetic sector of the title is undoubtedly capable of alienating us with a certain effectiveness, but the shortcomings, among which the lack of variety of enemies stands out, are many and evident and the pur excellent sound sector, enriched by songs with a vintage flavor of good quality, is certainly not enough to support everything. BalancedAlthough, at least partially, we still find a relatively low price that slightly exceeds 10 euros and is also justified by an avalanche of updates that are already pouring in copious.", "date": "2012-05-08", "grade": "7.0"}
