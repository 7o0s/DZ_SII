The present Fractured Soul represents a perfect match to the summary identikit just outlined, being indie both in form and in substance: under the guise of a trivial platform with a two-dimensional structure there is in fact an ambitious project that involves the use of both displays for play. Let's see what it's about... Two screens and a soul To be honest, Fractured Soul is not the first title ever to have the intuition of basing its gameplay on the exploitation of the two screens of the Nintendo laptop at the same time: this Chronos Twins had already tried it on DS in 2007, with an experiment that it certainly cannot be said that it has gone down in history. The EnjoyUp product found its Achilles heel in the excessive effort required by the user to keep an eye on two screens at the same time, an element taken into consideration by the developers of Endgame Studios as we will see. The same cannot be said of the plot, in fact completely absent in Fractured Soul: the user takes on the role of what appears to be an anonymous space soldier, busy tackling the game levels without any particular purpose. The only thing that is made aware of is the particular ability of the silent protagonist, capable of alternating between two different dimensions represented by the two console screens. As often happens, it is much easier to understand the mechanics of a product like Fractured Soul by playing it rather than reading a description, but the facts are these: each of the two displays hosts a version of the level you are facing with more or less marked differences, and to continue it is necessary to alternate between one and the other by pressing the back button. To take a simple practical example, a door can be closed in the lower screen but open in the upper one, just as a platform can appear on one side but be absent on the other, or a staircase can only be reached in one of the two dimensions. The title does its best to make the user gradually digest this peculiar gameplay element, proposing elementary puzzles in the initial levels and gradually adding different factors to the equation, even bringing into play different forces of gravity between the scenarios represented in the two screens: in short, the ideas of Endgame Studios in terms of level design are excellent and abundant, but as we all know, a modern video game cannot rely only on good intuitions... 3D effect As explained in the review, the game develops on both console screens, with the user having to control his alter ego alternately on one or the other display: therefore, the decision by Endgame Studios not to adopt any 3D effect, which would probably have only added confusion to the gaming experience. Open fracture The experience with Fractured Soul can cause several grumbles, mainly attributable to some serious product balancing problems. We can start by talking about a level of difficulty that becomes really irritating in the more advanced stages, with the user who often finds himself forced to pay dearly for every slightest mistake, having to start over in the event of death. It would also have been appropriate to give more structure to the clashes with enemies, already present in a very limited variety and which turn out to be more of a nuisance than a complement to the gameplay, also due to the availability of only one long-range weapon in the protagonist's equipment . Then there is a purely technical problem, namely the disorientation of constantly shifting the gaze from one screen to another, an activity that in many situations is required with intolerable frequency and speed at times. Anyone willing to live with the elements listed so far will still find bread for their teeth, with a title that in relation to its price offers a considerable amount of content: the internships, present in good numbers and all characterized by a commendable level design, they constitute a good challenge and can be repeated freely by those who want to aim to find all the secrets and beat the record times. An online leaderboard system guarantees the right visibility to the best performances, and the product does not skimp on even a handful of bonus scenarios to unlock. Finally, from a technical point of view, we are in the average of the eShop offer: the polygonal graphics are pleasant even if not very inspired and tending towards repetitiveness, mbetween music and sound effects just do the homework.", "date": "2013-01-24", "grade": "6.8"}
