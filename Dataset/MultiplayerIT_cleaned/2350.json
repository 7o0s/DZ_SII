{"name": "Burnout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout_b.html", "text": "burnout vs. GT3? Burnout cannot be compared to Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec as the comparison made between an extremely arcade racing and a typically simulation title which is considered Polyphony's masterpiece would not make sense. However, there is no shortage of qualities for this game that tries to find success where others had failed. When you start the game you will notice with pleasure the presence of the much coveted 50/60hz option, often unjustly snubbed by the manufacturers. There is no introductory movie and, after the inevitable initial screens, we find ourselves in a main menu that is perhaps a little bare but very concrete. Here we have the possibility to choose to participate in a single race, to take part in a series of championships and to play with a friend of ours in the inevitable 2-player mode guaranteed by the usual split screen. In each of these sections there is a selection screen for the car to use of which we can change the color to our liking and choose the version with manual or automatic gearbox. The presence of damage on the bodies has unfortunately forced Criterion to have to do without the official license for the use of real car models, a possibility denied by the manufacturers also due to the high level of non-education of this game. However, this does not justify the absence of a larger fleet of cars, reduced to the bone despite the presence of some interesting racing cars. One rule: there are no rules There are 16 tracks available, not a few, even if some of these are simply mirrors. At least initially you will only be able to perform on three tracks that make up the first championship, by winning which you will be able to access the next set of tracks. The variety and length of the circuits is remarkable and so you will find yourself in the open countryside, on the motorway that runs alongside a metropolis or in the much more intricate streets of a hypothetical city centre. The aim of the game is obviously to win the races, which is not easy because your road will be full of obstacles to overcome (not just metaphorically). Unfortunately, your goal will be the same as three other hit-and-run hit-and-run drivers who will behave like one at every opportunity. Burnout is certainly the fastest and most frenetic driving game available for PlayStation 2 and this would not be sustainable if we did not have an effective and precise control system available. Fortunately, this is exactly the case and, despite the crazy speeds you will reach, you will be able to extricate yourself from even the most complicated situations. The only rule in Burnout is that there are no rules. So forget about the highway code and the prudence that should distinguish every motorist with common sense. The crimes at your disposal will in fact be numerous and you can for example speed at 200 km/h along a city street, cross an intersection at the same speed or, what is even more serious, go through a red light. The more skilled pilots will instead be able to choose to risk their own skin by traveling against traffic on every road and even the motorways. I think the risks run are easy to guess. Burnouts As risky as certain maneuvers may seem, they will allow you to progressively ~fill up~ the Burnout bar, located in the lower left corner of the screen. Every time you risk your safety, and that of your car, you will also contribute to the completion of the Burnout which is nothing more than a prodigious turbo that will allow you to equip your car with a massive dose of additional horsepower for a few seconds. At this point do you think that driving skillfully and taking advantage of burnout is enough to get to victory? Unfortunately this is not quite the case and you will find that the real enemy is not your opponents but the traffic that you cannot dribble too easily. In fact, it will happen very often to cause frightening accidents with one or more of the 300 different models of vehicles that characterize the traffic. Whether it's a small car or a mighty truck, the devastating effects of the collisions are underlined not only by a series of instant replays but also by the damage caused to the bodywork of your vehicle and that of the other vehicles in the accident. This is simultaneously the most spectacular element of the game but at the same time the most frustrating. The fact that the clashes are represented with great care, especially as regards the dynamics of the collisions, does not however mean that the continuous slowdowns due to accidents andthe consequent waste of time will most often lead you to an inevitable defeat. The difficulty level could have been better balanced and this is accentuated even more by the fact that the outcome of a race is most often decided by chance. In fact, you can run into accidents caused by others or, even more unnerving, cross an intersection just as a car passes, being unable to do anything to avoid the collision. The Criterion Mysteries Criterion Games as well as having developed Burnout was also the creator of the good Airblade released a few weeks ago. Both games were made thanks to the Renderware platform created by Criterion itself and also used for Grand Theft Auto 3. Unlike the other two titles just mentioned, Burnout unfortunately has some obvious graphical problems that seem rather inexplicable especially in light of the excellent work done by the same programmers with Airblade. So get ready for the reappearance of the hated aliasing and flickering, present in a fairly massive dose but still not too evident due to the remarkable speed of the game. However, the graphics are more than appreciable above all thanks to the excellent creation of the tracks, always very detailed, the convincing use of the color palette and the excellent car models although GT3 has accustomed us to other standards. The game's graphics engine is also very convincing, which practically never detaches itself from 60 frames per second. The sound, for its part, is of moderate quality both thanks to the convincing sound effects (excellent those of the impacts) and to the music that is always pressing and appropriate to the type of game. Last crossing... Despite some flaws that could have been easily eliminated, Burnout is all in all a very good driving game. Its uncontrollable speed and frenzy and the spectacularity of collisions and overtaking undoubtedly make it a game recommended for all those who love a purely arcade style of driving. Just of the arcade genre, Burnout can be considered the best interpreter, at least on PlayStation 2, together with that Rumble Racing which in my opinion deserved more attention in the past. Gran Turismo 3 remains untouchable but I think the time has come to support it with this game which will allow you to do everything that in GT3 would have been impossible even to imagine. Pros: Incredibly fast Convincing control Very spectacular crashes Good graphics... Cons: ...despite some flaws High difficulty Sometimes frustrating The successor to Need for Speed A few weeks after seeing it in action for the first time, the definitive version of that Burnout that has made a lot of noise in recent weeks arrives on PlayStation 2. At the time of the preview test, I was already favorably impressed by this new driving game by Acclaim which finally seems to bring something new to a genre that has, to say the least, been inflated on consoles. Illustrious ancestors can be attributed to Burnout, first of all Need for Speed which I don't think needs any introduction. PlayStation owners will especially remember well the first chapter of the long series of Electronic Arts racing game which at the time (at least 6 years ago) was very successful even in spite of the ~colleague~ Ridge Racer. The feature that more than others unites Need for Speed and the new game developed by Criterion is certainly the presence of traffic, which is not only a side element but which, never as in Burnout, assumes the role of protagonist and judge of the race .", "date": "2001-11-22", "grade": null}
