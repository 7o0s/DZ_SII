{"name": "Surf's Up - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/surfs-up-recensione_a.html", "text": "A blockbuster film hardly gives life to a playful masterpiece Surf's Up is the latest computer graphic animated work from Sony Pictures, this season's blockbuster film that aims to fill magazines, televisions and shopping malls with advertisements, posters and colored cartoons. In short, a mass product, just like the great successes of Shrek and the Pixar Animation films that both young and old like. Penguins are the absolute protagonists of the CG film, and evidently this bird, which in reality cannot fly, is becoming the fashionable animal par excellence given the quantity of upcoming films that see it as the protagonist. We said that penguins don't fly, it's true, but in Surf's Up they can instead maneuver a wave board with extreme dexterity and skill, and it's the first time ever that they've done it! Surf's Up can be considered to all intents and purposes a cornerstone of the genre, a seminal title that will pave the way for sports penguins A blockbuster film hardly gives life to a playful masterpiece For this reason, Surf's Up can be considered to all intents and purposes a cornerstone of the genre, a seminal title that will pave the way for sports penguins, or maybe not. Perhaps it is better to compare the Ubisoft game with famous exponents of similar genres, which basically resemble him a lot in gameplay and structure, and we immediately think of Tony Hawk as well as the previously mentioned Boog & Elliot. From the first it takes up some very simple and well-known mechanics, such as how to perform tricks on the waves, how to balance on their crest or how to jump, land and direction. Skate and Surf have a lot in common, after all. Penguins are good for the whole family Video games dedicated to films can be developed in two diametrically opposed ways. The first, taking into account the script of what was seen in the cinema and transposing the salient facts of the story into the game; the second, clearly breaking away from the narrative plot and creating a different playful product, even if set and inspired by the film. Surf's Up follows the latter direction, as opposed to most of its similars such as The Incredibles, Lord of the Rings or Madagascar. The fulcrum of Surf's Up ~The King of the Waves~, this is the title that suggests a lot, is to tame the ocean and its waves by managing to score goals during the races. There are five locations inspired by the film for a total of thirteen levels to be completed within a few hours, half an afternoon will be more than enough. Videogames dedicated to movies can be developed in two diametrically opposite ways Penguins are good for the whole family The difficulty level is deliberately calibrated downwards, to allow the main target of this title, children, to be able to have fun freely without many frills or constraints. However, the programmers have also thought of older brothers, fathers and mothers, trying to increase the sense of challenge by inserting objectives to be achieved during the competitions. If it is true that completing the game will take us very little time, it is also true that doing it by unlocking everything is much more challenging. These goals mainly include a minimum score to reach, but also passing through a certain number of bridges, and above all finding and taking all the ~idols~ of surfing that the sea is strewn with. These bonuses also allow us to unlock videos, new levels and extra images. Boredom and frustration, or healthy pajama-paja fun? The main problem of Surf's Up is certainly the monothematic nature of the game action. All levels are tackled with the same repetitiveness, i.e. by performing tricks, passing under bridges and looking for idols, with the only variation on the theme represented by the ~scenography~ of the level, which changes from time to time. We go from tropical storms to snow-capped glaciers, to torrential rains and the open ocean, but the essence is that the game is repetitive and chasing its tail. The same evolutions are absolutely few, and differ from the key pressed: A for the simple ones, B for the complex ones and Y for the special ones. The right analog button completes the picture which allows you to rotate the board on yourself in freestyle. Once you get on the crest of the wave it is possible to grind, just like in skateboarding, balancing the weight of the penguin left and right with a special bar (that Tony Hawk lovers certainly know). The main problem of Surf's Up is certainly the monothematic nature of the game action Boredom and frustration, or healthy pajama-paja fun? Scattered around the levels there are also power-ups, or objects that allow us to increase the boost, the levelor energy (needed to perform high-level tricks) and the hourglass that momentarily freezes the remaining time. There are also points multipliers scattered everywhere that allow us to put a nice 2x, 4x or 5x next to the score obtained for the next jump: once you learn how to use it, scoring will become child's play. As you progress, new characters are unlocked, for a total of ten, including the cute Elliot moose. Each of them has a particular style and performs the movements in a different way, even if with the same keys and with the same mechanics: for this reason the choice of one or the other, in the end, is purely stylistic and ~of personal sympathy. It is also possible to customize the tables with designs, decorations and colours. How would we like a surfing penguin game? First of all, it's cheap! Surf's Up should be taken for what it is, and not for what a penguin game should be in our most private dreams. It is essentially a home entertainment title for a very young age group, and in this perspective both the gameplay and the graphics / audio section should be judged. The latter seemed to us very accurate, fresh and colorful, in perfect harmony with the type of game. The various locations of the film are faithfully reproduced and variety is their strong point. The environmental effects such as waves, thunder, lightning, rain and sun, are very accurate and boast a decent number of polygons and effects. Perhaps water, certainly not a negligible element in a surf game, could have been improved by adding any sort of reflection or transparency, but anyhow, Surf's Up is pleasing to the eye, fluid and very detailed. Surf's Up is pleasing to the eye, fluid and very detailed How would we like a surfing penguin game? First of all, it's cheap! Even the audio is well cared for, with the presence of all the original voices of the voice actor cast, completely in Italian, fresh and cheerful music and songs. The multiplayer component of Surf's Up is unfortunately limited to an offline split screen for up to four players, while Xbox Live is only used for some score charts to be published online. Surf's Up represents, by its very nature, a sort of ~mini game~, which many would see well published on a platform such as Xbox Live Arcade with success; its physical publication perhaps raises some perplexities, even if the cover price will be significantly lower than what we are used to seeing on news Surf's Up is available for PC, PS2, PS3, Wii, DS, GBA and 360. The tested version is the one for Xbox 360. Goals 360 Surf's Up, like the recent Boog & Elliot also from Ubisoft, is an excellent opportunity to reinvigorate your gamerscore that has been stopped for too long. The game ends in a few hours, which allow us to earn most of the 1000 points up for grabs, the classics of every Xbox 360 game. It won't take much effort to get them, as it will be enough to complete all 13 available tracks located in the 5 game levels. However, some objectives will be more difficult, such as what it would take to unlock all the available surfs, but they can still be achieved in a very short time. One of the simplest games ever, from this point of view (but not only). Comment Surf's Up certainly has the courage to detach itself from the plot of the film that inspired it, representing a very valid entertainment product for the little ones. It's a simple game, and in its hypnotic and childish repetitiveness it bases a gameplay within everyone's reach that knows how to amuse the family. The objectives of each race make it a little more difficult to complete, but what is basically missing is a certain variety of actions that can be performed. Graphically it is very pleasant, simple as its playability but nice, as well as the audio. Too bad for the lack of full Xbox Live support, used only for scoreboards; multiplayer is relegated to an offline split screen. Ultimately, for what it tries to offer, an honest game. Pros: Cheerful and colorful graphics For the whole family Audio Cons: Very simple and repetitive Completes in no time No online multiplayer support For some strange and unknown market moves, sometimes, the logos of arch-rival companies such as Microsoft and Sony can head next to each other on the box of a video game, scorched land of confrontation between the two bitter enemies of the last two generations of consoles. Well, Surf's Up is yet another tie-in inspired by a cartoon, produced precisely by the cinema ~section~ of the same Playstation parent company, which however sees the light on all formats, startingfrom PS2, via Nintendo with GBA, DS and Wii, finally arriving on Xbox 360 branded boxes. The author of the nice videogame cross-over is Ubisoft, now at ease in these transpositions after the recent Boog & Elliot. However, these market oddities are not rare pearls, just think of Microsoft itself which periodically publishes some of its games on the Nintendo platform par excellence, or Nintendo DS. That said, what we want to see is the actual quality of Surf's Up, starting from the assumption that, unfortunately, history teaches us that very few products inspired by cinematographic films manage to get noticed for their quality.", "date": "2007-09-27", "grade": null}
