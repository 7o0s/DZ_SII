You spend your days in a gloomy office of a sad multinational company always doing the same job. You don't lift your head from your desk for hours and hours, your colleagues are at least apathetic and you don't seem to have any real existential outlet. You're just a cog in an inhuman machine where you count for nothing. You feel like a prisoner of limbo with no way out. Except that your grandfather bequeathed you a farm, located in a place called Stardew Valley. How do you run a farm? Who knows; but the prospect of being able to change the air, in every sense, is a siren you can't say no to. So you quit your job and leave, not really knowing what to accomplish. Arrived on the spot you are greeted by some of the locals, who immediately prove to be benevolent towards you. A few polite chats, the customary greetings with the promise to visit them in the village (a place with a suggestive name: Pelican Town), so you stay alone inside your new home. It's time to look around. The interior is not bad and has everything you need for comfortable living. The outside, however, is a disaster. The land is full of weeds and stones and the crops of the past are now a vague memory. Not even the shadow of animals, as well as agricultural structures. Really everything is missing. In short, there is a lot of work to be done to get the farm back in business, but, thinking about what you have left, you don't mind it one bit. This, broadly speaking, is the story behind Stardew Valley, an incredibly successful title that already sells well over two hundred and fifty thousand copies on Steam alone, despite having appeared out of nowhere. In reality, this is not quite the case, given that the developer (the name ConcernedApe actually hides only one person) and the publisher have taken advantage of social networks to make the game known a little before launch. Of course, they didn't even imagine it would be so successful! We have reviewed Stardew Valley, one of the PC surprises of the last period Love for the earth In fact, one wonders why no one ever thought of trying the Harvest Moon formula on PC. In truth there have been some attempts, but they have been very timid and made by teams who have looked more to the silly Farmville than to the beautiful Marvelous series. Marvelous itself never ported Harvest Moon to PC. He probably thought they were more suitable for portable consoles, given the kind of content offered. Of course, if they had looked at the PC market with a minimum of attention, they would have discovered that titles like Farming Simulator, which deals with the world of agriculture from a more simulative point of view, always sell very well. They would also discover that with a minimum of effort they could embrace the Minecraft genre, that is, introduce an advanced crafting system into their formula, affecting literally millions of users. Here, basically Stardew Valley could have made it themselves, because, although the idea of playing a farmer in a video game can make many people smile, the facts show that the public's interest in agricultural activities exists and is really big. After all, despite the fact that some peasants are always ready to offend the work of farmers, we are talking about the economic activity that more than any other has guaranteed human beings to survive over the millennia. Where there is agriculture there is progress, even if many tend to forget this. Harvestdew Valley of the Moon But we were talking about Harvest Moon. Let's face it without hypocrisy: Stardew Valley is largely a clone of the Marvelous series. It is in the basic theme that characterizes it (escape from everyday life to find the essence of life in the earth), it is in the setting and it is in many of the activities that can be performed in the game. Telling us that before we can cultivate we need to use a pickaxe to remove stones, an ax to remove roots, a sickle to cut weeds and therefore we need to till the ground, plant the seeds and water them, then giving them time to grow , we seem to speak indifferently of both titles. The graphic setting is also very similar: Stardew Valley is seen from above and offers pixel art graphics that are very reminiscent of the style of classic Japanese role-playing games, widely used in independent productions (more on that later). In short, it is fair to say that ConcernedApe was heavily inspired by the Harvest Moon for his game, as many critics point out, but once you understand this, the solitary developer must also be recognized for having added a lot, creating something that, although not definable cs original, it has its own personality. Right from the start, in fact, we are left much freer than what happens in the title of Marvelous. Basically, three limits are placed on us in the work: endurance, time and resources. Resistance measures the tiredness of the protagonist: the farmer's work is beautiful, but it is tiring and after a few hours you have to rest if you don't want to collapse. Time is self-explanatory: the days go by quickly and when evening comes you have to go to sleep to rest and, above all, to favor the cycle of nature. The next morning we will discover that the seeds have become seedlings and, as the days go by, the seedlings will grow and bear fruit. Finally, resources are the raw materials needed to make anything. If we want to build a fence we need wood, if we want to improve our house other resources, and so on. These factors removed, Stardew Valley leaves us free to spend our time as we see fit. Freedom In fact, the initial freedom almost risks being unsettling. The tutorial doesn't explain much and it's a bit difficult to understand all the possibilities offered. That is, what needs to be done for the farm is clear, but the many accessory activities that form the background to the whole are less so, such as the development of interpersonal relationships with the inhabitants of Pelican Town, including the possibility of courting some of them. However, it doesn't take much to understand that you are faced with a much more multifaceted title than it seems. In the meantime, however, it is time to return to the farm. To survive you have to produce and to produce you have to work. Soon that disaster field that we had found at the start of the game will become a jewel of agricultural production, capable of supporting us economically and welcoming various activities, such as small livestock farms. If desired, we can also go and extract raw materials from the mine, with which to build objects and start other activities. The more we follow a certain trend, the more skilled we will become by unlocking new projects to build equipment and advanced objects, from which we will derive the greatest profits. In fact, selling very little fruit raw materials and it is better to devote yourself to crafts or the production of products, such as honey, jams and more. The possibilities are so many, and quite frankly we'd be lying that we've explored them all. But the beauty of Stardew Valley is also this, namely that its apparent simplicity actually hides a complex title that keeps you busy for many hours and that the more it reveals itself, the more it makes it clear that what we are implementing is only one of the many possible ways of evolve the farm and that each activity is challenging in its own way. There is no shortage of mysteries either: by exploring the map you also come into contact with closed areas that must be unlocked in some way, but the game is careful not to tell us how. We have to find out for ourselves, although, like everything else, it's not essential to do so. We are under no obligation to exhaust all content. Stories As we mentioned, in addition to the economic aspect, Stardrew Valley offers an entire country to get to know. Also in this case we must not be deceived by appearances, because the inhabitants of Pelican Town are much more interesting to know than they seem. If at a superficial glance they seem only the typical inhabitants of a Japanese role-playing game town, getting to know them better we discover that they all have interesting stories to tell us and to make us live. Exploring and making friends with people, you come across betrayals, affairs, enmities, romantic stories, other very sad and so on. It almost seems like a game within a game, with its own precise progression: initially we won't be able to enter anyone's house (except in a tramp's tent), but as we become familiar with the locals we will be well-liked and will have greater freedom of movement, which will translate into the possibility to get more in touch with everyone's life. Here too the inspiration is evident: there is a bit of Harvest Moon, but also a lot of Animal Crossing, albeit with one notable difference: the stories of Stardrew Valley are much more true. Where in the Marvelous and Nintendo titles there is great attention to keeping the tones of the stories of the characters very ~clean~, probably because they are designed for a very young audience, in the work of ConcernedApe they go much more freely and the lives of the inhabitants of Pelican Town are more likely. There is love, there is sex, there are grievances, there is poverty; in short, there are all those aspects that are usually found in a human community. There is no doubt that the pupil has surpassed his teachers. However, the stylistic aspect is less successful. egFor goodness sake, we realize that we are dealing with the work of a single person, however the graphics, despite the intelligent use of colors, recall too much the standard assets of RPG Maker, ending up holding back the overall appeal a bit. The game's pixel art does some good things, but others lack personality. Even the sound side is really anonymous and devoid of bite. Here, if we were to indicate where to invest for a sequel we would have no doubts: in the artistic direction. With a more distinctive overall style, Stardew Valley could take off and really start looking down on the titles that inspired it.", "date": "2016-03-07", "grade": "8.5"}
