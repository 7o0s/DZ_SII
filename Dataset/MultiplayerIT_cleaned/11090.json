{"name": "Midnight Club: Los Angeles - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-club-los-angeles-recensione.html", "text": "The reproduction of the city of Los Angeles is not - for obvious reasons - perfect, but it has been scaled down to a smaller size by cutting and eliminating superfluous streets and neighborhoods. The main roads have been maintained, such as Santa Monica Boulevard, the motorway junctions and the streets of the downtown, the city center surrounded by skyscrapers. Reproducing every inch of the entire metropolis would not only have been excessively expensive in terms of work and data storage on disk, but probably also boring to play. The city is in fact made up, in reality, of many suburban residential blocks, which are located between the ocean and the Hollywood hills: all the same, geometric, square, absolutely boring. Thankfully, Midnight Club reproduces all the playing area in a smart and sensible way. The map is made up of hundreds of square kilometers of asphalt that can be traveled at high speed, but above all the city is full of shortcuts and secret alleys to discover, which always come in handy during the races to cut off our opponents. The map is made up of hundreds of square kilometers of asphalt that can be driven on at high speeds Thanks to the GPS it is always possible to call up the points of greatest interest, set new ones and trace the road ahead to reach each objective of the story mode. By pressing the back button, the camera takes off, ending up in the clouds and giving us a satellite view that takes your breath away as detailed and well reproduced. Similar sensations, it must be said, are not entirely new or unpublished as they are already proposed in similar titles such as the now old Test Drive by Atari, from which the developer of Midnight Club draws inspiration many, many times for the creation of many solutions in the gameplay of your title. It is precisely to the Eden Studios game that Rockstar's new creature owes almost everything, proposing the same situations already successfully tested a few years ago with a different interpretation. Between fiction and reality, the right compromise is sought Midnight Club is a huge sandbox, a huge space within which we are free to manage our raids, which allows us to follow the story, face challenges, create new ones or participate in online tournaments against other players, via PSN or Xbox Live . It is possible to follow the main track, given by short interlude cut-scenes excellently recited and dubbed, or disregard the fate of the protagonist (the usual handsome in full Fast and Furious style) and compete in series all the challenges that the CPU offers us , choosing from a vastness of tracks and courses enviable by any racing game. Yeah, because Midnight is basically a driving game, not a GTA clone. The first feeling with your car is not the best, due to a general feeling of heaviness of the vehicle and slow reactions to our commands. Midnight Club is a huge sandbox, or a huge space within which we are free to manage our raids But don't worry: luckily the driveability of each car is very different from one another, and each one has its own very strong and peculiar characterization from all points of view. Proceeding with the game and earning money we quickly access more powerful and performing cars, with which finally those old sensations of poor feeling with the vehicle disappear, giving way to greater driving fun. It is also true that some defects in the control system still remain. For example, it is very difficult to countersteer, and cars seem to travel on a central and immovable virtual track from the center of the screen, effectively limiting the control and freedom we have over it. The driving style has obviously been researched to find the right middle ground between arcade (like Burnout) and a simulation and we can say that the right compromise has been found, even if something is still missing to reach a balance capable of giving full satisfaction in every moment of the game. Pimp my Ride! The events available in Midnight Club are very varied and always different, ranging from time trials to races to delivery missions. It's hard to get bored, with such a diverse amount of actions to do. Not to mention the possibility of buying spare parts and accessories for our racing car, which in a short time undergoes a transformation worthy of Pimp My Ride. Spoilers, mufflers, neon lights and decals are available in large quantities to allow us to customize our dream car to the max. The races are started in various ways: by going to the starting points, by coming ingagged by an adversary, or by provoking a driver with our dazzling headlights. There is also an online tournament mode, but for the moment it seems not yet active and available. These are probably tournaments organized directly by the developer that will be made available in the future. It is also possible to switch to photo mode at any time, which allows us to take unforgettable postcards of the landscape, sort them into a special album and share them with all the other users of the game thanks to the automatic upload on the web page dedicated to this service. Ailerons, mufflers, neon lights and tattoos are available in large quantities Pimp my Ride! Aside from races and photos, life in Los Angeles isn't all that free and libertine, as the streets are constantly patrolled by city police cars. Making accidents, traveling at too high a speed or performing dangerous maneuvers will activate the agents, who will thus begin to give us a ruthless chase until our capture and payment of a fine (symbolic and not at all frustrating, to tell the truth, going to influence very little on our amassed fortunes). The police cars do everything to stop us, and are equipped with a rather aggressive and effective AI that allows them to capture us with relative ease. Once taken, the story restarts from the police station and we must therefore return to where we left off a challenge or an activity. Not only the police, but generally all opponents are very difficult to deal with. After a few relatively simple games to win that serve as a tutorial, when the game begins its real challenge phase, the opposing cars become semi-impossible to beat: they go faster, but above all they already know the game map perfectly , thus managing to immediately find shortcuts or cuts. It's beautiful: a vast and detailed way In addition to the numerous offline activities offered by the single player, Midnight Club features a solid online component that allows the player to challenge friends, create classified sessions of his own tracks or compete with 15 other people. The longevity of this title is therefore guaranteed by the huge game map and the fair amount of things to do inside it. Rockstar programmers have done a great job in trying to recreate all those sensations that only a lively and pulsating city like Los Angeles could offer. The sidewalks are always full of people walking and moving with realistic animations. The streets are full of shops (of which it is possible to observe the interiors, moreover), lights, colors, but above all the traffic, managed in an extremely realistic way by the routines borrowed from GTA IV. The endless sponsorships enjoyed by the Rockstar title allow you to recreate the real logos and trademarks of famous brands visible on the streets of the city, with shops, buildings and advertising. The car models are detailed and well modeled: the lines of the bonnets are soft and sinuous, without ladders or graphic defects. Midnight Club has a solid online component Rockstar's meticulousness is all in the details: the polygonal rims, the perfectly recreated interiors (appreciable using the internal view) and the bodies are perfect and equipped with effects such as refraction of light and the surrounding environment, reflections, chrome. The city, as a whole, is fantastic and the desire to discover it all is a good adjunct to the desire to play that is established right away. Some effects could have been managed more convincingly, such as some shadows, smoke and the light of the headlights, but these are still marginal boundary elements. The musical sector is also good: every genre is well represented by classics and novelties, ranging from rock to hip-hop, passing from west coast rap to metal, thanks to a heterogeneous and well-chosen musical selection. The effects and noises are also well done, with good samples and three-dimensional in-game environmental effects. The general quality, in essence, is very high, despite the vastness of the playing area. Comment Midnight Club is a car racing game that takes place in the city of Los Angeles, through a free and explorable map as other titles have already been able to do in this Next Gen. However, Rockstar has long embraced the ~free~ philosophy, inventing made the genre and paving the way for this natural evolution of the Midnight Club saga. The solutions found in the gameplay and the ideas are therefore not surprising for their originality, but the game is still well structured and above all fun, thanks to a lively city full of things to do, races, tournaments and co machinesllect. The realization of Los Angeles is absolutely out of parameters and is worth the ticket price in itself. Some doubts remain about the excessive difficulty, some hastily created effects and a driving style that is fun but could be perfected. Pros Los Angeles is sublimely done Lots to do and see Will keep you hooked for a long time Cons AI calibrated too high Some unrealistic effects Driving model is a fair compromise, but has some issues Xbox 360 - Goals Midnight Club: Los Angeles provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to unlock. Only a few of these are achieved in a relatively short time, for example by taking a photo with the appropriate mode, as most of the objectives are taken by advancing in the story, by winning a certain number of online races or by doing special actions such as driving 80 km on two wheels (it takes days and days and days). The Rockstar title is therefore not very generous from this point of view, but uses the achievements to try to keep the player glued to his title for as long as possible.", "date": "2008-10-31", "grade": null}
