{"name": "Castlevania Anniversary Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castlevania-anniversary-collection-recensione.html", "text": "Castlevania Anniversary Collection is a collection that re-proposes the first episodes of the Japanese series, so for this review we prepared to relive the more or less clear memories we had of the various chapters of the franchise. The package includes eight games in total: Castlevania, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest and Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse for NES, Castlevania: The Adventure and Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge for Game Boy, Super Castlevania IV for Super NES, Castlevania: Bloodlines for Mega Drive and finally Kid Dracula, a spin-off for the NES never before released in the West. An interesting in-depth e-book is also added to the selection, The History of Castlevania: Book of the Crescent Moon, with interviews with historical authors, many images and information on what remains one of the most famous Konami intellectual properties ever. In short, we are talking about a collection capable of boasting a fair consistency and some options that enrich the emulation of interesting features, such as the modification of the image proportions, the presence of any frames and scanlines, as well as a quick slot saving system single that buffers the inevitable frustration of some moments, even if there is a sensationally missing option to customize the simple controls. In any case, what stands out on the horizon is once again the battle between good and evil, and in the role of the various members of the Belmont family we will have to face Dracula and his armies in increasingly complex paths, characterized by a ruthless and not at all accommodating approach, especially with regard to games from the 8-bit console era. Overview and features Castlevania Anniversary Collection is the second chapter of a trilogy that Konami has decided to publish to celebrate its fifty years, which follows the not so brilliant Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection released in May and which will see the arrival of the Contra Anniversary Collection in the summer. All in all, the intentions behind these projects appear noble and the price of 19.99 euros is adequate for the quantity of titles included in the package, but in the case of Castlevania the selection of episodes deserves a little clarification. In fact, where the original arcade was included in the first collection, this new collection finds space only for the chapters that saw the light on 8 and 16-bit systems in the period preceding the actual birth of the metroidvania, celebrated separately last year October with the launch of Castlevania Requiem: Symphony of the Night. The result is therefore a more basic and simple experience, one that tells the first steps that the franchise has taken on consoles and the ideas introduced for the occasion, which have become more sophisticated in concert with the capabilities offered by the different hardware with which the developers they had to do. The NES trilogy clearly demonstrates this, which despite all the limitations of the historic home console manages to trace a fairly clear evolution and gains its own personality with the third episode, thanks to the introduction of some new ideas (crossroads, multiple characters), free from the need to necessarily relate to the cinema version. The mechanics remain more or less the same, as does a collision detection that does not accept compromises and which at first can cause quite a bit of difficulty, but the charm of the experience is undoubted and it is replayed with pleasure. Playstation 4 trophies Castlevania Anniversary Collection includes fourteen Trophies that can be obtained by completing the individual games and the entire collection. For titles that provide for the possibility of selecting different protagonists, an achievement can be obtained for each ~path~. Shortcomings and strengths As already reported, Castlevania Anniversary Collection also includes two episodes released on Game Boy, in this case Castlevania: The Adventure and Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge, which are predictably the ones that make the least on current generation platforms. At the time, Konami had to work hard to reduce the mechanics of its action platform to the very limited capabilities of the handheld par excellence, managing to do so in a more than discreet way, but dealing with the monochrome tones and the slowness of the games in question in 2019 is not not simple at all. The approach of Super Castlevania IV is quite different, the first chapter released on the SNES in 1991 (the year after in Europe), which revolutionizes the aesthetics and gameplay of the franchise by focusing in particular on the rotations guaranteed by Mode 7, applied practically everywhere and right from the start: the drawbridge of Dracula's castle that rises again, the chain of Simon Belmont which can rotate at will and this time also be thrown vertically and diagonally, the sections in which one hooks onto handholds to overcome chasms, and so on. This and other elements make it a historical episode of great importance: the last of the ~old school~, before Rondo or Blood and the advent of Koji Igarashi with Symphony of the Night. In any case, the evolution that the series has experienced on Super Nintendo remains a path in itself, which has not contaminated the other platforms, as demonstrated by Castlevania: Bloodlines, the first and only episode released on the Mega Drive. Fast, immediate and fascinating, it presents the possibility of selecting from the beginning one of two different protagonists, John Morris and Eric Lecarde, equipped with different equipment and therefore with peculiar fighting styles. The last game in the collection, Kid Dracula, instead stands as a sort of nice easter egg, a spin-off originally released in 1990 on the NES but never distributed in the West, which we can now get to know: surprisingly fast, funny and pleasant, even with all its technical limitations.", "date": "2019-05-22", "grade": "7.0"}
