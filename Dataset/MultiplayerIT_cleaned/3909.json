{"name": "Subnautica per PS4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/subnautica-ps4-recensione.html", "text": "Subnautica was enthusiastically received at its official launch on PC last January, following a long period in Early Access on Steam. Among other things, in fact, the developers were recognized for having made the best use of the possibilities granted to them by Early Access, adding features and content to the experience without ever losing track of the situation, and indeed remaining consistent with what was initial vision of the project. We are talking about a survival game that in some respects strictly follows the trends of the genre, in others it introduces elements of welcome break, opting for a traditional and non-procedural design of the levels in order to assimilate the scenario to a significant part of the narrative sector. able to surprise and excite as you go further from the starting point, discovering new and unexpected settings. Gameplay and structure The first impact with the PlayStation 4 version of Subnautica is unfortunately not the best, given the long duration of the initial loading and an interface that does not seem to have enjoyed particular refinements over the last few months, revealing almost amateur streaks in some situations. Beyond this, however, the game has been transported to the Sony console in its entirety, adapting in a dignified way a control system evidently designed for the use of the mouse and keyboard, and inevitably slower and more cumbersome when we is found to manage its functions through the analog sticks and buttons of the DualShock 4 controller. The introductory sequence shows a spaceship adrift, about to crash on the surface of a planet that appears completely covered in water, and the protagonist of the adventure just has time to enter an escape pod before falling victim to the tremendous impact. Regaining consciousness, the man finds himself floating in his damaged pod, but still equipped with a working construction device, a medkit generator, a cargo hold, a radio that is missing some parts and hatches that can be open to dive and go in search of the resources necessary to satisfy one's primary needs (hunger, thirst, oxygen), as well as build useful tools to make the exploratory phase more practical and fruitful. We imagine that those who know survival games have already understood the circularity of a gameplay of this type, which however does not get lost in chatter and avoids the player exhausting extraction sessions on the seabed, indeed making the collection of materials, scrap and edible fish (from which to obtain both food and drinking water) very simple and intuitive. Everything we collect is analyzed and catalogued, which means that more often than not we'll find ourselves scanning the scenario by keeping an eye on the PDA which shows the components we need to make a particular device. The flow of action will soon absorb us, seasoning our comings and goings from the pod with a certain degree of habituation, especially when the obligation to return to the surface to restore oxygen supplies becomes less pressing. As happens in many other products of the genre, in Subnautica there is no tutorial nor does the game lead us by the hand in any way, therefore it will be up to us to guess what to do and how to do it, set priorities and roll up our sleeves, with a view to an experience that will, however, be able to reward our efforts with great satisfaction, taking us within about twenty hours to pass from a condition of absolute precariousness to the management of positions, vehicles, weapons and advanced instruments. It's this solid and compelling sense of progression, coupled with a 'layered' map concept, that is the best and most significant aspect of the game, and the PC to PS4 conversion process hasn't scratched those foundations. Moreover, those who wish can set up the game by completely eliminating the survival component or by emphasizing it, so as to increase the challenge. Playstation 4 trophies The eighteen Subnautica Trophies can be obtained by performing certain actions for the first time: the first dive, repairing a device, finding a place or creating certain tools. There is obviously no shortage of achievements related to free exploration and others that are unlocked only once the adventure is over. Technical realization In addition to the long initial load and some solutions that would need attention to the source, it is the not exactly irresistible performance that characterizes the Subnautica experience on PlayStation 4. The game runs on PS4 Pro at 1440p, but we would have frankly preferredI wanted a lower resolution in the face of a frame rate of 60 frames per second, given that the transition to 30 fps makes the explorative phases of the game, that is, its most intense and particular part, decidedly less engaging and evocative. There's a bit of stutter here and there, but more importantly, you experience large dips in certain situations, such as when you come out of the water to breathe again - an annoying phenomenon, which we hope will be fixed in an update. Added to this is a generally modest drawing distance, which compensates for our desire to proceed more quickly with pop-up effects, especially when we enter densely populated areas in terms of flora and fauna. The design of the creatures is valid, even there, net of some less inspired solutions, and the atmosphere of this fascinating world has remained intact, but it would have been nice to be able to count on a more incisive conversion job. Strange that an expert team like Panic Button, which on Nintendo Switch has worked almost miracles with DOOM and Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, has not been able to assert itself in this case. Nothing to say as far as the sound is concerned, however, capable in its essentiality of creating a convincing, atmospheric audio environment.", "date": "2018-12-07", "grade": "8.0"}
