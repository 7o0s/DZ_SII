{"name": "Blood & Truth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blood-truth-recensione.html", "text": "The resolution certainly can't compete with that of your latest television, and invariably wear it after a while tired, but gaming experiences such as those that you can experience with virtual reality firmly strapped on your head are absolutely worth the price of admission, the courage of dimensional jump. Take Blood & Truth for Playstation VR of which you are reading the review, for example: the game from London Studios is rather simple in gameplay, it is still a question of shooting the bad guys who appear in front of you, but it is living in the very first person what which is usually seen through a normal screen that totally changes the emotions at stake. Blood and bullets Blood & Truth is the baddest version of London Heist, an action pill included in the Sony virtual reality welcome pack entitled VR Worlds. The London Studios have poured into the project in question all the experience gained in these years spent working on the PlayStation VR, and the results can be seen, starting from the commands up to the execution of each key scene. Once again we are talking about a crime story set in London, but with a family feel: the protagonist of London Heist returns to the city for his father's funeral, but he doesn't have time to dry his tears before a rival company tries to take advantage of the void of power that came to be created to steal market shares, to the sound of threats and pistol shots. But no one must afford to treat the Marks family like this, or at least what's left of them: the two brothers together with their mother and sister try to restore order by blowing up the whole fucking neighborhood. Michelle, our sister, is good with computers, and our mother and brother are great at public relations, but the real added asset of the family will of course be us, in the role of thirty-two-year-old ex-Prt Ryan Marks. Blood & Truth is told in a very similar way to London Heist, with sequences set in the present from which explosive flashbacks explode, which would then be the various stages: Ryan Marks was in fact captured by an unidentified Agent Carson, a veteran of the US Delta Force , ready to do anything to unravel the conspiracy whose tracks he has been following for some time now. There is therefore something more than just the commercial disagreement between the various parties involved, and we will gladly let you discover this for yourself. However, know that Blood & Truth has a lot more story than even we, despite having played the game several times, would have expected. Maybe even too much? This depends on the tastes of each of us, but when the action is so well conceived there is always a bit of a desire to get back to shouldering machine guns and rifles as soon as possible, not to get lost in superfluous chatter. Luckily the cast is really well characterized, excellent in the original language and not bad in the Italian dubbed, strong above all by an acting that perhaps had never been seen of this quality in a product designed specifically for virtual reality; even the faces, as they are animated, mark a huge step forward compared to any other similar experience. Bond & Wick The purpose of London Studios, it appears even more clear once Blood & Truth is completed, is to transform us into action heroes halfway between James Bond and John Wick. Because of this, the game structure is mostly on rails, but don't take that as a bad thing because it's not. Only by having almost total control over the pace of the game and our movements can the developers guarantee an always perfect dose of adrenaline and sensational action sequences. We say ~almost totally~ because during the shootings it is possible to move between the different covers freely, such as choosing between different crossroads that will allow us to discover numerous secrets, get our hands on new hidden weapons and face certain shootings from better or worse positions based on the situation. equipment in our possession at that time. However, the movements are not teleports, given that once the button on the controller is pressed, the protagonist will move between the different positions in a completely natural way, risking being hit while remaining in full control of his arsenal, therefore being able to return the enemy's fire . The hybrid works wonders, and makes Blood & Truth an experience suitable for everyone: for those who are very familiar with motion controllers and viewers, and for those who are taking their first steps through this new dimension of electronic entertainment. After all, there is plenty of complexity: each weapon can be wielded in different ways, just as the feedback that will be drawn from it will be different, the numbersThese weapons guarantee unexpected strategic implications, it is also possible to slow down time for a few seconds in order to reload, aim, shoot and win even when our faces are covered in blood and the end is always inevitable. Seeing blood dripping at the edges of our eyes is a damn effective indicator that does not reduce vision as in normal two-dimensional games, almost making us feel the heat of the dense plasma that descends from our forehead. Weapons in hand, Blood & Truth is a true marvel, in the sensations it transmits to the player and in the precision which, provided for an optimal calibration, it manages to reach even in the most agitated phases, where other games leave the two imperfect PlayStation Move out of breath. Surprisingly, there are no big problems even when we bring the second hand under the barrel of a machine gun, for example, to increase its stability, partially covering the luminous sphere of one of the two controllers, or holding a gun with both hands. But all the commands have been conceived great and made even better: among other things, it is possible to hold two weapons at the same time without however having problems bringing your hands to your chest to take new bullets, in order to reload them. But the possible plots are many more because in the action you will happen, for example, to want to take the pistol in the left holster with your right hand, or the other way around, or get rid of both to immediately bring your hands behind your back to extract both at the same time. high caliber weapons that you can carry around. Shooting two barrels together, unloading them completely, and then pulling out a Colt to kill the last enemy with a sharp blow between the eyes is what you've seen done in millions of movies and video games, but never like today, unless you are a real gangster, you've experienced the sensations so close up, on such a scale... not realistic because then Blood & Truth has its dose of lightness that keeps it game... close up here. Let's not forget that by pressing the triangle button, it is possible to loosen the grip on the weapon to be able to turn it like a real cowboy, and that with the square button it is possible to make gestures which, if used with the right timing, will make every action more exciting. game scene. Lead silence Not even when the weapons are silent co-protagonists do the surprises end. Blood & Truth is full of collectibles that are very fun to find and in some cases hit, as it is full of small mini-games such as paper balls to put in the office basket, secret safes, interactive DJ consoles on which to pump bass, mids and treble while waves of enemies burst into the ballroom, improvised shooting ranges and the rest of the surprises that it is right not to reveal. And then there are cigars and e-cigarettes hidden everywhere, and only those who have played London Heist know how much satisfaction a virtual ~meal~ can give a real smoker. In the game there are also climbing stages, done very well and which will give a hard time to all those who have problems with heights, and sections in which to cut wires, replace fuses, pick locks. All of this of course requires the two Moves to be fully appreciated, but London Studios still wanted to implement the normal Dualshock, so as not to leave anyone out. The difference between the two control systems is substantial: with the pad, almost all the actions that require a 1:1 movement of our hands will inevitably be more abstract, and consequently less fun and immersive. After all, the Moves are also used to modify the weapons that we will unlock by finding them in action, to color them using the appropriate airbrush, or to modify their set-up in order to be more efficient in the next mission. And by the way, it takes six to eight hours to finish Blood & Truth, which is quite a lot for a PlayStation VR exclusive game; then we must consider the extras to find, the polygons to unlock on which to beat friends' times, even online, and the upcoming contents, given that London Studios has not stopped yet and counts on supporting this game as long as there are fans who will want to continue playing the role of action hero.", "date": "2019-05-28", "grade": "8.0"}
