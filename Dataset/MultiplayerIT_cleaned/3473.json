{"name": "Mutazione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mutazione-recensione.html", "text": "Mutazione is the brainchild of Nils Deneken, creative director of the small independent studio Die Gute Fabrik. In the past, the Danish team has dealt with varied titles such as the puzzle platformer Where is My Heart?, the narrative adventure Ruckblende and some party games, however the project we are going to talk about in this review seems to be the one on which the study he has reflected and worked longer over the years. Although the actual development has taken place in the last three years, the basic idea has been ~cultivated~ for over a decade. We have chosen this word not by chance, given that the story of Mutazione is somehow related to the contact of human beings with nature, with the primordial order of things and ultimately also with the spirituality that pervades all living beings . The finalization of a simple concept into a real project was made possible by public subsidies and subsequently thanks to the support of the Californian label Akupara Games, which guaranteed its arrival on PlayStation 4, iOS devices via Apple Arcade and Android. Kai and the small community of Mutazione The protagonist of this singular journey is Kai, a barely fifteen-year-old girl leaving for an adventure that will prove to be more surprising than expected. Her mother Gaia greets her on the pier and a few moments later the young woman takes off on board a small boat. During the crossing, she rereads the letter sent to her by a certain Mori, in which she is informed of the precarious health conditions of a person towards whom she and her mother still harbor old grudges. We soon discover that it is her grandfather and that the mysterious place she is headed to is an island called Mutazione. The choice of the name is not accidental, because exactly one century earlier the fall of the ~Lunar Dragon~ meteorite literally shattered that tropical paradise, decimating a large part of the population. The few survivors have been forced to live with singular mutations that have changed skin color and appearance. Precisely following these events, the inhabitants of the mainland preferred to repudiate the inhabitants of this place, which suddenly became a sort of taboo territory for fear of contact with the different. Driven by initiative and the need to survive, the small community continued its life for another two generations, shaping a sort of small self-sufficient ecosystem essentially detached from the rest of the world. Kai therefore arrives on the island to support his grandfather in the hope that he can regain his strength, but ignores that the latter actually has many other plans in store for her. Playstation 4 trophies There are only fifteen Mutation Trophies. They do not indicate precisely what must be done but must be unlocked by completing the story and exploring the game world. Dialogues, colorful settings and botanical gardens Mutazione offers a very basic interactive structure, mostly based on interactions with the few inhabitants who populate the island. The developers usually call it a ~mutant soap opera~, precisely because during the game Kai comes into contact with many small personal situations that outline the life of the characters. Typical moments of real life, clashes and sometimes misunderstandings that leave room for clarification, but at the same time also moments of healthy sharing and social cohesion. All this reveals what does not seem to have been captured by the outside world, namely that ultimately the people who live in this place apparently fallen into disgrace have not changed that much, in spite of what one might think at a casual glance. The dialogue system implemented in the game allows you to choose from time to time between two alternative answers, often referring to opposing feelings. For example, it is possible to decide to act sincerely or suddenly change the subject, remain in religious silence and let your interlocutor continue his reasoning, or still prefer an aggressive approach, even if the answers do not actually determine substantial differences in the economy of the tale. Precisely by virtue of the events that occurred a century ago, Mutazione has a biome with unique characteristics. And it is precisely from definable ~botanical~ needs that the bizarre existential journey with which Kai will inextricably bind to his grandfather and to the place that hosted him for almost forty years arises. The girl receives a unique shaman's drum as a gift, by means of which she is put in a position to play particular melodies that have the peculiarity of making her grow and prosper rapidly.are plants and shrubs. At first Kai struggles to understand the old man's plans, but faithfully carries out all of his orders. Thus, between one vicissitude and another of the journey, the player tries his hand at bringing back to life some of the uncultivated gardens found in various areas of the island. What at first sight would seem to be a mere gardening activity without construct, it will gradually reveal itself connected to a much broader design, on which the very survival of Mutazione and the future of the community that populates it depends. Also on this front the interaction is very basic and immediate: during the exploratory phases and the completion of some tasks, Kai has the opportunity to recover a wide range of seeds which can then be used for cultivation. It is up to the user to decide which vegetables to prefer in relation to the composition of the soil and the type of melody that is necessary for them to grow luxuriantly. As the story progresses, further tunes sometimes linked to human feelings such as joy, anxiety or melancholy are unlocked. Through the eight chapters that make up the story - in turn marked by the various phases of the day - Kai will make a mainly spiritual growth path, learning more about herself and the world around her.", "date": "2019-09-27", "grade": "7.0"}
