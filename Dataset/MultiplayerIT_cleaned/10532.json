{"name": "Videogioco 2.0?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70378-scribblenauts-videogioco-20.html", "text": "Welcomed like a bolt from the blue during the last E3 in Los Angeles, labeled by many magazines as ~Game of the Show~ of the American fair, idolized by entire forums, the game was seen as an epochal step forward in game design. This and much more has been the Scribblenauts phenomenon over the last few months: a small but ambitious project created by 5th Cell (authors of Drawn to Life and Lock's Quest), which practically without any advertising boost and thanks only to word of mouth from the network has become one of the most anticipated titles of this autumn season. Now that the game is in our hands, we can finally tell you whether or not you were right to believe the hype I'll take care of the solution We have talked numerous times about the peculiarity that made Scribblenauts so popular, in any case for those who were ~not very careful~ let's do a brief review. In practice, the Warner production, although it may appear to be a 2D platform with comic graphics and relative protagonist - named Maxwell -, in reality it is nothing more than a puzzle game; the aim of the game is in fact essentially to be able to obtain the star, called ~starite~, hidden in each level in order to then continue to the next. The peculiarity lies in the fact that, in practice, there is no correct ~way~ to achieve this objective; on the contrary, you can bring anything that comes to mind and deems useful to life on the screen for the purpose, simply by writing it. An innovative, original, even potentially revolutionary concept. And the numbers seem to prove the American team's ambition right, in the face of the tens of thousands of objects included in the vocabulary; in practice only real people and what is covered by copyright are admittedly absent, thus leaving a huge door open for the user's imagination. We have already given many examples, but one more certainly does not hurt; imagine a level in which the goal is to fill a basket with 3 flowers scattered here and there, and then return them to the gardener and thus obtain the starite. Too bad that a particularly aggressive bee is guarding a flower, while another is guarded on a plateau just beyond a pond populated by a piranha. This is the situation, the choice is yours on how to resolve it in a positive way. We have invoked none other than God, obviously omnipotent and therefore able to eliminate both the bee and the piranha. After that, a jetpack was enough to easily get over the pond and complete the mission. But we could have created infinite solutions, perhaps by taking up a flamethrower or overcoming all the obstacles on board an airship, and so on. And what about the level where we were asked to help a woodcutter, sadly alone next to a tree, do his job? We could have trivially made a chainsaw appear, or something like that; we actually preferred to invoke a beaver, which made it possible to achieve the same goal in a much more original way. But precisely what should push, apart from the pure taste of experimentation, to meditate on alternative ways to obtain the starite? The developers have devised a sort of report card at the end of each level, as an evaluation of the user's work; the variables are both trivially the time taken, and also the style and the par. The latter, in a similar way to golf, identifies the number of objects that have been used with respect to a pre-established quantity; obviously going under par is a positive factor, while exceeding it inevitably leads to a reduction in the points (or rather the dollars) obtained. More generally, however, there is a maximum limit of objects that can be accumulated on the screen, in all likelihood simply linked to the limits of the DS hardware; this is indicated with a sort of horizontal bar that gradually fills up until it reaches the maximum, and at that moment the only solution is to delete one of your creations making it disappear from the scene. We are all scribblenauts The main game mode is organized through a series of 10 worlds with different themed environments: from gardens to the stunt park, from wild glades to snowy peaks. Each of these can count on eleven ~puzzle~ levels and as many ~action~: the difference is that while in the former a more or less precise task is provided, in the latter you simply need to be able to reach the starite almost always already present in the screen. Obviously in the latter case the task is not as easy as it seems, given the presence of switches, levers, enemies, traps and so on. But at the end of this long description, the question obviously is: is Scribblenauts capable of mant live up to all the promises and expectations of these months? The answer, quite frankly, is no. Let me be clear, the effort of 5th Cell is a game that really deserves to be tried by anyone, at least to reward the ambition and vision that the programmers have and that they have tried to materialize. The problem is precisely that this last step, that is, the practical transposition of the premises did not take place in an optimal way. The first flaw is the control system, entirely and totally based on the touch screen, since the keys are only used to move the camera within the level. This unfortunate choice determines a decidedly annoying imprecision especially when several objects and one's own character coexist at the same time, all close to each other; on such occasions the possibility that the system interprets and executes an action other than the desired one becomes more than concrete, making everything rather frustrating especially when you have to act quickly or respond to an attack. The second problem, on the other hand, is more integrated within the game concept itself, amazing in the first levels thanks to the novelty factor, but which struggles to keep itself on the same level in the continuation of the game. Apart from the basic repetitiveness that begins to appear as one enters the adventure, it simply seems that there is a bit of an imbalance between the potential of the project and its effective expression within the real product. This is because the interactions between objects are basically reduced to a few behavioral categories, and often the idea that one has when one gives life to something then has no equal concrete reflection. All this therefore reduces the real incentive to look for truly original or collateral solutions to the proposed puzzles, also because the scoring system turns out to be too magnanimous. Therefore, the curiosity remains to see if this or that thing is present, and to appreciate its reproduction in the hilarious graphic style used, but it is inevitable that this factor will also disappear over time. A note on the level editor, which is especially interesting from the point of view of being able to share your creations with friends; at the time of writing we couldn't test this feature for obvious reasons (i.e., no friends have the game since it's not in stores yet), but we'll be sure to add a comment later.", "date": "2009-09-15", "grade": "8.0"}
