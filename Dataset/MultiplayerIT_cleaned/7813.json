{"name": "I fantastici quattro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/119102-fuse-i-fantastici-quattro.html", "text": "The Fuse project, originally called Overstrike, is not only Insomniac Games' first multiplatform title after so many years under Sony's protective wing, but proof that Electronic Arts' intentions regarding the co-op component in its products are all anything but marginal. We have already seen it partially in Dead Space 3, a sequel where cooperative grafts almost risked compromising the identity of the game. However, Fuse is a different case, being designed to be enjoyed strictly by four players, although the possibility of tackling everything solo has not been (wisely) excluded. All together passionately Fuse is a third-person shooter set in the near future and puts us in the shoes of the Overstrike 9 team, a quartet of elements from highly specialized sectors, who have preferred to go it alone as agents for an easy buck. It begins with the wiry Dalton Brooks, a mercenary who goes little for subtlety and proves to be the best weapons expert, Naya Deveraux, the scientist Isabelle Sinclair and the detective Jacob Kimble. The four are dispatched to a base in Nevada to investigate the operations of the evil Raven Corporation, the Umbrella-style antagonist of the game, unsurprisingly engaged in military experiments. The incipit is a pretext to get your hands on the technological Xenotech weapons powered by an alien substance called Fuse as soon as possible. Each of the four agents has a peculiar one that somehow reflects his personality. Dalton can use a sort of plasma shield with which he can move freely, covering his companions, but also shoot lethal beams at enemies. Naya wields a deadly singularity rifle capable of creating black holes, while Isabelle is able to crystallize opponents, and then reduce them to a thousand pieces. Last, but not as dangerous, is Jacob himself, who shows up with a deadly crossbow loaded with flaming arrows. These bizarre superweapons, selectable with the directional cross on the pad, are accompanied by the traditional paraphernalia seen in many other titles of the genre, from the assault rifle, grenades, pistols and sniper rifles. The alternation between the two types is made necessary also and above all by the shortage of available ammunition. Between serious and facetious Insomniac keeps true to its intentions, reducing the story and cutscenes to a minimum and instantly catapulting us into the action. Once we arrive at the base and after discovering the nefarious results caused by the experiments with the Fuse, with a style that is very reminiscent of Half Life 2 we must add, they take up arms and start shooting against a large group of enemies. The software house is famous for the creativity of weapons and Fuse is no exception. Brooks' shield pistol in particular, called Magshield, manages to integrate expertly into a collaborative mechanism, since, as mentioned, it is possible to cover one's companions while guaranteeing a fair offensive potential at the same time. Unfortunately, however, it is not possible to enjoy these subtleties beyond a certain level solo due to the limits of the team's artificial intelligence. In fact, the companions do not do much to help us, except for the action of bringing us back to life in case we are shot down. Don't expect much more. On the other hand, playing alone guarantees an interesting feature, the possibility of changing the main character at any time by simply pressing the Select key. A very effective idea that not only allows you to enjoy the various peculiarities of weapons, but also to get out of dangerous situations, including death. For the rest Fuse fully adapts to the trend of third-person shooters based on covers, with much more than one inspiration from the famous Gears of War. More generally, the whole game seems to retrace the classics of the genre with a certain humor, mixing them badly with more serious elements. Dalton himself recalls a comic caricature of Marcus Fenix, the way in which the characters lean against the wall recalls that of the famous ~wallguy~ from Perfect Dark Zero, on the other hand the general gloom, some suits, music and the setting seem to want to create a strange link with the aforementioned Dead Space 3. Despite this, Fuse presents itself as a title not to be taken lightly, the clashes are excited and demanding, the enemies are exaggeratedly tough, a few shots from the opposing snipers are enough to end up on the ground agonizing, same thing that goes for the equally challenging boss fights. Another Insomniac Games trademark that is faithfully maintained. Xbox 3 goals60 Fuse features 40 objectives for a total of 1000 player points, which is the standard for retail titles on Xbox 360. A fifth can be obtained by completing the main campaign, while for all the others it will be necessary to roll up one's sleeves and complete everything in the company of friends. Also remember to collect the bonus items scattered throughout the maps, and above all develop the skills of both the characters and the entire team. While you're at it, start thinking about some particularly creative kills, perhaps using the powerful Xenotech weapons. Good luck! End-of-generation gasps Fuse does not disdain a growth system for both the characters and the team very similar to an RPG, through two specific menus it is possible to acquire new perks through the experience points that can be accumulated both in the campaign and in the Echelon, the inevitable horde mode that can be tackled up to to four players, so as not to make it seem like the usual addition to lengthen the broth. In any case, the campaign has a relatively short duration, no more than seven hours, making it unattractive for the single player, while in company it is not a problem to play the levels several times at a higher difficulty to satisfy the simple desire for a challenge. Fuse's most relevant problem is the lack of a character capable of guaranteeing him a precise identity in the market, the presence of weapons is really the only noteworthy element, everything else is excessively derivative as it is devoid of particular flashes. The level design is really too schematic and predictable, the variations inserted by the programmers are not enough to give variety, such as some extremely guided platform sections, stealth phases and others in which it is necessary to transport Fuse containers to be placed before they explode. Boredom risks arriving long before the end credits, not to mention that faced alone it is also rather frustrating due to the inefficiency of artificial intelligence. Graphically the same picture is roughly presented: despite the presence of a more lively color palette than the average of the genre and the aforementioned caricature aspects, probable legacy of the origin of the project, the visual impact struggles to keep up even with the first Gears of War, a not very flattering result in 2013. To aggravate everything contributes the absolute lack of antialiasing, an omission that exacerbates the presence of ladders, and a series of surprising technical ingenuities, such as the animations of the characters slowed down in the vicinity of invisible walls. Also in this case without infamy or praise therefore, but an annoying limbo with no intention of shaking this console generation closure. A challenging and well-crafted shooter, but which fails to reach values of excellence.", "date": "2013-05-28", "grade": "7.0"}
