Also in this case it is a cartoon made with the ~stop motion~ technique, with the characters made of plasticine and equipped with a metal core, then filmed frame by frame in order to create the animations. The protagonist of the series is precisely Shaun, a shrewd and courageous sheep who often and willingly works to save the other members of his flock from potentially dangerous situations. In the Home Sheep Home 2 videogame we find him, his cousin Timmy and the huge Shirley once again engaged in solving puzzles based on physics, on pressing switches and on platforms, in a wider context than in the previous episode, released on the App Store last April. In fact, if Shaun's first adventure could be completed rather quickly and didn't boast who knows what level of challenge, for the sequel the development team changed and the focus was on much more important numbers, with thirty stages plus some bonuses and the promise to add even more via update. It also seems that the criticisms have been received, given that the small size of the touch buttons represented one of the weak points of the game and the interface has now been completely redesigned, proving to be more precise and reliable; even if, in certain situations, the possibility of switching from one sheep to another by touching it on the screen comes into obvious conflict with the buttons, and we end up selecting another character when instead we simply wanted to act on the arrows for movement. To solve the problem it would be enough to limit the switch between Shaun, Timmy and Shirley to the icons placed at the top of the screen. From caves to the city Beyond the short tutorial, there are two settings currently available in Home Sheep Home 2: the first sees the three sheep enter the subsoil, inside caves full of pitfalls and mechanisms that must be activated with cunning; the second, in some ways more oriented towards platform action, is an urban scenario made up mostly of moving vehicles. The third setting, which as mentioned will be added via update, will see Shaun and his friends wandering in space, in a context of zero gravity, and it will be very interesting to understand what kind of puzzle we will be subjected to in this situation. For the rest, gameplay and structure have not changed, there are quite a few objects to collect and at the end of each stage the performance is evaluated with the classic stars. The latter are essential to be able to unlock the next setting, but in the end a few are enough and therefore you don't need to complete all the levels of the underground scenario to be able to try the city one. Shaun is the most ~balanced~ sheep among the three at our disposal, while Timmy and Shirley are poles apart: the former is small and agile, therefore he can sneak into narrow passages and swim with relative ease; the second is big and heavy, it can move objects of a certain size but it inexorably sinks in the water. Our goal is to combine these peculiarities and exploit them where necessary, also using the various objects that we will find in the levels, so that all three sheep reach the exit in turn. The strengths of this nice tie-in have not changed, therefore, as well as the technical sector, which can boast excellent hand-drawn graphics, characterized by pleasant pastel shades, and a pleasant musical accompaniment.
