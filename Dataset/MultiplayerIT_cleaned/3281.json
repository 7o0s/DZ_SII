{"name": "Might and Magic: Chess Royale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/might-and-magic-chess-royale-recensione.html", "text": "After trying Might and Magic: Chess Royale for the review, it is easy to say that it is a carbon copy of Auto Chess, a title already widely raided by DoTA Underlods, Teamfight Tactics and all the other Chinese auto battlers that roam the various digital stores. Without starting to redo the history of this young genre, which we remember was born from a DoTA 2 mod, let's try to understand if the Ubisoft title has something more to say than direct competition or if it is completely devoid of ideas. Fundamental mechanics That the auto battler genre is difficult to renew can be understood from the difficulty with which the various development teams that engage in it manage to introduce substantial innovations. From the point of view of the main mechanics, Might and Magic: Chess Royale is almost nothing different from the other exponents of the genre: bought units from the in-game shop, you have to arrange them on the battlefield, divided into a chessboard, to make them fight automatically against opposing units. Three units of the same type can be merged into a single second-level unit. By merging instead three second-level units, a third-level unit is obtained. Each unit is linked to two signs: deploying different units with the same signs you have the so-called synergies, which provide different bonuses depending on their level and the sign itself. For example, you can have armor or damage bonuses, or you can receive extra coins at the end of winning matches. Unlike other autobattlers, in Might and Magic: Chess Royale there are no matches against CPU-driven creatures or interludes aimed at obtaining various items and equipment. Indeed, there is no equipment here at all. However, there are spells, six in total, of three different levels that are unlocked at different times in the game. Spells are not always the same and change every day. In this way it is not possible to consolidate tactics that exploit them and you have to study new ones from time to time. In general it must be said that they are the element that creates the most imbalances, because sometimes it is possible to create combos that are truly devastating. For example, we happened to be able to combine a second-level spell that stunned enemies with a third-level one that did large automatic damage to stunned enemies, spreading fear among the opponents. However, since everyone could buy those spells it is clear that their effects could in a certain sense be canceled, but it is equally evident how they had become a compulsory purchase to win... no, there were no alternative tactics capable of competing. Another small difference between Might and Magic: Chess Royale compared to other auto battlers is in the player's level growth. As in the other titles mentioned, to level up you need to accumulate experience points, which are obtained after each match, or by spending money. Typically the endgames of auto battlers require you to be of high level to win, because then you can field more units. Here things are much more nuanced, because there is a structural difference in the game which makes spending on growth less useful and allows you to win even by remaining a couple of levels below the maximum quota (which is ten). Quick matches The developers' idea to give a fresh touch to Might and Magic: Chess Royale is clear right from the title: to mix the mechanics of the auto battlers with those of the battle royale. So the games, instead of against a handful of opponents, are played between more than a hundred players who face each other in random matches until there is only one left. In fact, each player has only three lives available: if you lose three matches, you are out. In truth it is possible to lose even four, given that in the first one no damage is suffered regardless of the result, but in hindsight it is a minor detail. Despite the high number of players involved in each game, Might and Magic: Chess Royale is the most agile autobattler on the market: a game can be completed in about twenty minutes by winning all matches, where titles such as DoTA Underlords o Auto Chess requires even more than double that, even in the event of a sensational defeat. This is no small detail because many players have abandoned the genre precisely because of the length of the games. The brevity also explains why there is no need to climb to the maximum level to win and, indeed, sometimes it is counterproductive: there is no time and lack of resources to organize teams that are too numerous, so it is better to invest more in upgrading the units and on the creation of synergies. Incidentally: having ten units counts pocor if they are all or almost first level. Better to have eight tier two, with maybe one tier three, if you want to have any hope of winning. Graphics and units In terms of units Might and Magic: Chess Royale is exactly as expected: it takes full advantage of the Might and Magic bestiary. On balance we are faced with a bunch of generic fantasy creatures, such as dragons, ghosts, dryads and so on, which paradoxically have an advantage over the units of other auto battlers: abilities and signs are immediately understood, reducing the initial difficulty of entry into the game. For some it will be a minor detail, but we guarantee you that titles such as DoTA Underlords or Teamfight Tactics are not as immediate. Here a dragon is a dragon, and a ghost is sure to get along with a lich. Obviously a lot depends on personal preferences: a DoTA 2 player will not have found any difficulty in understanding the units of DoTA Underlords, just as a League of Legends player will have found himself immediately at home in Teamfight Tactics. From a graphic point of view, however, Might and Magic: Chess Royale is perfectly in line with its competitors. After all, the entire battlefield is a chessboard framed from above, where small-medium sized units battle each other with swords and magic. There is little room to work miracles and, considering that everything must also run on mobile systems, it is normal that the graphic aspect has not been pumped up in any way. This does not mean that we are talking about an ugly game to look at. Its does, but don't expect anything more.", "date": "2020-01-29", "grade": "7.5"}
