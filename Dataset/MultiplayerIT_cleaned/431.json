{"name": "LocoRoco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/locoroco.html", "text": "United we laughed Developed by SCEJ, LocoRoco starts from some trivial premises to insert the user in the ~tender~ scenario that forms the background to the game. The world is threatened by the invasion of the evil Moja Corps, black creatures with a thirst for destruction, and the only hope of salvation lies precisely in the LocoRoco, small round blob-like creatures. Contrary to what might be expected, the player has an indirect influence on the LocoRoco: the real deus ex machina is the earth itself, whose movements are managed through a control system that defining simple is really an understatement. Pressing the L and R keys therefore tilts the two-dimensional game plane to the left or right respectively - thus allowing the LocoRoco to roll in the desired direction - while a simultaneous solicitation of the same allows the blobs to make a jump. That's all, or almost. The Sony product is developed as a sort of puzzle-platform which, beyond the variations in slope and leaps, plays on the LocoRoco characteristic of dividing into several parts and recomposing at will. The level design is extremely accurate, capable of offering something different or particular in each stage United we laughed In fact, scattered along the levels there are 20 bulbs whose collection determines an increase in the size of the blob of the moment and consequently the maximum number of ~clones~ present on the screen following a split: a process, this, directly controlled by the circle key ( the stylistic device used by the developers is hilarious: thunder strikes the LocoRoco to divide it, while an earthquake causes the various parts to get closer again out of fear) and which proves to be the main discriminant of the various small puzzles present within the stages. If therefore a single, large LocoRoco represents the best way to continue one's march and face jumps and enemies, many small blobs are indispensable for crossing narrow spaces, simultaneously completing different routes or even filling containers. These and other elements peep out thanks above all to an extremely accurate level design, capable of offering something different or particular in each stage: levers, gears, mobile platforms and so on enrich scenarios whose constant is instead represented by the numerous secret passages leading to bonuses of various types, and which in themselves constitute an effective stimulus to replay value. Rolling rolling rolling However, the action of LocoRoco is not reduced to the simple rolling and collection of bulbs: in addition to the elementary fights against the Moja - to be killed with headbutts - there are three distinct types of collectibles called to stimulate the user to search. First we find small insects present in varying quantities within the levels (more or less the equivalent of coins in Mario) to be collected to increase the score and to be used as currency in the three different mini-games offered by the main menu. Each stage then hides three Mui Mui, small blue hominids with which to unlock new songs, and a whole series of elements for the Loco House (another section of the game in which it is possible to build a scenario and observe the reactions of the LocoRoco), obtainable in more diverse ways. Aesthetically, we would not hesitate to define LocoRoco as the Yoshi's Island of our times Rolling rolling rolling However, one of the most important aspects of Sony production is the musical one: not only for the exceptional quality of the songs that form the background to the action - and which, moreover, with a brilliant idea, the LocoRoco themselves sing continuously - but also for the role they play in the game economy. In fact, we often find ourselves in the presence of real ~living barriers~ such as walls, clouds or shrubs equipped with eyes and mouths, willing to free the passage only in exchange for a chorus of voices of a sufficient number of small blobs. No less ingenious is the cosmetic sector of the SCEJ titles, which we would not hesitate to define as the Yoshi's Island of our times: delicious two-dimensional stylized and colored scenarios of pastel shades therefore surround the march of the very nice LocoRoco, of which during the adventure it is possible to unlock and use six types, different in appearance and vocality. The result is so effective that it is not even surprising to face already completed sections again just for the sake of hearing the peculiar verses of the LocoRoco and observing their funny movements and expressions. An aspect, this, capable of largely filling the not excessive longevity of the game, made up of about 40 stages and in any case characterized by a decidedly accessible basic level of challenge. Comment LocoRoco is shadeless di doubt one of the most stylistically original products of recent times, as well as a video game capable of offering an excellent combination of ease of use and fun factor like few others. Characterized by an exceptional graphic look and a series of incredibly cheerful and engaging music, LocoRoco proves to be a truly exciting title, perhaps a little simple to complete at first but decidedly difficult for anyone who wants to understand every secret. In short, LocoRoco represents for PSP what Katamari Damacy was for PS2: the jewel you don't expect and which you can no longer do without. Pros Unique audiovisual style Simple and captivating gameplay Good replay value Cons Not high basic level of difficulty Extras not exciting One of the most exemplary ~unwritten laws~ of the world of video games states that the more a title is simple to assimilate and at the same time difficult to master in its entirety, the greater its value will be. In the handheld field, this universal axiom must be accompanied by an equally important one, relating precisely to the very nature of portable entertainment, which is most effective when it manages to express the qualities of its gameplay even in short game sessions. Well, the awaited Sony LocoRoco not only follows the above dictates to the letter, but embellishes everything with a design that is impossible not to fall madly in love with...", "date": "2006-06-22", "grade": null}
