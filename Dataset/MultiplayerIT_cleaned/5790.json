It occurred to someone in California in the 1960s to take a board, add four wheels and jump on it. The phenomenon becomes a sport and, sixty years later, we have the themed video game: same experience, but everything is controlled by comfortably holding a controller in front of the TV (or monitor). Well, ~same experience~ up to a point, you say. And you are right. This very observation, in fact, has haunted the developers of Crea-ture Studios for some time. Think about it for a moment. Skateboard-based video games have already existed for some time, just think of EA's Skate series or the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Session: Skate Sim, however, is as different from all the products just mentioned as day is different from night. Of course, the underlying sport always remains the same, but this time we found ourselves spending hours and hours with a real simulator, based on the most faithful adaptation of the real world experience in playful form; a form that requires time, dedication, patience, to then adequately repay the efforts made. If you are interested in skateboarding and have been waiting for a videogame counterpart that is as realistic and faithful as possible, this could be your chance. You are about to find out, in the review of Session: Skate Sim. Gameplay for real skaters The environments of Session: Skate Sim are unfortunately not many or varied, but they do their duty The gameplay of Session: Skate Sim is unlike any other skateboarding title you've seen in the past. Its not your classic arcade philosophy to begin with; consequently the fairly common scoring system is also missing. One of the characters present, a friend of the protagonist, jokingly insists on this aspect from the beginning. Incidentally, the presence of irreverent, pungent and self-deprecating dialogues also makes the most annoying moments of the title - such as the punitive tutorial - if not pleasant, at least bearable. From the very first start, Session: Skate Sim will ask you to select a difficulty level, which can then be changed at a later time. Basically, the game is interested in knowing how expert you are in the sector: the less you are, the more it will go into depth, with patience and perseverance, in explaining every single aspect of the sport you have chosen to practice in videogame form. The remarkably original control system changes based on this setting, since it ~assists~ the user more at lower difficulty levels, without ever engaging the autopilot. The realistic style of Session: Skate Sim The truth, however, is that we are in the presence of an extremely realistic production, a real simulator and therefore there are really no significant discounts for anyone. The dual-stick control system ensures that each of them corresponds to one of the protagonist's feet. The sensation returned is truly almost that of being on a real board: it is not easy to learn how to dose the weight, control the direction and speed, let alone all that myriad of stylish combinations with demonic names. What you need to know is that there are all possible tricks; that everyone needs a certain execution; that this execution of specific commands also needs timing calculated to the thousandth of a second with respect to the surrounding environment, otherwise you will end up with the poor protagonist crashed against walls, stairways and benches (the interpenetrations with objects and collisions are not that great ). The overall feeling is one of extreme fidelity to the reference sport. Moreover Session: Skate Sim is technical and meticulous in its requests, it requires great attention. Aware of all this, the developers have prepared some sensible features: for example, you can set up your customized save points within the environments, in order to reload the character and skate on the fly in that position, and nowhere else. In short, the philosophy is granitically that of ~trial and error~: you make a mistake, you try again, you make mistakes again, you try again until a damned execution fails as perfect as it should. And meanwhile the hours of play go by without realizing it. Structure (and some limitations) Performing tricks in Session: Skate Sim will take time, training, patience Session: Skate Sim is a different title from its older cousins and whoever buys it will do so precisely because of its simulator soul. It is also worth knowing the general structure, because it is one thing to master the skate, another to use it for some more precise purpose. From this point of view, the world offeredby the developers is quite limited and consists of a series of points of interest (for skaters) hosted by the cities of New York City, Philadelphia and San Francisco. There is a sort of generic plot - the protagonist, after years of rest following an injury, returns to his great passion - which hosts short and very short missions, almost all of which consist in the technical realization of certain moves on one's table. As a reward, you get a currency that can be spent in the shops of the aforementioned cities, to buy up to two hundred customizations for the main character (and obviously for his skate). It all works, but it undeniably shows the side in terms of content and often also qualitative. The only truly unassailable thing, in fact, is the gameplay; the technical sector already leaves much to be desired (even on PlayStation 5), as well as objects and details of the various environments present, collisions, the very personalization of one's avatar, completely inconsistent. The structure of the progression itself, in reality, is quite questionable: a story organized into chapters is missing, as well as a minimal pretext that leads to the exploration of the surrounding area; you can very well stay practicing in the first area, forever. How many times will you crash into the ground in Session: Skate Sim? Very many, you will see Sure, you might say, the bones count here, not the frills: but a perfect skateboarding simulator isn't necessarily a fun simulator too. Apart from the big fans of the sport (and, in our opinion, also different from each other), everyone else will risk getting bored after a few hours. Unless they are perfectionist maniacs: in that case Session: Skate Sim will be able to give them satisfaction, especially at the most prohibitive difficulty levels.", "date": "2022-09-29", "grade": "7.0"}
