{"name": "Sora tua", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/162281-sora-sora-tua.html", "text": "Orange Juice is a name that will say little to the general public, but that fans of scrolling shooters, arcade ones by the way, will know well because of the two Suguris. At first glance their new effort, Sora (as indeed happened with the Suguri) seems like a title like many others, but it's only by playing it that you realize how the orange team has once again ruthlessly unhinged some of the stylistic features of the bullets hell, to add some interesting and original mechanics to the action. One of the dialogues with which the story is told. The drawings are not beautiful. The player takes on the role of Sora, an augmented girl who fights a meaningless war against opponents she knows nothing about. The plot that forms the background to the seven levels into which the game is divided, of which we will not reveal anything, is told by dialogues with other characters, with a style very close to that of visual novels. However, the core of the experience is represented by the shoot'em up phases, in which one is inexorably swept away if the game system has not been studied a little with the tutorial, which has never been so useful. We try to explain. Sora has three attacks (missiles, laser projectiles and sword strikes) and the ability to dash to avoid projectiles or parry them. Unlike other shooters, each action has a cooldown that exposes the girl to enemy attacks and some, such as sprinting, grow a heat bar which penalizes her enormously if filled. From the intersection of all these elements, a highly technical gameplay derives, with a pinch of strategy that further enriches it. To win you must not only learn how to use the attacks, but develop such a fluency with the controls to be able to take advantage of the advanced actions available to Sora to, for example, start a dodge immediately after a hit, so as to eliminate the recovery time and get right back into action. The nature of the Orange Juisce title emerges overwhelmingly in the boss fights, which I end up looking more like spectacular ballets than classic dodge and resistance challenges. In fact, Sora is a very difficult title: we advise you to tackle it first on the easy level (which took us several hours of play to get to the end) then on the normal one. Sora is a classic shooter who tries to renew the bullet hell formula: will he succeed? Black bands and bass drum Where Sora stands out in the negative is on the technical/stylistic side. If you follow us with a certain perseverance you will know that we are not in the habit of criticizing independent games for their graphics, since we are perfectly aware of the production limits that a small studio can have... unless you are faced with to a half-wreck or an ~annoying~ realization. The special effects are well done, but the backdrops are really poor Here, Sora falls into this second category. In what sense? The sprites are drawn with a typically manga stroke, and so far nothing strange, but they are not particularly beautiful. Much better has also been seen on the independent scene, so as not to disturb all those titles designed by professional mangakas. Even the design of the enemies is not very inspired, not to mention the backgrounds, anonymous and without peaks, all formed by decorative clouds of various shades, apart from some insignificant attempts at diversification. It certainly cost little to make them, but a minimum of variety could be sought. In short, we find ourselves fighting against unimaginative opponents on flat scenarios that quickly get bored. Let's also add the black side bars and the massacre is complete. Someone can tell us that there are many shoot'em-ups with sidebars, given the needs of the genre that often clash with the change of resolution. True, especially for vertical scrolling ones. Not bad, actually, but they could put some filler image there. So everything tastes really sticky and it's not very pleasant. It's a shame, because convexly the special effects of the bullets and super attacks are well done and feature really spot-on plays of light and color. Fortunately, the beautiful soundtrack also helps to mitigate the overall negative impression on the external components of the game.", "date": "2016-01-21", "grade": "7.0"}
