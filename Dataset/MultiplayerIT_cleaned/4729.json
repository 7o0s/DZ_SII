Equipped with light mechanics, but at the same time with several layers of depth, it offered immediate and captivating gameplay, designed in particular for local multiplayer, but also functioning well online. It was a simple title, fulminating in its ingenious simplicity. Nidhogg 2 restarts exactly from Nidhogg: he turns it over in his hands, examines it down to the smallest detail and finally understands that any attempt at detachment would mean losing the charm that brought the game to success along the way, so he limits himself to expanding it, maintaining its formula is essentially intact. We sharpen swords Nidhogg 2 tells no story. In reality there is a vague outline and the presence of the worms determines a certain mythology, but basically the game is limited to being a confrontation between two players that follows very simple rules. Starting from the central point of each level, you have to reach the opposite side of the starting point, while killing the opponent who wants to do the same by heading in the other direction. Some levels are very beautiful Killing and not being killed is crucial, because it determines the direction in which the level flows, indicated by a clearly visible arrow at the top of the screen. The gameplay is therefore not reduced to being a senseless race, but is formed above all by a series of comparisons between the players, with the loser who reappears after a few seconds in front of the other, after having however given him the opportunity to cover a piece of the level and maybe to switch screens. How to fight in Nidhogg 2? Each character wields a weapon. In the first chapter there was only the rapier, but later three were added: a heavy two-handed greatsword, a short but lightning-fast knife and a bow with arrows. Each weapon has different characteristics and slightly varies the attack and defense strategies. For example, the bow allows you to hit from a distance by shooting arrows at two different heights, but you have to pay attention to the reload time of the shots and, above all, to the possibility for the opponent to send back the parried arrows. The broadsword, on the other hand, is a heavy weapon that does not follow the rules of the rapier and the knife, i.e. it cannot be used to carry attacks at different heights, but provides for a single powerful blow that literally disarms or disintegrates the opponents. Obviously it is also the slowest melee weapon, therefore prone to counterattacks from faster ones. The rapier and the knife, on the other hand, work in a similar way: both allow you to carry attacks at three different heights and at great speed. The only differences are the length of the weapon and the speed of recovery. That said, as in Nidhogg all weapons can be thrown at the opponent and, when left unarmed, you can fight with bare hands with kicks, punches, slides and flying kicks, all techniques that mainly serve to disarm or knock down the opponent. 'opponent. Make up If the combat mechanics of Nidhogg 2 have remained almost identical to those of Nidhogg, the same cannot be said of the visual side, enriched by a much more detailed and colorful pixel-art. In short, no more colors and sprites from Atari 2600, but well-defined characters (customizable at the start of the game), detailed backdrops and many more animations. From this point of view, progress is evident and undeniable even by those who were fond of the original style. Seeing the characters who, when they die, become bloody colored pools that drip from the platforms is extremely satisfying, as is admiring some of the landscapes, much more varied than those of the first chapter: between a level set in the snow, another on flying ships , yet another in a disco and so on. All levels are connected to this island All are ideally linked to a large island, visible in the transitions between matches, on which the flying worms already seen in the first episode reign, always ready to devour the winners. Fortunately, in addition to the aesthetic novelties, the levels, ten in total, also have a more shrewd design. The developers have eliminated the presence of areas formed by fixed screens, opting for larger arenas, in order to be able to insert structural innovations, such as platforms, doors and so on, which serve to make the clashes more varied in the tactics to be adopted. Nothing revolutionary, also because, as already pointed out, revolutionizing Nidhogg would mean ruining it, but it is still a series of interesting revisions, which emerge above all when playing with someone else. The dormant flame Like Nidhogg, Nidhogg 2 remains a title essentially meant to be playedto multiplayer. It has a single player mode, which consists of overcoming ten battles against the CPU in the shortest possible time, but it's really secondary and, if you don't get carried away by the speed contest, you can put it aside after about fifty minutes since it lacks variants . Playing multiplayer, on the other hand, is another matter, as Nidhogg 2 can truly enrapture you for hours. Also in this case there are few possible variations, although the matches can be configured by choosing which weapons to use, setting time limits or activating some bonuses. The worm that eats winners is still there The fact remains that it works really well in its essentiality. Of course, it must also be said that if you were tired of Nidhogg, even though you may have appreciated it, Nidhogg 2 does very little to rekindle and keep the flame alive, because the game is essentially the same. There are more maps, it's nicer to look at, it offers some little new features, but it doesn't go beyond that. It's a big polish, yes, but it must be said that it lacks some of the anarchic energy of the original. It's great when played with a few friends, great in many respects, but fails to shock anymore and overall, while offering more content, loses interest faster. The bottom line is that if you liked Nidhogg, you certainly can't ignore Nidhogg 2, but, at the same time, if you think you've played enough with it and the idea of taking it back doesn't tickle you, this won't give you much motivation to change your mind.", "date": "2017-08-14", "grade": "8.5"}
