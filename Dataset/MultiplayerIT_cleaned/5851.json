{"name": "Battaglie portatili", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/160007-dynasty-warriors-8-empires-battaglie-portatili.html", "text": "The Dynasty Warrior brand, albeit with all its limitations recognized with a certain regularity by most of the western public, has managed to establish itself in the land of the rising sun by selling carloads of copies of each iteration. What in fact started as a well-defined franchise, over time was then embodied in different spin-offs and secondary series that have touched both home and portable consoles, just like in the case of Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires which nine months away from its debut on PlayStation 4 it appears on PlayStation Vita adapted to the small screen, both in the graphics and in the interface redesigned in part to make the most of the touch features. On the content front, however, the game remains the same, doing everything one would expect from a title in the Empires series, that is, taking the combat system of the last chapter of the main saga, adding some new strategic elements and mixing it all up to offer new challenges to the never tame players. Consequently, being the basis rather good, even the work of Omega force with this title has not struggled to be appreciated, while maintaining firmly all the critical points of a game formula that has been the same for too long now. Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is reconfirmed as an excellent title also on PlayStation Vita Management and Strategy Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is the second expansion of the eighth chapter after Xtreme Legends, and exactly like the latter it keeps most of the features of the game system intact by adding new strategic elements absent in the previous titles. The game world remains the same, as well as the historical period and the events narrated with the player who will have to take part again in the war of the Three Kingdoms by impersonating one of the many characters available. The ultimate goal will therefore be to unify China under our leadership not only by acting on the battlefield, but also by dealing with the economy, politics and alliances. However, there are two different ways in which to accomplish this task. On the one hand, we can decide to travel alone to China probing for possible objectives and alliances to conquer the first outpost, and from there begin to expand our military and territorial dominance. Secondly, however, we will take part in the war as an active member of the house to which we are affiliated, following the instructions of the commander in chief to proceed in the conquest of new territories. The goal will be far from easy since we will have to combine good performances with the sword with as many strategic skills in order to impress superiors and climb the positions in the chain of command. Having acquired the role of Prefect, for example, we will obtain control of a small region of the map to be managed at three hundred and sixty degrees by deciding with which other clans to form alliances, take care of the army and military operations, including clashes with neighboring landowners or raids , but without neglecting the economic management. This last aspect is particularly important in the Empires game experience since our strategic decisions are all based on the financial availability of the region we govern. To build military garrisons, shops and improve buildings, or decide whether or not to invade an adjacent territory, we must have enough money, but once the invasion has been successful we could exploit all the resources of the new territories and gradually expand our economy. It therefore becomes essential to carefully analyze the map to get a more precise idea of where to direct your military and diplomatic efforts. In fact, we are not only talking about brute force in Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires, given that alliances and above all sentimental relationships will have a considerable weight, with the latter which could lead to marriage with a loved one from whom to have a child, who will inherit characteristics similar to those of the parents. On the alliance front, however, the character traits of our interlocutors will have a lot of impact, with some more inclined to betray us regardless of our choices and performances on the battlefield and others willing to tolerate our mistakes more. PSVita trophies Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires in the PlayStation Vita version offers the same 48 trophies as the home console version: 36 Bronze, 8 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. To collect them all you will need to spend a lot of time in front of the console since you have to complete all the missions in the game on the difficulty level plus more, make certain moral or strategic choices during the adventuretura, have at least five children and score a certain number of kills in battle. On the battlefield Based on the alliances we will then be called to take part in certain battles proposed in the Empires mode, which are essential for the protagonist to evolve and make him stronger. By completing the strategic objectives of each battle you will obtain the Merits with which to level up your character and allow him to obtain new positions within the chain of command. They are quite varied in the various scenarios and draw on the most common war situations with tasks that include, for example, participating in a successful invasion, carrying out raids against certain camps or forming a profitable alliance with another kingdom. Victories also bring other bonuses, such as an increase in leadership, that of life points and obviously the transition to a next command rank. In this sense, the strategic and managerial part of the menus gives way to the more traditional game structure of the titles in the Dynasty Warrrior series, or rather a hard and pure musou that proposes the same gameplay for the umpteenth time with hordes of enemies to slice with sword blows. The combat system is always bare-bones, with two buttons for attacks, one for parrying and the inevitable jump to be combined in the right sequence to create combos of a few hundred hits. It is not unusual to finish the scenario with a thousand or more active kills, also counting that we can take advantage of the special shots and temporary upgrades drawn on the ground. We will also always be accompanied by allies controlled by artificial intelligence to whom we can issue orders. There are also the very useful stratagems which, by giving us the support of a shower of arrows or an ambush, now have a greater impact on the fate of the battle, proving to be decisive for having the better of the opponents especially at higher difficulty levels. The mapping of the commands also works very well on PlayStation Vita, with the combat system used for the physical keys and the management of the tricks directly to the touch controls, but unfortunately it is when you leave the battlefield that all the limits of a studied interface emerge to be enjoyed on a television and not on a 5-inch screen. Having no real audio dubbing, beyond a few side sentences pronounced in Japanese, Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is expressed mainly through screens full of lines of text all in English that are decidedly difficult to read which contextualize each game scenario or battle and above all they act as a tutorial to take the first steps in the game. You therefore need a lot of patience and placing the screen a few centimeters from your nose if you are interested in reading the whole story behind the war of the Three Kingdoms. Even graphically the show is not the best, not so much for the main protagonists who have decidedly rich in detail models, but rather for the many opposing soldiers all the same and the settings covered with flat and bare textures. In terms of modality, the offer remains unchanged except for the multiplayer which inevitably loses all the contents related to the use in local split screen, focusing only on online.", "date": "2015-12-02", "grade": "7.0"}
