{"name": "Cloudpunk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cloudpunk-recensione-pc.html", "text": "The Cloudpunk review comes at a time when the gaming world's interest in cyberpunk is going through a particular peak. The reason is obviously linked to the arrival in a few months of the highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077, towards which the eyes of all fans of this literary current (and others) are focused. But the origin of the coupling between cyberpunk and video games certainly doesn't go back to yesterday, indeed we have to go back several years. In fact, there are many titles related to cyberpunk or that have elements related to it, from masterpieces such as Beneath to Steel Sky and Blade Runner to the long-lived Deus Ex series. Even with an important title like the one from CD Projekt arriving soon, there it is therefore ample space to make inroads into the hearts of cyberpunk and video game lovers. The German team ION LANDS, developer of Cloudpunk, knows this well and with this title tries to carve out a small space in our hearts. Let's see together if he made it. Setting and plot: a story in the glow of neon Cloudpunk takes us to Nivalis, a sprawling city where sunlight seems to be just a distant memory. Built on several levels, Nivalis appears as a maze of streets dedicated to flying vehicles, or HOVA as they call them in those parts, committed to moving from one point of the city to another while on the platforms life flows frenetically to the rhythm of the falling rain incessantly. The character we control is called Rania, a courier struggling with his first night of work for Cloudpunk, a delivery company that operates on the edge of illegality. No package is refused and the couriers don't have to ask questions if they want to live in peace, while the man who calls himself Control tells them one after the other the various jobs to be done. After starting from a few simple warm-up tasks, Rania will find herself in the midst of situations that will inevitably raise some questions, pushing her to make decisions that can have a potential impact not only on her work, but also on the city of Nivalis itself. Between corporations that seem to control everything and everyone, androids linked to human beings, dangerous slums and spiers for the chosen few, Cloudpunk does not miss anything of the kind that it recalls with its name, for this reason it is undoubtedly appreciable by those who love cyberpunk. However, we must be willing to deal with a rather evident derivation from other works, Blade Runner in the first place, and with a main story that fails to take off particularly, thus leaving the player who would have liked to get involved a little dry-mouthed. ' more from the plot. Gameplay: good driving, less walking We spend most of the time spent in Nivalis driving our HOVA, initially a half-batch that stays on almost by a miracle. The objective is to travel from one point of the city to another to carry out deliveries on behalf of Cloudpunk, without deviating particularly from this aspect for the duration of the game. There are missions where instead of a package it can happen to transport people, or where it is necessary to work a little more to get from point A to point B, but the gist always remains the same. The impression is that elements such as the need to repair the HOVA from the damage it has suffered (especially at the beginning it often happens to bump into other vehicles and buildings) and to refuel are a kind of filler thought by the developers to break some ' the monotony. A similar argument also applies to the possibility of enhancing one's vehicle by investing part of the money collected working for Cloudpunk, or of enriching the apartment in which the protagonist lives with some elements, which one quickly forgets about. Cloudpunk driving is still a pleasure especially for the reasons that we will discover in the paragraph following this one, the phases in which you have to move on foot discover the side of a few more criticisms. The use of a blocked perspective means that Rania's steps do not always follow the direction we want to give them, while in cases where the shot is further away it is even difficult to identify the silhouette of the character we control compared to the surrounding environment. The vertical development of the city is used by the developers as a ploy to propose small puzzles, where we are called to reach the destination from the parking point (in Nivalis there are very few!) using elevators and other similar elements. The most appreciable aspect of moving on foot is undoubtedly linked to the possibility of interacting with the characters that populate Nivalis, usingor the dialogues (up to multiple choices) to find out more about them and about this place that appears both fascinating and dangerous. It is therefore all the more a pity that Cloudpunk never really goes deep, because the city actually gives the impression of teeming with stories that are actually only superficially told. Graphics and sound: like in a movie If Cloudpunk manages to involve the player by pushing him to move forward amidst some uncertainty, the credit undoubtedly goes to the technical sector set up by the developers. In fact, very few moments spent floating in Nivalis aboard the HOVA are enough to be literally struck by the work of ION LANDS from a graphic point of view. If you have always dreamed of moving in a place similar to Blade Runner's Los Angeles, Cloudpunk represents one of the best ways to do it, allowing us to explore Nivalis far and wide, letting ourselves be enchanted by the neon light that passes through the raindrops and the vapors of the city. Really wanting to find a flaw in the creation of Nivalis we can say that some of its areas are a little too similar to each other: greater diversification would have helped to add further charm, but what is there is still largely appreciable especially by those who want to driving and relax without putting too much effort. The accompaniment offered by the soundtrack is simply amazing: the work done by Harry Critchley in this sense does not really seem to have anything to envy to a film production, prompting us to listen to the more than ninety minutes that make up the soundtrack even outside of the game. The English-language dub comes across as a bit mixed, with well-crafted voices and others thrown in a little too quickly. The texts are translated into Italian, so from this point of view there is no problem. Among the characters, the one you will love the most is undoubtedly Camus, the naive artificial intelligence who accompanies Rania during her adventure.", "date": "2020-04-29", "grade": "7.5"}
