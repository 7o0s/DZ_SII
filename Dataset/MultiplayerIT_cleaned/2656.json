{"name": "Crash Bash", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-bash.html", "text": "No more Naughty! The new Universal title (Naughty Dog sold the rights to exploit the brand after finishing the third episode of the series) is a party game, a genre little known on the Sony console. In this case it is a question of tackling mini-games, with a simple concept and great playability. Initially there will be four mini games available, but during the game it is possible to unlock three more; moreover, for each of them there are variants that bring the total to twenty-eight games. There are three modes available: ~Adventure~, ~Tournament~ and ~Battle~. In ~Adventure~ mode (you can play alone or cooperating with a friend) you will find yourself in the now classic level selection room, from which you can teleport to one of the available stages, completing which you will get prizes (crystals and trophies) that will they will allow you to unlock all the bonuses of the game. In the ~Tournament~ mode, designed for multiplayer games, up to four players can be faced via ~multitap~: one of the seven events is chosen and all four of its variations are challenged. It is also possible to play in cooperative mode, for example two against two (but I recommend three against one!), or all against all. The ~Battle~ mode is almost the same as the ~Tournament~, with the only difference that you face a single stage (without the four variants). Given that the ultimate goal of the mini-games is to eliminate the opponents trying to stay alive until the end (~... there will only be one left!~), or score more points than the others, you should know that in the stage ~Crate Crush ~ you will have to eliminate the other competitors using the crates that you will find scattered in the game area, or the weapon that you have supplied (for example, Dingodile uses his tail). In ~Polar Push~ you will find yourself riding polar bears and the aim will be to make your opponents fall from the frozen (and slippery!) platform you are on, simply by pushing them; to facilitate the task you will have an energy bar, loaded which you can give a ~mega push~ to the other players. In ~Pago Pandemonium~ you will be astride a stilt and by jumping you will have to color the squares that make up the arena; the one who, at the end of the time, has filled more squares with his own color wins. There are no weapons here but you can recover gadgets (by breaking the crates you'll find around) that will allow you, for example, to jump faster. In ~Ballistix~, aboard a strange vehicle (which can only move to the right and to the left), you will be busy defending your door from the arrival of numerous metal marbles, while trying to send them into the other players' doors. Shooting opponents with the turret of your very slow tank will instead be the aim of the mini-game ~Tank Wars~; you will also have mines that you can place to ambush your enemies. In ~Crash Dash~ you will compete on a suspended track aboard a spaceship that struggles to keep the road; the aim will be to stay in the race until the time runs out, trying, using the weapons you will find, to eliminate your opponents. Finally in ~Medieval Mayhem~ you will have to try to burst the balloons of your color that will rain from the sky; whoever blows up the most wins. Also in this game you will find gadgets (the vacuum cleaner that draws the balloons towards you is really amusing) that will make your task easier. 5 Oh my Crash! Speaking of technique, we must appreciate the new development team (Eurocom) which has been able to maintain the style that characterized the other episodes of the series. The graphics are well done, the textures are sharp and clean and the animations are really funny, what more could you want? The sound is also well done with cheerful music that adequately accompanies the game sessions and fun sound effects. To improve, however, the control system, in some cases too ~woody~. Oh my Crash! Ultimately a game that you either hate or love as the case may be; you will hate it if you have to play it alone, even if the game turns out to be quite challenging and addictive (and then you have to unlock the hidden games); you will love it if you have a friend (preferably three!) and a multitap. In this case it will be days before someone leaves the screen. In short, a highly recommended title for evenings with friends but which loses a lot if played alone. Crash Again??? Recently on the market, Crash Bash is the fifth title to take advantage of the imimage of the popular Sony mascot. So far engaged in platforming with remarkable technical care and in a spectacular racing game aboard karts, this time Crash Bandicoot will meet his old friends and enemies (Dingodile, Coco, Tiny, Nitros Oxide, etc.) in a decidedly new field on PSone", "date": "2001-01-04", "grade": null}
