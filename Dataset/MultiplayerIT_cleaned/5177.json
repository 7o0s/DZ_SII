It is therefore with a justified suspicion that the mobile community has welcomed the arrival of The Trail here, the third work of the 22Cans studio: will it finally be a proper game or yet another mockery? The good premises of The Trail are lost between in-app purchases and a tendency towards monotony Walking walking The premises of The Trail are undoubtedly intriguing, starting with a non-obvious concept that sees the user in the role of a pioneer landed with little means and many hopes in a new world to explore that has the features of colonial-era America : the goal is to get to the town of Eden Falls to give life to their dreams of glory, but as the title of the game suggests, much of the emphasis is placed precisely on the path to take to get to this goal . In fact, along the way you are called to collect resources, manufacture new elements, complete missions and trade with other characters, all activities that contribute to increasing the protagonist's experience and the money in his wallet. The procedures are usually quite intuitive, even if the tutorial mechanisms leave a lot to be desired by omitting important information that you have to discover on your own by trying: you play by holding your smartphone vertically and using practically only one finger, swiping on the display and tapping on-screen elements to interact with them in different ways depending on the context. To complete a picture that at first appears more than rosy, there is also a truly remarkable technical realization, strong in graphics that adopt a convincing cel shading that gives the product a pleasant look a la Wind Waker and a sound sector that boasts good level and a very nice English dubbing. With the Molineaux of recent years, however, the rip-off is always around the corner and unfortunately The Trail is no exception: once the curiosity of the initial stages of the adventure has vanished, the game reveals itself for what it really is, or rather a walking simulator boring, with a crafting component that leaves the time it finds, management elements that are all too sketchy and above all with in-app purchase mechanics that at the most beautiful moment enter with a straight leg erecting a wall between those who are willing to pay and those who are not. Much of the time with the game is spent observing the protagonist who advances automatically (only the speed of the gait is allowed) on a pre-established path, looking around to collect with taps the ingredients necessary to make tools, clothes and objects. A monotony that is interrupted by reaching the camps found along the way, where it is possible to restore the energy that is squandered by walking, get down to crafting and carry out trades with other users through a small mini-game. As previously mentioned, it doesn't take much to realize that The Trail doesn't interpret the free to play formula in the best way: if you don't give in to the purchase of paid components, you will soon find yourself having to resort to heavy grinding to achieve their goals, which only exacerbates the sense of boredom that already pervades the 22Cans production. Once you reach the fateful settlement of Eden Falls, things change slightly but without improving much: it is possible to settle down by purchasing a property and engage in a series of activities to increase your income, and there is also a splash of social component which involves interacting with other players in order to create the most prosperous community. Despite some references to titles such as Animal Crossing, even at this juncture The Trail ends up proving to be more tedious than it should be and above all excessively linked to monetization mechanisms.", "date": "2016-11-10", "grade": "6.5"}
