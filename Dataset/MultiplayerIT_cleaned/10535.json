In reality, there has not yet been a real exploitation of what are the innovative features of the DSi against the ~old~ Lite, at least until now: we therefore welcome Flipnote Studio, a free application but with enormous potential. Come forward creative Flipnote Studio is, essentially, a small and simple tool that allows you to create short animations, but it is above all a product capable of exploiting in an exemplary way all the seeds that in fact represent the innovative features of the latest version of the Nintendo portable . First of all, the application is available exclusively on DSiWare in a completely free form: it is therefore enough to connect to a Wi-Fi network and download the program (which is, however, small in size) to be able to immediately get to work and make your own short films. The interface is extremely simple, as can be expected from a Nintendo title: you obviously use the stylus to draw what you want on the touchscreen, while three basic commands are assigned to as many directions on the D-pad. Pressing right you pass to the next frame, where the previously traced figure appears as a shadow, thus facilitating operations; with the down key it is possible to view in real time a preview of what has been achieved up to that moment, and finally the up arrow opens the tools screen. From here the user can change the size, color and type of brush, delete portions of the drawing or entire frames and make various changes to the animation (for example by setting the display speed). There is also room to exploit the mistreated DSi camera, since the images captured in this way can be suitably retouched and / or inserted between the various frames. You can even add sounds, to be recorded using the DSi's built-in microphone and juxtaposed as you like within your work. Even with the obvious limitations of the case, Flipnote Studio proves to be a truly performing tool, and it is practically impossible not to get involved in its extraordinary simplicity of use: it goes without saying that the Nintendo product does not represent the ideal terrain for anyone with artistic ambitions to high caliber, but it's a perfect app for creating something fun to share with your friends. This is in fact the second, enormous strength of Flipnote Studio, considering how easy it is to convert and distribute your creations. To begin with, the application allows you to transform your work into GIF format, provided you eliminate the sound component. On the sharing front, however, there are two possibilities: just a few clicks are enough to send a file to a friend with a DSi, while registering on https://flipnote.hatena.com gives you the opportunity to upload animations directly to the web and submit them to the scrutiny of the internet public. Furthermore, the flipnotes made by other users can be downloaded and viewed directly on the console, given their small weight in terms of megabytes. In short, as can be seen from the description given so far, that of Flipnote Studio is an incredibly complete offer for a product made available for free. Certainly this is not a gesture of pure philanthropy on the part of Nintendo, and it is evident that the goal is to stimulate users to accelerate the transition to the DSi: commercial reasons aside, Flipnote Studio remains an excellent and very fun tool that no Nintendo handheld owner can afford to snub.", "date": "2009-09-14", "grade": "9.0"}
