{"name": "NBA Jam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81232-nba-jam-boom-shaka-laka.html", "text": "When we talk about a title whose roots go back a long way back in time, it is appropriate to make a brief introduction for those who were still too young to remember it at the time: the NBA Jam present here is therefore a reboot of the homonymous series born in 1993 by Midway, characterized by an extremely arcade style of play, based on two-on-two challenges devoted exclusively to spectacularity and speed. Very famous in the period of the 16-bit consoles, the franchise got a little lost along the way around the end of the 90s, but EA has decided to bring it back into the game by calling into question its creator, Mark Turmell, who has well thought not to change practically an iota of the original gameplay. For the sake of those who, in 1993, were already perfectly capable of understanding, wanting and tinkering with the joypad... A pinch of nostalgia Longtime fans of the NBA Jam series will be happy to know that, despite the handover from Midway to Electronic Arts, little or nothing has changed in this latest episode, which in fact re-proposes all the features that made the franchise famous. The setting is therefore the usual, and sees teams made up of only two elements on each side compete in frenetic games to the last dunk, where the tactic is beautifully thrown out the window to make room for pure and simple arcade action. So much so that the control system, despite having adapted to the particular configuration of the Wii, still makes use of a few keys, the bare minimum to allow the user to set up passes, shots and various acrobatics using a handful of inputs. Played with a Classic Controller, NBA Jam is exactly the same as the 16-bit console chapters, while the Nunchuck + Remote combo requires you to use the latter's motion sensor to go to the basket and jump on defense , simply with a flick of the device upwards: a solution that can be said to work properly, given that no particular lag is perceptible compared to the more traditional configuration. As in any self-respecting modern product, however, EA has well thought of inserting a rather extensive tutorial section, useful for brushing up on the fundamentals of the game and for practicing as regards the timing necessary to insert the ball into the basket. However, the title is extremely immediate, and a few games are enough to launch into spectacular plays, dividing yourself between dunks that make your opponents fall to the ground, triples that set the ball on fire and alley-oops that destroy the basket backboard. Certainly depth has never been the strong point of the series, and NBA Jam is the confirmation of this, given that the single player is a bit stale after just a few games (despite the presence of different modes which we will then describe): against, playing in four is a sometimes delirious experience, especially if there are skilled users capable of overturning the front of the action in a matter of seconds, going to grasp what is the very essence of the gameplay of the franchise. In this sense, the lack of an online mode is a real shame, which forces those who want to make the most of the playful offer of the EA product to look for valid companions to challenge locally. The new advancing Being part of the EA Sports range, NBA Jam can obviously count on the official licenses for all the teams in the US championship, each of which provides a handful of its stars to select for their favorite duo, taking into account the statistics that define the abilities of the various athletes (including our Gallinari). In terms of game modes, however, the commitment of the developers to offer as many alternatives as possible is evident, even if the best part of the title is always and in any case the multiplayer one. Playing alone, you can try your hand at a Classic Campaign, which broadly follows the trend of the real championship, with the fragmentation into divisions, the playoffs and so on, or in the so-called Remix Tour, in which it is necessary to complete specific challenges to be able to continue. In fact, the only real incentive to tackle these somewhat lackluster experiences lies in the possibility of unlocking various extras, which culminate in the Boss Battles in which you are called to face real basketball legends. The Remix Modes menu then presents a series of alternatives to the standard game action, almost all intended exclusively for group play: in Smash, the team that first destroys the opponent's board with dunks wins; in Domination you have to go to the basket in specific areas of the field toobtain score multipliers; Elimination is a survival mode in which the athletes with the lowest score are progressively discarded; in 21, the team that reaches the designated score first wins; finally, in Remix 2 Vs 2 you can play games modified by the presence of power-ups to collect on the parquet. Like the game modes, the technical sector has also undergone an obvious update to today's standards, starting with a graphic that in any case maintains the caricatured tone and spectacularity typical of the series unchanged: visual effects and exaggerated animations abound, while it is quite convincing -but also slightly disturbing- the solution of combining the athletes' three-dimensional bodies with 2D digitized faces complete with diversified expressions depending on the action in progress. The sound is also good, in which the return of an exaggerated commentator stands out who comments on the match with screams and expressions (also) typically from the 90s...", "date": "2010-10-05", "grade": "7.9"}
