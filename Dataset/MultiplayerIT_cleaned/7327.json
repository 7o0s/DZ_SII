Especially the European ones. The Japanese still play Monster Hunter Portable 3rd in our face, both on PlayStation 3 and on PSP, while the next Monster Hunter we will see in Europe is the highly anticipated fourth chapter for Nintendo 3DS... in 2015. The brand now seems to have chosen Nintendo machines as a reference console and in the meantime, with a Monster Hunter Online that no one knows what it comes out for and when, in the library of Sony consoles - especially portable ones - a void has been created that the others software houses are desperately trying to fill in their own way. Namco Bandai tried it with God Eater. Sony itself tried it with Soul Sacrifice. And now Tecmo Koei has also tried to make his Monster Hunter, the company famous above all for its ~musou~, Dynasty Warriors in the first place. Tecmo Koei, however, entrusting the development to its flagship Omega Force team, made an intelligent thought after all, namely: what if instead of putting all the flour in our bag, we copied almost all of Monster Hunter's ideas? Criticize them as well, but they almost hit the mark... Toukiden didn't make us forget Monster Hunter, but it made missing him less painful The Oni Hunters Set in an unspecified alternative medieval Japan, Toukiden talks about heroes and demons, oni and ~slayer~: eight years before the beginning of the game, a huge oni - a demon or ogre in Japanese folklore - had appeared from an interdimensional rift bringing death and destruction with an army of monsters in tow. To defeat him, some of the bravest warriors of the time had united in a kind of army specialized in the destruction of supernatural demons, and since then the ~slayers~ have continued a fight that has shed more and more blood, both demonic and human. Today the monsters have become more aggressive and violent and the slayers need new recruits: you, needless to say, are a recruit in the village of Utakata, but right away - as always happens in these games - your superiors notice that you hide great potential and you can become real stars in demon hunting. In short, Toukiden's story is certainly not one of the most original, but it must be said that it is much more present and incisive than the practically non-existent one of Monster Hunter. The supporting characters, although stereotyped, are all well characterized and interact with each other and with the player in a fairly convincing way, increasing the sense of involvement. The dialogues are all fully voiced in Japanese, marked by beautiful artwork depicting the characters involved in the conversation. In short, technically there is very little to complain about: the scenarios are very evocative and perfectly recall the idea of an ancient and legendary Japan, as well as the models of monsters and characters, full of details and particulars, especially for what it's all about the many weapons and armor that can be crafted from the shredded demon pieces. In short, from this point of view, Tecmo Koei has done an excellent job, also because the various slayers we will be dealing with will be able to follow us into battle, for a maximum of three at a time: each of them fights with a different style that enhances attack or defense, so building a good party can prove decisive in the most difficult missions. There's no need to beat around the bush: they function much like the Felynes from Monster Hunter, but the fact that they have a personality of their own, commentary on the action and are significantly more intelligent than the Capcom sidekicks makes them a welcome addition to our arsenal of hunters. Young exorcists grow up The similarities between Toukiden and Monster Hunter lie not only in the concept, but in the actual execution. The Tecmo Koei title is played practically like the Capcom one, and also develops in the same way, fortunately making diversifications here and there which for some players will even be improvements. The basis is very simple: you choose a mission from the ever-expanding list, made up of mandatory quests for the main story and optional side missions, and after accepting it at the slayer counter you leave the village gate to venture into the area of interest . Area divided, in turn, into numbered micro-zones separated by short loads, just like in Monster Hunter. Depending on the mission chosen, the goal could be to defeat a certain number of enemies, collect some items or get rid of one or more high-ranking demons. Defeated enemies can be purified: this is a pprocedure that is carried out by holding down the R key near the corpse of a defeated monster, and which can also be performed automatically by our companions, not at all different from the skinning of Monster Hunter, if not for a very interesting small detail. When facing demons and larger creatures, it is possible to purify the body parts destroyed up to that point, and it is important for three reasons: first, it prevents them from regenerating; second, it weakens the enemy, preventing him from carrying out certain attacks or causing him difficulties during movements; third, with a little luck, it allows you to get that body part as loot and use it to build new weapons and armor. In the village of Ukataka, in fact, it is possible to take advantage of various services, including that of forging the equipment that is unlocked with the passing of the missions and the discovery and defeat of new races of demons. It goes without saying that, beyond the story, Toukiden is played precisely because of the challenge proposed by the various demons, increasingly large and powerful, and for the collecting element mixed with the desire to continuously improve one's equipment. PSVita trophies The array of unlockable Trophies in Toukiden is quite large: in addition to platinum, we are talking about two gold, eleven silver and thirty-six bronze trophies. Some are unlocked almost automatically, for example by defeating various demons; for others it will be necessary to put at a good pace, manufacturing each weapon, enhancing each mitama or accumulating a lot of money. Oni versus Rathalos And there are plenty of weapons and armor, aesthetically different in both shapes and colors, of different degrees of power and effectiveness. The itemization in Toukiden is less complicated than in Monster Hunter: there are fewer parameters to evaluate and it is not necessary to sharpen the weapons for example, so the weapons lack the value of sharpening, but this does not mean that there is a lack of decent depth for as regards the tactical choice of equipment, which takes the form above all in the so-called ~mitama~. The mitamas are obtained by defeating some particular bosses and demons and are nothing more than spirits inspired by some legendary Japanese heroes: they can be ~embedded~ in our weapons, in a number that depends on the slots in the weapon in question, and give us powers specials that are activated by holding down the R key and allow, for example, to enhance our attack or defense, absorb the energy of enemies or heal ourselves and our companions. The mitama, which differ in type in combat, once equipped increase in level and power and represent a very important strategic parameter that expands our move park and must be played in synergy with our battle companions, controlled by artificial intelligence or from other players online or in ad hoc connection. For obvious reasons it was not possible for us to delve into the multiplayer sector, which in any case offers a fair variety of specific missions against creatures and bosses stronger than normal. However, the offline adventure can be enjoyed completely alone, even if for some bosses it will be necessary to work hard: it also happened in Monster Hunter, of course, but Toukiden unfortunately pays the price for an excellent technical and content package with a significantly inferior combat system compared to that of the Capcom title, despite the possibility of hooking enemies with a convenient lock-on. The variety of weapons is discreet: from the slow but lethal gauntlets to the elegant and fast longsword, passing through the very fast double daggers to the bow for ranged combat. There are also more complex and outlandish weapons, such as the medium-range spear and the chained scythe that allows for unpredictable combos. It is essential to get to know each weapon to make the most of it against the monsters' weaknesses, of course, and from this point of view, Monster Hunter fans will feel at ease. The problem is that the combat system lacks that sense of weight and momentum that characterizes the Capcom series, often resulting in too fast animations and sudden changes of shot that risk confusing the player. The same problem applies to monsters: also in this sense there is a great variety of creatures, increasingly disturbing and monstrous, but their repertoire of attacks and behaviors is less vast and perhaps it is precisely their bizarre and unnatural shape that prevents to easily interpret their animations, transforming some clashes into real brawls that are not well reasoned and, in the end, less satisfying.", "date": "2014-02-10", "grade": "8.0"}
