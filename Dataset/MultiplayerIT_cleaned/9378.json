{"name": "The Gunk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-gunk-recensione.html", "text": "The indie developer ecosystem can seem quite static at times, but it actually tends to change even faster than the triple A industry. On the other hand, when you have a team of skilled creatives at your disposal, the path is always that of ~ big leap~, usually with a transition from 2D to 3D or an exponential increase in the resources dedicated to production. Some software houses manage to evolve with an almost disarming naturalness, yet there are those that fail miserably, even with a pedigree of all respect. Similar stumbles usually derive from calculation errors, or from the simple inability to properly evaluate the efforts necessary to change a good part of one's internal philosophy, an eventuality that is far from rare if up to that moment one has always chosen to face the job ~ in a small way~ (or with an almost extended family structure). Even with such difficulties to overcome, however, if a well-known team tries to take this tortuous path, expectations are predictably high, as the probability of finding a real gem on your hands increases. When Image & Form presented The Gunk, therefore, more than one enthusiast pricked up their antennae, convinced that they could see the talent of the team to which we owe the SteamWorld series explode thanks to a three-dimensional action adventure. As already mentioned, however , sometimes we aim too high, and a solid mine of talent at the base of a project may not be enough. Indeed, after completing the game, we doubt it could be the title capable of making the name of this team of Swedish programmers take off. We explain why in our The Gunk review. Fiction: in search of energy The Gunk: the arrival on the planet The differences of The Gunk from the previous works of Image & Form are noticed almost immediately: it is, as mentioned, a very linear and markedly narrative action adventure. The game puts you in the role of Rani, an expert in space excavations who reaches a mysterious planet together with her partner Beck, in search of energy sources and/or riches. Armed with a powerful mechanical arm capable of sucking up various types of materials, Rani then sets out to explore the newly discovered world, but waiting for her she finds a verdant landscape invaded by a strange dark substance - immediately christened Gunk by the girl - which once removed middle gives way to promising energy explosions and the sudden rebirth of nearby vegetation. Obviously, the search for the source of all this leads the couple to face something very different from a simple exploratory expedition. The Gunk: The blob leaves behind nothing but desolation As you will have understood, we are dealing with a rather malleable premise, which can be developed in many interesting ways. The Gunk however, although very guided by its plot, does not particularly shine for dialogue or characterization of the characters and overall it never manages to exalt. In fact, throughout the campaign the story gives the impression of being more of a justification for advancing than a real support of experience, and there is no shortage of heavy naiveties in the writing. Nothing terrible, for heaven's sake, however the title would undoubtedly have gained from a little more effort in this area, since it is far from flawless in other respects. Indeed, one can easily overlook a less than excellent narrative if the gameplay leaves you speechless, however in The Gunk the choices made by the developers are not always the best. Structure and gameplay: Lots of slime. Just too much. The Gunk: The greenery is colorful to say the least If you go to analyze the structure of the game, in reality, you won't find anything particularly wrong: The Gunk is a sort of ~fake exploratory title~ in which the three-dimensional maps have obvious crossroads placed there mainly to solve some extra puzzles and obtain additional resources . The materials recovered by deviating from the recommended path can then be used to enhance Rani's glove in various ways and make life easier in dangerous situations. The problem lies in the ease of the puzzles and in the even excessive linearity of the progress: the campaign has very simple puzzles and an all too obvious path for progression for at least three quarters of the duration; things get slightly complicated only in the final phase, and even in that specific case getting stuck for more than a dozen seconds in front of a puzzle is a rarity. Just to let you understand to what extent the level of challenge is low shot: we really only stood still a couple of times during the adventure; both were not due to abstruse puzzles, but to bugs that cost usright to restart the last checkpoint to activate platforms that hadn't started. The Gunk: Fights are more of a nuisance than anything else The battles against some monsters present in the title do not change the situation much: they are little variegated enemies with very simple patterns, which mostly represent a nuisance while solving the various situations in which Rani finds herself entangled (their general difficulty is lowered as soon as you get some specific boosts). To further weaken everything, then, the Gunk is used: a slime scattered everywhere to be cleaned up constantly in order to reach the following areas. The elimination of this blob in itself is not evil: the suction effect of the glove of Rani is very visually pleasing and cleaning up the 3D maps feels almost relaxing most of the time. However, the general rhythm is even too staid and the need to cancel these dark agglomerations from the continuous journey only lowers it further, leading to some phases (especially the initial ones, given the ease) boring. Technical compartment and judgement: soft with lemon The Gunk: In an alien facility Let's be clear, even with all the criticisms just described this is not really a bad video game. The Gunk works, doesn't last very long and does its dirty work while also offering a few flashes of fun and wit here and there. The problem is its generally mediocre quality, which a handful of moments managed to resolve is certainly not enough. This ~just sufficient~ general level, however, is also found in the technical sector, where apart from the effects related to Gunk that we have before described there is very little of note to speak of. The three-dimensional models of the maps and characters are pleasant, but far from superlative, the animations are woody and the art direction is lackluster. In general, the most annoying thing were certain bugs: some minor - such as platforms becoming ~solid~ with a slight delay, or physics engine hiccups - others significantly more critical, such as those that forced us to reset a few times. Many of these bugs appear to be known at least, so it's conceivable that the team will fix them with the first few patches. The one thing that stands out? The soundtrack. The sound design of the game is remarkable, and accompanies the events with absolutely spot-on sounds, passing from incredibly relaxing music during the quiet phases, to more tense moments clearly underlined by more hostile and disturbing melodies. From the team at the reins of this work, however, we really expected much more.", "date": "2021-12-16", "grade": "6.5"}
