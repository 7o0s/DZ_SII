{"name": "Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-rogue-spear.html", "text": "But first allow me a literary excursus that never hurts If the name Ian Fleming immediately makes us think of the famous James Bond, the same associative algorithm applied to Tom Clancy will produce the certainly less famous Jack Ryan. Played on the big screen by Alec Baldwin (in 'The Hunt for Red October') and Harrison Ford (in 'Power Play' and 'Clear and Clear'), Jack Ryan is not the exact counterpart of 007, far from it . While not disdaining action, Jack mostly uses his cerebellum and his experience as a statesman; he is also characterized by a humanity that makes him much more likeable and believable than the forced Bond James Bond. In the narrative universe created by Tom Clancy, Jack Ryan begins his career as a CIA agent specializing in military strategies and, novel after novel, has recently become president of the United States. It's likely to think that from now on old Jack's most exciting task will be to have the knob polished by the intern on duty, will it be worth writing a whole book about such performances? Luckily (?) There is no need because Jack Ryan is not the only character Clancy has had the foresight to create, the other 90's piece is John Clark. Like Bond and unlike Ryan, Clark (Willelm Dafoe on film) is a guy with a high testosterone coefficient, an agent who kills you 5 times before letting you fall to the ground, someone who takes you on a hostage rescue mission in the morning, in the afternoon he assassinates a corrupt official and if there is time before dinner he also bombs the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. He is the protagonist of Clancy's most recent novels and in particular of Rainbow Six (Rizzoli, pages 778), a book in which Jack Ryan is mentioned only on one occasion and even in passing. End of the excursus, wake up... The first Rainbow Six arrived on Playstation in a pitiful state: the most important feature, the accurate planning of the mission to be accomplished, had been reduced to a minimum. Of the type: choose which of the two entrances to break in from; this to meet the reduced mental capacities of consular users, at least according to the judgment of Red Storm. Of course it was the flop. Fortunately, with the sequel, Tom Clancy's house seems to have learned from its mistakes. The anti-terrorism group called Arcobaleno Sei and led by the incorruptible John Clark will have to take charge of the defense of world democracy by killing all the bad terrorists and rescuing the helpless hostages in pleasant places such as museums, airports, ships, Genoa during the G8 (it's a joke )... As mentioned above, the briefing in Rogue Spear occupies a large part of the gameplay, you can choose the elements of the attack team from a list of agents specialized in different fields such as reconnaissance, demolition and sniping. At this point you will have to divide them into sub-teams and assign them the most suitable equipment then, 3D map of the area in hand, it will be necessary to establish the action plan. This part is certainly the best thing about the title, it will be possible to indicate for each group a path within the playing area and a series of actions to be performed along this path (cover, position camera, defuse bomb...), yes they will also be able to establish 'blocking' points. Let me explain, if at some point along the way I place a block and call it 'Tango', the agents will follow the orders given to that area, then they will stop there until I radio the order 'Tango', at at that point the plan resumes. Brilliant isn't it? Naturally, the roadmap can also be changed on the fly during the game by redistributing orders to remedy the inevitable hitches that every self-respecting plan is bound to have... But is it worth the time? So far I would say that everything is very nice, unfortunately the 'ahinoi' arrive when you take action, the technical realization is in fact very mediocre and denotes how few resources are now being reserved to produce games for this once glorious console. The polygonal complexity of the areas is very little but it is above all the textures that ruin the atmosphere: poorly colored and with a very low resolution, it seems to be in a gigantic mosaic. Disappearing polygons are commonplace, and this bug is often relied upon rather than heat-sensitive glasses (!) to see who is beyond the wall. Animations to forget. But the meager graphics, as we know, are not enough in themselves to demolish a title, unfortunately Rogue Spear also lacks in a field from which, in games like these, one cannot really ignore: artificial intelligence. As far as relook at the colleagues led by the CPU, everything goes well as long as they have a plan to follow, they are dutiful and quite efficient, but in the absence of it they remain motionless like puppets, absolutely unacceptable especially if you have had the opportunity to admire the splendid AI of a game like SWAT3. Even the bad guys are not doing well, they stand still trying to spot the enemy as in every game of the post MGS era, at which point they shoot with millimeter precision (one shot can be enough to decree death). So you will have to be faster than them or, possibly, take them by surprise, at which point they could even decide to surrender and kneel with their hands raised, but strangely, however, there is no option to handcuff them so, in order not to risk it, in these cases I have always preferred execute them with a shot in the back of the neck... but don't tell Amnesty International! ;) Even the pathfinding algorithm fails sometimes, once it happened to me that the hostage I had to escort to the recovery point got stuck against a wall, I tried to give him a push but I passed through him, I tried to shoot him in the leg but... nothing, at that point I got angry and threw a grenade at him, then I turned off the console, and what the hell... Rick Dangerous effect Unfortunately the most serious problem afflicting the opposing AI is what the writer likes to call the 'Rick Dangerous Effect (TM)'. In a nutshell: you enter a room, you forget to check on the left, it happens that there is a criminal on the left, he shoots you, you die. When you replay the mission and re-enter that room, the criminal will always be in the same place but at that point you will know it and act accordingly. In my opinion, this is one of the most deleterious effects in a video game as it leads the player to overcome the mission by memorizing a series of elements death after death, rather than learning tactics and using them constructively. This happens beautifully in SWAT3 (where each game is different from the previous one) but not in Rogue Spear which unfortunately remains a game with good intuitions but poorly made and lacking in personality. The advice therefore is to save the money on the purchase and rather read a book by Clancy, perhaps one with Jack Ryan, that John Clark is more disliked than Bond Pros: The briefing section is excellent The topography of the game arenas is beautiful Cons : Mediocre technical realization AI largely improvable Red October calls Black September: where has Purple April gone? Having become famous for novels full of political fiction and military action, with an extremely realistic cut, with sometimes maniacal descriptions of weapons and war strategies, Tom Clancy has recently launched himself into the world of video games by founding Red Storm Entertainment and has shocked PC users with the first Rainbow Six, an FPS in which mission planning assumed an importance never seen before in the land of shoot-shoot-and-then-maybe-think games. The success of the formula (always on PC eh...) quickly gave birth to the sequel Rogue Spear which, with good delay, now arrives on the Sony box number 1.", "date": "2001-07-14", "grade": null}
