Watching an episode of the cartoon, especially over a certain age, one can't help but roll his eyes every three by two and wonder what the producers' target is. Observing a game of cards as perfect ignoramuses, on the other hand, it almost seems that the duelists speak Martian. We often tend to consider it a puerile version of Magic: The Gathering, the well-known trading card game from which it is inspired, but the reality is that, putting aside the cartoon, and delving into the rules and mechanics of the game, Yu-Gi -Oh! is definitely more strategic and complex than it seems. It is no coincidence that even today, fifteen years after the first printing, it continues to attract followers and to be played in tournaments, fairs, recreation centers and clubs around the world. Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal: World Duel Carnival tries to recreate that feeling on Nintendo 3DS, but fails miserably. World Duel Carnival is a title far too incomplete for even fans to consider The story that doesn't exist Based on the parent series spin-off of the same name, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal stars Yuma Tsukumo, a Duel Monsters player who finds himself dealing with an alien entity called the Astral. The Story mode of World Duel Carnival is a kind of spin-off in turn, and offers twelve separate storylines, each focusing on a different character from the diverse original cast: Yuma, Reginald, Kite, Tori and so on. Here the problems already begin, because in the Japanese version of World Duel Carnival the characters proposed in the Story mode were as many as forty: a senseless reduction which, in fact, undermines the longevity of a title which, as you will soon discover, certainly does not shine for variety . Fortunately or unfortunately, vobis, the loss does not seem to have been so devastating given that the plots told through dialogues and illustrations are far from compelling and present themselves more as mere pretexts to justify the succession of various clashes. The presentation, however, is somewhat lackluster. The dialogues are not spoken (another difference from the Japanese counterpart) and the texts are extremely puerile and inconclusive. Fortunately, each narrative sequence can be skipped by acting on the console's touch screen, but a bit of regret remains because the story mode, being one of only two present, could have been treated much better. Fans of the anime will find that each character has the exact same cards that characterize their style of play in the original series, which certainly gives a more faithful flavor to the games, but undoubtedly limits the possible strategies since the decks are basically pre-packaged. In case you just can't continue with a certain character, therefore, the possibility of changing the difficulty level at any time and retrying each game without the terror of a real Game Over is a panacea. That said, the story mode is also the only one to offer a minimum of replay value, as the various characters are unlocked by completing the various storylines. In short, for fans of the real game, there is free mode. The 3D effect So small that you can easily turn it off and save on battery. Relatively free The Free Duel mode, on the other hand, represents the developer MCP2's real tribute to the die-hard fans of the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game! Which does not mean that there is no room for newbies: the game, on the contrary, even before reaching the main menu, will ask us if we want to learn how to play or if we are already experienced duelists. In this sense, World Duel Carnival does an excellent job of explaining the rules of each game step by step, which become more and more complicated as new concepts are illustrated, but never in an overwhelming or confusing way. We won't stay here to discuss them because a papyrus would come out that nobody would be interested in, least of all the fans who were probably the first to click on this review, but the game manages to reproduce the idea of a game quite effectively to Duel Monsters complete with a customizable playing field and card back. Too bad, however, that the low-resolution illustrations of the various cards do not do the original ones justice in the slightest, ruining one of the best aspects of the franchise a bit. The Free Duel mode allows you to put yourself in the shoes of your own avatar and face the various opponents created for the game at will and, of course, their favorite decks: for this purpose it is possible to freely draw on a pool of over fivethe cards and immediately build your own ideal decks, without limits or restrictions except those imposed by the rules of the game. Unfortunately, however, the aforementioned pool is not updated to the latest releases in terms of cards and game expansions, so the most avid fans could feel the weight of these shortcomings, especially if they aim to reproduce the strategies implemented in reality in-game. Newbies, on the other hand, won't miss it, because there will be another one to weigh on the enjoyment of the title: the multiplayer mode which simply... doesn't exist. Incredible to say, MCP2 has not implemented multiplayer either online or offline, betraying one (if not two, including the concept of card trading) of the principles of the real game, namely competitiveness. A flaw, in our opinion, simply colossal.", "date": "2014-07-21", "grade": "5.0"}
