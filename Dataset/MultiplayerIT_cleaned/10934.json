{"name": "Bionic Commando Rearmed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bionic-commando-rearmed.html", "text": "Bionic Commando, on a par with the various Megaman, Black Tiger and Ghost'n'Goblins, represents one of Capcom's flagship products of the 80s, that is, the period before the advent of Street Figther 2. Released in theaters in 1987, it is an action game with numerous platform elements in which you take on the role of a very special soldier: he is equipped with a bionic arm with the ability to stretch, to allow him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Using his unique abilities and a series of interchangeable weapons, the character must complete four stages to find a captured agent (such as ~Super Joe~ ...) and prevent the enemy army from starting a nuclear war. The ~remake~ just released for consoles (available only through digital channels) offers gameplay extremely similar to the original but enriched by solutions in step with the times, together with a greater number of stages. And it is precisely this version that has been brought to mobile by Capcom, continuing a trend that sees the Japanese publisher converting its most popular titles to mobile devices. The structure of Bionic Commando Rearmed is quite simple: our special soldier must go through a certain number of stages of increasing difficulty, eliminate the enemies he will find in his path and collect a series of key objects that will bring him ever closer to finding ~Super Joe~. Just as the locations become more complex and the opponents increase in number, at the same time we will find ourselves facing increasingly complex boss fights, however characterized by the same objective: to destroy a huge electronic device. The control system appears immediately complete and intuitive: the d-pad moves the character, the # key activates the bionic arm diagonally (to throw it up or forward, we will have to press the relative direction on the d-pad), the key 9 allows us to fire and the key *, finally, to select the weapon among those we have available. Each of them has its strengths and weaknesses, for example the starting weapon is not very powerful but also strikes from a long distance, while the others may prove to be more effective but only up close. Since we won't be able to jump but only duck, firefights will often be decided by speed rather than agility: it will be essential to take enemies by surprise, especially during the advanced stages, when it will take more than one hit to eliminate them. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, Capcom hasn't gotten used to it so far, indeed it has always focused on maximum compatibility rather than on the quality of the graphics. In this specific case, it cannot be said that Bionic Commando Rearmed is a feast for the eyes, but at least we are on levels higher than the previous (and very sad) Lost Planet: Trag Zero and Dead Rising. The sprites boast a discreet design and animation of sufficient quality, while unfortunately the locations suffer from the usual problems: few colors (and badly used), repetitiveness of the graphic elements and often mediocre level design. The interface does its job honestly, but that's not crazy either, far from it. As for the sound, however, there are some positive notes: the developers have included the music of the original Bionic Commando, which perhaps won't drive you crazy for the purity of the sound but can boast the charm of timeless classics.
