{"name": "Unreal Championship", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-championship_b.html", "text": "Unreal Championship Let's start the Unreal Championship Tournament is part of that genre of Fps in which tactics and strategy have little life: action and pure adrenaline predominate over everything. The Digital Extremes game is purely based on Multiplayer, in fact, it supports Xbox Live. The game modes The first time you use the game, before you can start playing, you will need to create a profile which will then be used during the game. You will have at your disposal a wide range of characters, divided in turn into races. Anubans, Automatons and Mercenaries are some of the choices available. Once the profile has been created and selected, you will access the main screen. From here you can choose which game mode to play. There are several modes, the most important are, undoubtedly, ~Single Player~, ~Instant Action~, and ~Training~. The latter is very useful for the less familiar with the game: you will learn to move dexterously within this game and learn the usefulness of the various objects that you will find during the battles. In ~Single Player~ you will have to create your own team, of which you will be the leader, and face battles against other teams. Thanks to these clashes your character, in case of victory, will acquire extra skill points, which will allow him to improve his performance. ~Instant Action~ will catapult you into fights to the death against very fierce bots. You will be able to face each other in a classic, but always effective, Deathmatch, in a Capture The Flag and in particular events such as ~Attack with the Bomb~, in which two teams will face each other, whose aim is to collect the ball placed in the center of the map and deposit it in the opponent's goal. Unreal Championship Ouch, how bad! Playing Unreal Championship is a truly inimitable experience, I can assure you that after a game session you will be shocked by how fast and frenetic it is. The maps on which the fights will take place are very detailed and varied: vast and never monotonous. Despite the size, you will not run the risk of getting lost, you will always be able to stay within the action and therefore in the heart of the game. The primary element of a fps is, of course, the firearm. In this game you will have a wide variety of them at your disposal. You can choose whether to use projectile weapons or laser weapons according to your preferences, you are spoiled for choice. The most powerful and most used weapons are undoubtedly the Fulminator, excellent for hitting from long range, and the rocket launcher, ideal for close combat. Worth noting is the presence of a shield, capable of protecting you from enemy blows, and a teleporter, very useful in Capture The Flag to reach the enemy base. On the battlefield you will come across red and white vials called Adrenaline. Each time you take one the on-screen indicator will increase, once you reach 100 you will be awarded bonuses such as invisibility and regeneration. Unreal Championship The Graphics The graphic aspect of this game is, on the whole, of a good standard. The character models are very well done, and are definitely well characterized. The same goes for the animations, I didn't find any particular defects. Another positive note for the textures, which aided by bump mapping, give a decidedly realistic look to the environments. The graphics engine of Unreal Championship handles the amount of graphics without problems in almost all situations, except for some cases in which, due to the characters on the screen and other factors such as the elements of the backdrops, the game tends to slow down. However, this slowdown lasts for a very short time, one second at most. In any case, taking into account the amount of characters and the characterization of the seabed, the slowdowns are bearable. Unreal Championship Joypad or Mouse, which to choose? Every fan of fps on pc at the sight of an e Pad shudders arguing that the Mouse is better. With the arrival of the Xbox Pad, things have changed. Thanks to the rear triggers, the pad of the Microsoft home console is perfectly suited to this kind of game. Halo was the first to prove it, and now with Unreal Championship the confirmation has arrived. Moving around the game maps is extremely simple and intuitive, the Pad will respond perfectly to your every command. By pressing the right trigger you will activate the primary fire, instead, with the left one, you will activate the secondary fire. Thanks to the front buttons you can perform useful actions in battle. With the A key you can jump, undoubtedly an excellent possibility to dodge blows and to move more easily. With the X and B pot keysnetwork select weapons from your inventory. With the Y key you can activate a function that I particularly appreciated. By pressing the key, a window will appear on the screen that will allow you to manage the team in battle. You will be able to use all the front keys: with A you will encourage and spur your teammates to battle to the death, with B you will order them to defend the base in case of Capture The Flag, with X you will send them to attack the enemy and with Y you can insult your opponents. It goes without saying that insulting an enemy by saying, ~You suck!~ or phrases like that after killing him is particularly satisfying. In addition, it is possible to adjust the Pad to your liking, among the available customizations I mention the adjustment of the sensitivity of the commands and the inversion of the Y axis. Sound Department Gunshots, explosions and screams are the order of the day. All of this undoubtedly helps the player to immerse himself in the game. The game supports Dolby Digital: owners of a good Home Theater system will fully enjoy the battle atmosphere that is felt and experienced within Unreal Championship. The voices of the characters, which change according to race, are overall carefully crafted. Both the game and the manual are written completely in Italian, however, the speech is in English during the Tutorial and in Italian during the battles. Although they remain at a high level, insults in Italian are decidedly less aggressive than in English. Unreal Championship Longevity The Digital Extremes title is undoubtedly based on Multiplayer: the absence of a plot and the only possibility of carrying out deadly battles is proof of this. Contrary to what one might think, all of this is a plus. Indeed, Unreal Championship will always be fun and replayable, there is no possibility that the game will become monotonous and repetitive. Starting from the 14th, players from all over the world will be able to compete online thanks to Xbox Live, thus guaranteeing endless challenges. In addition, thanks to the Voice Communicator it will be possible to interact with your companions, adding that pinch of tactics that you don't mind at all. For now this game may seem incomplete due to the lack of On Line, however, when it is available we will have one of the best titles in our hands. Final Comment Even without the Multiplayer On Line, Unreal Championship is a game able to entertain and excite the player. The well-crafted graphics and excellent gameplay make this title one of the best FPS on Xbox. Even though it seems like a minor game now, by March 14th it could be one of the best games available for Xbox at that time. Pros: -Fun -Playability -Insults against opponents Cons: -Without Xbox Live it might seem limited -Some slowdown The life of fps on consoles has never been easy: the genre, too often labeled as ~PC~ has always been relegated to the background. Today, with Xbox, fans of the genre have found what's right for them. Developed by Digital Extremes, Unreal Championship presents itself to the world of consoles as a frenetic, fun and adrenaline-pumping FPS, based on multiplayer and in no uncertain terms. What will the result be like?", "date": "2002-12-21", "grade": null}
