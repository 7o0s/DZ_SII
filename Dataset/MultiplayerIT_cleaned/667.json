The answer could be yes (with obvious sacrifices), but certainly not with this debut on the two-screen console. Starting from the most successful aspects we can talk about the graphic aspect that manages to be appreciated even if the console can offer more. There is care in the overall presentation of the title, and the will to offer something valid is perceived. The fact engine boasts honest 3d graphics at very stable 60fps, which only yield on very rare occasions in the game. The classic tracks of the series are re-proposed with a certain attention, trying to keep the original atmosphere of the scenario as much as possible, even if sometimes the settings seem a bit desolate. Traffic is reduced to a minimum, and the surrounding cars are undoubtedly sparse in order not to overstretch the game engine, to be honest, even our cars don't shine in terms of construction, but the glance, especially in view of the small DS screen, is at least satisfactory. A legitimate criticism to make of the graphics engine is that you can't always see the obstacles and curves, at least until you have memorized the track. On the 32 in the living room Burnout shot away in an almost worrying way, almost F-zero. The crazy speeds that were reached with the turbo combined with the excellent audio and video effects sometimes left you speechless. This aspect of the game has not been carried over to the DS. However, although the game speed suffers an inevitable limitation, on DS the game still flows with a certain ease and scrolling speed, especially with the cars reaching 300km/h. The effect of the turbo is limited to widening the angle of view a little, and tries to simulate the blur effect of the home version with modest results. If Burnout Legends doesn't deliver the sense of speed properly, the problem lies more with the physics that governs the game, rather than with the speed on the screen itself. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] A rough physics One might have thought that the biggest obstacle for such a conversion would have been the technical aspect, but it proved that despite the cuts, what matters has been ported to DS, it's the turn to take into account other fundamental factors of the game : physics and control system. The programmers have undoubtedly got lost in a glass of water: perhaps forced to leave prematurely, or perhaps because they started off on the wrong foot and were no longer able to get a spider out of the hole. Control of the car is decidedly limited and unbalanced. At first glance, we note that the car does not respond as one would expect to the solicitation of the pad. With small touches you have an immediate but docile response, while holding down you have a slower reaction, which tends to drift. Once the car has been brought sideways, a countersteering stroke results in a total and immediate oversteer from the opposite side, in a completely irrational and uncontrollable response. And so you find yourself from one side of the track to the other without having had the slightest intention. Some cars perform better, but the basic physics are common for all. Other than that, there's no physical sense of speed, splashing at 280kph or 100k seems the same, the only difference is that it widens the corner. All this means that the pleasure of playing in the home versions of the title is not repeated in the same way in this conversion for Nintendo DS. Conflict collisions If for some strange reason the control system turns out to be rather irrational, the same can be said of the collision system. After a thorough test, it almost seems that the game foresees points in which you go into penalties, and others in which you get away, without taking sufficient account of the speed or the way in which you hit the obstacle. It probably won't be like this, but the feeling is still the same. In most guardrails you can easily scrape the whole side by adding the boost as well, while in other points that you will get to know over time, you will discover that the slightest bump could be fatal. Some tracks contain pillars in the middle of the lane, and even if hit with a good deal of the car, the result will be chand your machine following the impact will move a few pixels and will pass unscathed. Rarely after a collision you will ~resurrect~ in the middle of stationary cars, or even in the middle of polygonal structures of the track, with a certain loss of time to get out of the catch. Collisions with traffic are also only sketchy: lightly pinching a car usually results in a fatal collision, and sometimes they appear to be considered a collision even if there was no contact. It will also be problematic to perform some takedowns (that is, crashing the cars against obstacles and traffic) towards the opposing cars. The safest way to take the point is to plug the opponent with a good speed difference. Pushing and hitting the opponent, perhaps trying to throw him off the track, is almost always useless. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Damage count In conclusion, a game that lacks where it should shine cannot claim to aspire to sufficiency. And it's a shame because one gets the impression that the game was almost developed in two moments or with two different teams. On the one hand, the satisfactory graphics engine, and on the other, the lacking game physics. At the beginning the game is also fun, but over time you will discover that some flaws were avoidable, and to be avoided. Despite everything, thanks to the tested and intriguing game formula, interesting game moments will arise, but for the next release (hoping that there will be another one) it is reasonable to expect greater attention to what are the cornerstones of the series. Nobody expects miracles on the Nintendo DS, but if the graphics engine can be functional, there's no reason why the controls and physics shouldn't be too. And perhaps it will be the case, for the next time, to also consider the possibility of removing the Crash mode, at least if it has to be implemented as in this release. If in a game where the main aim is to cause the most spectacular and vast accident possible, both traffic and spectacularity are missing, what remains is only boredom and desolation. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Comment Despite everything, this incarnation of Burnout proves that the series can work on DS too. No one expects the majesty of the home versions, what is expected is that the spirit and frenzy typical of the series is enclosed in a laptop. Burnout Legends would have made it if the controls and physics issues had been fixed, but as it stands, it remains a premise to what can be expected in the coming years. The graphics engine works, and over time it should only be enriched with details and traffic, perhaps highlighting the outline of the curves more. The other defects, on the other hand, can simply be solved with more attention in programming or with more willing people. Absolutely boring sound and inadequate effects, and totally underexploited the features of the DS. It will be for next time. Pros Good graphics engine Good number of cars and tracks Cons Obvious collision and control issues Inappropriate audio tracks, and limited effects No use of DS properties It will be because in Burnout transgression teases the player, it will be for the rather successful arcade-style driving model or for the jaw-to-the-ground technical aspect, but the series has deservedly earned the sympathy of the players since the first episode. Basically Burnout combines the virtual pleasure of driving with a taste for gambling. The more reckless you are, the closer you get to the most destructive crash, and the more you will be rewarded: of course, not everything always goes the right way", "date": "2005-12-28", "grade": null}
