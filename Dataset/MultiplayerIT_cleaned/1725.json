{"name": "World of Demons", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-demons-recensione.html", "text": "The opportunity to write the World of Demons review came as a surprise, as part of a real relaunch of the Apple Arcade platform, which in recent days has seen the release of a large number of new games, some of which made by rather experienced and talented development teams. Well, when it comes to experience and talent with the action genre there is certainly a name that immediately comes to mind, that of PlatinumGames: the authors of Bayonetta, Vanquish and NieR: Automata have demonstrated everything there was to prove over the years, and it's great to see them finally grapple with a mobile game. History World of Demons, Onimaru and Sayo fight in their first meeting. The story of World of Demons draws convincingly on the legends of Japanese folklore, telling how the alliance between men and Yokai has caused the envy and anger of the Oni, who one day decide to declare war on the two races but are defeated .Centuries later, the king of demons Shuten Doji nevertheless manages to free himself from the stone prison in which he had been locked up and launches a new, terrible offensive, subjecting the Yokai to his will and threatening the existence of human beings. Only a handful of warriors seems capable of defeating the armies of the underworld, and it will be the mysterious samurai Onimaru who brings them together. Gameplay World of Demons, a fight sequence. We can say without fear of contradiction that the gameplay, and specifically the combat system, represents the absolute core of the World of Demons experience. What appears before our eyes is in fact a pure action, in which the scenarios play a role in Musou style: they are only the background to the duels we entertain with the corrupted Yokai. However, there is more depth to the mechanics of PlatinumGames' mobile game than one would expect. In fact, although the settings are apparently corridors that develop in a linear way, the more you go on and the more secrets, particular interactions, hidden enemies and other elements appear which, in general, reward exploration and backtracking. Checks World of Demons, the water column created by a Yokai at our service. The combat system of the game appears simple and trivial at first, but acquires consistency very quickly. Whether you manage everything using the touch controls or a perfectly supported Bluetooth controller, the situation changes surprisingly little: both setups are excellent, solid, reactive and precise enough to ensure a quality experience. In addition to the stick to move the character, we have a button dedicated to the basic attack and one to dodging, with different possible combinations. The other inputs are used to manage the Yokai: every single enemy we defeat in the game can become part of our deck, with two fixed slots (subject to cooldowns) and one variable, in which the supernatural minions are stored with their elemental attacks . Yokai: friends and enemies World of Demons, one of the many boss fights in the game. Mixing all these maneuvers creates exciting combat sequences, in which we can hit the enemy on duty with a series of slashes, throw him in the air by calling a Yokai that creates a column of water, hit him with fire from a Yokai-bomb, defend ourselves from more distant opponents by summoning a Yokai of the wind and so on, in the meantime collecting new skills around the level. The variety of creatures we will have to deal with is excellent and examines all the monsters of Japanese legends, presenting each of them with Ukyo-e style name and illustration the first time we meet them. There is obviously no shortage of bosses, which are huge and very beautiful to look at, also linked to Japanese folklore and taken from a long list of Yokai that can be consulted from the options. Personages World of Demons, Sayo is the second playable character and fights using a long spear. As for the protagonists, there are four different characters that we will be able to unlock during the campaign and switch at any time, but choosing only two per mission. Each of them is equipped with a specific type of weapon (sword, spear, hammer, etc.) and has special maneuvers that are obtained as we level up. Both weapons and Yokai can be upgraded using the gold collected during expeditions and other collectibles. This progression in turn allows you to unlock moves and skills that we can use in battle, further enriching the repertoire available to each warrior and increasing the variety of an experience which, as mentioned, lives solely on combatyou. Technical realization World of Demons boasts a graphic style that clearly recalls the classic Okami. In terms of technical realization, World of Demons is certainly exciting due to the clear references to the classic Okami. In fact, we have ~coarse-grained~ cel-shaded graphics, as we would define it: a successful mix of low poly, broad brushstrokes and impeccable artistic direction as regards characters and enemies. The interesting thing is that all this visual abundance moves in a always fluid, at 60 fps stable, both on iPhone 12 Pro and on iPad Pro, with also the possibility of activating three different qualitative presets in order to scale the experience according to the terminal in our possession. World of Demons, Onimaru uses Fire Yokai to defend against enemies. The scenarios, as already mentioned above, unfortunately limit themselves to being the background to the action and it is clear that this peculiar visual style applied to the settings makes it less than one might expect, emphasizing the possible desolation of certain glimpses. Fortunately, there is a lot of variety here too, and the different chapters of the campaign are each characterized by well-defined locations, different from each other. Accompanying the medieval Japanese pictorial style that makes World of Demons so exciting are the ~ in Japanese, subtitled in Italian like any product available on Apple Arcade, and music that perfectly refers to the stereotypes of the genre, capable of accompanying the sequences that alternate on the screen in a very effective way. There are unfortunately also a couple of technical issues which, at the time of writing, have not yet been resolved with an update. Firstly, the camera tends to ~wobble~ violently during fights, especially boss fights, which does not create real inconveniences but it certainly annoys. Secondly, one of the playable characters, the monk Dohzen, it has completely broken collisions and is therefore unusable unless you use the loaded shot and Yokai. These are enormities that will certainly be fixed, we take it for granted, but which inevitably affect the evaluation of the game.", "date": "2021-04-06", "grade": "8.5"}
