{"name": "Struggling: recensione di un platform assurdo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/struggling-recensione.html", "text": "Cyclically the discourse of difficulty comes back into vogue, of the need to always have access to an ~Easy~ mode for difficult games. The discussion, however, often arises around works that, to one extent or another, include some type of statistic that can be raised or lowered ~in an instant~, to make life easier for players. But what happens when a game isn't difficult because the enemies are too powerful, but simply because every pixel is designed to give us trouble? Suffer and move on. Here is our review of Struggling (nomen omen), a game where everyone suffers and no one wins. Except you. Perhaps. Maybe not. A hand game Struggling: Hector and Achilles, in all their beauty What is Struggling? An easy way to imagine it is to think of Getting over it with Bennet Foddy, perhaps mixed a little with Snake Pass. If you don't know either of the two games, know that we are talking about two platformers based on an atypical movement and control system. In Struggling we will in fact have to guide Hector and Achilles, within a series of levels. The two are a ball of flesh with eyes and a mouth, with only two arms to support the whole. We control, with the levers and triggers, the hands of the iliac couple and we use them to grab objects and drag, swing, throw and crash around. By advancing, a couple of powers are also unlocked, namely the possibility of detaching the arms and moving them away (but not too much) from the body and the ability to slow down time for a few moments, so as to successfully execute extremely precise moves (N.B. The percentage of success may vary from person to person, we are not responsible for repeated deaths). By now you will have already widely understood, but we specify that Struggling is certainly not a simple game. The idea of grabbing, throwing, dragging and so on is simple on the surface, but requires a certain level of commitment. Controlling two independent arms requires considerable mental flexibility and if you normally struggle to manage structured control systems, this game is not for you. You can also play in co-op (one arm each), but we have not had the opportunity to test it and, in all honesty, we believe that certain phases would be really tiring in two, given the coordination required for certain movements. Probably, played in cooperation, it could almost become a sort of crazy party game where you can laugh at your failures. Or violently ending social relationships. So let's get the tooth out right away: the game can absolutely be frustrating. Indeed, we take it for granted, we don't believe there is a single player who won't find themselves somewhere in the game huffing and shouting terms that we can't write in this review. The rest of the time, however, he will find some satisfaction in having managed to complete a section. Struggling makes us swing between love and hate for the duration of the adventure. Struggling will make us climb almost everywhere Is it worth playing, then? To answer it, we must first ask ourselves two questions. First of all: are the levels interesting? The answer is yes. Struggling's level design is well done, in some sections inspired and intriguing, with even unique and absurd stages ranging from a motorcycle race to a TV show in which you will have to find your true love (don't ask questions). Above all, the game regularly changes the cards on the table, with new environmental elements that vary the rules and the type of movement we can perform. If at the beginning even just dragging ourselves up a slope seemed like a feat, in the second half we will fly left and right with a certain freedom and knowledge of the facts. There's always a bit of trial and error, with traps placed right where the careless player will end up on their next move. In some sections the team could have made life easier for the player, instead of adding difficulty upon difficulty, but from a title called Struggling it is difficult to expect otherwise. The second question, however, is: do the controls work well? We say ... almost always. Struggling's ~problem~ is that it is based precisely on the idea of toiling and controlling a character in a strange, deliberately uncomfortable way. We control the hands and move them using arms that are almost tentacles which therefore can become entangled in themselves and self-lock in place. When instead we anchor one hand to the ground, our control will pass to the shoulder which will be able to push the body in the desired direction, provided that inclination of the ground, inertia and the other arm are helpful. When we detach an arm, we will no longer have the support of the body, so we will have to reason the movements in a div wayerst. The control system is therefore layered and constantly changing and, in the early stages, your head could explode (not literally, even if in the game it happens to the characters all the time) in an attempt to understand how to move the character correctly. Unfortunately, sometimes the arms get stuck in the ground or with each other and, every now and then, the character freezes on itself and makes it impossible to move quickly: various stages are full of traps or are timed, so even just an indecision involves a game over that we are not to blame. A nonsense plot There are also some unique sections in Struggling Struggling shares with Getting over it with Bennet Foddy the atypical nature of the control system and the desire to give the player a demanding challenge (Foddy's game is much more difficult, mind you), but it certainly doesn't share the narrative component. Foddy has created a game that discusses consumerism and digital culture, the art of gaming and the concept of difficulty and frustration, which he sees as a positive force, if perhaps a little masochistic. Stuggling is a game about a ball of flesh that screams in pain continuously and farts when it loses its arms. Don't expect a sensible game world, in fact, be prepared for some completely nonsensical sections as well. For the record, however, we specify that there is a sort of plot. By grabbing javelins one can travel at great speed in Struggling In ancient times, humanity was saved from Evil by some Heroes (deformed humans, essentially). A King, however, drove out the Heroes who finally disappeared, leaving to posterity a prophecy linked to two brothers who would reunite the community of Heroes. In modern times the prophecy comes true, with the only problem that Hector and Achilles are almost brainless, deformed beyond belief and that the world is now in disarray. The whole adventure refers to ancient Greece, with characters such as Ulysses, Pandora, Paris and so on, who however have little to do with the original figures, as they are also beings with poor physical and intellectual abilities. In essence, judging Struggling for the narrative component makes little sense, because it itself does not try to give purpose to the whole game. Even the environments vary randomly, going from a laboratory, to caves, to a canyon in perfect Wild West style, arriving at a dream world in which the developers have completely abandoned all brakes and have only mixed random things one after the other. On a stylistic level, Struggling is not very original, a very classic full-color cartoon. It's nothing unique, but it gets the job done. The sound is also pleasant: the music can be heard, but it is the screams of suffering of Ettore and Achille that make the difference; more than once we realized that we had an expression of pure disgust on our faces (in a positive sense, eh) in seeing and hearing the tribulations of the characters.", "date": "2021-09-08", "grade": "7.7"}
