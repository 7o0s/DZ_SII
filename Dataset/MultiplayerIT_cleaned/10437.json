A real challenge that sees us fully committed to every single game, aware that in the event of a defeat, recovering those three points won't be easy at all. But it is also a way of living that imaginary made up of heroes, clashes and fallen that men have built and scuttled in the name of existential competition and under the aegis of the god of money. There is also the good old 2d view. The expectations of the team, the job offers and everything in between, from interviews to gossip, are the element that manages to give life to the structure that is as solid as it is mechanical in football simulators. This is the distinctive point of Football Manager. Even more than the immense database, although the latter remains fundamental and makes it possible for every gamer to become the coach of his favorite team or of a team linked to some particular memory. A solid base that enhances the importance of Cassano's statements, undecided whether or not to leave Sampdoria, and the news that Gervaso Bunker went into a rage when asked what he thought about the statements of the Apulian champion. More complex, more accessible The goal of the guys from Sports Interactive is to make everything accessible quickly and painlessly. An easy thing to do in the progressive sections where from the tactics selection window we switch to the one where we can motivate the players to finally get to the match. A less easy thing to do when the player is faced with a superhuman amount of options. The renewed interface This is why the main screen was developed thinking directly of the new versions of web portals, designed to be readable and usable as a whole in a few moments. The main items that allow access to specific management screens are located at the top. On the right stands the key that allows you to proceed with the game phases while the contents to be consulted are located in the center of the screen. The main page contains a summary of all the important items, starting with the games on the left and ending with the news and transfers that usually appear on the right. Furthermore, a tutorial accompanies us constantly, appearing at the top right when we are blocked or when we are faced with particularly complex or important choices. Sometimes we are given simple explanations explaining what certain screens mean, in other cases advice that also appears during loads and finally useful shortcuts related to activities we may have overlooked. Novelty Why only talk to players before the game or in the locker room? Nature has endowed soccer coaches with powerful voices for the sole purpose of making them howl desperately at unruly or confused players. Well it's time to use that voice and it's damn fun to do it. But this is not the only novelty even if it is the most relevant and is able to give much more depth to the vision of the match in three dimensions. Other additions concern the aesthetics which can be customized at will starting from the graphic skin. Furthermore, the possibility of subscribing to specific news bulletins allows us to have personalized information on cups, teams and even on individual players. Integration between menu and game And we can finally tell our collaborators which line to hold during a press conference we prefer not to attend. The editor has also been enhanced and allows you to add minor leagues that connect to existing ones and to add new ones, modify the rules of existing ones and create incredibly detailed rulesets to generate competitions of all kinds. Finally, it is possible to modify the finances and the approach to the market of a team in order to be able to add specificities that further increase the depth of the title. To all this we add the Analyze This tool, which shows us the main actions and movements made by the players during the match through very clear drawings, and the comments of the supporters, less useful from a purely tactical point of view but essential for filling the stands Curiosity The Football Manager series is actually the continuation of the Championship Manager series but the name remained in the hands of Eidos who used it for a new line of football managers. Sports Interactive therefore found itself forced to find a new name and decided to acquire the title of a series that was successful way back in 1982. The first Football Manager, developed by Kevin Toms and distributed by Addictive Games, for thisAnto imperfect and limited, it was a pioneering title in the arena of management titles. Technical details The arrangement of the players on the field is bound by a grid and is therefore less free than in the Scudetto 2010 which excels in this field, also allowing game tactics to be tested. For the rest, Football Manager 2010 can be considered more than complete, starting from the 400,000 players in the database to get to the options for preparing them, managing collaborators and scouting. And the integration of these elements into the fabric of the game is incredible. A response in a press conference can not only influence the decisions of our players, but it can make the team we manage attractive or not to those from other clubs who we may want to sign. A wrong answer can even affect the number of fans present at the matches and that is relentlessly displayed by the three-dimensional engine during the matches. The great defect of Football Manager 2009, if it can be defined as great since many do not even use the 3D engine for matches, was the woodenness of the players compensated, however, by the public in the stands. Well, the 100 new animations don't work miracles but they improve the situation by giving the players more credible movements. The improvements in the management of lights and shadows are also evident, which finally give three-dimensionality to the image and make us forget the flat and tasteless field of FM 2009. Certainly the hardware requests rise but remain within the reach of the vast majority of gamers and we must admit that even with all the variables activated, the loads are still quite rapid. If you don't have a particularly powerful computer, it is still possible to reduce the size of the championships, perhaps excluding the minor competitions, to keep the ~reasoning~ times within acceptable limits.", "date": "2009-10-26", "grade": "9.0"}
