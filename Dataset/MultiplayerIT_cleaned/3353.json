{"name": "Kingdom Under Fire 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-under-fire-2-recensione.html", "text": "Finally, we have come to the review of Kingdom Under Fire 2, a long-awaited new chapter - and finally arrived in the western version - of a series that has been able to effectively mix action, strategy and RPG elements. It is therefore not surprising that this sequel, available on PC and coming to consoles in the future, still focuses on the combination of different elements. But in doing so it takes a more modest path on the one hand, in terms of visual detail, and on the other a more tortuous one, pushing more forcefully on the strategic component and tinged with an MMO. Kingdom Under Fire in an MMO key A tough task for Bersia's leader, busy not only with managing troops of various kinds, but also forced to deal directly with the enemy on the battlefield by dodging flaming arrows, huge boulders, spells and frightening blows delivered by monstrous creatures. And this is precisely the heart of Kingdom Under Fire II, however set in an MMO context that allows you to obtain experience points, new troops to be deployed on the battlefield, upgrades to evolve them, materials, equipment items and consumables, facing with only hero, momentarily deprived of his army, the classic massively online game missions. It follows the modern current, therefore, even if with a little delay compared to the promised timing, so much so that it suffers from an MMO component that does not add much to the gameplay, resulting more than anything else functional to strengthen our hero and the ranks of the army in sight of the main missions and raids where instead the action and strategic components are in command, even in cooperative or PvP, both reinterpreted in a different key compared to the original formula. Fortunately, the MMO breakthrough does not include any pay-to-win element despite Kindom Under Fire II (paid by us) in some markets is distributed with the free-to-play mode. There are equipment and inventory slots to unlock, there are tickets to resurrect troops and heroes, there are prize boxes of various kinds and there are items related to the three purchasable packages, but everything can be unlocked by playing, accumulating the currency called cubic and connecting regularly. Just a few aesthetic microtransactions for mounts and characters remain out, which is largely understandable given the very long gestation period. Furthermore, the online structure makes sense in contextualizing the two factions and guilds, all elements necessary to obtain special skills and to try their hand at PvP, but it offers very little more. In fact, it is limited to the unstimulating missions of killing monsters and collecting materials which, in addition to debasing the gameplay, castrated by the presence of a few poorly intelligent enemies, force us to go back and forth from characters placed a few meters from each other, sipping tons of dialogues that very often border on total uselessness. Luckily the areas intended for the distinctly MMO component are small, a click on the map activates the autopilot, the quests are short, the guided exploration and the approximately 200 hours of content ensure a less boring leveling phase than in other titles, but however, the experience is diluted and as you level up the grinding and repetitiveness begin to make themselves felt. The missions of the campaign therefore become even more important, bringing us back to the purest dimension of the series between structured operations, castles to conquer, a rather articulated plot and a gameplay that finally finds its dimension, starting from the third-person action component that catapult into the midst of hordes of hundreds of enemies. Action and strategy mix The main missions of Kingdom Under Fire II offer quite a varied range of situations. There are dragons blocking our way, troops that attack us from unreachable positions, huge monsters, cannons and even castles to conquer. Not everything is made with the care that we would have liked to see after years of waiting, we say it right away, starting with the artificial intelligence of the enemies and troops that borders on the non-existent. But overall the campaign manages to push us to use all the possibilities at our disposal, from the skills of archers who can kill opponents out of reach to direct combat, perhaps at the head of our ground troops, which allows us to quickly eliminate entire contingents of monsters with our hero or heroine. The five available classes are in fact gender locked, although the complex character editor guarantees a good margin of customization, and they are all also differentiated by skills, with the arrival at the tenth level and the capital which, in addition to unlocking the world map, allows you to spend points for purchaseUse new skills, including more powerful masteries, increasing hero customization. The setting of the characters, however, remains the basic one. The gunslinger combines sword and pistols to attack even at medium range, while the spellsword, despite having magic available, fights at close range, like the massive berserker. The ranger, on the other hand, can make more effective use of distance, like the elementalist who can rely on both spells and her animal companion. But they are all united by an offensive and frenetic gameplay that is based on activation or chaining skills and special shots that merge into a large number of short and effective combinations. The influence of the MMO breakthrough, however, is also felt on the gameplay, with numbered skills and cooldowns, but between basic attacks, dodges, final moves and short combos that can be chained in a large number of different ways, the character is always on the move, dragging us into a tight action that gives satisfaction when dozens of enemies are thrown into the air between explosions, huge creatures and evolutions of our hero. But as pleasant as it is, the action must take into account the strategic component that allows us to switch to a Total War-like view with a key. Compared to a classic RTS, things are simplified, also due to missions with a decidedly guided structure, but there is no lack of special abilities to make the function of each of our troops even more unique, all characterized by strengths and weaknesses of which we must take into account to avoid nasty surprises. Among other things, the strategic component has a decidedly complex background, with 120 different units to obtain, upgrade and carefully select, given that the maximum number is severely limited even once all the army slots to be taken on missions have been unlocked. Planning therefore also becomes very important, since it can make the mission easier for us, but it also has an interesting downside, since in the event of a mistake it gives more importance to the hero who can save the situation. However, it is difficult to run out of options and it is always possible to reformulate or upgrade the army to overcome a particularly difficult mission, perhaps by spending a little more on the mission preparation screen which allows you to encourage the troops with extra pay. Graphics, problems and room for improvement Overall Kingdom Under Fire II is an interesting title capable of giving satisfaction, also from the point of view of the main plot which tells the events following what happened in Circle of Doom. But as we have already said, not everything is made with the care we would have hoped to see, starting with the technical component. If the models of the protagonists and non-player characters are cared for, the same cannot be said of the monsters. Some creatures are more inspired than others, but between the lack of variety, invisible walls and polygonal poverty there is very little to enjoy in the face of a title that tests our patience also due to bugs that hinder our path. bosses that move erratically blocking us against walls and assorted ingenuity. Fortunately, the eye remains when loading hundreds of units, but even in this case the gaze falls more often on low-quality textures and design flaws than on the merits. Of course, the technical setting is functional for battles with hundreds of fighters and for the strategic view, which is more pleasant by moving the camera away from the ground, but the overall yield disappoints even taking all this into account, thanks to the very unoriginal poutpourri of Japanese elements and medieval to which we are already accustomed, but which by making a great mix of different elements ends up making the qualitative disparities between the models even more evident. Fortunately, things are slightly better in the city, but they get worse in the areas intended for quests and farming, small and poorly cared for despite the framerate, in 1440p, being able to drop below 60fps even with a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti mounted on a Ryzen 7 3700X. On the other hand, the music is saved, however these are subject to an uproar of genres and not always spot on, but of decent quality like the interlude scenes which, except for some problems with dubbing, are made with a certain care, graphics engine permitting. No problem, however, with the interface. Once the shortcuts are memorized, it becomes easy to navigate between game modes, skills, equipment, information and the multiplayer menu, which allows you to join an existing party, provided you have already unlocked the mission they face, or to create one either as a cooperative function, is looking for PvP sessions. Furthermore, the Sonce online has another positive side, guaranteeing the continuous evolution of a title which in terms of balance and content is destined to change with the addition of new classes and new troops to which we hope will add some content capable of making sense, even from an end game perspective, to the MMO component.", "date": "2019-11-22", "grade": "6.5"}
