{"name": "Espgaluda II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76401-espgaluda-ii-sparando-tra-le-nuvole.html", "text": "When we talk about video games and technology, especially if we have been ~militants~ in these fields for several years, we cannot help but notice how constant and sustained progress is towards three dimensions, photorealism or in any case a certain type of experience that seeks to involve all the senses, to bring the videogame medium ever closer to an interactive cinematographic one and where perhaps, unfortunately we would add, only budget and double-digit productions emerge and supported by a not indifferent media boost. If you like, iPhone is the emblem of technological modernity, but also a welcoming port for many interesting productions made without exorbitant prices. This is thanks to the App Store model, capable of ensuring good revenues and visibility in any capacity that has a minimum of interesting ideas. And so even the so-called ~old school~ can still have its say, in this case the group of ~shoot'em ups~, a genre typically in two dimensions with vertical or horizontal scrolling that depopulated a few decades ago on consoles and in arcades, and where in command of the most disparate ships and characters you had to make your way through a myriad of opponents and projectiles, in a real exercise in style and skill with the controller, up to memorable productions from a visual point of view, of spectacularity but also of difficulty, which have framed this genre as one of the most hardcore and niche ever made, and with the Dreamcast hosting the last large number of exponents. Shoot'em all! Espgaluda II is actually a not very recent vertical scrolling shoot'em up, at least as far as the arcade is concerned, where it first appeared in 2005. A recent transposition for Xbox 360 only in the Japanese version brought it back to the fore, until to reach the current version on the iPhone, adapted in the control system and in the modalities available. The graphic style of the game is typically Japanese in the creation of the main characters and enemies (after all, the developer comes from the Rising Sun) and is definitely surprising for its realization. The title, currently only compatible with the latest generation iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch, scrolls through extremely fluid levels, full of detail and with lots of ships and structures on the screen, all accompanied by explosions, camera changes and more. A small jewel therefore from a visual point of view, strengthened by a rousing soundtrack and which goes perfectly with the frenetic action of the game. Espagaluda II offers two modes, one called iPhone Mode, the other Arcade Mode. The game structure first of all foresees three difficulty levels, which differ in the amount of energy possessed by the enemies and the number and speed of the projectiles; a second screen instead offers the choice of the complexity of the control system again among three types, where one or more aspects among those listed below are automated. Finally, the three main protagonists differ in the type of weapon available rather than in resistance and speed, they have two different types of shots, a shield indicated by a bar at the bottom left and finally the possibility of entering ~awakening mode~ (the game is only in English, and therefore we will use the original names without venturing into improbable translations) thanks to which while your ship remains motionless, you can touch the screen to generate shock waves capable of eliminating enemies, and also transform them bullets in gold to increase the score multiplier. To use this feature you need to accumulate the spirit gems, green crystals released by destroyed enemies and necessary to get the better of the most frantic actions. The shield is activated automatically when hit, until the appropriate bar is exhausted, while it is also possible to use it independently to take advantage of the destructive attack that can be released after its use. The movement is delegated to the classic scrolling of the finger on the screen - it is possible to decide in the options the area dedicated to the game and the lower space reserved for the finger itself, although it is also possible to move it across the whole screen - while there are also the mega bosses at the end level. The difference with the iPhone mode as regards the Arcade mode is to be found in the awakening mode; in this case entering this state only serves to increase one's own points multiplier and upon completion there is a sudden acceleration of the opponent's projectiles. From the point of view of playability Espgaluda II performs very well, it is a fun and arremba titlewhere the level of difficulty is always well calibrated, never frustrating and with a control system that works decidedly well, thanks also to the choice of the already mentioned three different degrees of complexity. To get the most out of fun and scoring, it is absolutely recommended to use at least intermediate control, since managing the shield allows you to make the best use of your energy and save your skin in the most delicate moments, without wasting even the potential derived energy attack. It is therefore one of those games that we can define as ~addictive~, with six different levels available and the possibility of tackling a specific one after unlocking it, in the two modes listed above. To close the account there is the always welcome support for Open Feint, an Xbox Live and PSN-style social network that offers an online ranking system for scores, vital for this genre of games, friends list and achievements, linked to the completion of the various modes, to face all the levels without going through the game over and to perform in rather high combos. The icing on the cake would have been a cooperative mode via bluetooth or online, but at the moment it seems to be difficult to implement from a technical point of view. Longevity is therefore all linked to how much one is kidnapped by the game system, in search of the best score and on completing the title with all the characters and difficulty levels.
