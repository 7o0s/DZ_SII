{"name": "Silicon Dreams: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silicon-dreams-recensione.html", "text": "From Philip K. Dick's Electric Sheep to today, the cyberpunk imaginary has been filled with androids, no doubt also thanks to the success of the film Blade Runner based on the novel just mentioned. An imaginary that has filled practically all sectors of entertainment, including that of video games which, beyond Cyberpunk 2077, has long since shown that it is not indifferent to its charm. We will talk about the classic aspects of this imaginary today with the review of Silicon Dreams, a game developed and published by Clockwork Bird which draws heavily on some well-known elements of the genre from which it draws its setting. As for the video game itself, however, the genre is that of the interrogation simulator, within which we are called to put human and non-human subjects under pressure for the reasons we will see. Advancing in the story told by Silicon Dreams we will go through truths and lies, going to determine with our behavior which side we want to be on, facing inevitable ethical doubts until we reach the epilogue. The plot: an android chasing androids The plot of Silicon Dreams takes place in 2065, the year in which androids have now become part of everyone's daily life. In this situation, large companies such as Kronos Robotics have gradually assumed more and more power within society, in some cases even assuming the right to carry out dirty operations. The android models have meanwhile become more and more advanced, to the point that in many cases they cannot be distinguished from real humans. However, like all machines, even the androids of Kronos Robotics need maintenance. Not to mention the models that through specific systems have undergone hacks to look even more like people in the flesh, thus making even the most attentive eye questionable. Where the gaze is no longer enough, our work arrives within the game. Indeed, Silicon Dreams puts us in turn in the shoes of a particular android model, specialized in conducting interrogations. We are therefore employed by Kronos Robotics itself, to be exact in the maintenance department where the models deemed potentially defective, or as we said hacked, are sent. With the tools at our disposal we will therefore have to ask all the questions necessary to find out what the truth is, finding ourselves as imaginable in the face of situations that often seem to contradict each other and then decide whether to send the interrogated person away without doing anything to him, send him in for repair or even decommission it. Without going further into the details of the plot, we can say that it is a fairly classic scenario for the genre from which Silicon Dreams draws its setting, perhaps too much since overall it smacks enough of what has already been seen. All of this is naturally built to arouse empathy towards the questioner, in order to influence the player's ability to judge. This while Kronos Robotics promises a career and luxurious apartments, instilling further doubts in our heads. The choices made lead to multiple endings, while given the nature of the game, its duration proves to be very variable depending on the approach adopted in the interrogations. The gameplay: beware of emotions In terms of gameplay, Silicon Dreams rests a large part of its dynamics on the question and answer that arises from the questions we have at our disposal. The initial arguments are linked to the subject's file that we can always consult, also paying attention to details that may seem collateral. Going forward in the game we will also be able to count on other elements to draw from. One of the first suspects, for example, will arrive accompanied by a personal diary in which to find important details to try to contradict the interrogated subject with himself. In other cases, however, it will happen that you receive additional information while the interrogation is in progress. By asking the right questions at the right time, others may appear to allow us to obtain the information we are looking for. Each interrogation is in fact associated with a separate report, within which Kronos Robotics asks us to answer specific questions about the android (or human being) interrogated. What has just been said can leverage the emotions felt by those in front of us, for example managing to pull out information by instilling fear and surprise in their mind, or vice versa by gaining their trust. In a diametrically opposite way, such emotions may be keeping us from getting the answers we want, methus leaving us in a position to have to struggle further to access the details sought. In addition to the questions, there are obviously other tools to allow us to be more ~persuasive~ in our interrogations, however, with their use, we raise further doubts about the ethical aspect of what we are doing. In short, to get to the end it will be necessary to have a little stomach, especially when the truth of the facts begins to make its way before our eyes. Graphics and sound: could do more The aspect related to the graphics of Silicon Dreams is undoubtedly the least inspired overall, ending up as we are about to see also affecting the gameplay. In fact, the developers' choice was not to literally put us in front of the subject we are questioning, allowing us to see him live only through a few cameras pointed at him. The suspect is in fact in a sort of interrogation room to which, however, we do not have access except via remote connection. The impossibility of looking in detail in the face of who we are addressing therefore ends up taking away something from the empathetic factor, contrary to what happened for example in Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived where we could clearly distinguish the expressions on the faces after the questions. In the case of Silicon Dreams, on the other hand, we are limited to the levels reported by a series of sensors, which while being useful in indicating the levels of joy, fear, surprise and other emotions of the person being questioned remain a bit too aseptic. As for the sector little audio to report: the soundtrack properly resumes the theme dictated by the setting of the game. Given the nature of Silicon Dreams, it is also advisable to evaluate one's knowledge of English: in fact, there are numerous texts, so a solid foundation of the language allows you to grasp all the elements necessary to be able to move forward.", "date": "2021-04-16", "grade": "6.5"}
