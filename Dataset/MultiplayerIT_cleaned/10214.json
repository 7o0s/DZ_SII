{"name": "Dante's Inferno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/74306-dantes-inferno-una-crociata-per-beatrice.html", "text": "~In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark forest...~ this sentence represents for many people an indelible memory of the school period, the one in which teaching often failed to highlight the greatness of some literary works, either due to the ineffective system in making learning dynamic and pleasant, or due to the very greatness of the works dealt with, which always clashed with the limited time available. For many other younger players it represents a current nightmare, but the next time you hear this verse, mostly ~recited~, it will be for something more frivolous and fun, even for a video game. Dante's Inferno actually knows life, death and miracles, thanks to the powerful media tam tam operated by Electronic Arts in this regard, for the less attentive it is a third-person action title that re-proposes a revised and corrected version of the Divine Comedy, in this case the part dedicated to Hell. In this context, the main protagonist is indeed an athletic and well-trained Dante Alighieri, who after returning from a crusade finds his adored Beatrice lifeless - just as the demo begins - and about to be swallowed up in Hell, until remote from its circles. Hence the frantic chase to the sound of bloody fights and scythes in Dante's possession, in order to reach Beatrice and at the same time atone for those sins with which the poet in the crusader version was stained during his numerous battles. The emperor of the painful kingdom During the development of the game there was a lot of talk about the similarities between Dante's Inferno and the God of War series, and actually there are several points of contact with the production of Sony Santa Monica, starting from the type of gameplay, to the style used for the combos to finish with the quicktime events and so on, so much so that it takes little effort to get used to the game dynamics. However, it must be said that the production of Visceral Games (the same as the excellent Dead Space) also has in its repertoire a whole series of peculiar ideas, such as the progression of the main character - we will come back to it later - the puzzle part and precisely the historical background /cultural above. The license which the title can boast has opened the field to an interesting exposition of the events and realization of the settings, since, just like in the Divine Comedy, each circle represents a cardinal sin, and waiting for Dante there are different types of enemies . As mentioned, the main protagonist is in possession of a scythe to counter them and a whole series of spectacular combos, which can be performed thanks to the use of the square, assigned to light attacks, and the triangle for heavy ones. There is also the possibility of grabbing enemies with R2, parrying blows with L2 and unleashing a whole series of spells that are acquired as the descent into hell proceeds, thanks to the combination of the L1 key and the four front buttons. Particularly interesting is the use of the circle button, which allows you to throw white crosses (reminiscent of the various Castlevanias) which are very effective in the combos themselves or in ranged and upward attacks. Still with a view to free adaptation in the work, shortly after the start of the game, the crusader Dante acquires the possibility of condemning or acquitting particular types of more difficult enemies, after having weakened them. Following the choice made, in addition to the souls absorbed for each classic killing, experience points are obtained which increase one of the two bars in Dante's possession, and which are used to obtain one of the 7 levels that distinguish Impiety and Sanctity, the two inclinations of the main protagonist. This sort of dualism is also reflected in the progression of the main character: there are in fact two precise branches, always indicated by Impiety and Sanctity, which, based on the level reached, allow you to spend the acquired souls to unlock spells, energy or mana upgrades and specific skills . Dulcis in fundo, there is no shortage of collectibles of different types, a diary of Dante's travels, with interesting quotes from the Divine Comedy and above all the relics, sacred objects that allow you to add passive skills to Dante such as mana regeneration, increased defense and so on . These are the foundations of Dante's Inferno, which translate into an automatic camera action that follows the player through the various levels, interspersed with dialogues with the poet Virgil, Dante's guide through the various circles, and boss fights that resume characters such as Charon, Cerberus and so on. Presentthe puzzle part is also conspicuous, based on the resolution of environmental puzzles of various kinds, ranging from the simple ones of activating gears up to some more complex ones that must be completed within a certain amount of time. A good part of these puzzles is quite interesting and certainly represents the best part of the Visceral Games production, together with the combat system, which makes the various fights fun and immediate, never boring even if present in large numbers. This is also thanks to the fact that the title always runs at 60 frames per second in any situation, which has allowed the programmers to return a fluid and immediate response to commands, which allows you to have full control over all the combos and in the most confusing clashes leaving their correct execution solely to the skill with the pad. Dante's Inferno is therefore a title that lets you play, entertains and offers a good variety for enemies, bosses and puzzles, drawing from an already written literary work and often proposing a disturbed but effective enemy design, as in the group of the lustful or in that of the greedy where each enemy has a very specific personality. Playstation 3 trophies Dante's Inferno offers 43 trophies, of which 3 are gold and 13 are silver. To get them all you have to defeat the various types of enemies, complete the game, make a predetermined number of combos, absolve some souls and complete the entire path of Impiety and Sanity in full, acquiring all the spells. Nothing complicated, but to get all the souls necessary for the above spells you have to play the title at least once and a half, something less by facing it directly on the highest difficulty level. I was sad that day However, where the merits end, various flaws also begin, linked above all to some questionable design and difficulty balancing choices. To complete the title you need from 8 to 9 hours, after which an additional difficulty level is unlocked and the ~Gates of Hell~ mode is added, based on a series of arenas to be tackled in succession and with some rules, up to their completion. The thing that is noticeable going forward in the single player campaign is how the title lacks particularly spectacular ideas and above all how in the final part it seems to have been ~stretched~ to lengthen its already not striking longevity. In the eighth circle in particular, the 10 pits are represented by some similar arenas that must be overcome to get to the final boss, which is also not very memorable. It is inevitable that this affects the quality of the title a little, as well as a level design which, on the one hand, has the advantage of reducing backtracking (having to cross the same area several times) to practically zero on the other proposes a rather basic and in some cases sketchy progression. And again, shortly after mid-game it is possible to access a couple of skills and spells that unbalance the difficulty level in your favor, as one is used to regenerate mana, the other health; therefore, a moment of foresight is enough to almost always avoid being killed, lowering the challenge in concert. Finally, referring to a gameplay that has been continuously refined over the years, it is easier to notice how the camera and the control system have some problems in this sense, especially in the platform sections, where sometimes distances are not perceived well and the programmers have imposed in a too marked and unnatural way where it is possible to hang or not, such as for example when there is a circular platform reached by a bridge with lava on the sides: it is possible to hang only near the bridge, if you try from the side, where the conformation of the rocks is exactly the same, you book a nice bath at high temperatures. The technical system as mentioned is extremely solid thanks to the frame rate and the creation of the backgrounds, which can boast some very pleasant views to see. In particular we liked the bosses, detailed and with good aesthetic taste (always relatively speaking), and the creation of some circles such as that of gluttons and heretics. The same thing cannot be said for the polygonal detail, which is rather low especially in the enemies, for all that series of particle effects that slightly lower the overall impact, and for the light sources, elementary and without any adequate reflection effect on structures and characters. Beyond the questionable choice or not to readapt Dante's Inferno in this way, whose definitive judgment we leave to the taste of each individual, the production of Visceral Games unfortunately remains average from a purely narrative point of view, with few twists, exposed in a rather anonymous way, and dialogues that alternate verses taken exactly from the Divine Comedy and others instead rendered in a more ~courtly~ form by exchanging verbs and adjectives. The result is rather fluctuating, with some passages that are certainly not easy to use, especially for younger gamers. The dubbing - completely in Italian - in any case is interesting as well as the music, which accompanies the player and blends well with what is happening on the screen. The Dante to come Inside the Blu-Ray of Dante's Inferno there is a movie announcing the creation of the expansion called ~The Torments of Saint Lucia~, which will be available starting from April 29 at an as yet unspecified cost. Each player will have an editor at his disposal to create combat arenas that can also be tackled in cooperative mode, complete with online rankings. From what can be seen from the video, it will be possible to choose the setting by drawing from those of the game, the number and type of enemies and the spells/combos available to the participants. An interesting idea that we look forward to trying firsthand, and that could give the game new longevity.", "date": "2010-02-03", "grade": "8.0"}
