And let's not talk about those enclosed in a chessboard but integrated into explorable cities, outposts of a destroyed world full of desperate people ready to do bad business risking their lives. On the other hand, this is the formula of a couple of titles with an isometric view that have left their mark, those two Fallouts from which Bethesda has pulled out its three-dimensional sequels, a new title on the way and also a spin-off created by Obsidian. Company founded, among other things, by the designer of the first chapters of the series that those who have had the patience to face, given some asperities, will hardly forget. But despite the evolution there are those who have remained faithful to the original formula, the isometric one and tied to the so-called ~on-the-go~ turn-based formula which with Fallout 2, produced by Fargo at the time head of Interplay, pushed the game of role towards its maximum two-dimensional expression. An excellent result, capable of elevating the name of Chris Avellone, who later became a star of the RPG genre with Planescape: Torment, who on that occasion held both the role of designer and game director, alongside Tim Cain. We owe all this to the first Wasteland, a milestone that has Brian Fargo among its fathers, a title that in 1988 marked the history of post-nuclear role-playing games. And it was also a commercial success, so successful in sales that work on two sequels soon started. But Fountain of Dreams went a separate road, while the concept of Wasteland 2 stalled to end up, several years later, in the production of Fallout. Something, however, must have remained in Fargo's drawers while Interplay closed its doors and InXile Entertainment was born from its ashes. In the meantime, crowdfunding has arrived, the classics are back in fashion and a new wave of success has arrived for turn-based RPGs, and so here we are, at the end of 2012, with Wasteland 2 being funded on Kickstarter. campaign worth more than 3 million dollars, out of 900,000 requested, which allowed Fargo to take control of its creature with a sequel that finally came out in 2014, 26 years after the debut of its predecessor. An old school title While influenced by the first two Fallouts and further modernized thanks to the use of a three-dimensional engine, Wasteland 2 looks directly at its predecessor, with a team of four characters that we can customize in terms of aesthetics, stats and abilities. Hurry up the formalities, we start immediately with an important mission, embark on the exploration of a world that 15 years after the events of the first chapter is finally starting to recover. It begins, we said, because it is still devastated by radiation and is infested with the worst rabble imaginable, an army of cultists and brigands who threaten the safety of civilized outposts. And it is in this context that we find ourselves acting as heralds of justice, Rangers sent here and there across the travel map that gives way to the isometric view once you arrive in a location, with turn-based combat automatically activated as soon as someone attacks someone else. The player is therefore faced with the tactical choices he has made previously, with the composition of the group and the related skills that are decisive in order to overcome the difficult fights. Without a doctor then, things get complex and to all this must be added luck and choices in the field, which are just as important. Wasteland 2 does not forgive mistakes even at the lowest difficulty level, prompting us to look for the right position, preferably raised, before the henchmen controlled by a rather effective artificial intelligence do it, attacking from the optimal distance for each weapon. Making mistakes means suffering a lot of damage and risking your life which is already worth little in a world full of dangerous puzzles, deadly traps and complex situations, but giving us great satisfaction in advancing through the missions thanks to the excellent characterization of the characters. And of course thanks to a main plot that is nothing short of compelling with countless well-crafted dialogues that also allow us to carry out small investigations and take advantage of the social skills of our characters. All seasoned with the importance of the choices made and the timing that can compromise a mission, perhaps following the decision to help someone met on the way or who contacts us by radio. Unfortunately the side quests aren't always successful, with some not even trying to hideits nature of mere filler, but from a qualitative point of view Wasteland 2 is a very thick turn-based RPG, a concentrate of atmosphere, irony and post-nuclear action, modest in graphics but finished like few others in terms of tactics and narrative quality. The technical question Already rich in content, Wasteland 2 grows further with the Director's Cut which includes 8000 new lines of dialogue, voice dubbing, a couple of new songs for the suggestive soundtrack and an evolution of the graphics engine which in the transition from version 4.5 to 5 of Unity has gotten a new lighting system, topped off with increased detail, animation improvements, and a generally more defined look. All this is not enough to sweeten the pill on the TV, where the poor detail and low budget of the cutscenes are all too visible, but thanks to some valid textures and the macabre details of the combat, the spartan title InXile does not fare badly on the move, true trump card of the Nintendo hybrid that is hoarding titles of all kinds. Sure, some sometimes feel a little forced on Switch, but when you can slip a game like Wasteland 2: Director's Cut into your pocket, a massive 80-hour RPG that represents the pinnacle of post-nuclear turn-based RPG, it is easy to give in to the temptation to turn a blind eye to some imperfections and to the price of 25.99 euros which is not high but neither is it modest for an indie title from a few years ago. However, the problems don't stop with the extravagant mapping of some keys or the interface that hasn't been adapted to the portable format as evident from the texts that are tiny even when set to extra large. The flaws go much further, embracing the entire technical sector, and are those that risk alienating new players, already forced to contend with a difficult and demanding title. The movement of the group, fortunately, goes smoothly in most cases, but the framerate plummets by activating the mode that highlights the objects with which we can interact. And the same happens with the zoom and rotation of the camera, especially when we are in combat. Furthermore, crashes are not rare, and someone seems to have suffered much more than us, for a situation that is anything but rosy. For this we hope the arrival of a patch that we hope will introduce the key mapping and improve the latency problems that make the control system even more cumbersome than it is. Among other things, it happens that the delay in the response of the commands leads to mistakes and as we have already made clear, an error can mean death, with a good dose of frustration to follow if we are in the middle of a fight up to that moment best managed.", "date": "2018-09-24", "grade": "8.0"}
