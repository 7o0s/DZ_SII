In Bridge Odyssey, the new puzzle game developed by Gameloft for iPhone and iPod Touch, we are not forced to carry out such a detailed analysis in each stage, but we must also take into account various factors when we arrange the wooden planks that will go to form a safe passage for our cute animal friends. Developed within six different islands, for a total of forty-eight stages, the game action is based exclusively on the use of the touch screen to build a bridge sturdy enough to allow a series of more or less heavy creatures to even just one step. The lightest animals hop forward or in any case never represent a great concern due to their weight, while their sturdier companions (an elephant and a buffalo, in this case) end up easily giving way to the boards and therefore have to rely on of a support base that is solid, even if only for the few seconds necessary to travel from the left side to the right side of the screen, generally separated by a deadly abyss. By this way! Bridge Odyssey allows us to move the frame by ~dragging~ it with the fingers or to leave it fixed (very sensible choice, in truth), as well as to make a grid appear on the screen for a more precise arrangement of the boards (another not very apt idea) . You can try your hand at a simple tutorial or face the first island directly: given the immediacy of the gameplay, there is nothing to fear. The construction of the bridge must necessarily start from one or more ~hooks~ present within the scenario: from there we can start and hook our boards, determining their length up to a certain point and fixing them together thanks to the ends. A simple ~line~ formed by three horizontally arranged axes, which hook together, is a bridge that can be used by the lightest animals but too little resistant for the heavier ones, which would end up breaking everything and falling. In cases like this it is therefore necessary to build a more complex structure, with an upper line complete with partitions to increase the general robustness. The internship is completed when all the animals manage to pass to the other side, at which point a judgment is given on the goodness of the work done. This judgment is enthusiastic (~master~) only when three conditions are met: all the animals pass unscathed on the bridge, all the golden eggs present in the scenario are collected and at least two wooden planks are left over. Achieving these particular objectives translates into a challenge within a challenge, because at a certain point we will have to face stages in which only one coupling pin is available to us for the planks and we have to predict what will happen to the bridge through a series of trials and errors . Erase & rewind In the upper part of the screen, on the right, there is a button which starts the animals and which therefore allows us to see if our construction holds up to their passage: in case things go wrong, just press it again to go back to the Starting situation. Similarly, at the bottom left we find the classic ~undo~ button to undo our last move, whose usefulness is not extraordinary given the practicality of the interface, which allows us to eliminate the axes already arranged through a simple ~double tap~ on the relevant joints. Just the interface, unfortunately, shows the side to some annoying shortcomings. Firstly, it is impossible to play using the thumbs and therefore the boards must be placed with the index finger. The excessive sensitivity of the controls and the impossibility of zooming frequently leads us to arrange the axes in the wrong way: at that point we have to delete and reposition them every time, since they cannot be moved once they have been inserted. Apart from this, the technical sector of the new Gameloft product is really excellent both for the graphics (coloured, fluid, with the stages very well characterized despite their simplicity) and for the sound (enriched by ~sung~ songs perhaps a little repetitive but very nice).
