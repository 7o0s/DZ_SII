{"name": "Black Buccaneer - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/black-buccaneer-recensione.html", "text": "a mere and unsuccessful attempt to copy the Prince of Persia saga, with gross copying at the limits (but perhaps well beyond...) of plagiarism The Curse of the Black Buccaneer After this not exciting incipit, we begin our adventure on a mysterious island where we were shipwrecked and we immediately realize that we are dealing with a typical 3D action platform: a mere and failed attempt to copy the Prince of Persia saga, with copying gross to the limits (but perhaps well beyond...) of plagiarism. In fact, you should know that the Black Buccaneer is the alter ego of our protagonist, Mister Francis Blade, a sort of voodoo entity a little slow in his movements but with ~extraordinary~ powers and which can be evoked in certain circumstances. Anyone who has played the Two Thrones will surely have a strange feeling of deja vu... The Raped Prince But the assonances (let's call them that...) certainly don't end here: here are the large rooms on which to cling from step to step, the puzzle variations, the swashbuckling fights (having to face poor monkeys is sad. ..), all to be done with a control system that is not at all user friendly, decidedly approximate and not inclined to implement commands quickly as well as a management of the cameras capable of making even the most experienced pirate feel seasick. In the PC version we should also deal with an excessively high frame rate (even at a resolution of 1600x1200 pixels and with all the effects activated, the game, on a medium-high range personal computer, runs excessively) but which in some occasions drops dramatically and in both cases this will lead to serious problems on the playful side of the title. Black Buccaneer also fails spectacularly from a technical point of view with shameful animation sets After such a criticism someone, reading this review, will say: ~but perhaps at least from a technical point of view the game is saved...~. You are wrong. Black Buccaneer fails clamorously even from this point of view with shameful animation sets: if we also think that the game draws ~inspiration~ from Prince of Persia which had its plus precisely in the velvety and fluid movements of the Prince, you understand how the situation is even more traumatic and serious. The medium-low graphic detail, the not too detailed textures and a character design bordering on the ridiculous (apart from some handsome monsters from time to time...) are almost ~marginal~ problems compared to everything else. To want to save something at all costs in this shipwreck there are sufficient light effects and sound that is not annoying and in keeping with the type of videogame experience proposed. Certainly not enough elements to save Black Buccaneer from a sudden drowning... Black Buccaneer is available for PC and PlayStation 2. The tested version is the one for PC. Conclusions There are bad games and there are bad games. There are those who still have some element of interest, a small gimmick capable of catalyzing attention even for a few minutes. Then there are titles like Black Buccaneer that try to exploit the wake of the new interest in the imaginative universe of pirates and to clone a great series like that of Prince of Persia, failing miserably in every respect, bar none. We are faced with a deficient product in every area, unable to even live up to the quality standards of players with less intransigence and with a very wide sleeve. A title not to be recommended to anyone, not even Captain Hook. If you don't want to be sucked into Black Buccaneer's curse keep at the greatest possible safe distance... Pros Pirates are very trendy again thanks to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom The music is not annoying Cons Deficient, lacking, unacceptable in every respect A plagiarism of Prince of Persia The list goes on almost indefinitely All be pirates... We certainly cannot speak of ~pirate-mania~ but undoubtedly the release of ~The Pirates of the Caribbean~ and the more recent sequel ~The Dead Man's Chest~ have aroused a certain interest in this imaginative universe also thanks to the appeal of starring Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. The French programmers (from Lyon to be precise...) of Widescreen Games have therefore decided to take advantage of the wake of this discreet trend and set their new game in the same background. Black Buccaneer thus opens with the narration of a truly standard plot (not to say badly copied from the films just mentioned) and graphically represented by semi-static comic strips that closely resemble the technical achievements of the presentations on16-bit gaming systems.
