{"name": "Yager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yager_b.html", "text": "I'm the god of hellfire An important component for the atmosphere surrounding this game is certainly the narration of a story which, in a swing of emotions that will go from humorous to dramatic, will try to involve the player in a futuristic world of the late twenty-first century. The war for the race for power is open, and the undisputed dominion of one of the major megacorporations of this imaginary planet earth, the Proteus Company, is affected by some attacks by the ~pirates~, headed by the formidable Gunther Van Berg. Following these unfortunate episodes, the Proteus Company decides to run for cover by hiring a freelance pilot, of which we will play the role. After a short presentation, which will see the protagonist Magnus Tide enter Proteus Island, we will immediately be put to the test as a freelancer with a flight simulation and a little training following a veteran pilot. All this in order to immerse the player in the world of Yager and, above all, bring him closer to the complex system of controls. In fact, it will take a little practice to assimilate all the functions of Sagittarius, Magnus' (and consequently ours) combat ship, but with a few not at all frustrating game sessions you will be able to tame the craft right from the start with all the attached arsenal. Sagittarius is a combat aircraft equipped with a very useful original peculiar feature: the possibility of sailing the skies in two totally different arrangements, namely jet-mode and hover-mode. The substantial difference between the two aviation systems lies in the navigation speed and movements of Sagittarius: with the jet trim you will navigate with a much more incisive speed, without ever having to accelerate, as it is automatic, and being able to perform 360 rotations on axis; with the hover mode, on the other hand, you will have the possibility to stand still, floating in the air and then accelerate with the left trigger, regulating the speed at will and also moving by horizontal lines. The two flight systems are interchangeable at any time by pressing the right analog stick, which will also change the configuration of some keys on the pad, leaving the keys associated with the arming as fixed points. Sympathetically alone, or almost, against everyone... This title of Germanic origin is divided into missions, interspersed with interlude scenes in real-time graphics that will have the purpose of telling the player the plot and the events associated with each mission. The variety of tasks to be performed goes beyond the simple concept of shoot and run, giving the player tasks that can be cover, solitary or mass attack, defense or simply precision. The exploratory component is also of fundamental importance, proposing large and rather complex scenarios to visit, in search of ammunition or the best position to launch an attack. But Sagittarius is the real focal point of Yager's gameplay, where choosing the right strategy with which to approach the various missions will be essential for their completion; in fact, it will be possible to carry out stealth-type actions, real sniping, thanks also to the supplied zoom, or act with pyrotechnic assault flights. Also noteworthy is the good artificial intelligence of the enemies who will do everything to avoid being hit, trying to get out of the way to get behind. Here we will be helped by two tools placed in the lower corners of the screen: one is a map that will indicate the position of the enemies towards us in real time, while the other will indicate the type of weapon equipped and, thanks to a diagram depicting our shuttle , from which side we will be hit. I feel good tadadadadada The technical level of Yager stands on discrete ranks where the only flaw to undermine the playability is the framerate, albeit slightly below 30 fps, with some vertical collapses especially when the screen is filled with enemies and explosions; considering the quality of the hardware and that the graphic effects are not top-notch, it could and should have been done better. Absent noteworthy light effects and with little detailed textures, Yager gives his worst in the realization of the water, which is nothing more than a pre-calculated mirror with which it is impossible to interact or see anything other than the ripples, which are always the same, and by the reflections of the buildings. As regards the polygonal models of Sagittarius and the other boats, thework expressed by the German software house is visibly more accurate; as well as the background that offers a varied and inspired cosmetics, also enjoying a deep horizon that only a slight clipping can scratch. It definitely improves the sound sector which offers a good dose of different sounds from each other in the background motifs which, although not very inspired, always fit perfectly with the current situation. The English dubbings are excellent, especially that of Magnus Tide who, in addition to a decidedly apt tone of voice, boasts a line of shortcuts weighed for every situation; in fact our protagonist will pass from the serious tones of the most critical situations, to a funny and amused sarcasm in the soft circumstances, ending up singing some legendary motifs such as ~I feel good~ and ~My way~ in the moments in which the exaltation and the adrenaline will have the upper hand at the end of a fight. This says a lot about the meticulous work done in the development, being the characterization of Magnus Tide extremely accurate in order to bring the player to a higher level of involvement through the verbal adventures of our hero. Comment Yager is a true revelation that manages to enrapture the player for hours with gameplay that offers plenty of ideas and emotions. A game that requires a good deal of effort, especially manual, and which hardly ends in boredom due to the variety of tasks to be performed. Too bad for the lack of localization in Italian and for a subdued technical realization, when compared to the rest of the game. A title recommended to all those who want to approach this genre and a practically obligatory purchase for enthusiasts. Pros: Good control system Varied and complex missions The protagonist is impeccably characterized 60 hz is always nice Cons: Lack of any kind of localization Subdued graphics compared to the rest of the game At the end of a long path covered overcoming delays of all sorts, here is finally Yager, an aerial combat game, produced by THQ, by a newborn and homonymous German software house. During the preview we saw how this title was really ambitious and full of elements sufficient to make a certain mouth water, and in the editorial office more than one person was willing to bet on the real quality of this air-combat game.
