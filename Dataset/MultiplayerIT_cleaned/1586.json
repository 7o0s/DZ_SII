{"name": "Cycling Manager 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cycling-manager-3.html", "text": "Let's get back on the saddle... to the Bersagliera! Known by bicycle enthusiasts for some years now, the previous titles in the Cycling Manager series were definitely appreciated but failed to conquer the more general public, due to a game interface that was not exactly state-of-the-art and due to a not exactly exceptional game variety. This year, with the third chapter dedicated to the 2002-2003 season, the transalpine software house tries to get out of the ghetto by presenting a series of innovations and new tricks born from the experience accumulated in all this time. New graphics: now - even if you certainly won't be calling your friends at home to show what your PC can do - the feeling of being there is even more appealing. The level of detail, especially for this kind of game, is quite high and, in the case of famous stages such as Paris-Roubaix, it will be possible to see famous monuments such as the Arc de Triomphe or the Roubaix Velodrome. Too bad that, as expected, this attention to detail has stopped at a few macroscopic cases, going around Italy more than once in fact we will ask ourselves why we are unable to see the sea or cross that given river. Large cities like Milan, then, will merely be represented by a road surrounded by a few houses in an unidentified architectural style. Even the sound aspect has not been left in the background: if already from the menus some music will appear catchy and ambient, the fact of being able to make our favorite MP3s play in the game is definitely appreciable. License to run The game includes practically all the most famous (and not) cycling competitions - the national championships or the world cup, complete with rainbow jerseys, tricolors and so on - and all the corridors of the top 40 professional teams in the world. There are also famous names in the cycling industry such as Shimano, Campagnolo, Fir or Pinarello. Of course, some shortcomings were inevitable, after all, certain licenses for the exploitation of a name cost a lot. The Tour de France is now called the ~Grand Tour of France~ and some very high-profile runners, such as the famous Armstrong, are represented not with the usual photo but with a much more vulgar, and less realistic, three-dimensional model and with a crippled of the name. Fortunately, even in this edition, all fans will be able to add, modify and customize these and many other details thanks to the game editor directly sold together with the game. Before starting a new game, in fact, we will be asked whether to use the DB provided by the developers or another customized and, perhaps, more updated and complete one. Sports directors you become. The real heart of the game obviously lies in the management and simulation engine. Above all in these aspects the programmers have not spared themselves, on the contrary. There are basically three game modes: Career, Single Tour and Race. Obviously the greatest commitment will be required by the Career mode. We assure you that the choices to be made, especially at the beginning, will be numerous and painful. Nothing has been left to chance and managing any of the 40 squads made available will require considerable effort and tactical acumen. You go from managing your team's workforce with a lot of buying and selling market, to finding the materials with which our riders will go racing. There are many stage races, the great classics as well and knowing how to dose and use our best cyclists in competitions and at the most appropriate moments of the season is already half of our success. Recruiting young and promising cyclists into our ranks represents the other half. But if man represents the engine of this splendid sport, we must not forget them either, perhaps the least intrusive but still fundamental protagonists of this sport: bicycles. In fact, before each race and each competition, we will have to choose the best mix of the equipment at our disposal (basically wheels and frame) to put at the service of our cyclists. Obviously, depending on the type of stage (time trial, flat, uphill) that awaits us, a range of more or less high compromises will be available. Cycling is not enough... During the actual competitions we will have full control over our men and we will have to indicate to each member of our team how much energy to spend, when to attack, follow the opponent, pull the group or get in the way.the wheel to rest a bit. The game speed will be settable from 1x (real time) to 8x: in this way we could decide the right compromise between detail and duration of the game sessions; a pity that an automatism is missing which, in the event of decisive race actions such as the escape of a group of men, changes the speed in real time. Due to this shortcoming, more than once we may miss a stage because, when we notice a breakaway or a puncture from our lead man, it will already be too late. Overall, the passing of the stages will always be fun and enjoyable by virtue of the functional but sufficiently spectacular graphics and the artificial intelligence which, although subject to ample room for improvement, manages to recreate stages that are always plausible in their evolution of the race. Although after the first few days of acclimatization, the game may appear too easy, we can assure you that, perhaps trying to complicate your life by managing second-tier teams, you can spend several hours of fun. The Pyrenean stages, the crowded sprints between sprinters, the placid pursuit of the group against the daring hero of the moment in a 100Km breakaway these are all situations that more than once will give true enthusiasts a healthy and incomparable Zen satisfaction. Comment If you spend the first spring days following the Alpine stages of the Giro or if you stay at home on the sultry July afternoons to watch the Tour, ~Cycling Manager 3~ is an almost obligatory purchase. The graphics, while not making us cry out for a miracle, manage to do their dirty work and the control interface, although still perfectible, can be tamed after a few hours of training on the field. Furthermore, the various stages, even if in the end the choices to be made are always the same, will be able to present new and unprecedented challenges for a long time. Rather, the problem still arises with those who don't know rudimentary  even if not obvious  cycling tactics and techniques. The ~staying at the wheel~, covering one's sprinter in the most difficult moments of the race, the importance of having the right wingman at the right time and many other tricks of the trade, are all things that are not explained by the game but which must be part of the cultural baggage of the player. We are therefore once again faced with a really good and versatile title for all ~two-wheel~ enthusiasts, rather difficult and difficult to recommend for everyone else. The fact that this problem is more important for this CyM 3 than for Scudetto 4, for example, simply lies in the fact that in Italy there are around 60 million technical stewards while there are decidedly fewer sports directors. Despite this, beyond a Database not even in the least comparable to that of the multi-named Scudetto or a simulation accuracy that can still be decidedly improved, those who madly love cycling will no longer have to feel like the son of a lesser god. Pros: The only title of its kind for cycling enthusiasts Longevity and variety ensured Very nice graphics Cons: although we can't expect too much For some it may seem quite easy If you don't like cycling you will hardly change your mind One man alone... Cuneo-Pinerolo stage: five Alpine hills, 192 kilometers of escape and a cyclist enters the legend. One man is in charge; his shirt is white-blue; his name is Fausto Coppi. Could we begin a review dedicated to the sport of effort par excellence, without quoting the legendary words of the never too late master Mario Ferretti? Probably yes, but this time it went wrong... After all, already on the cover of this Cycling Manager 3 (from now on ~CyM 3~) appears, against a classically pink background, the effigy of another great of Italian and non-Italian cycling: Claudio Cipollini. For all cycling enthusiasts, therefore, the time has come for revenge against all those millions of football players who have been able to have fun and amuse themselves with the new Scudetto 4 for a few months now. Let's find out together if the new chapter of this managerial series, developed by the French Cyranide, it will not make you regret studded shoes and shorts.", "date": "2003-07-14", "grade": null}
