{"name": "Summon Quest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/summon-quest-recensione.html", "text": "In the mobile sector we have been witnessing for years a process of simplification in game mechanics which, after an initial period of shock for more traditionalist users, is starting to show some interesting applications. The automation of controls, in particular, is an area that is lending itself to productive interpretations: having overcome the embarrassment of the real autoplay, which has now become part of the mobile RPG genre as an almost necessary element, some developers have started playing on the concept by proposing concrete innovations in terms of gameplay. A now famous example is provided by Vampire Survivors, but another exponent (although less arrogant than what was seen in Poncle's game) can be found in this review of Summon Quest. In the game we play a fighter armed with throwing knives who must free various dungeons from the presence of hostile creatures, until you reach the bosses and go to the next level. All this takes place through a structure that could be defined as a hybrid between action RPG and twin-stick shooter, except that you play with only one ~stick~: the peculiar feature of Summon Quest is in fact the fact of having to manage only the movement of the character within the scenario and the activation of special summons and techniques, while the fire is automatic, with a constant throwing of blades towards the closest enemy. Although this may seem like an oversimplification, in truth it introduces a fundamentally different mechanic, focused on the correct positioning and timing in the use of summons. The general concept is therefore similar to that of Vampire Survivors, but its application finds a closer reference in Archero, a game that has enjoyed considerable success in the mobile sector. Everything is represented with considerable care, as befits a chosen title to be part of the Apple Arcade catalog. The Label team has put some care into the making of the game, through a well-balanced production on the aesthetic front, even if the characterization doesn't help build a strong identity for an already uncharismatic game. Automatic knife thrower A squad of helpers to summon in Summon Quest The gameplay is structured on a classic progressive mechanic for this type of game: each ~dungeon~, so to speak, is made up of a series of levels placed in succession of increasing difficulty, which culminate in the clash with a boss, preceded by another mini-boss placed in the middle of the path. In a similar way to what has been seen in various roguelikes, we are periodically asked to choose a power-up among three proposals, which then accumulate together, constituting constant power-ups within the dungeon itself, resetting once the quest is finished. The system works well to modify the temporary build of the protagonist, but in the end there are very few variations on the theme, considering that we are still limited to throwing knives with some possible passive and active support skills. The control system is based on a virtual stick positioned at the bottom left and a series of keys that correspond to the activation of the different summons on the right, each characterized by various cooldown times. The solution works very well, considering the convenience of the automatic fire that allows us to focus only on moving the protagonist. Summon Quest, the personalization of the protagonist The other characterizing element of the gameplay is the constant progression of the character, who levels up by increasing their stats. Upon completion of the levels you also get keys to open treasures and currencies with which to obtain and buy new equipment and characters to summon, which are fundamental in the most demanding fights as valid momentary supports. It is clear that this mechanism was designed for a free-to-play approach with microtransactions, but since Summon Quest was distributed on Apple Arcade it is now totally devoid of these elements. This is certainly pleasant, even if it is almost strange to be faced with a gacha-like system without any element of ~gamble~ or in-app purchase.", "date": "2023-05-01", "grade": "6.5"}
