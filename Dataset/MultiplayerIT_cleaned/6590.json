From all this was born the idea of the Gray Goo we are talking about today, that is to say the fruit of the work of Petroglyph Games, the team responsible for Star Wars: Empire at War. A studio that thanks to its members can boast such an amount of experience in the field of real-time strategy, as to make most of the other developers currently present on the scene pale: to compose it we find people responsible for milestones of the entire genre such as Dune II and Command & Conquer. The latter title has also been mentioned several times over the months, to describe Petroglyph's intention to return to its origins: the guys based in Las Vegas have in fact decided to rely on the nostalgic foothold for the good old days, trying to churn out a title capable of recalling the strategic games of the 90s, together with their mechanics, in the shadow of a market that in the meantime has redefined itself with StarCraft 2, but not only. Given the trust deserved by the members of Petroglyph, we could not help but immerse ourselves in the game, hoping that the Gray Goo does not end up swallowing us too but above all that fans of real-time strategy games can actually have a new alternative on the horizon. Gray Goo takes us back in time to Command & Conquer, with some new features Ecosystem 9, fight 3 The story told in the Gray Goo campaign takes place hundreds of years after humans first ventured into space, naturally becoming acquainted with other civilizations. One of these is that of the Betas, humanoid beings once great space travelers but forced on the planet Ecosystem 9 after a war: on this place full of resources, the Betas hope to be able to return to explore the worlds, and it is precisely here that the story begins. Following an experiment, the Betas come into contact with the Humans, the second faction of the game, which also ended up on Ecosystem 9 to solve their problems. After initially entering into conflict, Beta and Humans will have to deal with the third Goo faction, which, as already mentioned, draws inspiration from the apocalyptic scenario described at the beginning of the review. That said, we don't feel like going any further, given that the universe imagined by Petroglyph for Gray Goo deserves to be discovered by the players themselves, going through the storyline and missions prepared for the campaign mode. Inside, as we said, three factions as required by the classic number of the real-time strategy genre, to be controlled in the fifteen missions divided equally into five for each of them: first Beta, then Humans and then Goo, to naturally also act as bridge to the multiplayer component of the game. Both in skirmish against the CPU and online, it is in fact possible to take part in matches which, depending on the map, reach up to a maximum of four connected players, with Standard typology (destruction of the most important buildings), Annihilation (total destruction of buildings and units) o Destruggi HQ (destruction of the main building): if the number and size of the maps are not so exciting at the moment, it is worth noting that the editor and Steam Workshop are already fully functional, and that precisely with a view to bringing in vogue in the good old days it is also possible to play games via LAN with your friends, an element that is now very rare nowadays. Also present are the epic units, thanks to which you can carry out deadly attacks. Ready, Set, Goo! Gray Goo's game mechanics are essentially based on collecting resources and building your own base. In truth, the only resource present in this title is the so-called Catalyst, a kind of oil to be collected and brought to the base to ensure that it is used both in the creation of new buildings and in the training of new units. From this point of view, as far as Beta and Humans are concerned, there is little to explain: with the necessary differences, their management closely follows the classic canons of the genre. Looking at them from a higher level, the Betas are however more versatile than the Humans, for their part specialized in the construction of defensive structures. The Goo faction instead deserves a completely separate discussion, given that it practically has no base: its headquarters, if we can call it that, is in fact a gelatinous mass called mother, able to move around the map to go directlyon the Catalyst sources, replicating itself in other mothers or different types of Goo, to be used to generate the units. In fact, therefore, there are no buildings, and the entire Goo force can be moved far and wide without a fixed abode within the playing area. An idea that certainly pays off in single player mode, but that in multiplayer opens up dangerous scenarios in which the players who control Betas and Humans are forced to go around the map (or to occupy it all ) to try to flush out the opposing Goo Cluster. Returning to the single mode, both in the campaign and in the skirmish we can say that the opposing artificial intelligence behaves quite well, offering three levels of difficulty but still giving us a healthy hard time from the beginning. As for the campaign, perhaps we would have liked to have been able to tackle some additional missions in the company of the three factions, to be able to better understand their strengths and weaknesses before tackling online matches. Gooard what stuff To create Ecosystem 9 and the entire setting of Gray Goo, the developers resorted to a lot of help: that of Weta Workshop, a New Zealand company to which (for one thing) we owe a very good part of the realization of the effects seen in the The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The end result is a world in which it is very easy to immerse yourself, thanks to the various interlude scenes characterized by highly respectable animations for the protagonist characters of the story, dubbed in an equally excellent way. The soundtrack is also of excellent workmanship, entrusted to the hands of Frank Klepacki, also coming from the old Westwood team in which he took care of the creation of the music for titles such as Dune II, Blade Runner and Command & Conquer himself. Sorry if it's too little. Being a strategic one, an important role is also played by the interface, designed by Petroglyph in the name of accessibility, leveraging the use of the QWERTY keys to combine the opening of the various menus with the quick selection of the unit or the building you want to build. The game engine proves to be reliable even on machines that are not exactly of the latest generation, even if in more agitated phases it is possible to notice a loss of frame rate.", "date": "2015-02-05", "grade": "7.8"}
