{"name": "Vampire Survivors", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vampire-survivors-recensione.html", "text": "There are some games that simply give you an instant sense of fun that you end up drawn into with no escape. They don't seem to have who knows what pretensions, but at the end of the day, it's easy for a game to be stolen from us and we end up thinking about it more than big productions. Poncle's title is one of them, as we will see in the Vampire Survivors review. Essential formula The Castlevania-inspired imagery is evident and not hidden Vampire Survivors never takes itself too seriously. It has the flavor of a good amatriciana pasta, with pecorino and guanciale at will, which never transcends towards haute cuisine, remaining proudly itself. Conceptually we like to imagine it as the pastime of Luca Galante, the developer, who, after returning home in the evening from his former job, set about implementing everything that came to his mind in a minute work, which had as first ambition is to amuse himself. So here are some objects taking absurd names that remind him of Italy and that probably make him smile under his mustache while writing them, for example Mannajja, Phiera Der Tuphello, Laborra or Gatti Amari, and the same happens with some of the selectable characters: Gennaro, Pasqualina, Dommario, Pugnala, Poppea Pecorina, Zi' Assunta and others. In the head there is a lot of Castlevania, at least as an aroma, but mixed with the tripe cooked by Enzo in Trastevere and without any claim to clone the Konami series, which remains only in the background. Everything is tribute and fun, a kind of celebration of the personal imagination, perhaps made while dreaming of a nice gricia (dispassionate advice: never write articles before lunch, Ed.). The gameplay formula itself is simple and straightforward, very light-hearted, yet addictive nonetheless. After all, it was his hobby and he didn't want too many complications, also because he had to do something else and the time to devote to the implementation of abstruse mechanics was very little. Fairy tale with a happy ending Certain situations can become chaotic... and that's the beauty of it So we have a player-driven main character, a vampire hunter, who roams seemingly endless 2D levels, fending off or shredding enemies of various kinds (mummies, skeletons, zombies, golems, witches, ghosts, and so on), who attack in huge waves with the only goal of killing him. The system is based on the gradual growth of intensity and strength of the waves, which is counterbalanced by the progression of the character. The goal is to survive for 30 minutes in each level, unlocking and upgrading new weapons, which are used automatically. The pleasure all comes from the rapid accumulation of power, which makes weapons and bonus items more and more effective, allowing you to combine them to obtain even more destructive and spectacular tools of death. The count of monsters killed grows dramatically. How not to be admired in front of certain displays of videogame omnipotence, in which the screen gradually fills up with sprites, almost to the point of overflowing, which are annihilated by our attacks? A kaleidoscope of pure chaos, visually overwhelming and satisfying, from which you can't tear yourself away until the end, whatever it is. Not all fairy tales have a happy ending, but this one definitely does. Galante publishes the game on Steam in Early Access, signing poncle, at a very low price, practically less than a cappuccino with a croissant (he increased it a bit as version 1.0 approaches, it will be due to the galloping inflation that has increased the cost of coffee and jam, but it has always remained very affordable). Against all odds, Vampire Survivors starts selling big, attracting millions of players. From a hobby project it becomes a full-time job. The initial planning jumps, update after update more content is added than initially budgeted, the community grows exponentially. However, the game remains simple and direct and is not distorted in any way. There are more items, more characters and more secrets, sure, a card system is added and some bonus stages are added. The roguelike system, with permanently unlockable upgrades, purchasable with the currency obtained by playing (no microtransactions) is expanded, but the substance remains the same, as well as the immediate fun and light-hearted tone. Pure fun As you level up, you get weapons and items After more than fifty hours spent with the game, which obviously also includes the Early Access version, it is difficult to make any real criticisms of Vampire Surivors, other thannot at least specious. As can be expected, unlocked all the objects and tried many of the many combinations available, the sense of amazement is a bit lacking, but considering that it costs very little, that we are talking about dozens of hours of gameplay anyway and that Poncle is continuing with its update policy, you can't really complain and, in case, you can abandon it serenely. Graphically it is not exceptional, as you may have noticed from the screenshots, yet it is beautiful, especially when extreme confusion reigns on the screen. It doesn't bend GPUs, but it does what it has to do in a timely and creative way, waiting for the already promised transition to a new graphics engine. By combining items, more powerful ones are obtained In short, we are faced with a title that does not expect anything and that works very well for this very reason: it is just fun, without too many frills and without appearing more complex than necessary. It does not excel, except in its existential lightness which makes it irresistible. It is the result of a vision of video games that is closer to the players than those of the titles traditionally offered by the industry, an invitation to share the absurd and phantasmagorical that characterizes it, which paradoxically forms a narrative universe stronger than that of many projects written at the table by hordes of creative professionals.
