And so, after King of Thieves, cute but not exciting, here is the Russian team fielding CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars, a strategy that mixes two very popular elements: on the one hand the kittens, always indisputable stars of social networks ; on the other, the Robot Wars-style death machines, which these cats in fact ingenuity to build to participate in special tournaments in which the vehicles collide. The formula closely resembles the experience of Banjo-Kazooie: Screws and Bolts, but also that of Bad Piggies: in both cases our goal was to use a series of components to put together vehicles capable of overcoming certain challenges. Well, how does such a solution work in the context of asynchronous multiplayer clashes? Frankly, not very well: the possibilities offered by the game are too limited and the challenges soon become monotonous. CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars brings an idea full of potential into play, without however exploiting it properly Crazy cat CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars is a very simple product from a structural point of view: after having created a vehicle using the available pieces (a hull of a different shape to which wheels can be applied, a couple of weapons, thrusters and possibly stickers), we will be able throw him into the fray of casual matches or tournaments, in the latter case with the aim of conquering a certain number of victories to climb the rankings and access more advanced classes. The progression is also simple: as our kitty makes a name for himself, he receives better and more powerful parts for his vehicle, with the possibility of fusing the less interesting components in order to improve those he considers reliable and effective. When everything is ready, based on an action energy indicator that requires only three attempts but recharges quickly enough, we will be able to unleash our robot against a sequence of opponents and thus witness fully automatic battles between the two vehicles in field, which will be resolved within a few seconds in favor of one or the other contender. With missiles, lasers, chainsaws and devices that overturn the enemy, the robot we have built will therefore have to reset the energy of his opponent before the opposite happens or the barriers of the arena begin to close, destroying the closest vehicle and leading to its defeat. While very nice to look at, thanks to a neat and convincing graphic style, CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars fails to involve that much: whereas in Bad Piggies the customization of the vehicle took place according to problems to be faced during specific routes, gradually longer and more complex, the fights in the arena are so short and limited as to take away the bulk of the enthusiasm compared to a formula that usually works well. In short, the construction phase remains pleasant and the freemium mechanisms are more or less affordable, but the complete automatism of the experience and the banality of the fights could push you to uninstall the application after a few hours.", "date": "2017-04-27", "grade": "6.5"}
