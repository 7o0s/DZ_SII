The now famous digital platform had the undoubted merit of questioning the freemium format, despite the fact that this approach was now so deeply rooted in productions for iOS and Android that it was taken for granted by both users and developers. And yet here we are, at get your hands on a decently made racer, in particular as regards the excellent creation of an officially licensed fleet, and bang your head against paywalls and other limitations that are now difficult to digest, which inevitably end up compromising the experience, regardless of its potential. In this specific case we are talking about a driving game designed for use on the move, with substantially short races, which take place in a handful of seconds and in which you have to pay attention to the trajectories and drifts, as well as strategically manage the release of the nitro, available with a single charge for each race. Although rendered in a simple and basic way, the formula is captivating and the physics of the vehicles helps to make the challenges pleasant, which however take place within the same tracks and make the grinding a central aspect of the progression, so as to make everything extremely repetitive already in the first hours. Freemium gameplay, structure and model In Rebel Racing our goal is to beat the leaders of a rival gang, but in order to do so we will have to upgrade our car enough by purchasing upgrades related to intake, tyres, exhaust, nitro, gearbox and engine; and possibly mounting appendices to get further inspiration. On the map there are some events, fixed and daily, which allow us to obtain the money necessary to buy the components and therefore proceed in our growth path, or perhaps get another car, or even customize the one we have by changing the paint, color rims and brake calipers, or by applying vinyl. There is even a nice augmented reality application that allows you to photograph the car in your home, like a miniature, or perhaps in the parking lot next to your real car, and then share the result via email or on social networks. this type of structure are many, unfortunately. In the first place, the grinding is exaggerated: you have to literally redo the same races dozens and dozens of times to be able to challenge the bosses and move forward, but you stay in the same scenario and on the same tracks for too long. Secondly, the freemium model chosen by Hutch Games is quite limiting, with just eight units of fuel to be able to try your hand at racing. Thus, when the energy of action ends, you are faced with three possible choices: wait for it to slowly recharge, watch advertising trailers to be able to run again or put your wallet and buy a few packets of gold coins or banknotes. As if that weren't enough, the touch control system, while valid, is not assisted by a tilt alternative and least of all by the support for Bluetooth controllers, resulting, however, quite assisted when it comes to braking and drifting, without the possibility of change nothing from the options. Not much to say about the technical realization: as already mentioned, the cars are very well made and move within fairly well-crafted scenarios, although decidedly devoid of personality, a bit too generic and characterized by a system unsophisticated lighting. The sound effects are average, while the music becomes quite repetitive after a few races: luckily you can turn it off.", "date": "2019-11-13", "grade": "6.5"}
