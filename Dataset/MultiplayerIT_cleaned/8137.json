In reality, the games with the Rabbids as protagonists have never been who knows what masterpieces: more at ease in party-games than in platformers, as demonstrated by the first and mediocre sortie on Nintendo 3DS, these completely crazy rabbits know entertain for their irreverent silliness rather than the actual quality of the games themselves. So here we are again, almost three years after the previous Rabbids 3D: was it worth the wait? Les Lapins Crtins Apparently Ubisoft has realized that the Rabbids are not particularly good at imitating Super Mario, so they have decided to abandon the previously beaten path of the platform genre to bring them back to their natural habitat of party-games. In reality it was a difficult choice because this genre is not particularly suitable for a portable console, with rare exceptions, but in the end we must admit that the decision turned out to be the right one: the compilation of minigames proposed by Headstrong Studio proves to be entertaining enough to make us smile at the senseless and childish screams that introduce each new challenge. In fact, we are faced with a product in which there is no real common thread to unite the various mini-games, thrown onto a sort of board in which each box offers a different test to complete. There is no shortage of variety initially, but as the game progresses, one increasingly comes across minigames that are very similar to those already faced a short time before, perhaps set in a different audiovisual context. Many of them, among other things, are largely inspired by those proposed in the previous adventures of the Rabbids. It must be said, however, that the guys at Headstrong Studio are committed to offering a series of games that make the most of the capabilities and hardware of Nintendo 3DS. We find a bit of everything: from interacting with a Rabbid via augmented reality (also thanks to the card included in the package) to cameras that magically reveal the little creatures to hit in our own room, from speed races regulated through the internal accelerometer to very common rhythm music mini-games that use the touch-screen. The various challenges are pleasant and fast, but probably too simple: you certainly don't have to be a video game wizard to get the maximum score, quite the contrary. The short duration of the ~campaign~ does the rest: just under three hours are enough to complete all seven worlds. But this is not, in fact, the real purpose of the game. The 3D effect ... which 3D effect? The one proposed by Headstrong Studio is practically non-existent. On a practical level it offers no benefit and from a purely visual point of view we are faced with one of the weakest 3D effects in the Nintendo 3DS toy library. What a pity. Kill them all Unexpectedly, Ubisoft has well thought of integrating an RPG-like component into this umpteenth raid of the crazy rabbits which, technically, should prolong the use of the game, especially impressing a less savvy user target. Between one minigame and another, in fact, we will find ourselves having to face three pissed off Rabbids, using as many Rabbids chosen appropriately from our collection. The mechanics are very simple: each Rabbid has an attack skill, a defense skill and a special technique; once the action to be performed has been chosen, we will have to press a key at the right time so that it is successful and that Rabbid does not waste his turn unnecessarily. After having beaten our opponents for a while, we will be able to choose which rabbit to give the coup de grace, knocking him out and adding him to our collection, perhaps for future use. Well yes, as you may have guessed we are dealing with a rudimentary imitation of Pokmon. The question is: does it work? Yes and no. On the one hand, the idea is very nice and increases the longevity of a product otherwise destined to be forgotten in a very short time. On the other hand, it's a really rough and little-depth game mode, light years away from the complexity of the one and only real Pokmon. The battles soon turn out to be very repetitive and to effectively use the acquired rabbits it is necessary to increase their experience level by playing mini-games and already completed battles. The Rabbid, about a hundred, are not even that different from each other, therefore the game is not always worth the candle, but with those obtained completelyGoing to the main mode, exchanged with other players or downloaded via StreetPass, it is also possible to face the CPU or another human player locally through a bizarre competitive mode of almost non-existent thickness. Fortunately, the technical aspect is not as superficial: without infamy or praise, mind you, but more than decent, clean and colorful.", "date": "2012-12-05", "grade": "6.0"}
