Apart from a few faces sacrificed probably to keep the budget at reasonable figures, almost all of Fox River is represented in a convincing way. Among the most popular we will find the faces of Michael Scoffield, Lincoln Burrows, Theodore Bagwell, Fernando Sucre, John Abruzzi, C-Note, and Guard Bellick. The most regretted face, on the other hand, is that of Dr. Sara Tancredi, together with that of other secondary characters. Prison Break: The Conspiracy is a third-person stealth adventure in which as Tom Paxton, a pawn of the Company, we have to stop Michael's escape plan. During our test we have already said that Tom Paxton is actually a character invented for the video game and that it is not part of the original script, however our actions will almost always intertwine in a convincing way with those of Michael and company, and at the same time we will not be forced, like Michael, to gain foot by foot access to the Fox River corridors. In truth we will be able to move practically throughout the penitentiary with the only foresight to stay away from the gaze of the sentries and make as little noise as possible. Four by four The greatest trick to respect during our stay at the penitentiary is to stay out of the light of the torches of the guards and the spotlights pointed above the roofs. Obviously this during the night escapes or in closed rooms, during the day instead it will be a matter of avoiding the gaze of the patrols or the bellhops who work for the prison. By pressing the L key we can walk stealthily, by pressing the R key instead we could run making more noise, with the risk of making the guards suspicious who will abandon the patrol to scrutinize every corner and spoil the party. The objective to be achieved is given to us from time to time, either directly by telephone from our superior, or by the convicts of Fox River who will entrust us with running their affairs in exchange for favors useful for our purpose. An X on the map indicates our destination, as do yellow painted objects scattered around the buildings. Railings, lines under doors, pipes and everything marked by bright yellow represents the way forward. Usually it is enough to understand how to move and press the button to carry out the contextual action, but it can happen to come across some variations, such as the doors to break open. In these situations, the screen is divided into two parts: in one we will see the pins of the lock that we will have to manipulate thanks to the stick, in the other we will see the guard who will inexorably approach us. Sometimes we will have to wait for the guards to change shifts or resume their tour, and in this case the possibility of peeking through a half-open door is useful, as will the lockers in which we can take refuge if cornered. The attention system of the guards is rather soft. If a guard catches a glimpse of us or suspects anything, a bar gauge will begin to fill, faster if we're clearly in sight or slower if we're indoors. If in the meantime without arousing further suspicion we manage to take cover, the danger will have escaped, otherwise the session will fail and we will start again from the checkpoint usually just behind. In this sense, the AI is not the smartest, and sometimes you find yourself in rather ridiculous situations with the stupid guard in the palm of your nose. Xbox 360 goals The first 300/400 points are generously given away by the game. The target icon will not stop pulsing. For the others you will have to finish the game even in hard mode, and above all finish each chapter without ever getting caught by the guards, an undertaking that will surely bore more than someone. A caress in a fist Another feature of Prison Break: The Conspiracy is given by the events in quick time, which will be activated from time to time during the exploration. If we fail, they will let us be discovered by the guards or they will make us suffer lethal blows from the inmates. Of these phases we can only say that the choice of having a key pressed repeatedly (among the various types of event), sometimes leads us into error because we never know when this will be replaced with the next command. Over time you can take the time, but at first it is rather annoying. When the fights are not in quick time, that is most of the time, we will be able to be the protagonists of the fight, and to do this we will have two buttons for attack and one for defense which will also allow us to carry out a powerful counterattack. For this purpose, the exercises that we will be able to do in the Fox River park will be useful and which will enhance both the resistance and the strength of the blows. Too bad, however, that in about half an hour we will be able to reach the maximum level, also frustrating the work on them. More or less the same amount of time it will take us to defeat all the opponents of the clandestine matches, inserted to sweep the pace of the game and to earn the useful grain to get every part of the body tattooed like a good jailbird. However, despite these attempts, after some time it will be clear that the efforts of the designers to give some breathing space to the adventure fail both in variety and in effectiveness, so much so that the resources spent in this direction appear unjustified and they make a structure sloppy that instead stands with dignity on its own legs, even if it always repeats itself like the days of a prisoner.", "date": "2010-03-26", "grade": "7.5"}
