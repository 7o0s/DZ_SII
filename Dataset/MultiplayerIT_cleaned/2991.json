{"name": "Tales of Crestoria", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-crestoria-la-recensione.html", "text": "If you already have an idea of what mobile RPGs with gacha elements are, you know more or less what to expect from the review of Tales of Crestoria, the new Bandai Namco title that adheres in a decidedly slavish way to the canon of the genre. Considering the recent postponement imposed on the expected Tales of Arise, this mobile chapter could exploit the void left by the older brother to somewhat satisfy the widespread desire for Tales of, given the popularity of the Bandai Namco series, but if you are already a little allergic to this type of game, know that this title does not escape the intrinsic defects of the typical mechanism of the obsessive collection of characters, without however particularly distinguishing itself for other characteristics of the gameplay, given that the derivative elements abound everywhere. Instead, where Tales of Crestoria can have something to say is its remarkable narrative basis (the texts are all in English, at least for the moment), which does justice to the series from which it derives with an interesting and rather well narrated story, with characters they don't escape that much from JRPG clichs but are still well built and deep. The premise is immediately shocking, when what seems like a classic start from a quiet coming-of-age story, with our hero committed to defending orphans, undergoes a twist and a sudden reversal of the reference system. The most trusted figures turn out to be stained with the most unspeakable crimes and the protagonist, Kanata, is forced to face them up to an extreme gesture that determines his sentence: the hero becomes an outcast, marked by a slanderous mark that forces him to fight constantly against the disturbing Enforcers, sort of nemesis whose sole objective is the elimination of the condemned. Deriving from a solid series like Tales of, Crestoria can count on a narrative of considerable depth even compared to other exponents of the genre in the mobile sector and its main characters are generally well characterized. However, this can, paradoxically, represent a problem for the gacha dynamics: through the usual evocations to be carried out with the expense of online currencies (gems or various treasures) it is possible to obtain famous characters from other chapters of the Tales of series, for a total of about 60 fighters. Coming from completely different stories and worlds, it is clear that these are unable to fit precisely into the complex plot set up for this chapter, therefore their presence clashes a bit with the narrative and stylistic coherence of Tales of Crestoria, with the brief introductory missions that are just digressions set on fanservice. Gameplay and aesthetics There is a certain care in the management of the characters, which open up to strategic insights even though they do not present particularly original solutions. Fans of the series could easily be disappointed by the absence of the typical Linear Motion Battle System, replaced here by a more classically turn-based battle system from the standard mobile JRPG. In any case, each character maintains their own Mystic Arts by importing them from their respective chapters, which increases the fanservice effect dramatically, when familiar moves are triggered, in some cases with connected animation. The turn-based combat allows you to establish the action to be performed for each character and the order of attack of these, with particular regard to the use of the Mystical Arts because they often require a rather long cooldown and therefore require a certain economy in use . Obviously, soon you find yourself simply activating the automatic battle by accelerating the time, given that the grinding takes up a large part of the progression, leaving the most important and demanding battles to the right manual control. The management of the characters is an aspect that requires particular attention, with the need to evolve the various fighters and apply the enhancement Memoria Stones to them. It is also the element that opens the door to countless micro-transactions, of course, which allow you to speed up the growth process without running into wild grinding, but here it is clearly the player's choice whether to rely on the paid shortcut or not. On the other hand, the need to resort to buying gems to carry out the summons is more forced, given that some characters are practically impossible to obtain through game rewards, which are also particularly scarce unlike many other similar titles. Tales of Crestoria alternates a rather cheesy 3D graphics, but still pleasant, as regards the fights,to the excellent 2D illustrations with which the story is told. Obviously the latter are the most precious parts of the entire production, to underline how the narrative substrate is the characterizing element of this game. If the combat system and the gacha dynamics are both totally derivative and not at all original, the story and the way it is staged is the real protagonist of the whole gaming experience.", "date": "2020-07-25", "grade": "6.8"}
