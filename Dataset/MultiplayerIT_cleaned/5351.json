For those who dislike science fiction in the most absolute way, No Man's Sky will say absolutely nothing. For those who, on the other hand, have wanted even once in their life a good telescope to better spy on the craters of the Moon, No Man's Sky will already arouse variable interest. Sean Murray's creature wanted to be this right from the start: an intimate game - personal, like so many good indies developed with passion - and a love letter to those who grew up on bread and sci-fi. Then something happened. The exciting intentions of the Anglo-Saxon company have attracted the attention of the powers that be and the announcements have become promises, the detailed explanations cryptic refusals to anticipate anything on the contents of the game. Many have turned up their noses watching that intimacy transform into a real show of the said and unsaid, but many others have been gripped by an enthusiasm that has ridden each new trailer, each new screenshot. Ultimately, no one knew exactly what No Man's Sky was going to be. To tell the truth, Sean Murray and his cohorts never promised Star Wars-worthy space battles, sophisticated planetary survival simulations, or revolutionary multiplayer modes. Maybe that's why No Man's Sky has betrayed the expectations (?) of its fans and maybe that's why those who were looking for an experience rather than the new video game of the moment are enjoying it more. We are also in the middle. The version we are about to review is the PlayStation 4 version, while we will dedicate a separate study to the PC equivalent, which has highlighted some problems. Is No Man's Sky a game changer or a crazy crap? Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between... The first curvature is never forgotten Let us tell you something that happened to us a few days ago, as we popped out of hyperspace into a new star system a couple of hundred light-years away from the third Atlas we visited. So, the glowing filaments around our cockpit turned into stars and suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of a space battle between gigantic spaceships. Being too close to the fight and a planet, it was impossible for us to dash away at full speed, so we resigned ourselves to dodging the photon beams and side with one of the two factions without even knowing why. We nosed up and dove among the asteroids for cover from the fighters unleashed upon us, but eventually our deflector shields gave out and we respawned at the nearest space station. Sighing, we boarded our shuttle - but hadn't it exploded? - and we went back to picking up our possessions left hanging in space. The battle still raged, but when we returned, no one paid attention to us, so we took our loot back and landed on the nearby planet in search of resources to upgrade those too weak deflector shields. Our intervention has left no sign in the delicate relationships between the alien species, if not even at the level of gameplay. No Man's Sky is a game of profound contradictions. There's that moment when it exalts you, making you forget you're sitting in an armchair, on Earth, in front of the television. A moment later he forcefully reminds you that his procedural universe is restricted to the hard drive of the PlayStation 4 or PC and that, after all, it's just a game. In this precarious balance, every problem of the ambitious Hello Games project is hidden. Early experiences are the best. The first jump to light speed, performed after having found all the components necessary to manufacture the specific fuel cell through a process divided into several steps, gives incredible satisfaction. You've just loaded the shuttle's tank, lifted off and nosed up out of the atmosphere, then choose your destination star system in the (very awkward) star map and confirm your jump. A minute later you have arrived in a new system, where new celestial bodies await you to explore. There are fifteen quintillion of them, the folks at Hello Games said, whatever that strange number means. Each of them has its own flora, fauna and of course its own atmosphere. There are planets colder than Hoth and planets hotter than Mustafar. Some are constantly battered by pesky acid rain, others are covered by endless oceans. On some animal life thrives, on others the flora is also luxuriant and among the strange shrubs it roamsno quadrupeds that could attack us or run away with their paws raised: unfortunately the artificial intelligence of indigenous creatures does not foresee large leaps. Never would it have been more accurate to say that the variety is not lacking, yet after the fourth or fifth warp trip you begin to notice the similarities. Yes, the colors change, the geometries and the landscapes change, but the same shuttles always ply the skies and the plants and animals are a continuous mixture of shapes and details already seen in the previous planets. The stations, shelters, emporiums and ancient ruins are always the same, residues of alien civilizations that have far preceded us, somewhat diminishing our pride as space pioneers. Why can we rename a newly discovered planetif there is surely already a station manned by some Gek or Korvax eager to do business with us? Not that there's all this coming and going of galactic explorers, mind you. No Man's Sky is a game of loneliness bordering on depression. The splendid and punctual soundtrack does the rest, further immersing us in a vast, boundless and unknown universe. There are those moments when you go up a hill to mine some Plutonium and look around: we have descended on a desert planet and there are certainly no Arrakis worms on the horizon. Only mountains, some plants, some deposits of Eridio. There is literally not a soul around and the only technology is that of our ship, if not some mysterious sentry drone lazily making its rounds. We don't know who or what created those sentinels, nor why the Atlas keeps calling us; in that moment we are alone with ourselves, millions of light years from home, where no one - apart from some procedural alien - has ever gone before. Playstation 4 trophies There are only 23 No Man's Sky trophies, but unlocking them is a delight since almost all of them mention novels, short stories and multimedia works that have made the history of modern science fiction. It goes without saying that to get the 6 bronze trophies, 8 silver, 8 gold and the culminating platinum you will have to explore, craft and analyze like hell. Have a good trip! Masters of our destiny The fact that there is a mysterious force in the depths of the universe that is summoning us and that we come across aliens belonging to different species cannot and should not suggest even in a dream that No Man's Sky leans on some kind of plot. Because it sort of does, but it's so cryptic and dark that, rightly so, one can't help but think of 2001: A Space Odyssey. As it should be, given that Sean Murray and his developers were deeply inspired by science fiction cornerstones such as Kubrick's masterpiece. There is also a bit of The Martian and Interstellar in No Man's Sky, between survival and black holes: bread for the teeth of several generations of gamers. The older ones will recognize in the absolutely exceptional artistic style the illustrations that evoked the mysteries of space in the publications of a few decades ago. The younger ones could simply appreciate the stylistic virtuosity of a graphic sector that does not want to amaze us with incredible special effects, but only to involve us, intrigue us. It is above all the colors that succeed in the enterprise, giving back the feeling of being exploring an alien environment completely different from the natural ones we are used to, with all due respect to the frame rate which sometimes drops below 30 frames per second, especially at the entrance in the atmosphere, when even an ugly pop-up becomes more evident. And if in our wanderings we come across some sentient, there is nothing strange. Have you ever taken a stroll through some unfamiliar city and bumped into a stranger in a deserted alley? It's not that that brief encounter changed your life, it's not that it has to mean anything. You ran into a random guy, maybe waved at him, and that was it. The next day you have already forgotten. Well, encounters in No Man's Sky are like this. The idea works, up to a point. The planets of Hello Games are littered with artifacts that teach us the most important words of alien languages, allowing us to at least partially understand the verses of our interlocutors. Actually, knowing the language of the aliens or not doesn't change anything at all. The game always tells us their intentions and ravings, leaving little room for imagination. And so, a Vy'keen waving in front of a monitor is simply deciding whether or not to accept a marriage proposal. Will we advise him to do so, or will we dissuade him from committing himself for life? Comprehendexactly his words are not needed, even if sometimes he allows us to choose the correct answer, especially in the case in which we are asked for a specific trade good. Unfortunately, however, the interaction with the alien species begins and ends there: at most you trade or buy some spaceship or some multi-tool, increasing your reputation with the various factions without having any idea why or the benefits that we will be able to derive from it . The same goes for what we could call the main ~questline~, even if it doesn't really exist. Essentially, the player can take three paths without ever being bound to any of them. He can freely explore left and right, follow the route towards the center of the universe or follow the one suggested by the Atlanteans, metaphysical entities that are several star systems away from each other. Meeting them all could lead to something. Refusing to follow them, getting lost in the cosmos in an attempt to discover what is at its core, could prove to be even more important. It is the player who chooses what to do, but in both cases he doesn't do it by following a pressing script that stimulates him with questions and mysteries to solve. The ~story~ of No Man's Sky is that of every day. There's infinite space and there's us, and even if we can't travel at the speed of light to explore it, that continues and will continue to exist. If in No Man's Sky you reach the center of the universe instead of the last Atlas or vice versa, essentially nothing will change for anyone. Not even for those players, on the other side of the cosmos, who are renaming planets you haven't visited yet after their high school teachers. The Explorer's Crisis So far we have mainly painted the inner beauty of No Man's Sky, its pioneering spirit both in the true sense of the concept and from a technological point of view. That the work of Hello Games is almost futuristic, we believe it is a fact. That it doesn't want to be a simulator like Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen should be just as clear. No Man's Sky is an exploration game for those who feel at least a little bit of an explorer at heart. You land on a planet, accumulate resources to manufacture new technologies, and prepare for another journey; meanwhile, you analyze life forms and admire new landscapes, getting paid to do it. Each new discovery uploaded - manually one by one, unfortunately - in the intergalactic database, perhaps renamed for the occasion, rewards the player in credit units. So far, everything works great. But then, once more Carbon has been extracted, our suit sends us a message that will soon become worse than a catchphrase: ~inventory full~. No Man's Sky is short on space right from the start: you have to manage slots in your multi-tool, suit and spaceship to accumulate resources and install new tech upgrades. Over time, you learn to expand your inventory by finding new multi-tools, increasing suit pockets in space stations, or buying spaceships from aliens who want to discard them. To do this, however, you need money, and to accumulate money you need to fill your inventory with resources to sell. However, the same resources are used to power the mining beam with which they are harvested, to refuel our spaceship and to keep the suit systems active. No Man's Sky almost immediately enters a vicious circle which, frankly, kills the pleasure of exploration a bit. Progression in the game isn't vertical, so the first few hours are bound to be the hardest: you spend a lot of time in your inventory moving resources, crafting components, and micromanaging each space. Planets are scoured in search of power-ups that can help us explore them better, and when they are found, the game only becomes easier and, in the long run, boring. There are those who describe No Man's Sky as a ~survival~, but surviving is not difficult. Just replenish the gauges when needed, that's all. The sentinels that could attack us do little damage and are scattered in an instant; the same goes for alien animals, when they don't run away as soon as they see us. The only threat is represented by the space corsairs who could decide to target us during our travels, but even in that case the player is not punished: just return to our grave and collect the loot, then resume travelling. Within a very few hours a real routine is established: you land, you search the points of interest identified by scanning, you analyze something, you refuel and you collect resources to sell or consume.
