{"name": "Castle Crumble", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castle-crumble-recensione.html", "text": "Indiscriminate destruction, but even more so that controlled and studied, have always been part of the game, intended precisely as a childhood pastime extended to more advanced ages. Even in construction, the next phase has never been without its charm. Just think of the creation of sand castles or more or less complex structures with Lego and similar toys: when we find ourselves pulling everything down, we often do it with undisguised satisfaction. Well, on this principle we have to base the review of Castle Crumble, a game that elevates the art of castle destruction to a specific skill, through numerous levels and few but rigorous rules linked to a convincing physics simulation. The Orbital Knight team had already experienced something like this with the previous Spire Blast, of which this seems like a sort of sequel, even if with a different title. There is no great story behind it: we find ourselves playing a sort of knight, or perhaps a gunner or in any case a leader of some kind, intent on already throwing down enemy castles using various systems: from cannonballs to explosives up to even specialized destruction magic, trying to find the tool, the effect and the most effective on which to apply blows in order to achieve the goal, or rather the coveted collapse of the strong mocker who stands out before us. That's all, and strangely it also works properly: obviously it's not an exciting adventure between twists and cinematic moments, nor a particularly enthralling puzzle, but in its zen simplicity it still manages to be a very pleasant pastime, perfectly included in the Apple Arcade catalog. Castle destroyers Castle Crumble: Later levels have increasingly complex structures Castle Crumble is spread over a succession of progressive levels whose level of difficulty increases with a remarkable slowness, so as to require a substantial amount of time before meeting a minimum rate of challenge, which could soon bore a good amount of people. The gameplay, on the other hand, is based more on the pleasure of the game action than on the level of challenge, therefore such an approach could be in line with the general philosophy that pervades everything. Each level develops on single screens, with the castle to be destroyed in the center: many are structured in several stages, requiring the collapse of all the fortifications placed in succession within the maximum amount of shots available. On these limitations, initially very generous, the whole ~strategic~ part is structured, so to speak. At the beginning of each level, the number of phases that make it up, the types of weapons available and the amount of ammunition the elements with which it is necessary to complete the mission. It's up to us to select which weapons to use and where to aim them to get the maximum possible damage, because the collapse of the castle must take place in the least amount of moves. In Castle Crumble we go from classic western medieval castles to Aztec constructions To obtain this result, it is necessary to study the structural weaknesses of the buildings and focus precisely on these to try to damage them as much as possible: for example, if a building has wooden grafts in the middle of the stone walls, it may be a good idea to focus on the least resistance of these to trigger a chain collapse, or apply explosives to the joint points and make them explode with precise cannon shots. There is a good simulation of physics at the base of everything, which is fundamental to the mechanics of the game itself. The general simplicity, in graphic terms, helps to make the destruction of the structures more dynamic and widespread, but the effect is still remarkable, considering how little an environmental interaction of this type is exploited even in modern games.", "date": "2023-02-10", "grade": "6.5"}
