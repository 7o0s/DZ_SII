{"name": "NBA SuperCard", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-supercard-recensione.html", "text": "The NBA SuperCard review can only start from a dutiful observation: finding the perfect formula for a mobile game today isn't easy, but it seems that 2K Games has succeeded, if we consider the great success of WWE SuperCard, and it has all the intention to exploit this concept in other areas. We had no doubts that the next sport to transform into a card battler would be basketball with an official NBA license, and so here we are grappling with this new freemium production for iOS and Android devices , downloadable for free and playable without major limitations, for as long as you want. Gameplay As it was legitimate to imagine, the gameplay of NBA SuperCard reproduces the mechanics of the aforementioned WWE SuperCard in a very faithful way, only by replacing the wrestling superstars with the many athletes of the NBA and WNBA: from LeBron James to Candace Parker, passing through Kevin Durant, the game roster does not miss anything at all and uses the classic rarity system to determine the most powerful and effective cards. After a few minutes the focus of the experience is already quite clear: continue to unlock new cards and therefore new players , enhance those in our possession and create a competitive deck with which to face any challenger within the main mode, the quick match. It is an asynchronous multiplayer battle which is basically based on the statistics of our athletes, and which has an automatic outcome. Our task will only be to select the cards in the context of four consecutive tests that can focus on attack or defense skills, rebounding, playmaking skills, harmony and so on. We will therefore be able to enjoy seeing these stickers that move in the middle of the field mimicking, as far as possible, the movements of the real NBA stars: the effect is less funny than the moves of the WWE SuperCard wrestlers, but still pleasant. With each victory we will get rewards, mainly new cards but also coins and upgrades. Resources that we will be able to use to improve the characteristics of the players on our deck, ~sacrificing~ the less skilled ones to raise the level of our top athletes. Needless to say, the appeal of this unlock/boost/quick match loop increases the more you are into basketball. Structure We said Quick Play is at the heart of the NBA SuperCard experience, but it's not the only mode available. It is in fact possible to participate in the Championships, although this option is completely passive and based on the statistics of the deck, with not too exciting rewards; or try your hand at the special events that will appear cyclically, and which are already being clamored for by the community. having to wait for energy to recharge or something like that. However, it is a pity that the developers did not consider introducing some innovations with respect to the formula we know well, limiting themselves also from a technical point of view to taking up the ideas seen in WWE SuperCard.", "date": "2020-12-17", "grade": "7.0"}
