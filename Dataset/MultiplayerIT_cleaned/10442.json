The similarities with mouse control are in fact numerous: same immediacy (indeed, more), same ease of use and at least similar final results. In short, the RTS developers have a not indifferent weapon at their disposal to assert their reasons in terms of gameplay and game depth, even in perhaps unfavorable situations. In the case of Castle Warriors, we have a strategic one in real time controlled completely with the fingers, which exploits the technical capabilities of the iPhone to show off spectacular 3D graphics, on the other extremely functional to the action. It is no coincidence that the GameResort product tutorial lasts a few seconds: the controls are really simple and immediate, and the rules on which the game is based are few and essential. Counting on three different levels of difficulty, our goal in each stage is to conquer all the towers present. We start from a first tower (located in the lower part of a ~spherical~ map, i.e. one that scrolls by rotating on itself) with a certain number of men available and we must move them towards the empty towers to automatically take control of them, or towards those in hand to the enemy to try to conquer them. The combat system is completely automatic, that is, just move the troops towards an enemy tower for it to be besieged until our men all die or until their opponents die. In the end, it's all about the numbers: if our expedition outnumbers the troops holding a tower, then the tower will probably be captured without too much trouble. Who would you throw off the tower? As mentioned, the Castle Warriors control system is very simple and intuitive. Just touch one of our towers with your finger for it to be selected, then touch the tower we want to move the troops towards to see them leave immediately. When we select a tower, an icon appears at the bottom right of the screen that allows us to select the number of troops we want to send: 25% of the total, half, 75% or all. It is clear that leaving a tower without men inside is a risk, because it means that any group of enemies will be able to conquer her in an instant and effortlessly. The best thing, therefore, is to always leave a certain number of soldiers to defend the positions, hoping that those on the move are enough to achieve the objectives that we set ourselves from time to time. In each stage, the number of towers to be conquered increases, and at the same time a time limit is set for their conquest: five days, ten days, etc. In the upper part of the screen we can see the time that passes from sunrise to sunset, and which precisely marks the passing of a day. If our troops are engaged in a fight, at sunset this will automatically be interrupted for everyone to return to their tower for the night. With each new day our troops (as well as the enemy ones) receive reinforcements, only that these reinforcements replenish the number of men present in the starting tower and moving them towards the ends of the map is anything but simple or fast. Indeed, in the event that one of our most advanced towers is besieged, we will almost certainly not be able to intervene in time to save it. It must also be said that in some cases the tower selection tool works poorly, i.e. we find ourselves sending troops to the wrong target, with no way to cancel the order. The game boasts a decent technical realization: the map is completely three-dimensional and flows smoothly and quickly under our fingers. The scenarios change depending on the stage, but it's more about color choices. The towers are all the same, as are the troops, with the result that the clashes between the two armies visually appear anything but spectacular, represented as they are by a ~fuss~ that calculates its victims in a somewhat too schematic way . The sound accompaniment is adequate to the action but does not stay in the head. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-10-23", "grade": "6.0"}
