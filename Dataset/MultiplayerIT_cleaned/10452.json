{"name": "La terza  la volta buona?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70968-naruto-shippuden-ninja-council-3-naruto-shippuden-ninja-council-3-european-version.html", "text": "Shippuden is Japanese for something like ~hurricane chronicles~: this term identifies the second series (animated, since there is no distinction in comics) of Naruto, a popular manga written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. Years ago Naruto was presented a bit as the spiritual heir of Dragon Ball and in fact he almost managed to reach his media diffusion. As for Shippuden, suffice it to say that at a certain point in history the young ninja Sasuke Uchiha, friend and rival of the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki, gives in to the ~dark side~ of the ninja and joins a group of conspirators: Naruto then decides to undertake a grueling workout, hoping to get his old friend back on track. There is therefore a gap of three years between the first and second series of Naruto: the characters have grown and matured and the plot takes on more adult tones. Paradoxically, Ninja Council 3 comes out in Europe just under a year after Ninja Council 2 and proposes the transition to the Shippuden series: has something changed in the video game too? Repetita iuvant? Unfortunately all the problems encountered in the previous episode of Ninja Council (and to be honest also in the first edition) also return to afflict this third chapter. Fortunately, a step forward has been made from a technical point of view: in reality, the only noteworthy change is limited to the new sprites that reflect, precisely, the growth of the characters and their new clothes; the main protagonists are well animated and detailed, while the enemies have been largely taken from the prequel: the variety from this point of view is very little, the opponents we will meet are very similar to each other and crudely animated. Some implemented graphics features sweeten the pill, such as numerous shadows and transparent afterimages that increase the quality of some animations. Even the various locations in which the missions are set have been recycled from the previous chapters: the design is slightly different but the players will recognize practically the same settings and the same general poverty of detail and colors. Fortunately, the animations relating to the Jutsu, the special techniques that distinguish the various characters, remain commendable: their activation triggers a scene halfway between a comic and an animated sequence, in which the character on duty launches his attack at the enemies. A treat for fans, for sure. Beat the iron until it is hot Clearly Tomy didn't try too much in the production of this sequel: it's useless to go around it, Ninja Council 3 is the recycling party. Most of the missions are exactly the same as Ninja Council 2 with a new narrative background, the problem is that already in Ninja Council 2 the gameplay was repetitive, tedious and irritating. The main flaw of Ninja Council 3 is certainly the control system: the layout of the keys remains abstruse as in the prequels and involves many annoyances. Combining the pressures of the various keys to run up a wall, for example, is decidedly frustrating: it often translates into unwanted falls on deaf ears and the delay in response to player inputs is a defect that should have been solved already in the prequel but which instead returns forcefully to make even Ninja Council 3 cumbersome and rigid to play. The mission structuring deceives on the variety of the game, which is reduced to a series of extremely banal stages in which you control one character at a time and beat up the enemies on duty by jumping from one platform to another and collecting experience points and money to learn new skills; however, the difference between the fighters is minimal and is generally reduced to the peculiar Jutsu which, once activated, require particular actions such as blowing on the microphone or touching certain points on the screen, making them more interactive than a very common ~super blow~. It must be said that the various ~bosses~ are quite fun to deal with as they give the game the appearance of a traditional fighting game: generally the boss is then unlocked and made accessible for the rest of the adventure or for the multiplayer mode introduced in this episode by Tomy. In fact, up to four players can connect their DS and respective cartridges to face a series of challenges in cooperative or one against all: a rather nice idea, except that the control system remains a disgrace and consequently it is really unlikely find three other friends in possession of the cartridge.", "date": "2009-10-21", "grade": "4.5"}
