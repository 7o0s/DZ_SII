Because the production of the US company is indeed a title with a very specific target, that of kids, but unlike many other exponents of this genre, this does not rhyme with a poor and limited product. Far from it. Portal of wonders The basic concept is as simple as it is intriguing: being able to actively combine and mix real plastic toys (or rather, statuettes) with video games, so as to make two parallel ~worlds~ interact with each other, albeit both protagonists of desires of the ~teens~. Considering then how influential and important the tastes of the children are within the expenses of the families, it is clear how Activision has well framed the potential of the product in question. In practice, operation is very simple. In practice, the game provides for the existence of 32 statuettes of different creatures, called precisely Skylanders, which can be used; of these, 3 are present in the game package, while the others must be purchased separately at the not too popular price of around 10 euros each, or 20 for a pack of 3. The point of contact between reality and video game is realized thanks to the Portal, or a peripheral in the shape of a circular platform also contained in the bundle called Starter Pack. By placing a character on the Portal, the magic happens: that same character appears on the screen, becoming then playable protagonist of the adventure. The procedure is very simple and immediate, and it is possible at any time to replace the creature resting on the platform with another in one's possession; a substitution which, beyond the obvious aesthetic differences, becomes important and bearer of repercussions also on a playful level. This is because every single Skylanders is equipped with specific characteristics, attacks and attributes, such as to distinguish them markedly from each other in practice. Furthermore, each statuette preserves the progress achieved by using it, thanks to the (bland) RPG elements that allow you to improve the characteristics of the characters, gain skills, use objects and level up; this aspect allows, for example, to bring one's statuettes to the house of a friend, who also owns the game, to play local multiplayer with the creatures that one has painstakingly raised. An intelligent and interesting solution, even more framed in the totally multi-platform perspective of this element; if the above friend has for example Skylanders for Xbox 360, while we for Wii, the procedure will still work without any problem. This aspect is only one of many that underline the care taken by Activision in the realization of the project; there is not only a good basic idea, but also its development has evidently been carried out with passion and trust, and the goodness of the final result is the best proof of this. Collect them all? Obviously the efforts in terms of design and construction of the whole system just described would have been rather useless in the face of a dull and disappointing video game. Luckily instead, in addition to the interesting side dish, Skylanders also offers a quality main course, albeit decidedly more standard and traditional in content. In essence it is a simple and accessible ~hack and slash~ action game, particularly devoted to fighting and solving simple environmental puzzles. The various levels, reachable from a main area that acts as a junction point, essentially require to be crossed from start to finish by eliminating enemies and collecting coins and treasures, to be spent later on enhancing the creatures. The use of different statuettes during the game is encouraged by a series of situations, basically related to the elemental aptitude of each Skylander; in fact, the creature can belong to Water, Earth, Fire, Air, Magic, Technique, Undead and Life, and this entails both greater strength within areas of the same element, and greater vulnerability to enemies belonging to the antagonistic element . An interesting system, but not the only one present in the game, since for example there are areas of the levels accessible only to Skylander with a precise affinity. Consequently it is clear that, for accede to all the contents offered by the Activision production, it is necessary to have at least one statuette for each element; fortunately this is an optional condition, since the 3 basic characters contained in the initial kit are more than sufficient to reach the end of the adventure. However, owning more statuettes is a real stimulus, because the various Skylanders are practically all well differentiated and characterized both from an aesthetic and animation point of view, as well as from a practical one: the attributes and attacks are in fact unique, and the element of growth with relative enhancement of the characteristics constitutes a constant goad to continue in the game. The level design is quite satisfying, if a bit repetitive in the long run; while maintaining the necessary accessibility, it would have been preferable to encounter some greater variation during the progression of the adventure. Finally, the technical aspect is not bad, with graphics that in the Wii version we tested can count on a sufficient level of detail but above all on a pleasant and colorful characterization.", "date": "2011-11-04", "grade": "8.2"}
