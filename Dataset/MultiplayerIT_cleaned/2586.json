{"name": "Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heavy-metal-fakk2.html", "text": "Continue ... that is catching me! The first thing that catches the eye is the spectacular graphics of course, never seen before in a 3rd person game. A profusion of lights and graphic effects spread like a magical cloak over textures with maniacal and precise detail, fluid and convincing animations, especially for the main character... too much grace! It's all justified by the choice of the 3D engine par excellence, that of Quake 3 Arena, which once again proves to be at the top, revised and corrected just enough for the change of view. The Rituals, developers of the game have been able to properly squeeze the ~beast~ of the ID obtaining a delicious, fresh and nutritious juice (ahem.. ok, I'm going to have a drink then I'll come back) ... let's say that the eye is satisfied. The ear as well I would say: EAX at the ball and sustained music that dynamically adapts to situations ... strictly rock (neighbors and across the street you are warned)! Well, do we have a solid foundation and what do we still come up with? Simply said: an arsenal with counter-flakes. Weapons, lots of weapons! Cutting, fire, throwing, bombs, magic weapons, etc. A wide range of reasons to rage on opponents more often and in the most disparate ways. In fact, you will be able to hold a different weapon for each arm, effectively controlling the left and right independently, simply by using the respective mouse buttons. Not only that, you can also perform special moves with devastating effects on enemies and the combinations are many, different for each pair of weapons used. However, how to do them is not up to me to tell you, the exhaustive tutorial present at the beginning of the game will take care of it. To tell the truth, it is not initially easy to fully master the control system, which requires some time to be fully assimilated. In particular in the most chaotic combat situations it will be important to start with the right weapon, otherwise you will lose precious moments to change it, sometimes fatal. Stop the hormonal storm! The feeling is the right one anyway and even the cerebellum will sometimes be stimulated (without exaggerating, obviously) and already the first ~boss~ will require a bit of cunning for example, demonstrating the fact that throwing yourself head-on against the enemy will not always be a good idea. However, there is plenty of blood and the clashes will become increasingly bloody over time (wait until you see the two-handed ax and you'll understand). Ultimately FAKK2 is a title that I promote, however making a necessary premise: to be appreciated it must be taken in the right spirit. Become aware of the fact that you are faced with a good-naturedly noisy game, full of action in fantastic and hallucinatory landscapes, permeated by the role of a very tacky protagonist (the right adjective is ~a manza-maranza~ I would say). Do you think you can enjoy all of this? If the answer is yes, then disconnect from the internet, turn off your PC and rush to the shopkeeper, possibly passing through the window! If, on the other hand, you are more skeptical let me tell you something... with this game there is nothing overly new, but ~only~ an excellent improvement of a consolidated style of play. I suggest you try it and then maybe you'll change your mind and thank me (or you'll stick to your position and send me to hell... never mind, I tried!) Don't call me tonight though... I'm going out to dinner with Julie! Julie vs. Lara How many times have we predicted this clash? Countless by now, but the comparison is inevitable when seeing this FAKK2. Sure, there have been plenty of 3D third-person view titles out there, but now we're faced with a direct competitor to Tomb Raider and if I may add, knocking it out of its crown in my opinion. Let's motivate this statement though... starting from the concept of image. The world of video games today is certainly characterized by an almost desperate race in search of the charismatic protagonist character, the one who even before the game itself arouses the desire to buy in fans. Whether this attitude is a cross or a delight for us gamers I don't know for sure... anyway going back to FAKK2 here we are: a female protagonist with all the ~attributes~ in the right place and a charisma like few others. Julie is a natural leader, she is ready to do anything to save the people she has brought together in the land of Eden and will sacrifice herself more than once for good. That alone would make her more likeable than any snotty archaeologist who shoots tigers. And with Julie nothing but wild cats! We will be immersed in a hostile world, but in some particular way, almost visionary and invitingta to explore it; a swirl of colors, tints, strange locations and bizarre creatures will surround you as evidence of the fact that globally it can be said that Heavy Metal FAKK2 is a vital, immersive, engaging game. Qualities that are worth gold nowadays, right? Thanks also to a solid background that has its roots even in the 80s when comic series and then films laid the foundations for a brand of sure impact.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
