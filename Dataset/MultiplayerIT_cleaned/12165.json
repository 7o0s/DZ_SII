This is because the use of the rear paraphernalia is limited in use due to the relative overheating, which prevents the gamer from always keeping his finger pressed on the trigger, forcing him, we rightly add, to weigh well the best moment to launch an attack . And therefore it is not always appropriate to mount the most powerful weapons on the back of the vehicle. But let's take a closer look at the race issue. Once you hit the track, you immediately realize the frenzy of Full Auto: Battlelines 2, but also some imperfections in vehicle control. Once the race has begun, it will be necessary to move with skill at great speed through the streets of the city, and depending on the objective, give vent to the devastating fury that is in us. Procuring the ammunition scattered along the way, the gamer can open fire by pressing the ~R~ backbone to fire the main weapon, and the ~L~ key to use the secondary one, on the back. It should be noted that the track also has points that can be ~hit~ by bullets and therefore usable in various ways: for example, a petrol pump hit at the right time can become a deadly source of destruction for the opponents behind us or in front, engulfed in flames and the air displacement of the explosion. Just as a demolished wall can prove to be a valid way to find a shortcut. As in Burnout Dominator, by destroying enemy cars or performing acrobatic actions while driving, you will also get energy points that will fill the appropriate bar on the screen which, once full, will activate the turbo or an option that allows the user to manage time to your liking. In practice, in these situations, for example, it is possible to move the hands of the clock back a few moments, perhaps before an accident or a driving error, in order to avoid it and not compromise the outcome of one's race. Frustrating All good, all great. Too bad, however, that the control of the car is not the best of life and that SEGA has sensationally wrong in the calibration of the controls, both with the directional cross and with the lever. The result is a gameplay that at times is penalized by the intrinsic difficulty of managing the machine by the user, especially in the parts where you use the turbo or battle with enemies, phases in which, in short, you should focus more on weapons and shots to be fired relying on stable, easy road holding. The title therefore turns out to be frustrating and at times repetitive, effectively diminishing the interest in it race after race. And it is of little use to use ~Multiplayer~ via wi-fi (as usual, with a friend who has a PSP and another copy of the game). From an aesthetic point of view, Full Auto 2 falls into that category of games ~that could have been, but are not~, and that is, it presents graphics that appear pretty at first sight but which then, upon in-depth analysis, reveal imperfections and little attention to certain details such as to cause some annoyance in the eyes of the user. The textures that cover the surfaces, just to give an example, whether they are cars or scenarios, are of poor quality and not very detailed, if compared with the competition, but despite this they mysteriously weigh on the game engine to the point of affecting, not you know how, on the frame rate. The same special effects such as explosions or plays of light should be reviewed. With a little more attention and care, it could certainly have been done better. Fortunately, at least the sound sector turns out to be better, with audio effects in the race decidedly on average (beyond sufficiency) and a well-made soundtrack, even if not the best ever heard. Full Auto 2: Battlelines - Review After the uninspiring debut with the previous episode on Xbox 360, and with the PS3 version, Full Auto 2: Battlelines arrives on the PSP, unfortunately confirming the negative aspects already seen on home consoles. The idea behind this genre of games, that is ~fight & destroy~ opponents to get to the finish line first, is revived by SEGA in an unconvincing way. Some interesting ideas, such as the possibility of blowing up portions of scenarios to be used as a trap for enemies, are followed by gameplay made frustrating by imperfect control over vehicles and dull graphics, not worthy of the potential of the Sony portable console . Therefore we would like to recommend FA 2: Battlelines only to the most hardcore fans of the genre, those who don't look anything or anyone ~in the face~ and don't worry too much about imperfections. Pros: Sometimes funny. Some very appreciable ideas (read: interaction with the environment). Great variety of means. Cons: Graphics not altage of PSP. Control of means to be reviewed. Lack of depth career mode. The Sony portable console now abounds in arcade driving games (and not only), being able to count on a plethora of really not bad titles. Last in the order of time among the products of the genre is this Full Auto 2: Battlelines of SEGA, already released with mixed success also on Ps3, a sort of emulator of the better known Burnout. Full Auto 2: Battlelines is one of those driving games in which it's not just about winning races, but also about physically eliminating your opponents, perhaps by blowing them up, throwing them off the road or anticipating them by looking for shortcuts and other tricks not exactly suited to a car race. The game modes for the PSP version are ~Career~, ~Event Attack~ and ~Multiplayer~, of which the first is the main one. In it, the gamer takes on the role of a professional pilot who is tasked with restoring peace and order in a futuristic town at the mercy of organized crime. Assisted by an intelligent government device activated in cases of emergency, S.A.G.E., which will illustrate the main characteristics and weaknesses of the opponents, the Ascendants, players will have to complete various missions divided in turn into various types. Generally the objectives to be completed are of two types, main and secondary, and are visible on the appropriate menu where it is possible to select the area of the city to ~visit~. The former range from simple victory in a race to the physical elimination of the enemy, and are indispensable for advancing in the adventure, while the latter are mainly used to unlock new Items and various Bonuses, and consist in completing races in which you must perform certain actions, such as destroying a certain number of vehicles within a certain amount of time. Having made his choice, the player can select his favorite car (initially only 3 cars are available, as the game progresses the others are unlocked, for a total of 25) and customize it with a respectable paraphernalia (machine guns, anti-car mines , missile launchers, etc) taking care to choose which ones to mount on the front and which on the rear of the car.", "date": "2007-06-27", "grade": null}
