{"name": "Underworld Ascendant", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/Underworld-Ascendant-recensione.html", "text": "We have carefully followed the development of Underworld Ascendant: since the first presentation in the summer of 2014, the level of interest had been positioned very high, both for the pedigree of the names behind the project, and because it was the third ~official~ chapter ~ of Ultima Underworld, a cult series for the RPG Taliban, a cornerstone capable of inspiring the Elder Scrolls saga and many other titles to come. Reading the list of Underworld Ascendant developers is like reading the cast of the Avengers: an endless list of Hollywood stars from whom a result was obviously expected, despite the constraints imposed by a budget that only the Kickstarter campaign was able to replenish . Let us therefore remember who signed this title: Paul Nuerath, founder of Looking Glass; His Majesty Warren Spector (System Shock, Deus Ex); Joe Fielder (BioShock Infinite, Medal of Honor); Tim Stellmach (Thief); and then again Will Texeira, Nate Wells, Justin Pappas and many others who share a curriculum that is the envy of most of their colleagues from competing companies. We also add the ~lore~ of the Stygian Abyss, whose rights have returned to the hands of their respective creators, and the expectations have become, as well as spasmodic, more than legitimate. You can therefore imagine how the hard core of the enthusiasts took it (many of whom let themselves be tempted by the promises of the development team by supporting the crowdfunding campaign), once they got their hands on the ~finished~ product. In fact, you don't even need to imagine, since most of the reviews on Steam are very negative in tone. We add to the chorus: despite all the beautiful premises and promises, if you expect to find yourself in front of a ~real~ third chapter of the 1992 classic (and its sequel the following year) you will unfortunately be disappointed. There are no NPCs to talk to, there are no huge maps to explore, there is no backtracking (nor would there be a reason, the way it is structured), there is no need to sleep, there are no not even the quests, at least as they are usually imagined, but only an interminable sequence of missions that leads to the inevitable final showdown. There are reminiscences of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic or of the Thief series, if we want even of Trespasser, the courageous Dreamworks adventure set in Jurassic Park, but they are just ideas and cues taken and thrown away without being adequately explored . Typhon's challenge Let's start in order: after a series of sleepless nights, our alter-ego is awakened by the guiding voice of Cabirus who informs him of a new and imminent threat to the populations of the Stygian Abiss. We are talking about Typhon, the formidable rival of Zeus, who, leveraging on the differences between the three factions (explorers, dark elves and shamblers), is about to break the chains that imprison him to expand his domain of death and darkness. Nothing simpler than to unite people against a common cause and defeat the lord of the abyss before it's too late. The game begins by simply choosing the name of the avatar and the size of the arms, which are the only things that will be seen, since the title, as tradition requires, is completely subjective. The first missions / tutorials, which take place in Pluto's gate, are used to take measures for the game mechanics which in some way should already be known to those who have followed our many tried ones. One of the most peculiar aspects of Underworld Ascendant is given by the environmental puzzles, which can be solved by interacting with the map as happened in the aforementioned Trespasser. The labyrinths are in fact scattered with furniture (each element of which has its own specific weight) which can be moved, dragged or destroyed: we can use wooden crates to create makeshift stairs, or even set them on fire by leaving them for a few moment over a brazier and then use them to burn a closed door. Moving a cupboard reveals a secret passage, knocking down a bookcase can build a barricade to keep enemies at bay. Although in practice this vaunted feature is mostly limited to the examples described, it hides interesting potential. Naturally the dungeons are populated by enemies: it is possible, and indeed advisable, to avoid clashes, extinguishing the flames with water arrows or passing away from the characteristic luminescent flowers of the OtherSide game, using the same tricks that we had already seen in Thiefe Dishonored. While crouching, an icon appears indicating stealth and a bar above enemiesra displays the alert level. In some cases it is inevitable to go to blows and here the combat system is reminiscent of that of Morrowind or Skyrim: with a single click of the left mouse button a light blow is inflicted, holding it down inflicts a heavier blow, while with the right one he parries. In an RPG, spells could not be missing and Underworld Ascendant offers two types: the first, and faster, involves casting spells using wands, while the second is more complex and uses the same principle as Ultima Underworld. In practice, putting in sequence the runes that are collected during the completion of the game, formulas are unlocked: some are discovered by exploring the engravings scattered throughout the levels, but nothing prevents you from experimenting freely, perhaps giving shape to harmful spells or other undocumented ones. In any case, the execution requires the use of mana that recharges very slowly, making the sorcerer's path a little more difficult than the other two, especially at the beginning. Few levels and repetitive At the end of the level the CPU evaluates the player's actions based on silence, combat, use of magic and exploration of the dungeon; it is then possible to spend the points received to unlock the skills in a tree with three main ramifications, which obviously concern the path of warrior, magician and thief. However, nothing prevents you from creating multiclass characters or champions of a single discipline. The hub of the game is a map called Marcaul (the volcano where Typhon is imprisoned), where representatives of the three game factions are located. In the ~Midnight Forum~ is a bulletin board where you can choose one of four available contracts; the rewards vary according to the quest and are ~multiplied~ if you respect the rules of a bonus challenge, such as not being discovered, not using weapons, and so on. Once you accept a mission, you are teleported to the relative map, and then return to the Marcaul upon completion of the assignment. If you have read our previews you will surely have noticed how we talked about environmental puzzles, strategies for dealing with enemies, the use of magic... but never about interaction with other characters, possible party members, quests and subquests, of dialogues and decisions to make, of weapons to forge... All this because, as we wrote initially, there is simply nothing that made Ultima Underworld memorable. The Ascendant concept is perplexing: not only are the quest objectives of two or three types (find a key, kill a boss, destroy an altar...) but, above all, there are only seven levels available. You got it right: after finishing a mission, in the following one you risk repeating the same dungeon where, however, the doors are blocked again, the traps still in operation, all the enemies in their place (perhaps with some more reinforcements). It is therefore a sterile and endless series of labyrinths that are held together only by the plot which, as can be guessed from what has been written so far, is not only mainly entrusted to the narrative voice of Cabirus and Typhon (there are very few texts to collect scattered throughout the game ), but it's also pretty trivial. The inventory is made with very little care: there is a quick one made up of ten slots, as many as there are number keys, and the real one which can be accessed from the same menu where the map and diary are also found. On the left side you see the areas of the body that can be equipped with armor and rings, but regardless of what you are wearing, there is no visual correspondence to make you understand what it is using. The same icons are then used for several types of objects: so it happens that a broken sword is represented with the same image as a valuable rare sabre. The level design is well made, with dungeons that also develop in depth as well as on the horizontal plane, and full of hidden passages as in the best Doom tradition. Unfortunately, the number of items to collect is limited (except for the furniture we mentioned above) and there is the feeling that they are a little too empty and lifeless (even hostile). Too many problems So far we have described in an aseptic way what Underworld Ascendant offers, but the time has come to understand how it was created. In fact, the criticisms have come both for an excessively linear, shallow and repetitive gameplay, extremely distant from the standards from which the game comes, and for the bugs, and here unfortunately the list is endless. The impression is that of a game released still in a deeply embryonic state and it seems that, despite the tan years available to programmers, development has stopped at the demo versions that have been fed to the press. So let's start with the problems of the physics engine which, despite the alleged refinements, is weak and makes even the most basic things difficult. For example, it is not possible to throw objects: a bottle with acid that cannot be thrown at a distant point, but simply dropped near the target we have to hit, in the same way as the wooden planks of a door that should be uprooted by the magic of the ~moving wood~ wand and which instead move a few millimeters. The combat system in turn lends itself to various criticisms: where magic is really difficult to use, especially due to the huge requests for mana that slowly regenerates, the title seems to have been designed solely and exclusively to reward those who prefer a stealth. The fights are not well balanced, given that two arrows shot into the head of a skeleton knock him out while a dozen violent hammer blows between the neck and collarbone are not enough to knock him to the ground. Even the artificial intelligence should be reviewed a bit because if on the one hand we do not expect strike team tactics from simple skeletons, on the other it is implausible that one would remain looking at the horizon while the other, a few steps away, he is engaged by the player. What about the dungeons, which often lack entire ~pieces~ of the map, so that it is possible to move from one point to another by crossing walls or get stuck in the middle of trees or the frame of a broken door? Not only can you not dive into the stretches of water but you can even walk on them with the curious effect of crossing the escalators in reverse. The save system is one of the aspects that has raised the most controversy; so let's try to explain it well. During a level you can memorize your position by planting silver seeds (reminiscent of the previous Ultima Underworld) in special flower beds: in doing so, once killed, you are reborn near the last tree with all progress preserved. This also leads to a certain sterility given that, apart from penalizing the final score of the quest, respawning does not have other disadvantages, considering that an enemy hit several times will already have his life halved. However, if you exit and re-enter, the game restarts from the starting point, with only some progress saved (typically some previously opened doors), but with all enemies and objects in their place, including closed chests. Now all this is more or less digestible in the smaller maps, but you understand what it can lead to in the more extensive ones, so we do not recommend venturing into a run if you have a few minutes available. Graphics and surroundings From a graphic point of view, no one expected to be left with their mouths wide open, and in fact Underworld Ascendant cannot be said to tear off the clothes. However, the character design is nice, with characters that seem to have more than a few genes in common with those of Fable. It's just a pity that variety isn't the house's strong point: in the first five missions we only found skeletons and a couple of archers. But even in this case we are forced to report various ugliness and bugs: we are referring to the eye icon which indicates the player's degree of invisibility, a real punch in the face, but also to some textures that are less well-finished than others (such as those of the 'waterfall). The dubbing is essential, the voices of Cabirus and Typhon can be heard (it is not clear why at the beginning you can choose the tone of your avatar, since he never speaks), the soundtrack is limited to certain highlights while everything else is entrusted to ambient noises that do their job well. It seems incredible but even here there is something wrong: the subtitles cannot be deactivated, a rather annoying oversight not only for the most savvy in English, but also because the written text and the spoken one often do not match. In turn, non-reassignable commands represent another gross error that, while easily fixable, should not have occurred in a title sold as ~complete~. Even the dialogue with the hardware needs to be improved, because an engine like Unity can't struggle to run on mid-range cards like the GeForce GTX 1060 at the maximum level of detail in high resolution. We used an older sister (GTX 1080) at a resolution of 3440x1440 and we encountered slowdowns and freezes of a few seconds when loading new areas of the map no", "date": "2018-11-22", "grade": "5.0"}
