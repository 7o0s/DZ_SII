{"name": "Undungeon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/undungeon-recensione.html", "text": "Laughing Machines, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, has finally released Undungeon, an action RPG that some may have already given a taste with the ~Arena~ version (now no longer available on Steam). So here's our review of Undungeon, an ARPG with good ideas, but a few too many edges. End of the multiverse The void of Undungeon The multiverse isn't big news anymore, but that's not much of a concern for Laughing Machines. In fact, Undungeon is not a world, but seven worlds which - due to a cataclysm known as the Shift - have collapsed against each other. The whole universe is in jeopardy and we are the Void, or rather a part of it, a creation of it, a Herald who must bring the End to give a new Beginning. What remains is a wasteland, a kind of western world with low-fi influences where desert robbers, giant scorpions and absurd creatures barely survive, waiting for our arrival. What you'll immediately notice in Undungeon, should you decide to dive into its narrative universe (universes?), is that the team has taken the role-playing direction seriously. From the very first moment a large world is presented, with names of places, characters, divine and immortal beings and above all with rules according to how everything works. Laughing Machines must be acknowledged for having taken care of the details, creating a world based on solid rules, even if not very clear at first glance. In fact, we are quickly overwhelmed by dialogues that tell us about nuclei, worlds, dimensional planes, veils that separate them and so on. What matters, though, is that we are there to stabilize the world and then build up mass to create a new one, perhaps even helping some struggling mortal who has lost their favorite pet. Undungeon is a verbose game, get ready, which hides multiple optional dialogues, which obviously give access to new information about the world, but also about fundamental skills to maximize your gameplay. Even if from the gameplay it could first of all seem like a pure action dungeon crawler, Undungeon focuses above all on the narrative, which proves to be interesting (without revolutions) if you decide to take your time. Exploration and upgrade Undungeon dungeons are never very structured Of course, you don't spend all your time talking to NPCs. Our character must regularly launch himself into dungeons which - unfortunately - quickly become repetitive. These are mostly small and unintriguing arenas, with some prize chests hidden at times, but there is little exploratory in the approach of Undungeon: once in an arena, one must first of all tear apart the enemies. The combat system is structured but basically classic. We will be able to attack melee, activate special abilities (basic, a shield that parries a single blow and a timed explosive mine), dodge (with even extra special effects with the right equipment) and use a series of objects, such as weapons from throwing, grenades and healing. The Undungeon Organ Menu Within a couple of hours you will be inundated with objects of various types, capable of healing or causing negative effects such as bleeding, poisoning, burns and more. These are many gameplay details, which add up to the fact that depending on the type of damage we will use to eliminate enemies, we will also change the type of rewards obtained, from the essence (basically experience points, which however can be spent perform multiple game actions) up to crafting materials. The latter - of many different types - are then essential for creating the organs (literally hearts, stomachs and so on) with which to equip our character. Organs activate various stat bonuses, even very serious ones, but they are always in danger. In fact, when you die, instead of going KO, you permanently lose one of your organs, which will then have to be recreated. The latter is no mean feat as the expense in terms of materials is considerable, unless you engage in farming and purchases from merchants scattered throughout the game world. The vendors, however, trade through barter and - consequently - it is always essential to go to the dungeons and collect all the objects possible, even spending the time breaking vegetation and objects, one by one. Undungeon therefore overwhelms us with elements, statistics, effects, menus to check for upgrades and bonuses: everything happens very quickly and it could take a moment to get into the best perspective. Combat The Undugeon overmap The main problem though is the combat system. our character,to be a Herald of the Void, an immortal being awaited by generations of survivors of a multidimensional reality, he is quite fragile, especially when he starts losing his organs and weapons (these too get damaged and become useless, and we won't learn how to repair them before a few hours of play). We also need to know that every enemy who lands a hit on us rises in rank, thus becoming stronger. Ranks are lost after a while, but become a shield that parries a blow. In short, fighting badly increases the level of difficulty: a choice that encourages learning, preparation and a shrewd and defensive approach, but which will clearly annoy those who want to be able to attempt a fight without the fear of losing all their resources in a moment or even suffer a death. Game over, among other things, means returning to the last checkpoint, which must be activated manually in a few specific places. In case of death, you lose any kind of progress (items, levels, quests...) from the last checkpoint. The solution is to keep going back and forth to the checkpoints, which requires movement in the overmap (with the risk of enemy ambushes) and two loads (entering and exiting the dedicated area). Void of Undungeon Undungeon is an explicitly hardcore game and its goal in the design phase is to put the player in trouble, but in some cases it exaggerates, even at a statistical level, with enemies capable of eliminating us in one fell swoop (or destroying our organs and forcing us to further farming or restarting from the last checkpoint). Even in terms of controls and game actions, the clashes are uninteresting, very repetitive and require a slow approach, attracting one or a few enemies at a time, and chasing ranged opponents who run away with far too much precision. Activating an entire group of opponents may not mean immediate death (healing items are expensive but there is a way to get a lot of them) but it makes it really difficult to dodge all the hits and manage the groups effectively: as already mentioned, getting hit it makes enemies more powerful, so you are at serious risk of being overwhelmed in the end. Having a companion can help, but their death is permanent, so care must be taken when jumping into the fray in any case. It doesn't help at all that visually the gameplay risks becoming chaotic. First of all, any tall object that is in front of us or enemies will hide us, allowing only a silhouette to be seen, but completely hiding any props that can get in the way of our movements. Most importantly, however, is the fact that with more than one enemy, the clashes become a mix of explosions, flying projectiles, colored status effects, buffs, healing, dodging, attacks... You risk not understanding what's going on anymore. happening and losing sight of any visual cues that should help us understand how to attack, which are however lost in the chaos of effects. Furthermore, the few movement and attack animations make everything unclean. In essence, the game action is difficult to read and this weighs heavily on the enjoyment of the clashes. Good ideas An area dedicated to Undungeon checkpoints Undungeon has some good ideas though. For example, most healing items cannot be activated directly. The character will make them appear in front of him and we will have to attack them to break them and activate their effect. The opponents will do the same. This means that you can steal (or have yourself stolen) other people's healing items if you're quick enough. This is an interesting mechanic that pushes us to pay attention to those dying enemies who will try to heal themselves. The upgrade system is also refreshingly free. In addition to the organs already mentioned, we will have a nucleus that will determine which Nodes we will be able to equip, in terms of number and type. With these we will be able to improve our statistics, deciding what to bet on. Also, Nodes can be merged with each other and upgraded if they are of the same type. The overmap is also well handled. The dungeons that we are going to explore will be positioned within a circular map, in which we will unlock bandit camps, places full of resources, merchant areas, the very important checkpoints and fast travel points to return to the HUB, where they await us some characters and the main functions of the game. Exploring and expanding the overmap is simple but happens at a good pace. Finally, we point out that Undungeon is completely in English.", "date": "2021-11-24", "grade": "7.0"}
