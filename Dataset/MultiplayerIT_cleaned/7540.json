So here comes the Rabbids Big Bang here to try to fill this gap. Mission accomplished? The world goes around At first glance, Rabbids Big Bang may recall Angry Birds Space, not only for the sidereal setting but also and above all for a gameplay that actually does not meet the usual standards of originality normally respected by Ubisoft bunnies: removing the element from the equation of the structures to be destroyed, in fact, the playful foundations of the two titles are essentially the same, for the sake of those who were hoping for a nice injection of novelty for the mobile gaming market. The protagonists of the game are two Rabbids who are quietly standing on the surface of a very small version of the Earth, one armed with a club and the other equipped with a jetpack: the aim of the game is to hit the latter in the preferred direction to launch it into orbit, then controlling its motion by activating the propulsion of the rockets and always taking into account the effects of the planet's gravity. All this to satisfy the missions that represent the objective of each of the 150 levels included in the package, and which can vary from collecting a certain number of objects to performing a certain number of laps around the earth's axis, to covering a certain distance and etc. It therefore seems evident that, even if the aim is different, the means to achieve it are in fact the same as those of the Rovio product, albeit declined with the usual madness that accompanies every undertaking of the bunnies: the animations and the verses of the protagonists are therefore decidedly nice, as are the various costumes and gadgets that can be purchased in the game shop using the coins collected during the gameplay. Rabbids Big Bang does not meet the standards of originality and fun typical of Ubisoft bunnies Too bad that the contents offered under this pleasant blanket of humor are rather disappointing, starting with a playful mechanic (very badly illustrated by the few and limited tutorial screens) which above all initially may seem dictated by randomness rather than by the actual skill of the player. It therefore takes more patience than necessary to adequately manage the motion of the jetpack-equipped Rabbid, especially in missions that require leaving Earth orbit to collect objects in space or to reach the center of gravity of another planet. The comparison with the precision and almost scientific rigor of the Angry Birds Space launches is almost merciless, for a title in which success seems to depend almost exclusively on luck, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the experience. Even the level design lacks the typical inspiration of the best exponents of the Ubisoft brand, with stages that appear very repetitive in form and not sufficiently differentiated in substance, with objectives that tend to lose their edge already after the first game world. The meager contour elements created by Ubisoft are of little use: it is therefore possible to improve the bat and the jetpack supplied by the Rabbids to respectively increase the range of the shot and the duration of the propulsion of the rockets, with the upgrades that also modify the appearance same of the two tools: however, the game is so uninteresting that it is easy to predict an abandonment much earlier than reaching the maximum level of enhancement, not to mention the very minimal risk of making the in-app purchases necessary in any case. Finally, the technical realization of the title is also sufficient, with pleasant graphics and sound but which lack a lot of variety, maintaining in this sense a not very commendable consistency with the rest of the production.", "date": "2013-10-25", "grade": "5.5"}
