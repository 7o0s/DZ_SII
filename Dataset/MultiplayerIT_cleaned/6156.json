{"name": "Disney Dreamlight Valley", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disney-dreamlight-valley-recensione.html", "text": "Not even a month ago we tried Disney Dreamlight Valley on PC, and then tell you about our experience. It was a first immersion in a world completely based on contexts, characters and situations in Disney sauce and - it goes without saying - already perfectly promising if only for this reason. But now we're here: on September 6, 2022 Disney Dreamlight Valley can be purchased practically anywhere, from smartphones to PCs, on PlayStation 5 as on Nintendo Switch, naturally passing through the Microsoft consoles. The Disney Dreamlight Valley review does not aim to tell you everything what you can find in the latest Gameloft production and this not only because we are talking, per se, of a constantly evolving title, but also and above all because it is an early access video game. This means that yes, you can play it now without problems, but everything will be completed only in 2023. Let's find out, however, what Mickey, Merlin, Wreck-It-Ralph and the remaining members of the Disney gang have in store for all the newcomers for the moment. Living in Disneyland (almost) In Disney Dreamlight Valley there is Wall-E, and for us it already earns points Disney Dreamlight Valley is somewhere between the life simulator and the sandbox, genres held together by a satisfying and also quite long-lasting main adventure. The context wants to immediately immerse players in a sort of Disneyland-style fantasy world, where they can start a new life in the company of well-known (and even lesser-known) characters from the House of Mickey Mouse. This is the underlying philosophy, mind you: if you are not interested in the structural elements, then this is not the title for you. In Disney Dreamlight Valley you will live in a world where Mickey Mouse as well as Merlin, Remi from Ratatouille and Ursula from The Little Mermaid meet routinely and seamlessly, all in harmony and without (too many) major problems. In short, like living in Disneyland, or almost: even there the animators dress up as the famous characters of the various intellectual properties. So what does the main offer consist of, from the point of view strictly linked to the gameplay? In a daily routine (but time doesn't go hand in hand with that of the real world, as in Animal Crossing: New Horizons) which sees the player grappling with small daily problems: looking after his own garden, finding resources in the surrounding area, expanding and beautify the main abode. With all the possibilities of the case, ranging from the pickaxe to extract minerals to the fishing rod given to us by Pippo, from the crops that can be resold at the Scrooge shop to the main and secondary missions necessary to continue within the ~plot~. At the beginning, the Disney Dreamlight Valley village will be practically uninhabited, but gradually all the currently planned characters will return, a considerable number of which will probably also be added in the coming months, given that Gameloft has thought of the production as a long-term project. The progression There are so many objects in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and it will take time to unlock them all The progression of Disney Dreamlight Valley is based on the main missions assigned by Merlin (general guide of the Disney-themed magical world) and on the secondary ones of the other characters present; the first ones you will meet will be Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Scrooge McDuck; then other areas specifically dedicated to Pixar films will also arrive. However, every smallest action is never an end in itself or useless, because it is counted in the long-term objectives and, upon completion, they guarantee a certain number of magic points, the same ones that regulate the unlocking of new areas on the map principal. In short, the more actions you perform and the more characters you help, the faster we will be to unlock the other areas and the missing Disney heroes (or enemies). Apart from these small tasks, Disney Dreamlight Valley remains an experience that never really wants to impose anything on the player, leaving him free to find his own pace and live his own very personal adventures, calmly. Both the protagonist and the secondary characters can then level up, with considerable advantages. First of all in terms of collecting, because new levels also mean new items of clothing, furniture and goodies of various kinds. Even from a collecting standpoint alone, Disney Dreamlight Valley aims to keep you entertained for hours on end. Non-player characters, on the other hand, once leveled up, offer a series of bonuses, such as more resources for certain activities, more money in case of sale, and so on. Nothing really fundamental, mind you, don't get prepanic when you have to choose: this is not a production to live with performance anxiety, in fact, quite the opposite. Disney Dreamlight Valley is always evolving From a content point of view, the work done so far seemed truly remarkable to us, and if we think that we are still only in the early access phase, a year from now Disney Dreamlight Valley, between new worlds and identical characters, or simply with the adding new cosmetics, it could become something mammoth; moreover, not even from a technical point of view is there really anything to complain about: pass the unmemorable (but still suitable) soundtrack, the general glance and the level of detail on PC seemed remarkable to us, even on a ~simple portable~. In this regard, we must also specify that the publisher has also provided us with a code for the Ultimate Edition of Disney Dreamlight Valley, which includes a whole series of aesthetic bonuses (fifteen decorative objects, royal clothing items, and in addition also all the aesthetic elements of the standard and deluxe editions, already conspicuous for them), as well as 20,000 moonstones which - as in-game currency - in turn allow you to get your hands on a considerable number of useful objects. But even here: what is the point of rushing into an adventure entirely based on finding one's own rhythms?", "date": "2022-09-06", "grade": "8.0"}
