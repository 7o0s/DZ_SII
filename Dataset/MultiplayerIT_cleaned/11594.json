{"name": "Lost Planet: Extreme Condition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-planet-extreme-condition-recensione_a.html", "text": "When golf is not enough In a hypothetical future, humanity is forced to leave the Earth to emigrate to the planet E.D.N III, a world totally submerged by snow inhabited by a lethal and insect-like alien race: the Akrid. A far from peaceful cohabitation, which sees the two forces in the field battle to take possession of the most precious source: heat. The temperatures are in fact so low as to force the player to refresh himself continuously, thanks to the numerous thermal stations along the way. Taking on the role of Wayne, an army soldier who will witness his father's death at the hand (or rather, tentacle ...) of a huge alien, you will thus be called to free the planet from the Akrid, and to stop the evil intentions of Nevec, a society of scientists who created the Frontier Project: this plan provides for the destruction of all living forms on the planet. Humans included Space Harrier meets Transformers Lost Planet looks like an old-school shooter, even recalling a classic like Space Harrier: the exploratory component is in fact very marginal, and leaves the role of the absolute protagonist to the action. The real novelty is represented by the introduction of the Vital Suits, particular Mechs that will enhance our firepower, and will allow us to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. There will be various types of Vs, all of which can be customized to a limited extent: along the way you will in fact find many armaments, and it will be up to you to select the one that best suits your style. Another interesting feature is the presence of the heat indicator. This numerical value will ceaselessly decrease every second, forcing the player to shoot down as many enemies as possible: in fact, each alien has an intrinsic variable amount of heat, useful for maintaining vital energy. The bar thus takes on a dual value: temporal and energetic. Shoot, shootand shoot! The first impact is certainly breathtaking. The atmosphere that you breathe is of absolute desolation, also thanks to the well-chosen sound accompaniment: the choice to limit the background music only in certain circumstances helps the player to experience an adrenaline-pumping feeling of loneliness. Pad in hand, the feeling is immediate: once you become aware of the slowness of the protagonist's movements, the controls are in fact very precise and intuitive. The real Achilles heel of Lost Planet is in the firefights, an absolutely fundamental component for the genre: the behavior of the enemies, absolutely devoid of tactics, denotes a terribly deficient artificial intelligence, and takes away the bite from the gaming experience. The problem is further exacerbated by the questionable implementation of the checkpoints, very distant from each other, but which can also be activated without having to waste any bullets: in fact, it is not necessary to get rid of the monsters present in each area, but it is sufficient to run away to the area later with the possibility of even going unnoticed in the eyes of enemies. This does nothing but further facilitate the game, which is not particularly difficult in itself. The degree of challenge is given more by the quantity than by the quality of the enemies, resulting in a dangerous deterrent to longevity, settled around 7 hours of play. Shoot, shootand shoot! On the other hand, the clashes with the bosses at the end of the level are of a completely different tenor: the player's reflexes and cunning are finally put to the test, forcing him to intuit, and subsequently put into practice, the adequate killing tactic. Given the majesty, it is advisable to face these monsters aboard the VS, which with their devastating firepower, combined with the possibility of avoiding enemy offensives with a certain effectiveness, turn out to be the most fruitful way to emerge unscathed from the clash. However, it is not uncommon to witness the destruction of your beloved mech: in this case, you can still face the bosses on foot, equipping the weapons previously mounted on the robot. All, of course, at the expense of the agility of the protagonist. Fratricidal warfare for up to 16 players The online component of the title is quite developed, even if the absence of a cooperative mode is lamented, which would certainly have raised the fun factor. The four modes present are quite canonical, and range from single and team deathmatches, to the capture and maintenance of some locations on the map, up to the most original one, called ~The Fugitive~, which is essentially a one against all. While waiting for the game to reach the European shelves, we were able to test the online only on Japanese servers, recognizing a certain response delay in the commands. With the ccertainty that these problems will be solved once the local servers are also open, we note how the limits present in the single player are also felt on the net. The title suffers from a marked repetitiveness, and some features present only in multiplayer, such as the day / night cycle, some underwater areas and the randomness of climatic factors such as snowstorms, are not enough to consider the Lost Planet online fully satisfactory . Age makes itself felt Graphically speaking, the Playstation 3 version of Lost Planet is a faithful conversion of the game released 13 months ago on Xbox360, with all the merits and defects of the case: if in fact last year it was cataloged among the best NextGen games, nowadays the market offers technically much more advanced products. We certainly would have expected improvements, however one can only be amazed by the majesty of the alien creatures, as well as by the vastness of the field of the suggestive settings, whose only drawback is perhaps in the low level of characterization. However, the bare locations are the price to pay for having a frame-rate anchored, with very rare exceptions, to 30 fps. Comment Lost Planet is a blast from the past: such immediate playability, combined with the subdivision into stages, complete with end-of-level bosses, is a nostalgic return to a video game concept that has changed over the years. However, some fundamental defects, such as the deficient artificial intelligence, and the prevailing monotony, prevent the Capcom title from becoming an essential purchase.
