Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. It's been since the days of the Commodore 64 that the Ghostbusters have enjoyed videogame transpositions. After all, we are talking about a film from 1984, which five years later saw the release of a sequel and which should return in style with a third chapter next year, to the delight of nostalgics. We all know Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, Egon Spengler and Winston Zeddemore, they are characters who have now entered the collective imagination and their presence in a video game can only be appreciated. We therefore enthusiastically welcomed the release of Ghostbusters on the App Store, a curious mix between an RTS and a management system that sees us on the one hand organizing the team, equipment and all the rest, on the other answering calls from New York citizens who find themselves dealing with a ghost, by going there and ~catching~ the ectoplasm of the moment. The plot of the game supposedly takes place after the events of the first film, although some elements seen in the sequel appear (for example the ~gel~ with which the heroes manage to give life to the Statue of Liberty). The boy with curly hair who volunteers for Dr. Venkman's psychic experiments, the one seen during the first few minutes of the film, discovers that he possesses supernatural powers and wants to take revenge for the treatment he received. He is therefore summoned by a mysterious presence that is preparing to unleash hell right in the center of the city, infesting an entire building. Whether it's the terrible Gozer again? And who will you call? During the first few minutes there is a lot of meat on the fire from Ghostbusters, perhaps even too much and you can get confused for a moment. In fact, the management phase provides for the creation of studies for the acquisition of new equipment, the personalization of team members and a nice handbook with the characteristics of each captured ghost. The headquarters of the Ghostbusters is at our complete disposal, with the ever-present Janine answering the phone, and we can move from one floor to another of the facility by sliding our fingers across the screen of the device. Once the tasks that await us in this part of the experience have been completed, here comes the real action, in this case the missions in the city. By pressing the appropriate icon, you move to a map of New York and from there you can devote yourself to capturing ghosts, spending a certain amount of energy-points (it is still a freemium production, let's not forget it) but earning a sum of money in case everything goes as it should. At this juncture, the game becomes a sort of real-time strategy game: our team of Ghostbusters is in a scenario and has to contend with various ectoplasms arriving from the sides, trying to concentrate forces and minimize damage until each ghost it is not exhausted and can be locked in the ~trap~. Characters are controlled by ~dragging~ them, and in the same way a target is selected for their proton beams, a target that is then touched when it is time to launch the containment unit. The first missions are quite simple, but soon the degree of challenge increases and new types of opponents are introduced, which makes it interesting enough in the long run. Too bad that at some point the slimes required to access the new challenges of the main quest become too many. On the technical front, a good job has been done: the graphic style is not always exciting but it works, while the soundtrack refers to that of the film and therefore brings back many fun memories.", "date": "2013-02-09", "grade": "7.2"}
