In a video game market that makes violence and dark colors a leitmotif of most of the productions, the title conceived and directed by Greg Lobanov places itself exactly at the opposite end of the spectrum offering a colorful, kind, optimistic and positive adventure. All this despite the narrative premises are disheartening: the world is in fact destined to end. Not as an abstract concept of a distant future, but just in the short term, because the divinity Eya, creator of everything, has chosen to erase the universe to give life to a new one. When Wandersong's protagonist bard learns of the ominous prospect, he chooses to embark on a journey to try to stop the seemingly inexorable fate. Without particular weapons or powers, but only equipped with his own voice, or rather with his own song. Yes, because knowing how to generate harmonious sounds from one's uvula is practically the only thing the hero is able to do. But underestimating this ability would be a mistake: in fact, through singing the bard can interact with people and objects and solve all the environmental puzzles, riddles and even face the fights that will arise in front of him along the way. An adventure to sing All this basically happens through the right analog stick, the inclination of which brings up a sort of radial menu on the screen whose segments are associated with the various tones that can be produced. Moving the lever in one direction rather than another will therefore produce different sounds, possibly to be put in sequences such as to give life to pleasant songs. However, this is not mandatory, because Wandersong is anything but a punishing game: on the contrary, even in cases where it is required to perform pieces following precise notes one after the other, the game is satisfied with the minimum effort without forcing the precision of the rhythms game. In fact, although the musical theme is the fulcrum of the game, it would be incorrect to associate Wandersong with the just mentioned trend: in reality, in fact, we are faced with an adventure in which the dialogues dominate above all, which outline truly interesting and in-depth characters , far from trivial, far beyond what the graphic style can suggest. Obviously this aspect, linked to the availability of texts in English only, is destined to greatly reduce the appeal of the title to the Italian public, which is extremely sensitive to the topic of translations. For those wishing to proceed, it should however be clarified that Wandersong's writings never reach particular levels of complexity, which is why a moderate knowledge of English is sufficient to be able to understand the dialogues. But without any doubt, understanding the text is an essential element to face the game, which otherwise offers little at a purely playful level: the platform phases are extremely elementary just as the puzzles appear linear and not very stimulating. Even the management of the song is not flawless, because the poor precision of the Joy-Con stick often makes it difficult to be able to touch a ~clean~ note without slipping on the neighboring one. On the other hand, Lobanov's effort to offer as much variety as possible during the bard's adventure is evident, and in fact it is a continuous succession of different settings and situations through different emotions that manage to keep the player's interest and curiosity alive . And the originality of the graphic component certainly deserves applause which is based on the reproduction of paper and cardboard to give life to a world reminiscent of those already seen in Teraway or Paper Mario. The artistic direction falls fully within the category of personal tastes, but the writer has not found the design of the characters exceptional as well as that of the protagonist, far too stylized to actually be able to remain impressed. But this is far too subjective a criticism to be developed further, which is why we prefer to leave this evaluation to the players. Wandersong is evidently a product designed for an audience capable of appreciating its lightness and humour, as well as the nave atmosphere that distinguishes it from wherever you look at it. To understand its perspective, just think that there is also the possibility of dancing at any time by holding down a key. Even new dances can be unlocked and learned along the adventure, so as to enrich the bard's dancing talent. There is only one small detail: dancing has no real use within the game, if not simply to see the protagonist leap in a funny way while he is walking or even during a dialoguego. Isn't that wonderful?", "date": "2018-10-12", "grade": "8.0"}
