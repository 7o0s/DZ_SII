{"name": "Dragon Quest of the Stars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-quest-of-the-stars-la-recensione.html", "text": "After almost five years after its original release, we are finally grappling with the review of Dragon Quest of the Stars, brought by Square Enix abysmally late on western markets and when by now few still hoped for its arrival. We are therefore faced with a rather peculiar situation: the game is a classic turn-based mobile RPG with gacha elements, a structure that those who follow the panorama in question at a minimum by now will not only know very well but will probably also have enough, given that this type of game has saturated the smartphone market in recent years and we are now beginning to see its sunset. For this reason, the Square Enix operation seems to make little sense at this point, considering that Dragon Quest of the Stars offers absolutely nothing new and can only count on its high-sounding name to be able to emerge in an already overcrowded landscape. However, it is not a small starting point: not many games can boast a tradition like Dragon Quest and even a simple digression like this can still count on a characterization that alone is enough to attract a large number of players. Having analyzed a really large number of mobile RPGs in recent years, we can say that the characterizing elements of games that are substantially identical, in terms of mechanics, are limited to the construction of the world, to the artistic direction involving the characterization of the characters (indispensable when we have to do with the gacha) and in some cases to the combat system, which can actually present some interesting variations. As for Dragon Quest of the Stars, the reference world is certainly the most interesting element of the game: embarking on an adventure with the classic forgetful hero, found unconscious on a mysterious beach, is a nostalgic return to the origins of the JRPG, which are constantly recalled by the other typical elements of Dragon Quest, from the presence of slimes to the cardinal points on which the universe of the game is oriented. We are obviously far from the depth of a real chapter in the series, yet the typical magic of Dragon Quest pervades even this small digression in the mobile sphere and can push us to move forward on a path that, to tell the truth, we have already seen far too many times. Self-playing mobile RPG After a brief introduction with the possibility of creating your own protagonist through a simple but complete editor, the game starts with the classic introduction/tutorial that sees us set off from a mysterious beach towards a great adventure, assisted by a sort of talking squirrel who teaches everything we need to know to be successful as adventurers. New heroes without blemish and without memory, we must first of all find out who we are and then save the whole world from some disturbing threat, basically taking part in a long series of quests. The gameplay is even more automated than what we have seen in other similar games: in a sort of globe it is possible to select the goal to be achieved, equip the party and then assist in an almost totally passive way as the quest unfolds. There is no free exploration or direct control of the character, basically we are witnessing sorts of movies with the protagonist who moves around the map independently and collides with various enemies until he reaches the location of interest or some particular challenge. The quests are divided into travel missions in search of new settings or characters to interact with and real dungeons. In the latter case, we find ourselves facing a series of clashes in sequence up to a boss, but everything always develops automatically, except for a limited level of interaction during the clashes. Interesting solutions to vary the action a bit are the online multiplayer for up to four players (which however does not change the dynamics of the game) and the possibility of taking part in various jobs to obtain new experience and loot possibilities, but at the beyond inventory management and character equipment there really isn't much to actively do in the game. The turn-based combat system, in addition to the management of the characters, is the only element of the game that requires an active part on the part of the player, even if it is not absolutely essential. The clash takes place independently, but we can actively decide when to use special abilities or defensive positions, always keeping an eye on the cooldown times required to load the most powerful moves. It is obviously a very simple and basic systemhilarious, but against some bosses a minimal strategy is required to face the challenge, which usually relies on a balance of special skills and the use of chained attacks to be launched together with companions. The whole mechanism is based on the conquest of loot, which is bestowed through the typical gacha system, with a drop rate that seems quite generous. Although it is a free-to-play, therefore presumably designed to push us towards micro-transactions, already in the first hours of the game it is still possible to obtain good level weapons and armor in terms of rarity and power, therefore at least for a while ' it is possible to continue playing without spending, given that even the stamina system, which is consumed based on the quests to be carried out, is not very oppressive. Obviously, since there is also a VIP subscription with a monthly subscription, it is clear that the game is structured as a sort of pay-to-win, but in a non-competitive environment it is not something that emerges as a major limitation to fruition. Technically, the game reveals the years that have passed since its initial release, being surpassed by other similar titles that arrived later. However, the classic style of Dragon Quest compensates for the technological limitations with a characterization that is always fascinating, also focusing on the nostalgic recollection of the old chapters of the series.", "date": "2020-03-02", "grade": "6.5"}
