{"name": "Il paradiso perduto di Ever Oasis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/185308-ever-oasis-il-paradiso-perduto-di-ever-oasis.html", "text": "Founded in 2006, Grezzo is a Japanese developer who only recently came into the spotlight, when Nintendo entrusted him with one of its most important intellectual properties: The Legend of Zelda. It was Grezzo himself, in fact, who made the Nintendo 3DS remakes of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, but also the multiplayer entertainment Tri Force Heroes. The first, true proprietary title of Grezzo was instead the discreet The Legend of Legacy of 2015, which was directly followed by this Ever Oasis. The works were directed by the president and founder of Grezzo himself, Koichi Ishii, better known as the father of Seiken Densetsu, the brand which, despite the many versions and titles, has become the famous Secret of Mana. And the DNA of the beloved action RPG published by Square back in 1993 - and which will soon be re-proposed in the Super Nintendo Classic compilation - is also easily recognized in the veins of Ever Oasis: in the picturesque character design, in the real-time combat system, in the three interchangeable characters and in the environmental puzzles. However, defining Ever Oasis as a simple ~spiritual sequel~ to Secret of Mana would be an understatement: Grezzo's new game hides an unexpected mix of ideas that draws heavily from the history of the Nintendo 3DS and beyond. In search of the lost oasis Tethu is a little bulb who lives with his brother in a beautiful oasis in the desert. Bulbs like them allow oases to thrive, protecting them from the forces of Chaos along with the water spirits. One fine day, however, the forces of Chaos kidnap Tethu's brother and destroy the oasis, forcing our little hero to look for another spirit to build a new oasis that can offer refuge to wayfarers and desert dwellers who may know a way to stop the Chaos. In a nutshell, the story of Ever Oasis offers nothing that we haven't already seen in a thousand different variations: it is the story of the struggle between good and evil, and this does not mean that it cannot tell us something new, especially if it plays on the themes of racial integration (say, Tethu's default complexion is dark). The texts have been translated into excellent Italian but, being a bit childish, they tend to excessively lighten the already tenuous dialogues between Tethu and the bizarre characters who will visit his oasis. In a certain sense, that's also good, however, because Ever Oasis is not a JRPG with dark and epic implications: the story actually takes a compelling turn, but always remains confined within the framework of a colorful game, full of life and joy. At least until Chaos has a hand in it. The merit certainly goes to the lively soundtrack by Sebastian Schwartz but also to the carefree character design by Yoshinori Shizuma and Yuichiro Takao, who have managed to give a touch of personality to the bizarre races that populate the world of Vistrahda and to the supporting actors who will join the Tethu's cause: defeat Chaos... and build the most beautiful oasis in the world! In three you are in company Ever Oasis is in fact a strange mixture of ideas and concepts. Mainly it reminded us of Animal Crossing, in the sense that every day various characters will visit the Tethu oasis and our goal will be to satisfy their requests so as to convince them to set up shop, literally. Grezzo has expertly intertwined the various side-quests with the main missions in order to offer a constant flow of objectives that mesh organically with each gameplay mechanic. The strength of the oasis is based on the hydrogems, practically the money that circulates in those parts and which will allow us to buy objects or expand the oasis by opening new commercial activities. The wayfarers who decide to stop and live in our oasis will sell their goods to fat people and other passers-by, but we will have to supply them with the materials and resources collected during our outdoor excursions or perhaps grown in the garden behind the house. The more the oasis is upgraded, the more goods it sells and the more hydrogems it accumulates, in a circle of the economy which fortunately does not rely on a senseless ~farming~ of fruits or shells: to continue the adventure without ever getting stuck, just collect the materials that you come across by chance while exploring the world or tackling the various dungeons, even if the most precious objects - especially those that we will be able to manufacture at Tethu's house - certainly require a greater commitment. Most of the characters that we ~recruit~ can be added to our party and this is where the Secret of Mana DNA we mentioned above comes into play. As we said, Tethu will not only have to manage his oasis, but will also have to affront the Chaos and the wild beasts that roam the world. The combat system is simply based on four keys: the slow and powerful blow, the fast blow, the loading spell and the dodge. By leveling up or completing story missions you learn combinations of special attacks and spells, but in general we are faced with very simple encounters that require a little timing and a pinch of strategy, especially when facing bosses. Indeed, once the team is composed, we will be able to change the character we will control directly and take advantage of its characteristics: not only will some weapons be more or less effective against certain enemies, but most of Tethu's friends have very specific skills and knowledge that will allow to solve the many puzzles in the dungeons. The Evia bulb, for example, is a healer who deals more damage to insects with her weapon and who can dig into some terrain, collecting materials that would otherwise be closed to us. Similarly, some characters can lift boulders or other heavy objects that can become launch pads for yet other characters, capable of having certain flowers shoot them like cannonballs. In the labyrinths it therefore becomes essential to choose the right team to fight and to solve the environmental puzzles: the idea is excellent, and it reminded us of the LEGO video games by TT Games, but perhaps Grezzo should have implemented it in a slightly less cumbersome way seen that every time a new puzzle blocks our way we have to teleport to the oasis, change formation and go back to overcome the obstacle, perhaps doing this coming and going several times in order to get the perfect team right and find every collectible. After a few hours you get used to it, but sometimes the expedient in question slows down the pace of exploration excessively and in these cases you end up ignoring chests and mysterious doors to go straight to the boss on duty, sacrificing a the sense of adventure and the loot with which we could further customize bulbs and oases. +10", "date": "2017-06-28", "grade": "8.0"}
