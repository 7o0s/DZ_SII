{"name": "Verso l'infinito e oltre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142793-elite-dangerous-verso-linfinito-e-oltre.html", "text": "The first representative of the new wave of space simulators has finally reached the final stage of its development, although it cannot be said to be complete yet. First once, at the time of the Commodore 64, and first again, excluding some interesting albeit limited indie experiments, but with some cuts compared to the vision with which Braben, pioneer of space simulators, decided to promote the historic Elite brand. We are talking about the lack of story mode which made more than one nose turn up. But that's about it. The title Frontier Developmpents does not have a classic campaign with a hero for the protagonist. The players are all on the same level, at least at the start; beings who roam the universe to accumulate wealth, upgrade their ship, exterminate enemies and pursue Elite qualification to stand out from the crowd. The structure, in essence, is the classic one of the series, in this chapter enhanced by modern technical devices and enriched by the online component. But even this is far from complete. The update dedicated to the cooperative game, which is crucial for making sense of group activities, will arrive at the beginning of 2015 and this means that for now the Braben title, while boasting the fateful denomination 1.0, is not complete. Despite this, there are many irons in the fire and the first new generation space universe is already online. Elite: Dangerous, four hundred billion stars just a jump away And then we went out to see the stars again In the modern video game, exploration has taken an almost exclusively quantitative turn. Bigger maps, bigger and bigger. Three times larger than those in the previous chapter. Tens of times larger than that of the original released twenty years earlier. But, paradoxically, some magic has been lost between repeated and repeatable quests, recycled textures and so on. Elite also focuses on large spaces and repeatable activities but the dimensions we are talking about are such as to silence anyone. In a real-size universe there is the risk of getting lost in the void, it is useless to deny it. But in Braben's space there are a lot of elements that counterbalance this risk, as long as we are emotionally involved in what surrounds us. In this case the fascination of a space that extends almost to infinity bridges long distances by putting in our hands a spaceship to be piloted with precision, with a permissive but nonetheless simulative model, and not a character who stops, jumps and climbs almost without having to touch the controller. The lines that connect the dots, those four hundred billion systems that make up the endless game universe, trace a design that speaks of exploration, of that dream that almost all of us had of becoming astronauts before being firefighters, of the desire to see a black hole at the edge of the universe to give meaning to existence. Even alone, with the music blaring, in a small cockpit lost in the cosmic void. This was the old Elite and this is Elite: Dangerous, even if the news, first of all the online dimension, are certainly not irrelevant. All players are connected to the same universe whether playing solo, in groups or in online mode. This is a setting on which the cut of the offline component also depends, adopted to ensure that the actions of the players reflect on everyone's experience. When cargo is brought into a station, for example, a previously absent commodity becomes available at that location, and this may allow a player to accomplish a mission he thought would require more effort. Furthermore, the presence of the product alters the market prices and this influences the activities of the traders as well as the introduction into the market of new quantities of rare goods, found by discovering and exploiting asteroid belts in previously unexplored systems. And in these new systems we will see the emergence, over time, of space stations and outposts of factions determined to exploit the deposits as long as the universe allows them to do so. In this, the set of players whose actions have more than just weight in shaping the economy plays an important role. The strength of the factions also depends on the missions performed by the players. It is not possible to complete important missions if you do not have the trust of a faction, which takes some time, but this setting influences the game by causing players to contribute to galactic movements willy-nilly in order to access missions better paid. And here is that if a large number of pilots support a rebel faction this is destined to grow, expand and commission new missions to expand further. The ability to join othersplayers and shape the fate of the universe, complete with a galactic news bulletin to highlight the upheavals, is no small matter but the actual influence of the changes on the gaming experience remains to be seen. For example, a system that falls into the chaos of anarchy cannot control illegal activities, but soon a new faction could impose its own rules and the risk is that only the owner of the space stations will change, without an effective impact on the dynamics of the gameplay. We also don't have the certainty that the players organize themselves in groups to generate a sensible flow of events, a spark of meaning capable of arousing the reaction of other factions of players and creating conflicts of a certain depth. A few days ago, for example, Senator Patreus decided to support the rebellion in a system to destabilize its power. But the slaver missions are paid too well and the lack of contingents of players like the Patreus line has quickly extinguished the fire of the rebellion. The hope is that this not particularly epic epilogue depended on individual choices and not on general disinterest, but at the moment we cannot know. In any case, it is a dynamic that makes us feel in a living universe, even when we play surrounded by emanations of artificial intelligence. From the depths of the universe, alien races determined to battle have already emerged, dark threats that launch our imagination in pursuit of further possibilities, of speculations on what could happen if the potential of Elite: Dangerous managed to become explicit. Will the players be able to stand together? Will the houses put aside their machinations to face the threat? Will the emperor come out of his silence? Endless questions highlighting the potential of this kind of science fiction. The atmosphere you breathe is that of the fifteenth century between intrigues, mysteries, plots, rebels and new worlds to discover. This is Elite: Dangerous, made robust by a solid flight system and full of goodies that include silent flight, tight maneuvers, fines, undiscovered routes, autocannons, missiles, countermeasures and everything you expect from a flight simulation modern, Newtonian physics included. Mass, energy systems, and efficiency also matter in ship customization, so much so that an expensive upgrade isn't necessarily better as long as its cost doesn't also depend on the fact that engineers have worked to reduce its weight. In all of this it is natural to try to work hard on the commands. Sidereal distances make us feel like real pilots determined to calibrate speed in the best possible way to arrive at a space station with class and perform a perfect docking maneuver. There is the automatic landing system but it is not satisfying and takes up a usable ship slot for more useful purposes such as combat, which is an important component of the experience and also requires a pinch of readiness due to the possibility, far from it how rare, of surprise attacks. The ability, in essence, has its weight even if Elite: Dangerous is not a punishing title and often, once you have a decent ship, you can easily escape from any one-on-one combat. In fact, the ships can withstand several blows in battles that are more reminiscent of Star Trek than Star Wars. Slow maneuvers, management of the ship's energy resources and inertial flight complex but not too much. The skill is important in linking all these possibilities managing to get in line with the enemy. But Elite is not a title that focuses on lightning reflex except perhaps for countermeasures. Combat often allows us to threaten the opponent via radio, to flee, to target specific subsystems of a ship to put it in trouble. Also for this reason, given the possibility of always keeping one hand on the fundamental keyboard, playing with the mouse is possible but this does not mean that it is comfortable. Eliminating the self-centering of the cursor means having to constantly correct the course. Enabling it, however, forces us to row like crazy in the middle of the fights. Fortunately, in the controls menu we find innumerable options that allow us to limit these two phenomena even if the only way to eliminate them is to use the yoke which, among other things, guarantees a much higher precision during the delicate inertial maneuvers. Better suns than planets Elite: Dangerous spares no content for lone wolves. The player has the universe at his disposal to be able to rise through the ranks of a faction and distinguish himself as a trader, explorer or as a fighter. Braben's universe includes pirate smuggling stationsand the ability to fly engines off to get past security forces undetected. The bounty hunter can install a device to tell if the ship she is scanning is wanted in another system. The explorer can optimize the distance of the hyperspace jump to increase the available routes and can sell the data acquired on new stars in systems that are twenty light years away from its discovery. In essence, there are so many possibilities and they mix with the unexpected, dragging us into a real adventure, one that is experienced only a few times in a lifetime. Playing Elite: Dangerous means appearing distracted in front of a blue dwarf, getting too close to optimize the approach maneuver to a target and feeling the soul slipping out of the body as our ship is sucked towards a radioactive hell. Elite: Dangerous is about escaping that hell by the skin of your teeth as the spaceship throws sparks everywhere, finally arriving in the safe underbelly of a space station. Elite: Dangerous is believing you've made it and suddenly realizing you're in a port controlled by the faction you just pissed off to help the rebels. Elite: Dangerous is being ruthlessly riddled, perhaps for an unpaid fine, far from home, with a load of medicine destined for a distant outpost. Elite is seeking refuge in a system, running out of fuel and finding it anarchy, lawless, while spaceships of all shapes and colors go to hell with each other. Sometimes clashes start by mistake, one shot too many; it is the frontier, the new far west. In these cases, whoever shoots first shoots twice. The online mode allows us to meet all the players but it is a virtual possibility and far from guaranteed. There is no universal shared space. There are instances that include up to 32 players which you don't hit without fail like in an MMO. They are bubbles, whose center is the player's ship, which you come across or try to reach perhaps because called by a clanmate. The gain in technical terms is evident. A small number of clients reduces the possibility that latency or connectivity problems affect combat largely based on aim and skills. But it is still not possible to defer to the reverse side of the coin. Realistic distances don't make it easy to reach a mate quickly, and if there's a scheduling error or lack of slots in the instance, as well as a netcode glitch, you risk traveling for several minutes to find yourself cut off from the action. In essence, receiving reinforcements could be complicated, with the risk of one of those dynamics that one would expect to find in an online space simulator being castrated. But the dimensions and realistic displacements are a key element of Braben's title and the guys from Frontier Developments are working to expand the instances and improve the code, although a galaxy full of players is out of the question. In the Elite: Dangerous universe, it's hard to bump into other players, let alone fights that are specks in an infinite space. But that's how this title is conceived, which exploits the universe to allow players to disappear with a stolen shipment, to explore fearlessly like new Magellans, to collect fines and bounties without being caught, to give everything to follow the traces of a prey and always have, or at least for the next 70 years, a new planet to discover. We are talking about a title that does not want to be the classic MMO with crowded squares and rows of players parked in front of instances that can be reached instantly. It wants to be a title in which running into a capital ship is an event. A universe that travels calmly, following the breath of things, out of breath. Elite: Dangerous can be enjoyed as a relaxing experience to discover stars of all shapes and colors. With the ears stimulated by flutes and mature science fiction sounds that blend with bases that are perhaps not particularly inspired but effective and capable of immersing us in the magic of the universe. And it is possible to further enhance the experience by drawing from ambient music with sci-fi tones, choosing the song based on the activities we carry out. But even classical music, the soft and known to all, marries incredibly with the timing of a cosmic journey in a video game that is no longer in fashion. And precisely for this reason it has its audience, perhaps vintage, in an increasingly populated planet Earth whose niches are now made up of hundreds of thousands of human beings. The hope is that these stick to the title and consent", "date": "2014-12-29", "grade": "8.5"}
