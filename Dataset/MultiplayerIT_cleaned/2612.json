{"name": "Le Follie dell'Imperatore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/le-follie-dellimperatore.html", "text": "Once upon a time... The new Disney-branded adventure tells the story of the arrogant and young emperor Kuzco, transformed into a llama by a magic potion prepared for him by the wicked witch Yzma, his advisor. In the role of the friendly quadruped, the former emperor finds himself in the heart of the jungle with the only company of a kind-hearted farmer named Pacha. In order to regain the throne, the unlikely duo will have to contend with a series of obstacles of various kinds and will often find themselves in comical and hilarious situations. The thousand vicissitudes faced together will give birth to a strong friendship between Kuzco and Pacha, and will teach the inexperienced emperor to look at the world from a new point of view. It will therefore be up to us to help him find his way home and the way to reassume his original human form. Keep within reach of children Essentially this LFDI is a classic 3D platform (a bit like Spyro in short), in which we will have to go through six different levels: the village of Pacha, the jungle, the cliff, the city, to get to the evil Yzma's laboratory and then to the royal palace. The repertoire of movements available to Kuzco includes the traditional ones of games of this kind, namely jumps, charges and kicks, and also the more original ~spits~, characteristic of the llamas. Thanks to this type of attack we will be able to face all the most disparate enemies who will block our way during the journey. Rats, bats, spiders, snakes and piranhas will in fact be present in large numbers along our path, not to mention the royal soldiers, once committed to defending the emperor and now under the orders of Yzma. Based on a now seen and overwhelmed game structure, made up of coins to collect, keys to find, bad guys to eliminate and small headaches to solve, however, original sub-games are well inserted that make this gaming experience very fluid and linear. We will thus be involved in speed races, survival against herds of crocodiles, in fights against the eddies of a river current, and in hilarious Metal Gear-style missions in which we will have to prove our dexterity in not being discovered by some guards . All this interspersed with sequences taken directly from the cartoon, and which introduce us to what awaits us from time to time, thus giving us the feeling that we are really carrying the story forward. However, it should be emphasized that, in analyzing the playability of this title, it must be kept in mind that we are always dealing with a platform exclusively designed and produced for children under the age of 14. Once this point is made clear, the medium-low difficulty that characterizes it certainly cannot be criticized, but rather at least praised for its good calibration in advancing from level to level. A cartoon on PlayStation Technically the Argonauts have forged without a shadow of a doubt a truly appreciable work. In fact, it is a pleasure to look at the excellent realization of the animations of our little llama and in general of all the characters present. They move between sufficiently large worlds, which if explored thoroughly will reveal various secret passages, the discovery of which will quickly fill our pockets with points and extra lives. The management of the camera that follows our actions may seem quite problematic at first, but it won't take long to ignore it, also thanks to the help of the back buttons. Another slight defect that undermines the quality of the graphics is the presence, however not very annoying, of the frequent pop-up that characterizes the entirely polygonal backgrounds of the landscapes. A note of merit goes instead to the cartoon sequences that are skilfully reproduced on the Playstation as if we were in front of the big screen. They are in fact excellently dubbed in Italian, as are the other dialogues and the various zoological verses of various kinds that delight our ears for the duration of the game. The sound is therefore also well done, thanks also to the amusing music, perhaps a little repetitive, but certainly up to the rest of the game. How nice to be a kid nowadays So what about this new Disney creation? Bearing in mind that the target that it wanted to take into consideration is the one in full pre-adolescent age, it must be admitted that it is perhaps the one among the last that came out best. A good technical realization has in fact been accompanied here by an excellent gameplay, which involves the player in the numerous moments of humor and irony that pervade the plot of this video game from start to finish. Therefore, the purchase is highly recommended, provided that you do not know what to give to your younger brother for his birthday. Another cartoon, another video game There is never a time that Walt Disney releases a new cartoon in cinemas without also reproposing a conversion in the form of a video game for every type of console or computer existing on the face of the earth. In this period then, it seems that the creativity of their developers is going through a moment of intense inspiration. And recent releases such as ~Donald Duck: Operation Duck~, ~Dinosaurs~, or ~102 Dalmatians~, fully demonstrate this. Last in order of time is this ~Le follie dell'Imperatore~ (The Emperor's new groove~ in the original title), arriving these days in all Italian cinemas and therefore also on our beloved Playstations.", "date": "2001-04-06", "grade": null}
