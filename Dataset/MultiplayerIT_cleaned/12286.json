{"name": "Big Range Hunting", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/big-range-hunting.html", "text": "Big Range Hunting therefore has hunting as its theme; sport, passion or gratuitous cruelty, we prefer not to dwell on moral issues, limiting ourselves to describing the game itself. Gameloft's production structure is quite simple; one's alter-ego, the hunter, is framed from behind, in the lower left part of the screen. The only movement that is allowed is to get up or down by pressing the ~0~ key, in order to hide from the sight of the preys and thus prevent them from escaping. The player's task is therefore basically only to manage the viewfinder of the weapon, and of course to fire. First of all it is necessary to track down the unfortunate beasts within the simple two-dimensional map, to navigate in search of green dots representing the prey. We then move on to the real hunt: the 8 animals present, lions, deer, ducks, bears and so on, are caught in their habitat while they behave in a fairly credible even if not very varied way. In most cases they just move at a slow pace, but I can also stop to eat, fight with each other or -obviously- run away from the sight of man. Based on the requirements of the individual missions, it will therefore be necessary to complete a task, which in most cases consists of killing a certain number of prey within a time limit. To be able to do this, Big Range Hunting offers 4 types of weapons, including a crossbow, shotguns and sniper rifles. The animals also have ~sensitive~ areas, usually the heart and head, which allow more precise players to kill them with a single shot; however, hitting other areas will require some more ammunition, seeing in the meantime the poor deer or someone else proceeding limping and wounded. Despite some small variations on the theme, such as hunting on a moving van, the gist of the game is basically this; the 3 available maps, Europe, Africa and Canada, obviously bring with them different animals and environments, while not substantially changing the gameplay by one iota. The plot is obviously non-existent, and the only minimally narrative component is provided by a kind of instructor, obviously scantily dressed, who from time to time provides the protagonist with the objectives. Too bad that in some cases these are very little edifying; in one of the last missions for example, the beautiful ditzy will impose to kill 3 white bears in order to obtain a necklace with their teeth, to wear for one's pleasure. The graphics are quite good, rather detailed and with decent animations, even if some animals end up looking a bit too much alike; the evaluation on the sound is negative, excessively limited and sunk by some bugs that lead it to disappear completely during the game sessions. PRO Graphically discreet Quite original Moderately funny AGAINST Very repetitive Far too short Bad sound", "date": "2007-05-14", "grade": "S.V."}
