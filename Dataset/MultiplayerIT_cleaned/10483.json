Fortunately, this is not the case with Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. Did you expect a great title, extraordinary from a technical point of view but also enjoyable and fun? Well, Naughty Dog, the game developer, has packaged just this type of product, and it's time to put on paper (or on the web in this case) all the elements that make this new Nathan Drake adventure a memorable event for everyone PlayStation 3 owners. Although part of a trilogy, Uncharted 2 offers a story that begins and ends in a self-contained way, obviously with references and appearances of characters already seen in the first chapter. We have old Sullivan, Elena and a certain Chloe, who will be the protagonist on several occasions in a rather interesting and amusing menage a trois (in the broadest sense, dirty guys) with Nathan Drake. The story, at least initially, revolves around Marco Polo's fleet lost during his travels, and then broadens the context. We'll stop here, but already starting from the early stages we can see how in just two years Naughty Dog has managed to improve the narrative a lot, in substance and in how it is proposed to the player, much more integrated into the context and credible, albeit fictional until it runs out. The ninety minutes of interlude sequences are well distributed and seasoned with action, humor and excellent direction, sometimes spectacular. The beauty is that even the gameplay thrives on this spot-on implementation, made up of breathtaking shots, short ~pre-calculated~ moments that aim to keep the pace always high and the development compelling and engaging. The Extras Uncharted 2: Among Thieves offers many extras for the player, both in single player and in multiplayer. The key to everything is the shop dedicated to both components, where it is possible to spend the money accumulated by completing the adventure and unlocking the various medals within the game. It starts from sketches of the characters, passing through the videos of the development, the possibility of seeing all the interlude sequences in the appropriate gallery, player skins and new characters for multiplayer, infinite ammunition, one-hit kills, filters to apply such as the game world upside down, faster speed or black and white. Furthermore, completing the game with the difficulty level equal to difficult unlocks the Destructive mode, the most difficult one, and probably to collect all 100 treasures scattered throughout the various settings it will be necessary to complete the game at least a couple of times. My eyes sparkle Let's start right from the technical sector, which in Uncharted 2 is truly extraordinary. Beyond the pure aspect of the programming, it is the whole that leaves you speechless, assisted by an excellent artistic sector and by a truly perfect mix of general elements, including the soundtrack that dynamically accompanies the action and the dubbing, completely in Italian. The quality of the textures is for the most part very high (even if there is some inevitable drop here), but above all the variety and quantity are incredible, the use of colors and the aforementioned artistic side. The polygonal detail makes the whole game environment solid and rocky, the use of light sources and reflections raises the enjoyment bar even higher, relegating the worst, albeit valid, parts to indoor scenes where programmers they could have had less fun with lights and effects. The camera does its job very well, the animations are always convincing and the presence of various highly spectacular scenes helps to always maintain an exceptional impact, bearing in mind that the graphics engine is anchored to 30 frames per second 99% of the time, despite there is such good things on screen. What about the settings then? We go from Istanbul to Borneo, passing through Tibet and the Himalayas, between snow and rain, night and day, water and storm, running trains or chased by helicopters, in Uncharted 2 there is also a clearly above-average variety in this sense . If in Killzone 2, for example, some subterfuges adopted by the developers to give an exceptional graphic impact were clear, the Naughty Dog title does it without any apparent compromise except that of medium-low general interactivity; the whole is beautiful, varied, sometimes devastating, so much so that we can state without too many hesitations that currently there is nothing better on consoles in this sense. Playstation 3 trophies Uncharted 2: Covo dei Ladri offers 48 trophies (the same number as in the first chapter), of which 8 are silver and 3 are gold, as well as the inevitable platinum. Only two, bronze, are aimed at multiplayer and are quite easy to achieve, since it is enough to complete a game in cooperative mode and one in competitive mode. The rest are related to completing the game, finding treasures, using all the weapons present, killing by headshot, hanging, running and in close combat, with some variations on the theme. Cover, shoot, kill! However, if Uncharted 2 was only a beautiful soulless woman, it would not deserve the vote that you can see next to the comment. The gameplay has the same roots as the previous chapter, but refines some aspects such as hand-to-hand combat, grenade throwing and above all in the platform phase, where the movements that can be done with Nathan Drake are now even more fluid and natural. Thanks also to the experience gained with the first chapter, Uncharted 2 has a practically perfect control system and a camera that does its duty very well. To this you can add the excellent level design and the complete absence of backtracking (i.e. the ~practice~ of retracing the same sections of a level more than once), which make you enjoy new situations and settings until the game is completed . With the X you jump, with the square you perform melee moves, with the circle you roll or push objects, with the triangle you activate doors and gears, with the upper backbones L1 and R1 you aim and shoot, with R2 you reload the weapon and with L2 the grenades are thrown. The management of the camera is delegated to the right analog button, while with the digital cross the two weapons that Drake is able to carry at the same time are chosen, between those with one and two hands. Uncharted 2 remains a linear third-person adventure where the action component is still dominant, but in this second chapter the title offers the player different ways to tackle the sections, which also include a stealth component. In reality, the first part of the game, the one set in Istanbul, practically only provides for this option, and then subsequently proposes both solutions: you can get the better of your enemies without making too much noise, or engage in a real firefight with dozens of opponents, taking advantage of high floors, cover and the arsenal at your disposal. In the same way, some parts of the game must necessarily be dealt with by eliminating all the enemies in the old way, but the effort made by the developers in this sense is felt to be better. Also because the platform part is very present in the game, where there are moments in which you have to do your best in climbs that have breathtaking landscapes as a backdrop or giant large rooms that also represent puzzles that must be completed thanks to Drake's athletic skills and by consulting the his diary. It was the puzzles that seemed more ~airy~ and interesting to us, in this case in fact you have to browse more than one page of the diary to understand their resolution, and they are usually divided into two-three steps that require a good platform phase before their completion. And again, always on the altar of a varied, spectacular and integrated gameplay in the various phases, in different points of the adventure you find yourself shooting but also using Drake's acrobatic skills, clinging from one ledge to another and in the meantime killing enemies or running away from the most dangerous ones, as in the case of the long sections where you are dealing with helicopters, running trains and more that we avoid writing about so as not to spoil the surprise. All that glitters now? Well yes, however, we feel we can make some complaints in terms of the Artificial Intelligence of the enemies, valid for good stretches but practically unchanged from the first chapter. In the offensive phase, our antagonists are very difficult because they attack from various sides, they throw bombs to blow up our cover, they move in groups on both fronts. In the defensive one, however, they don't pay much attention to cover themselves and are often easy prey if you are good shooters. In the stealth phases then, their field of vision is often too small, and therefore sometimes you run into kills that have very little credibility of stealth. In the light of these factors, and perhaps if you have played the first chapter, we recommend tackling Uncharted 2 on a higher difficulty level right away, where these small flaws are mitigated but where, on the other hand, the number of enemies is greater, according to the classic scheme, a bit antiquated to tell the truth but difficult to resolve, of the appearance of the same in sequence according to a fixed number and from nothing. On the other hand, we were very satisfied with Nathan Drake's supporting actors. In fact, for most of the time the main protagonist is in the company of another character, who covers us, attacks and goes his own way, with dialogues, often seasoned with humor, which make the interaction seem more lively and less fictitious. For example, try jumping into the pool when you're in the company of Chloe, and let us know. Curiosity Duration of the game The Den of Thieves lasts between 11 and 13 hours on Normal difficulty level and depending on your skills, duration which can increase if played directly on Difficult.Settings and Chapters The game chapters are 26, with settings such as Istanbul, Nepal, Tibet, Himalaya, Borneo and another that we won't tell you. Duration of the cut-scenes Interlude sequences are exactly 90 minutes long, the longest about 7 minutes, most 3 minutes on average.Graphic Engine The game uses the Naughty Dog Game Engine 2.0, an enhanced version of the one seen in the first chapter, while the physics is entrusted to the tested Havok engine. Multiplayer Maps The Multiplayer maps are 7 for the competitive part, 3 for the cooperative, 4 for the Survival mode and 8 for the Machinima. Multiplayer mode Competitive part: Deatmatch, Team Deatmatch, Plunder, Field War, King of the Hill, Chain Reaction. Co-op part: Survival, Gold Rush, Co-op Mission. Extras: Cinemas, Michinima Do you prefer competitive or cooperative? Completely absent in the first chapter, the multiplayer of Uncharted 2: The Den of Thieves is a pleasant surprise within the context of the game. After several weeks spent on the closed number beta and then on the final version, we can say that the gameplay of the title, in multiplayer, works very well. The development takes the salient features of the single player, such as coverage, platforming elements and shootings everywhere, and places them in a dynamic and not too frenetic context, where teamwork is often vital and the variety of situations and options from how result ample enjoyment and unexpected longevity to this component. The title to take as a starting point, just to understand the rhythm, is Gears of War 2, but Uncharted 2 has its own personality, also for how it presents some classic modes for the genre. The platform part allows you to make the action more varied, with ditches, the possibility of reaching high points or perhaps escaping in an unconventional way, as well as getting around the opponent with more options available. All of this is supported by a system of levels (60) which allows you to increase the characteristics of the character, equipping him with two upgrades to choose from among those that are gradually purchased/unlocked by going up in rank, such as more ammunition, less time recharge and so on. There are 7 maps available and they feature extracts from single player settings, the maximum number of players is 10, a number chosen by Naughty Dog to give the right balance, but probably also for technical reasons. As for the competitive part we have single and team Deathmatch, with the possibility of operating on parameters such as friendly fire, duration and score to be achieved, then we have King of the Hill, Field War (the Capture and Hold, with some variants like the arrival of helicopters that shoot indiscriminately on everyone), Chain Reaction, where you have to conquer some areas in sequence, and Looting. The latter, in which you have to steal the treasure and bring it to your starting point, has some variations on the classic Capture The Flag. First of all, something really not new and already seen in other (few) titles, when you are in possession of the treasure it is only possible to use one-handed weapons and, by jumping, the treasure itself rolls on the playing field. Therefore, on the occasion of ditches or other points that require to be climbed, the help of a teammate is necessary, hence a further strategic element. But that's not all, in Uncharted 2: Il Covo dei Ladri there is also a cooperative part, unfortunately not linked to the main story, but in the form of 3 different missions for up to 3 people, in rather extensive maps and always taken from the settings of the main campaign. Also thanks to the two difficulty levels present, the challenge level is quite high, however we would have preferred a greater number of missions, which presumably will come in the form of an additional download. To close the account for the cooperative part we also have Survival, where on four different maps you have to resist waves of enemies, and Gold Rush, where you have to", "date": "2009-10-07", "grade": "9.6"}
