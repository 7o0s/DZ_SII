{"name": "Real Football: Manager Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-football-manager-edition.html", "text": "Sports management is a relatively new genre, which expands on some of the elements already present in classic sports simulations. If in any football game we can decide how to deploy the team on the field, therefore modifying its formation and deciding which players to employ in the various roles, in a managerial game we must also pay attention to practical aspects such as the objectives to be achieved at the end of the season, the of prestige (which is reflected in team morale), the consideration by our president and the economic aspect. Real Football: Manager Edition boasts some two hundred teams from eight leagues, updated to the 2007/2008 season. Once a new game has started, we have to select one of the available teams paying attention to what its objectives are: in the case of a prestigious team, it is clear that we will have to aim for victory in the championship and in the Champions League, while if we belong to a lower category we will have to fight for promotion. A calendar punctuates the days as we move from pre-season friendlies to competitive matches, and we will have full freedom to field the team as we like, taking into consideration the conditions of the players lined up and perhaps spotting some talent from another club to try to buy it in the periods set up for that type of transaction. Once all the parameters have been adjusted, we can move on to the real game, which translates into a simulation where the players are represented by dots moving on the field, and which can be speeded up up to eight times so that the outcome is immediately clear . When things go badly, it is clear that you can intervene in real time with substitutions or changing the strategy. The procedure is repeated for each match, there are occasional events (injuries above all) that need to be remedied quickly, but in general we proceed until the end of the season if the team has good behavior and then we sum up, otherwise we can be sacked prematurely... The technical realization of this new Gameloft title shows off some excellent achievements in bitmap graphics, in this case the cross-section of the city in which we move to access the various phases of the game. The rest is purely functional (mainly texts), while the simulation of the games is unfortunately really essential and we tend to set the progress at maximum speed. The same goes for the sound, consisting of a musical theme and a few effects. Finally, the control system is the classic one of this type of product and responds quickly to inputs.
