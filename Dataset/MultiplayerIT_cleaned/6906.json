{"name": "Cubemen 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/137465-cubemen-2-cubi-in-guerra.html", "text": "This must have been thought by the Australians 3 Sprockets when, just over a couple of years ago, they launched the first Cubemen for PC and iOS systems, a fairly canonical tower defense that, albeit with some original ideas, tried to stand out in the broad scene of the genre on those platforms above all by virtue of an extremely ~cubed~ graphic characterization, so to speak, where the geometric solids of the title went to constitute the elements not only of the scenario, but also of the soldiers who fought in it, clearly inspired by the great success of Minecraft. Over time, a large and solid community has come to be built around Cubemen, so much so as to justify the birth of a second episode with all its load of novelties. Second episode which, present since spring 2013 on the usual PCs and Apple devices, now arrives with great fanfare also on Wii U, as an exclusive eShop. The most cube-like tower defense ever lands on Wii U: ready for glory? Defend your tower Like its prequel, Cubemen 2 does not distance itself in any way from the basic concepts of the genre to which it belongs, declined several thousand times since its birth, as a ~simplistic~ derivative of the RTS, more or less in the middle of the last decade. You have to defend your headquarters, which in this as in many other cases is just a tower, from the assault of various waves of enemies coming from the opposing headquarters, making use of the different military units available: from the simple soldier with average characteristics to the one that he prefers heavy weapons, devastating but which require a long reload time between shots, from the sniper who strikes from a distance to the soldier armed with a flamethrower who is instead very effective up close, up to special units such as engineers who place mines or build walls to slow down the enemy advance. The creation of a unit has a cost in, needless to say, Cubes, practically the monetary unit of the game which is recoverable every time an opponent is eliminated, just as it costs a certain number of Cubes to upgrade a single soldier , new from the past, can be performed twice. This lack of imagination (which, as we will soon see, is remedied with new methods) is not so much the major defect of the basic concept of Cubemen 2, as the fact that, in spite of the considerable tactical variety that an even worn game system however, the game allows you to face the thirty levels of the two campaigns plus the different ~single~ levels created by the development team, to always adopt the same approach; this mainly by virtue of two issues. The first concerns the balancing of the units: there is one, let's talk about the ~sniper~, which seems considerably more effective than the others as it can cover a very high part of the level. In many cases, at least in all the stages in which the sniper is available (not all types of soldiers are in fact always accessible), it is therefore enough to take advantage of the Cubes that are available from the beginning to create as many snipers as possible and then place them in the most strategic points to quickly get the better of the CPU. Even more so when the Cubes that are obtained by playing are used to enhance the snipers already created rather than to build different units that would give greater variety; in fact, the other big balancing problem, which actually does not only concern the sniper, is that the cost of leveling up is much lower than that required for the creation of a new unit, and the benefits brought by the upgrade always make it preferable. You will understand that once these two concepts have been grasped, the interest in the well-made campaigns and single levels in normal mode tends to decrease, despite the fact that the difficulty curve is, unlike the first episode, well calibrated. Not bad though, because in spite of a not excellent declination of the fundamentals of the genre, Cubemen 2 adds a little meat to the fire which also manages to differentiate it in some way from the competition. My tower is different The first alternative mode that catches the eye is the creation and sharing of levels. The editor, given the peculiar ~cubed~ structure of the stages, is very simple and intuitive, so much so that you won't miss a tutorial, and the levels created by users, thanks to the online structure that allows the Wii U game to communicate with the PC and iOS versions are many and some are truly impressive, for example real reproductions of maps of historical games such as Halo or The Legend of Zelda. Also linked to the online infrastructure are the alternative modes that complete the multiplayer for up to six players: Skirmish, Capture The Flag and King Of The Hill are quite simple.similar to each other, and require you to conquer enemy bases as well as defend your own, Rescue (also playable in single player) inserts in the context of defenseless units to be escorted to a safe point on the map, Defector eliminates the ~currency~ and therefore makes the no longer virtually unlimited units, and finally Territory, which seemed to us the most interesting, in which each square where a unit passes is colored in the color of that unit's faction, and at the end of the given time it is calculated how much of the level belongs to this or that player. They are all modes in which, unlike in the base game, a certain importance is given to the movement of the units, thus eliminating, or at least severely limiting, those problems of balancing and lack of tactical variety which we were talking about in the previous paragraph . They are also very fun modes: imagine how frenetic a skirmish can be with six players involved, in a game that, like all tower defense, does not allow time to be stopped to calmly plan one's moves. Theoretically these alternative multiplayer modes would be the flagship of Cubemen 2, were it not that, during the test days, we struggled a lot to play an online game properly, sometimes waiting even more than an hour; it doesn't seem to us that the online infrastructure works less than well, simply, although as we said there is cross-play between Wii U, PC and iPad, very few players are often present. It's a real pity because in this way the game cannot express its strengths to the maximum, and in fact the programmers cannot do much about this: perhaps it depends on the fact that the PC and iOS versions already have more than a year on their backs, and we must hope for the rapid construction of a solid community on Wii U. But the effort made by the team can be seen, as it is visible in the aesthetic department: the simple cube structure of stages and characters allows customization thanks to numerous skins different, here free instead of linked to the usual in-app purchases. Do you want cowboys to challenge each other in scenarios inspired by China? You can have them. Medieval knights (armed with bazookas and flamethrowers) fighting each other in Minecraft-like stages? Serve yourself soon. Or futuristic robots in elegant and bare stages a-la Tron? This is also possible, in the context of an effective graphic (and sound) sector but which does not make one cry out for a miracle, as it should be, for complexity and detail. Not that, even if it were the most visually beautiful game in history, it could be appreciated that much, given that given its nature and the necessarily touch screen controls (can you imagine managing a game that does not allow breaks with the classic buttons? ) playing on the GamePad is imperative, with TV viewing reduced to mere tinsel. Another series of problems here, at least in the first approaches: the all in all small screen of the Nintendo pad forces you to often resort to the fully customizable camera, giving the player an extra task. Nothing that can't be handled with ease with a little getting used to, but it's certainly not the height of immediacy.", "date": "2014-09-18", "grade": "6.8"}
