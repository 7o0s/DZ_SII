{"name": "Toki Tori - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toki-tori-recensione.html", "text": "The WiiWare library already has many titles and many different genres: most users will be tempted by games with a strong appeal such as Final Fantasy or Dr. Mario, but there are others with less high-sounding names such as Toki Tori, originally released on Game Boy Color in 1991 and today revived in splendid form on the new Nintendo digital distribution channel. Toki Tori is a very original and challenging puzzle-game that perhaps hasn't had the success it deserved in the past. Mainly inspired by Lemmings, of which it seems to be a sort of reinterpretation, it then found a natural evolution in products such as Mario vs. Donkey Kong. It is therefore a pattern puzzle game, essentially based on level design and the always different way of having to get to the end. The protagonist is a nice yellow bird called precisely Toki Tori: the aim is to free all the eggs of his fellows that sprinkle every level of the four worlds present, set among enchanted forests, castles and slimy sewers. It is therefore not a completely original title, but still very suitable for the WiiWare philosophy It is therefore not a completely original title, but still very suitable for the WiiWare philosophy and the Nintendo remote control; the controls have been adapted as a kind of point and click, and the graphics have also been updated with three-dimensional characters and enemies, more colors and modified levels compared to the original version. The Wii Remote works great, is responsive and accurate. Pressing the A key and pointing the screen indicates the direction where our cute friend must move, while the B key activates the various skills, learned as you progress through the game. Their use is limited and is the key to beating each level: finding yourself stuck, you can only start over. It is therefore necessary to study every move, to set the reasoning in motion so as not to waste moves and to arrive at the fateful white eggs, located in increasingly inaccessible and difficult points. The skills are many and always very different, such as creating a bridge, teleporting to other areas or real weapons useful for defeating enemies on the screen. The second youth of the yellow bird If our Toki Tori is stuck inside the level, we will immediately understand it from his mood: sad and disconsolate, with tender eyes looking down. In these cases it is therefore necessary to restart the level and start over. It is possible to activate a second remote control to allow a friend to give us directions and suggestions directly on the screen, a factor that increases the involvement and the challenge to face with a person at our side. There are ~Jokers~, limited in number, to be used in case we absolutely cannot continue, and allow us to jump to the next scheme. Basically, the game ends when we find ourselves blocked and unable to continue, when an enemy hits us, or if we fail to take all the eggs in the scheme. In each of these cases it is necessary to restart, study the scheme better and then start again. Each world, well characterized from a visual point of view, also hosts exclusive abilities for our yellow bird: for example, the ghost trap can only be found in the castle, in the sewers instead you can use the Snail Sucker, a weapon that manages to erase enemies and clear our way. There is also the freeze, which freezes opponents, and teleportation, useful for reaching inaccessible points. In the Wii version some cuts have also been made, such as the timer which forced you to think much much faster and perhaps made the game too frustrating. The ability to look at the pattern at all times has also been eliminated, as there is no longer any need for it. The beauty of Toki Tori lies entirely in the level design, sometimes brilliant, for the most part of the well-studied level. The beauty of Toki Tori lies entirely in the level design, sometimes brilliant The second youth of the yellow bird The feeling we get when playing with it is one of challenge, constant mental engagement and ever greater exploitation of logic. Often one gets stuck and it can be assumed that the level has been designed badly, or is afflicted by some bug, but with dedication and a glance, the solution will come out sooner or later, giving great satisfaction. Some passages are really difficult, and it will take many attempts to continue. That's the beauty of the game, but also an element of frustration at times. The Nintendo Wii message board is used in an innovative and fun way as we are constantly updated on our progressssed through illustrated letters in which the bird informs us about the continuation of his adventure. Moving on to the visual component, Toki Tori is very nice and colorful, obviously improved from its ancestor for Game Boy Color, with well-animated 3D characters and many side elements such as flowers, butterflies, and insects that populate the over 40 available levels. Furthermore, the backdrops and objects in close proximity help to create a pleasant effect of depth and unprecedented vitality. The music is made up of good tunes, nice and never oppressive, a fundamental characteristic in this kind of titles. Toki Tori perhaps has the flaw of being yet another puzzle game to arrive on Wii, and runs the risk of not receiving the due attention this time too, which it absolutely deserves as a truly challenging, fun title that can offer many hours of gameplay carefree. Comment This is the right opportunity to recover a title that escaped many people many years ago, despite the great qualities it possesses. Toki Tori is an excellent remake, graphically updated and improved, with new and even more challenging levels that will delight those who have already completed it on Game Boy Color. The controls work well and the philosophy of the game fits perfectly with the Nintendo Wii and its new distribution platform WiiWare. Toki Tori offers many hours of healthy entertainment and mental commitment through its four worlds and forty schemes, all well thought out and designed, always accompanied by captivating music and perfectly in tune with her style. Pros A true remake, with improvements on all fronts New controls work well Challenging and lengthy Cons Yet another Nintendo Wii puzzle game Not a completely original title Some very difficult and frustrating puzzles", "date": "2008-06-20", "grade": null}
