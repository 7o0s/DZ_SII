An old-school rail shooter, in the style of House of the Dead, which borrows the name and recycles part of the graphic assets from one of the most popular horror films on PlayStation 4, inserting cameos and some scares in the middle. A relatively low-risk project for the Guildford developer, conceptually too anchored in the past to be able to effectively push a technology projected towards the future such as PlayStation VR. Yet it is precisely the new Sony viewer that gives Rush of Blood that extra edge without which it would have remained a completely forgettable game. Between killer clowns, spiders and pigs, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood brings horror to PlayStation VR Watch out for the clown If Until Dawn was a game heavily focused on storytelling, Rush of Blood instead places itself at the opposite extreme. What is being told is actually a crazy trip that takes place in Josh's mind, a pretext that has allowed Supermassive to take many creative liberties while inserting small and vague references to the original game here and there. Hardcore Until Dawn fans will recognize some characters and certain elements of the scenario, but overall Rush of Blood doesn't even try to delve into the original story or add new information and points of view. We said, the game is literally a shooter on rails. In fact, the experience takes place sitting on the cart of a carousel, crossing the path of what appears to be the haunted house of an abandoned amusement park. It leaves us dismayed to see the sinister Dr. Hill who, in an unlikely carousel costume, leads us, stirs us up and introduces us to the local attractions. But soon the wooden targets and air guns give way to fearsome flesh-and-blood enemies to be eliminated with revolvers and sawed-off shotguns, while the innocuous initial area transforms into an ominous warehouse full of dangers . Too bad Rush of Blood's few really disturbing moments are all concentrated in the first half of the game: warping rooms and giant dolls make the carousel ride look like a distorted version of It's a Small World, but that's when you enter a repulsive slaughterhouse with gigantic pigs bleeding, wriggling and squealing as the Rush of Blood reaches its climax. The rest is a disappointing repetition of less interesting situations and environments, which end in a banal lava cave populated by just a few successful enemies. The attempts to scare the players are all extremely phoned, mostly following the clich of the light going out and the monster suddenly appearing. By the third time, it's already boring. Indeed, to keep the player busy in the dead moments, certain rooms (predictably, the less interesting ones) are filled with objects and targets to hit in order to increase the score multiplier. The game is mostly saved thanks to the ability of PlayStation VR to completely immerse the user in the scenario, forcing him to always look around for enemies or to tilt his head to avoid traps and obstacles along the way. On the other hand, the implementation of the two PlayStation Moves to control the respective weapons is less successful, and on several occasions it happened that one of the two lost synchrony making it very difficult to aim and point (to the point that, on a couple of occasions, we had to put pause the game and repeat the synchronization procedure). When they work well, the Moves allow you to play in total fluency, using each arm to illuminate the scenario with the torch, reload or shoot multiple enemies at once. But when they malfunction, they remind us that we're holding plastic remote controls with a glowing ball on them, a six-year-old technology that's been gathering dust in our drawers for an eternity. Of course, Rush of Blood can also be played using the DualShock (and in that case both weapons follow a single pointer together), but the sense of ~presence~ within the world is clearly affected. However, the one set up by Supermassive is a very limited experience, which is completed within an hour and a half without almost ever seeing a Game Over. To stimulate replaying the various scenarios, the English team has slipped in different difficulty levels, a ranking system, a handful of collectibles and some alternative routes, but after the first round Rush of Blood no longer reserves any surprises, and what remains is an all too traditional rail shooter with very imprecise controlsthe.", "date": "2016-10-13", "grade": "6.5"}
