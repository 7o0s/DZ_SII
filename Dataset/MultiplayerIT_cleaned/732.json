In Legion Arena, the thousands of responsibilities of the commander are reduced to the purchase of military units and their equipment. One wonders how it is possible to ~purchase~ a unit of legionnaires... as if going to the market were enough to hear shouts ~come come sihorri and sihorre, today we have on offer two units of legionnaires and one of auxiliary knights, and for the first five customers one of Hannibal's pet elephants for free...~. Well, you know, history is full of obscure points... As in any self-respecting strategy, each unit has different characteristics from the others, starting from the actual number of soldiers present and then going into detail on the individual aspects. If we are not satisfied with the performance of our soldiers in battle, we can always disband the unit and we will receive exactly what we originally paid to purchase it. Once satisfied with our troops we just have to start the mission then, once successfully completed, we will return to the same screen again to organize the development of the units based on the experience accumulated. Just like in an RPG, in fact, the various units will gain experience based on the number of enemies shot down, and each level acquired will allow us to assign them a new special ability. Equipment is treated in the same way as special abilities, in fact only the most experienced units will be able to use the best weapons and armor. So it all boils down to a simple matter of money and experience. Less brilliant however is the way in which losses are managed. Each completed mission is awarded a certain amount of fame that can be spent to replace the fallen; pity that this goes far beyond what is necessary, almost as if in the development phase it had been thought of using it in another way (which would seem confirmed by the fact that everything that can be purchased, from units to equipment, also has fame in its cost, only that its value is always zero). [C] The mission summary with the performance of the individual units is included in the mission. and the experience points earned. ~Leveling up~ (to put it in RPG terms) is a challenge. extremely easy and fast. The ~marketplace~ of the Roman army. As already said & egrave; strange that the cost in fame is always zero. [/C] Back to school The nightmare of all those who have made it! Well, you can relax, it's not exactly like that, but it comes very close... In fact, the way in which the events between one mission and another are narrated are very reminiscent of the old history books of middle and high school. Legion Arena consists of 3 distinct campaigns: the Latins, the Romans and the Celts. The first is a short tutorial that is essential for learning how to command troops. The Roman campaign is the longest, and forms the core of the whole game. Finally there is the Celtic one, just over half of the Roman one, which should complete the game. These are absolutely linear campaigns: a short introductory film made up of static images and a narrative voice introduces a series of missions, at the end of which a new film of a similar type guides us to the next story. We will therefore experience the history of Rome firsthand, from the first battles for the control of the tribes of central Italy, passing through the Punic Wars and the clashes with the barbarians, up to the internal wars for the control of Rome itself. The blitzkrieg, two thousand years before the Second World War... Short, short, too short... this is the only comment that comes to mind after playing a Legion Arena mission: three, five minutes at most, definitely too little. The scenarios are presented by two, three views of the deployments seasoned with about fifteen lines of explanation written in large letters, then we enter the phase of distributing the troops. The blitzkrieg, two thousand years before the Second World War... The battlefield can be of two dimensions: small or microscopic, to the point that there is barely the space to place the maximum number of deployable units. Apart from the effort sometimes necessary to maneuver in narrow spaces and the absence of the help of any zoom, the disposition of the troops is undoubtedly the most important operation of the whole game, in fact almost always the battles are decided in this moment. You have to observe the battlefield, try to predict where the armies will collide and choose the units that will composethey will hold up better on that terrain, obviously without forgetting the type of opponent they will be up against. The result is therefore a game of balance that requires a little attention at the beginning, but which after a few missions becomes almost automatic. The objectives of the missions then certainly do not stand out for their originality ... usually it is the banal ~destroy everything~, occasionally complicated by a limited time or by a maximum limit of losses that can be granted. In case of failure you have to try again until you succeed, because there is no other way forward. In words it may seem difficult, but in reality almost all battles are resolved with a simple direct charge, making sure to make your units collide with those that are more disadvantaged against them. In any case, variations in tactics are almost impossible, in fact the orders that can be given to the various units in battle cost a certain number of action points, and the commander has a limited amount of them, after which he will have to wait for them to regenerate, hoping that in the meantime the adversary does not take advantage of it to massacre us. Final comment Legion Arena is a budget title, so it doesn't claim to become a masterpiece or even to compete with more famous titles (although that pearl of Runaway always remains, budget title, and masterpiece among adventure games...). Yet it fails to convince There are no gross or macroscopic errors and that is why it still manages to touch, albeit barely, the sufficiency, but does absolutely nothing to deserve more. The missions are a disproportionate amount, but they are also incredibly easy and short, and despite everything you can comfortably finish the game in a couple of days. Too many times the same game map is recycled and it is seen all too well how all the scenarios were created thanks to an all too elementary editor. Campaign management itself is not convincing. Meanwhile, they are of very different lengths; moreover they are not at all connected to each other, but they must necessarily be completed in order and it is not clear why. The choice of the historical moment in which the game ends (the rise of Octavian for the Romans, and the Roman conquest of Brittany for the Celts) is not particularly convincing either: the history of Rome and the Celts continued for centuries beyond this point, and considering how little time is needed to create the scenarios, it's not clear why they stopped like this... The multiplayer option itself leaves its time, given that in the end they are very simple direct battles, which, given the brevity of the clashes, end right away. Legion Arena is an absolutely mediocre title, which has its only strong point in its low cost, but which alone is not enough to make it interesting. It can be a good choice if you are a fan of the historical genre or if you are interested in a more complex substitute for the usual Windows solitaire games. Pros Nothing to report Cons Extremely short Too simplified approach Inaccuracies almost everywhere Interview with JD McNeil We had the opportunity to ask JD McNeil, Slitherine's Administrative Officer, a few questions about Legion Arena. Here are his answers. Multiplayer.it: Legion Arena has a strictly historical setting: the player's results do not influence the unfolding of events in any way, and it is necessary to replay the failed scenarios again and again until success is achieved in order to continue the game. Why did you choose this setting? JD McNeil: We wanted to create a structure in the game by which we reward players for their progress and make the scenarios progressively more difficult. This was a game changer for us, as in the past our games, even when set in a historical context, allowed players to progress in any direction. This approach was not functional for Legion Arena which focuses quite clearly on battlefield control and tactics. We also wanted to keep individual battles relatively short so players could make significant progress in a relatively short period of play, such as during their lunch break. So we figured that linking the campaigns and scenarios using the story of the period would work well, and at the same time it would also be useful for learning something. One of the tenets of the game is that your command and control tactics and skills will improve as you progress through the game's scenarios, and if you fail there will be an infinite number of ways to make things right. As I said, the battles are relatively short so that rigLooking at them will usually be a fun experience as you try to figure out where you went wrong and put things right. Multiplayer.it: Historically the Roman legions moved slow and compact, and waited for the others to attack. On the contrary, in LA almost all of the scenarios are resolved by loading, and often one is even forced to do so due to time limits, thus making the use of more ~refined~ tactics completely useless. Is it a desired result or was it not possible to make the battles more realistic (especially regarding the Roman countryside)? JD McNeil: Roman tactics of this era were revolutionary and were honed with many years of innovation and training. All of this can be recreated, but only as you progress through the game. At first your troops will be quite simple and capable of only the most rudimentary formations and tactics and you will need to develop a program to make the best use of the units that will be at your disposal. You will soon realize that the Romans developed their formations and tactics for good reason and if you try to follow their teachings you should succeed quite well, but of course you will only be capable of tribal formations and tactics to begin with. Higher level skills and battle formations will come as you progress and learn how to use them. Also many of the missions have conditions that need to be met which are not as simple as winning or in some cases losing. It's also about fulfilling the requirements of your missions to earn the rewards needed to progress in the next missions. Simply using frontal charges can defeat the enemy, but at what cost? In Legion Arena you will need to keep an eye on the mission parameters and be sure to meet them, or progressing to high levels will become very difficult. Multiplayer.it: Legion Arena focuses on simplicity, and it is understandable given that it is a budget title. The fact that the control of the units is simple and intuitive is undoubtedly a plus; however, this simplicity is often found even in the same battles (very small game areas, units that cannot be destroyed, enemy armies almost always of a much lower level than your own), so much so that in the end the missions rarely last 5 minutes. Simple scenarios then, but in huge numbers (if I'm not mistaken there are around a hundred between the two campaigns): do you think it's a winning combination? JD McNeil: We've worked hard to keep the User Interface as intuitive and engaging as possible. Information needs to be at the players' fingertips when they need it, and controls need to be at hand to make events happen. If this is done right it won't be noticed, but the experience will be improved. We aim to make the gaming experience as rewarding as possible for our players and if we can simplify quite a few small parts to achieve this, then we consider it a point in our favor. We thought long and hard about allowing units to be destroyed, but we know that many players find it a negative experience. Losing a character, or in this case a unit, that they spent hours developing can be quite frustrating, so we decided to allow the units to survive, but suffer other consequences. Treat losses as replacements, the same way a real unit would gain them, but at the same time its progression and development are severely hurt. In the past our games have been huge, with literally hundreds of hours of play, and our research has shown that players often never make it to the end, so in Legion Arena the battles have been kept in a more manageable time, so that players can progress in relatively short sessions. This also ensures that they can bring him to his conclusion. So you'll have to learn a new skill set and become a Celtic General. In many ways this is a much tougher campaign, because during the Roman Campaign you were leading a rising army, whereas in the case of the Celtic Campaign it is the reverse. So, in answer to your question, we think it's a winning formula, but only time will tell. Multiplayer.it: The two campaigns are quite short. Are you thinking of developing updates, inserting new ones or extending existing ones to subsequent historical periods? JD McNeil: It is interesting that you consider the campaigns a bit short, in the past we have been 'criticized' because our games were 'too big'. However, if we accept the", "date": "2005-11-29", "grade": null}
