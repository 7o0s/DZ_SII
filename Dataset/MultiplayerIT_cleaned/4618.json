While not shining for originality, in fact, the title produced by Bethesda and developed by Shinji Mikami's team, Tango Gameworks, has managed to satisfy a large part of the public thanks to an adventure characterized by a flowing story and gameplay that has been able to combine well the various elements taken from the main exponents of the genre. More than enough situation - together with a fair amount of sales - to ensure the arrival of a sequel where the father of Resident Evil is present only in the role of producer. Obviously entitled The Evil Within 2, the game promises to build a slightly less linear and more ~free~ survival experience on the foundations of its predecessor. But will he succeed? Twisted worlds It is difficult to talk about the plot of The Evil Within 2 without anticipating something to those who have not played the predecessor: the events are in fact closely related, and chronologically the game takes place a few years after the ending of the first chapter. Everything still revolves around the STEM and its capabilities: thanks to this device, Mobius has created Union, a place that reflects the typical quiet American provincial town, populating it with people from the real world. To keep everything together and ensure stability, the pure and uncontaminated mind of a little girl is chosen, Lily, the daughter of detective Castellanos who he himself believed dead in a fire. But the girl disappears and that world left without its core begins to collapse: in the general chaos, some individuals with strong psychopathic tendencies find the way paved to distort the world and give vent to their murderous instincts. And it is at this point that a visibly exhausted Sebastian Castellanos, destroyed by past events, and the gamer come into play, dragged into a ~mutant~ nightmare made of fighting, madness and violence. Right from the start, in fact, The Evil Within 2 offers an unhealthy and decadent atmosphere, with scenarios, especially internal ones, dirty and corroded, where at every step it almost seems you can smell mold, rust and rottenness. Not to mention the annoying, oppressive nauseating sensation one feels in front of the butchered bodies that can be encountered along the way, and at certain moments that are nothing short of brutal, in a series of situations that seem to wink at the first Silent Hill, but above all to the latest Resident Evil 7 and Outlast II, but with less scary situations, apart from the appearance of some bosses. Exploring Union or the distorted and shocking places born from the perverse mind of its inhabitants and some really disreputable characters like Stefano and Theodore, does not only mean finding useful clues about the plot, items to upgrade weapons and Sebastian, or completing side missions , but also to literally immerse oneself in the psyche of these individuals, as often these places are the very emanation of their disturbances. Even the creatures, especially the more powerful ones from which you just have to run away, at least in the first hours of the game, largely reflect the suffering generated by their madness. Danger around every corner In general, the gameplay of The Evil Within 2 does not differ much from that of its predecessor: from this point of view, do not expect any upheavals of any kind, but simple tweaks and some small additions to vary, for example, the attack or defense moves of Sebastian, and maybe make them more fluid and functional. The level design is different: in the game there are still linear sections and points of no return, but there are also large open areas that can be freely explored, to visit any previously neglected areas. The idea of the developers is to give players some breathing space so as not to oppress them too much with horror elements and push them to discover more details about the plot by searching for files and completing side missions. Some of these exploit, among other things, a new device available to Sebastian, a communicator that detects voices from the past and resonance points that tell the personal stories of other victims, and act as a guide towards certain objectives. In any case, the decision to offer greater freedom of movement in certain areas transforms the gaming experience enormously, because in those situations which are different from the others, it is the gamer who shapes the pace and decides whether or not it is worthwhile to linger in a given area more than necessary, but with the risk of finding enemies there, or avoid everything, ~save~ bullets and continue straight on your way. Running completely dry is quite unlikely,to tell the truth, but the amount of bullets is small enough to ensure that the player never abuses the trigger too much. In this sense, the title pushes the user to an intelligent use of the resources at his disposal, to study the environment and the creatures to kill, before solving the problem and eliminating the threat. As such, it tends to reward sneaking behind all sorts of cover or in bushes, killing from behind or evading, at least on the higher difficulty level, where the creatures are more dangerous, although the cheap ones in general don't shine for sharpness. Otherwise, the action becomes similar to that of modern third-person shooters and you have to act accordingly, using anything if possible to get to the bottom of the battle, especially against the bosses who are quite difficult. Also in this case the developers have decided on the one hand to stick to the typical stylistic features of classic survival horror, on the other to expand the formula with greater environmental interactivity with bins, trolleys, petrol pools and crates to slow down its progress or inflict more damage. However, the improvements do not all reside in the open map, given that The Evil Within 2 also offers a significantly more elaborate development system than its predecessor, which separates the character's weapons and abilities. The protagonist, inside some unassailable buildings, in addition to saving, can build objects, upgrade weapons and create ammunition, this time thanks to a series of objects collected along the way. While in the old dream world inside his mind, through the usual, very special ~chair~ and his ~old friend~ Tatiana, Sebastian can exploit the green jelly obtained by killing monsters to improve his physical characteristics, from damage to resistance to strokes up to that to running and fatigue. Playstation 4 trophies The Evil Within 2 offers a total of 52 Trophies divided into 36 Bronze, 14 Silver, 1 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them, you must meet the game's requests, such as to overcome a particular boss, max out Sebastian's stats, or kill a certain number of enemies with a specific weapon or style, and so on. Madness takes shape From a graphic point of view, The Evil Within 2 abandons the black bars of its predecessor, so that it can be enjoyed in full screen. Visually it almost never reaches peaks of excellence such as to leave the player speechless, but this does not mean that it is not beautiful to look at: aesthetically it is superior to the first chapter and thanks to a series of optimizations it offers several rather successful external environmental glimpses (apart from a few pop-ins in the distance) which, thanks to excellent management of the lights and particle effects, give a good overview. Instead, we move some criticisms for some of the numerous interiors present in the video game, where despite the attention to detail, it happens to find points covered with fairly dull textures, even if these never lead to poor or low resolution levels. On this front, an artistic direction similar to that of the first episode certainly helps, in our opinion spot on, which well manages to represent the twisted worlds resulting from the sick psychology of some STEM individuals. A feature that has allowed Tango Gameworks to indulge themselves with optical illusions, unpredictable changes of setting and transformations, disturbing plays of light, carefully positioned particular objects and other tricks to make the atmosphere distressing and oppressive, and to mask some imperfections. Finally, the polygonal models of the main characters and bosses are beautiful, even if for the former we have facial expressions that are not always convincing and natural. On the other hand, the work done on the uploads is remarkable, which are always extremely rapid. As for the audio sector, the commitment to Italian dubbing is commendable, overall well acted and with different voices all in the part. The audio effects and the soundtrack are excellent, which more than once will make the player's skin shiver, especially when they accompany the appearance of creatures like Anima.", "date": "2017-10-12", "grade": "8.5"}
