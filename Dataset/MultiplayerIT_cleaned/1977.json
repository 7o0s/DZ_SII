{"name": "Taz Wanted", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/taz-wanted_a.html", "text": "Always watching cartoons! It's not true I'm playing! The graphics of the title are very faithful to the design of the original cartoons. The technique used is the classic one of Cell-Shading and the defects of this graphic style are very few. The characters are really well characterized and Taz particularly proves hilarious in all his moves. The sound is always appropriate to the situation and the background music is catchy and always suitable for the situation. The slowdown and quickening of the pace accompanies the unfolding of the actions, for example when Taz tiptoes over the logs or when he runs through the levels at full speed the pace goes from slow to frenetic in the space of a few seconds. The controls are excellent and respond perfectly to stresses. There are numerous actions available and all of them can be performed simply. With the pressure of the Circle it will be possible to carry out the classic vortex rotation that made the little devil famous and if this were not enough I anticipate that you will be able to swallow, spit, jump and even burp with truly disastrous effects on the monsters and the surrounding environment (no comment ). Longevity is good but not excessive and settles at a normal level. The most practical will not take much time to complete the title but some bonuses ensure a little extra fun. So even when you have finished the title you can always have a good go kart challenge with your friends and this greatly extends the longevity. Turn off the TV! Taz Wanted shows all its merits by trying to conquer the entire public, but the undertaking is too difficult. Up to 14/15 years the title can be fun, but despite the attempts of Infogrames, the characters still come from a cartoon, as well as locations and history and this is enough not to bring many closer to the title. However, I would recommend it to all platform lovers and to those who want to try their hand at a fun title and, as we well know, fun has no age. Avoid prejudices and immerse yourself in a very nice platform that exceeds the sufficiency by more than one point and that has very few defects! Pros: Very accurate graphics Very spot on sound Excellent localization Skyrocketing longevity Really nice characters Cons: Sometimes really difficult The target can be low The devil of Taz-mania We have all been children and consequently we have spent whole days in front of a screen watching cartoons. The company par excellence in the production of cartoons is Warner Bros. which has led to the success of characters such as the Looney Tunes, protagonists of fun and colorful cartoons and, for some time now, also of good quality video games such as the latest arrival Taz Wanted. The WB exploits one of the most charismatic characters with Taz, trying to conquer the public with his hilarious adventures and the choice is certainly the most appropriate, it is difficult to think of a better protagonist for the creation of a platform and only a ~plumber with mustache~ might change my mind about what I just said. We will witness the capture of Taz and his partner and their transport to a zoo by Yosemite Sam (remember the guy with the red mustache and the cowboy hat?), but Taz doesn't give up and manages to escape ! Our task will be to eliminate all the signs (Wanted in fact) representing Taz and any other clues that appear in front of us during the exploration of the levels, to then finally get to face Yosemite and thus regain our maiden. Directly at the entrance to the zoo it is possible to learn, thanks to the help of Tweety, all the moves of the game and to exploit them in the right way. Some objectives are actually more complex than they appear and it will take a good deal of ingenuity and patience to complete an entire level. All this may seem paradoxical also considering the target, but it is not because everyone should be interested in the title without thinking about the origin of the characters. However in the worst case you can adjust the level of Duffy-culture in the practical game options.", "date": "2002-10-16", "grade": null}
