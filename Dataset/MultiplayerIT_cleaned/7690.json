Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Ah, top view racing! Is there an older subgenre? Probably not: driving games started out just like that, with improbable pixel-shaped cars shot from above. Over the years we have had shining examples of what titles belonging to this trend should be like, and also shining examples of how they really shouldn't be, but today is Saturday and we haven't forgotten the weekly appointment with ~the free game~. And yes, this time we're talking about Red Bull Kart Fighter 3 - Piste Selvagge, the new freemium racer created by Red Bull Media House and set in the wonderful world of karts. An arcade driving game with a top view, in fact, which has respectable numbers on its side, in this case the beauty of twenty-five different tracks, which make up five tournaments and can be tackled aboard five vehicle classes. Before all these ~fives~ get you confused, let's take a step back, returning to the main screen to be exact. In fact, in addition to accessing tournaments, Red Bull Kart Fighter 3 allows us to try our hand at a quick game with random values, challenge a friend to see who sets the best lap time, check the rankings and trophies, or finally customize the kart by changing its color. This part of the experience stands out decisively thanks to cartoon-style graphics, really well done, and fast scrolling of the screen that gives the interface dynamism. In short, moving between the menus is a real pleasure and prepares us for the real action. Did you drink your drink? Red Bull Kart Fighter 3 - Wild Tracks is a very full-bodied arcade racer, with three different driving styles Kart sings One of the peculiarities of Red Bull Kart Fighter 3 - Piste Selvagge, in addition to the particularly full-bodied structure, lies in the presence of three different layouts for the controls, designed for beginners, intermediates and experts. In fact, the first configuration sees the kart move automatically within the tracks, allowing us to accelerate and brake, but also to change direction via the accelerometer if the artificial intelligence gets stuck, for example by continuing to bump into an opponent rather than overtake him. The second configuration, probably the best of the lot, uses automatic acceleration and allows us to steer using two arrows placed on the sides of the touch screen, but possibly also to brake. This type of approach combines challenge and involvement, and we liked it right away, while the third configuration is completely manual and requires a lot of practice to be able to master it, since the accelerator, brake and steering will respond directly to our input. But let's go back to the first peculiarity of the game, the structure, because the system adopted by the developers is very interesting and implies a tough apprenticeship in order to unlock all the tracks and all the categories of karts available. Every time we finish a race in first place we are awarded three stars (four if we use one of the available wildcards, which can be purchased using virtual money), and the amount of stars is crucial to be able to continue in the experience, which means that we will have to follow a certain procedure, familiarize yourself with the gameplay and reach the more complex stages only when we will actually be able to deal with them. All very nice, right? Yes and no: the speed ramps up a little too quickly from one category to another, within the same tournament, and a top-down driving game that's too fast on a smartphone screen is frankly chaotic. A problem that can be remedied with practice, but which takes a little by surprise and results in a decline in interest.", "date": "2013-08-03", "grade": "7.5"}
