{"name": "Highwater", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/highwater-recensione.html", "text": "We have seen several post-apocalyptic worlds as video game scenarios, but in the Highwater review we are dealing with a representation that manages to be fascinating and original, which is indispensable when it comes to spending time exploring large desolate areas . To tell the truth, it is by no means the first time that we have to deal with an almost completely submerged Earth and survivors forced to live among boats and a few emerged areas, however the way in which this future is staged in Highwater, between style melancholy graphic and world-building, has something unique. Some environmentalist concepts help to enrich this imagery, telling how climate change and humanity's inability to remedy the damage to the environment have caused this enormous cataclysm. The story stages the adventure of Nikos, a boy determined to face the risks of survival and try to penetrate one of the few bastions of social organization left standing in the general disaster. The world of Highwater is characterized by total social breakdown, where most people find themselves living hand to mouth scavenging resources and fighting to protect them from others. In this absolute loss of human cohesion, a minimum of support and protection was offered by the wealthy elites who inhabit Alphaville, one of the few places that still functions as a semblance of civilization, but this fortified citadel has long ago decided to close its doors, with increasingly insistent voices that tell of how the rich society intends to abandon the Earth and flee to Mars using special transport rockets. Finding no hope in a world totally adrift, Nikos intends to somehow enter Alphaville, find out how things are going and, if necessary, be able to carve out a space inside the rocket to Mars. Strategy, survival and adventure In Highwater, boat travel takes up a large part of the game The gameplay is made up of juxtaposed game mechanics, which alternate by intervening at different times: the exploration is almost open world, focused on navigating the world largely covered by water, although the possible landing places are limited and well highlighted. In some respects, this part is reminiscent of similar experiences seen in Far: Changing Tides or even The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, although Highwater isn't exactly about free-roaming a vast world. These sections mainly serve as a link to the phases on the mainland, which can present different types of interaction, from narrative moments composed mainly of dialogues with other characters to real fights that take place through the typical turn-based strategy mechanics. turn-based strategy-style combat is more basic than other more orthodox exponents of the genre, however it offers really interesting game situations. The mechanics are the classic one, with the playing field that is divided into squares on which we move like on a chessboard, in an attempt to exploit any advantages offered by the scenario and tools with which to defend ourselves or cause damage to enemies in the classic turn-based dynamic. In Highwater, the phases on land feature combat that takes place in a turn-based strategy structure What is particularly interesting are the interactions with the elements of the scenario, which also open up different solutions compared to the classic exchange of alternating blows. Some glimpses of Highwater are memorable There is no doubt, however, that much of the game's charm lies in the desolation of the Earth covered by water and in the discovery of the landing places that conceal small or large mysterious adventures. Despite the sadness that pervades a world now in ruins, exploration is always full of charm, also thanks to an almost pictorial graphic style, between chromatic choices, polygonal minimalism and the use of diffused lights. It's certainly a contemplative experience, also because often there isn't really much to do in the few explorable areas on land and the dialogues tend to be too synthetic, so much so that they don't explain much about the characters and the story itself. This remarkable technical achievement and the breadth of the game has a substantial cost in terms of hardware: played on mobile platforms, Highwater needs truly cutting-edge devices just to be able to function and it is far more difficult to be able to enjoy convincing performances.", "date": "2023-03-31", "grade": "8.0"}
