The DLC in question is titled Bulletstorm: Bloody Melody and costs 800 Microsoft Points on Xbox Live or $9.99 in the PC version, containing various additions. Introducing Ultimate Echoes mode, based on Echo but with the addition of specific objectives to pursue, with three new multiplayer maps for Anarchy mode: Mini-Town, Ulysses and Rock Quarry. Two maps have also been added to Echo mode, namely Monorail Factory and Mean Street to create a fairly interesting and full-bodied package for network play. The Mini City The new expansion pack for Bulletstorm, which will soon be available also for Playstation 3, expands the multiplayer experience of the latest Epic title with three maps dedicated to Anarchy mode. Like a sort of ~Horde~ a la Gears of War, up to four players join the fray of a map trying to survive wave after wave of enemies, increasingly stronger, more numerous and bad. On the screen there is a counter that displays how many are missing to kill, but passing the level is not necessarily linked to the count of enemy deaths, but to a score to be obtained through the style with which we ~kill~ them. Let's explain better: kicking an opponent and riddle him with blows while he is still in the air will give the player a higher number of points, as well as performing specific kill requests on some particular targets (electroshock, slide, black hole, and many other types of ~death ~). Bulletstorm: Bloody Melody allows us to fight in three new maps dedicated to this mode. The first, called Mini-City, is perhaps the worst of the package. We find ourselves in a sort of miniature city made up of skyscrapers, roads and bridges: a map actually recycled from the single player and decidedly simple. In fact, it develops completely horizontally and has a purely quadrilateral perimeter. No surprises or superfine tactics here, you shoot in sight and seek cover behind buildings when possible. A slightly raised lateral steel platform offers the opportunity to cover one's shoulders and wait for the horde to arrive from the front, but this is only possible for the first waves, after which the number and aggressiveness will increase and it will be necessary to move across the park. Graphically it is the most subdued map: in the center of the Mini-City there is a giant steel dinosaur on fire which dominates the view from all parts of the map, above which there are model helicopters circling above our heads to the entire duration of the games. Little else around but palaces, palaces and more palaces. Ulysses and the Cave The spaceship Ulysses, which plays a major role in the Bulletstorm story, finds itself in the Bulletstorm: Bloody Tune DLC with its ~revisited~, decadent and half-destroyed version. The map is spread over three vertical levels and with a circular perimeter, so as to allow a series of group strategies aimed at surrounding the enemies and taking them out all together, always moving sideways through the corridors. The structure of the spaceship also allows a whole series of spectacular kills: ~black hole~ if we manage to kick an enemy through the gaps in the ship that give directly onto outer space (sucking anyone who passes through it into a vortex), or ~electroshock~ throwing them into one of the many defaulted computers or electrical panels. Once again not a spectacularly beautiful map to look at, indeed, very simple but with attention to detail just like it was in the single player. An evocative view of the outside shows us deep space, planets, other ships on a collision course. Inside, however, little to say except what everyone would expect to find: metal structures, Aliens-style steel steps, on-board computer and little else. Lastly, Caverna is perhaps the most interesting multiplayer map of the three. First of all, it is the only one to be designed as a ~fixed route~ and not free roaming. It is developed on two levels connected by two long corridors, at the end of which there are as many areas where you can wait for the waves. Some nice gadgets fill the Cave: two pulleys full of hot lava can be opened at any time to the delight of those standing just below, while a rail trolley can be kicked to run over theenemies coming in the opposite direction, resulting in a hilarious ~derailment~ death. At the bottom of the map there is a closed area where there are electrified nets (useful for frying some monsters), while otherwise you can take advantage of the verticality of the area (and its precipices) to kick as many enemies as we can. Caverna is the most interesting map for this very reason: it offers a range of possibilities for eliminating enemies that all the others don't offer, and its nature also makes it much more evocative and beautiful to look at. It is, precisely, an open-air mine that overlooks a magnificent valley in the moonlight. The vertical but also very ~long~ design also makes it the map with the farthest horizon, where you can use your sniper rifle and see all the way to the other side of the war zone. Echo Supremo and the new challenges The Echo mode, unlike the more ~shoot-it-all~ one of Anarchy, makes us approach the game with a different, less wild and frenetic attitude. It is in fact necessary to cross some maps trying to conclude specific objectives, under penalty of the fateful ~The End~ of the game. In one of the maps included in the Bulletstorm: Blood Melody DLC, called Monorail, for example, it is required to complete 30 headshots, or to obtain mastery of some specific weapons (by equipping them and making a given number of kills). The ~Stabilimento della Monorail~ is one of the most beautiful maps: although closed, it has an often very distant horizon, with bright colors due to a blue sky above the glass roofs and orange lights that cut in, it is a mix of architectures sometimes dilapidated other times sumptuous, in the former train station of the city. The objectives are difficult but not impossible, with a good hand and a little patience this map can be completed with ease. The first objective, for example, is impossible in the initial part of the map but we will have to go to the back, where an active monorail circulates back and forth on a track: it is required to make five ~pancakes~, or kick the enemies and make them run over by the train. The second objective requires you to ~simply~ finish the level in one minute by performing 10 different moves. The third, lastly, is to take out all the enemies... without firing a single shot. Definitely within reach in a game like Bulletstorm that makes fantasy its strong point in Kills. And therefore green light to kicks, nooses, impalements, electrifications, flattening on trains, cacti, walls and so on that not even Uncle Tibia's ranking of deaths was more heterogeneous. Much more difficult, however, the second Echo map included in the DLC: Mean Street will require many restarts and a constant ~die and try~ right away, when it is required to clean up all enemies in just 20 seconds. Highly recommended in good old Bouncer that does a lot of damage in melee. The second challenge is to get 10 ~steady hand~: you can do it at any point you encounter a Burnout, in practice you will have to kill with a single bullet by shooting one of the orange weak points. Use the Headhunter (Sniper Rifle) and you will have no problem killing them one by one with one shot by targeting them precisely on an orange weak spot. This time it is an open map that develops purely horizontally through an obligatory and narrow path, but with very choreographic and evocative open panoramas. We recommend downloading this DLC only to Bulletstorm super-fans or to those who have already completed all the Echo missions or are tired of the usual multiplayer maps.", "date": "2011-07-11", "grade": "7.5"}
