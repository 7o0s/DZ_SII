A huge track that offers all kinds of landscapes and all kinds of challenges. Unfortunately we are cementing it to build buildings that no one needs while those that do are left to rot. But we are not here to talk about building speculation but to see how much Italian passion for cycling is in Pro Cycling Manager: Giro d'Italia. Riding through ups and downs Pro Cycling Manager: Giro d'Italia allows you to make track races and single races but the most important mode is undoubtedly the career that allows us to compete sequentially in the most prestigious competitions. But before putting your feet on the pedals, you need to buy and choose the right equipment for the stage ahead. In fact, the endowment, which obviously has a cost to be deducted from the team's budget, guarantees substantial bonuses that are essential to make the difference both uphill and in the sprint. Once on the track, however, all attention must be paid to the team strategy which is managed through a series of individual commands that allow you to launch breakaways, tow the group, carry out counterattacks and so on. And it's convenient to be able to decide who has to sacrifice in defiance of the will of the individual cyclist, which is far more difficult in reality, in order to favor our top rider. But before performing risky maneuvers it is good to keep an eye on the condition of an athlete before considering him as the ace to throw on the run. The title includes teams, official riders and all the names of the Giro d'Italia and this is a very important point for fans. Unfortunately the athletes are not recognizable since the faces are anonymous and are all the same, and not even the commentary, signed by excellent names such as Savoldelli and De Luca but rather spartan and generic, mentions teams or cyclists. Therefore, to find out if Contador is the guy who runs away at full speed, it is necessary to select him, obviously wasting precious time. But if nothing else, the team jerseys are the official ones and help us in some way to recognize the cyclists who ride around us. Luckily for Cyanide all editions of Pro Cycling Manager have a hefty perk called solitude. In fact, the managerial title has no competitors and therefore, willy-nilly, it is the reference series. What's more, it includes an intuitive editor to give players the possibility to recreate the official stages or create new ones, and in addition it allows you to compete with 20 other players in multiplayer mode. Finally we must point out that some improvements, in addition to the partial refinement of animations and interpenetrations, have been introduced. In fact, now the interface is less difficult and the notorious sprint bug should also be solved in this ~special~ edition. The difficult compromise between managerial and simulation Recreating the atmosphere of an authentic bicycle race is far from easy and perhaps out of reach for the finances of a small software house. In fact, the overall effort in reproducing runners, animations and direction in a title that manages dozens of runners is really high. And to face this challenge Pro Cycling Manager: Giro d'Italia adopts a simple tactic. Neglecting almost all the surrounding elements relying on the modders who have already done an excellent job with the last chapter. Unfortunately, however, the heart of the game remains that and some defects cannot be solved in any way. Fortunately, overall, the graphic sector is suggestive thanks to a rather well made natural landscape but this element had already been introduced in the last chapter and in this new incarnation the improvements are minimal. So we find ourselves looking, once again, at cyclists impaled on their bikes, guide bikes that don't lean when cornering and a plethora of fans paralyzed or afflicted with major tics in their arms. In short, the bonus of being the only contender is gradually losing relevance especially if we consider that with the new engine the last chapters, although they are more pleasant to see, have acquired more in terms of bugs than in terms of enjoyment. However, the management part is sufficiently complete with the possibility of finding and training new talents and of simulating the races or of living them second by second complete with a customizable interface and options of all kinds. Furthermore, before the race all the slopes of the track are indicated and the physical form of the most dangerous runners is indicated. Finally we must reiterate that there is no shortage of suggestive landscapes, expensive in terms of hardware resources but fundamental in a production of this kind, and mustWe want to add that in the Cyanide title there is no shortage of challenge as the opponents are sufficiently intelligent and tough to beat. On the other hand, what is missing is physics, verisimilitude and above all a direction that allows us to follow everything in a credible way. We can certainly jump from one player to another and adopt different cameras, but the automatic replays of the incidents and the guided views capable of automatically showing what is happening where we are not looking are missing. In addition, the need for an increase in the strategic sector is beginning to be felt given that the possible tactics in cycling are many more than those appearing in the title. In fact, although the stages are animated thanks to the water supplies and various strategies, in time trials and track races the options are reduced to the bone and the title loses its bite. If nothing else the athletes finally try to avoid collisions by switching to the side of the pack. Unfortunately, however, the animations and situations are few and the interpenetrations have been filed but are still present and visible. Furthermore, there is still no collision management which would give a completely different flavor and thickness to the entire title by preventing the surrounded cyclists from ~crossing~ their companions to escape the grip. In short, after a few minutes of play, the impression one gets is that of seeing something fictitious and the movements of the cyclists end up recalling those of a horse race on a Luna Park track. Furthermore, the development team has completely forgotten the interpenetrations relating to the lead car which is crossed like an ectoplasm by the racing runners. Yet it would be a simple element to fix given that no runner has to pass through the vehicle that acts as a track opener to fetch water which is instead at the back of the group.", "date": "2011-05-25", "grade": "6.8"}
