Born in 2004 on PlayStation 2, the musical series created by London Studio remained on the crest of the wave for some time during the last decade, before ending up on the back burner in more recent times. What used to be three, four or even more different versions in the same year have gradually become less and less frequent, to the point of making the arrival of a new SingStar a rare event. Despite the four years of life of the PlayStation 4, there has been only one episode on the current generation console so far, which was not at all lucky: we are talking about SingStar: Ultimate Party, which in 2014 convinced Sony to put the franchise in the freezer waiting for better times. The opportunity to reopen the freezer has presented itself in recent months with the arrival of the PlayLink series on PlayStation 4: after all, karaoke is still one of the funniest tools to animate an evening with friends, and a title like SingStar Celebration could not certainly missing from the list of games dedicated to so-called casual gamers.

After purchasing the game, you can in fact download the app called SingStar Mic to your smartphone, pairing it with your PlayStation 4 to immediately start using your phone as a microphone. It is undoubtedly a successful idea, which in any case does not exclude the possibility of using other solutions such as the integrated microphone of the PlayStation Camera or those of the classic type combined with the old SingStars, both with and without the wire. If you choose to use SingStar Mic to sing, its operation is practically flawless not only for the primary use for which the app was born, but also for the quick creation of customized playlists that would take more time to be generated at the time. inside the game via controller. However, there is no risk of getting lost in the SingStar Celebration menus, which in just a few seconds allows you to launch yourself into one of the thirty songs included in the tracklist together with your vocal cords. The selection of songs draws a bit from all genres and vintages, placing U2 from their golden times alongside the more recent One Direction, putting them to the test with Adele and her Hello up to catapulting us to 1995 with Oasis and their unmistakable Wonderwall. Almost needless to say, the selected songs act as a springboard to the SingStore, the place to go to find your favorite song among the many offered by Sony: net of some special packages in the store, the price for a single song is equal to 1.39 euros. So estimate a little more to add to the 20.99 euros needed to take home the basic version of SingStar Celebration. Alone but above all with others While it's certainly not forbidden to sing your heart out, just like its predecessors, SingStar Celebration offers different ways to interact with other people. Each singing performance is accompanied by a score, which now seems to take greater account of the vocal notes struck during singing instead of considering only the noise emission. The evaluation obtained can be compared with those of your friends, keeping in mind the possibility of calling everyone together at your home to get busy in Party mode. Although it is a bit neutered compared to its heyday, this always remains a point of reference for karaoke-based home parties, indulging in medleys and other types of challenges to be played together for up to eight people. In the songs that include it, you can also give life to a duet, and then maybe put the video captured via PlaySta on the Internettion Camera. In the social component of SingStar Celebration there are videos that go from unashamedly out of tune to real improvised cover bands in the living room of the house, ending up appreciating everything.", "date": "2017-11-23", "grade": "7.0"}
