{"name": "Tomb Raider: Anniversary - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-anniversary-recensione_b.html", "text": "The adventure on the Wii The Wii version of TRA differs from the others due to an unprecedented control system, which seeks to make the most of the characteristics of the Wii-mote and Nunchuck. Once the adventure has begun (from the start screen it is also possible to access the usual ~Croft house~, where you can train in the various movements and take into account the objects collected), all this translates into solutions that in most cases really prove to be spot on: Lara moves using the analog stick, while the Wii Remote's pointer projects a cursor on the screen capable of moving the view (holding down the C button) or transforming into a crosshair for firearms (firing with the B trigger) . The A button is deputy to jump, an action that is really fundamental in the game, which is much more focused on exploration and solving puzzles than on combat. Unfortunately, it is precisely during clashes with enemies that the limits of visual management are discovered: it is absolutely necessary to hold down the Z button to ~lock~ on a target and remain facing in that direction, otherwise it will be impossible to understand even just what is happening as we try to avoid the attacks. The problem is that even using the ~lock-on~ you end up being hindered by the elements of the setting, but in this case we are dealing with situations that are not very frequent. The second limit concerns the assignment of the launch of the grappling hook to the shaking of the Nunchuck: having to launch the rope immediately after a jump, one realizes that this is not a winning idea and that a simple button could have done the same thing with less risk (sometimes failing a jump results in falling into a chasm). Apart from these inconveniences and the not excellent quality of the analog stick mounted on the Nunchuck, the control of the character is really good and there are some undoubtedly valid ideas (see the use of the flashlight by moving the Wii-mote). The hands of Lara Croft Among the peculiarities of the Wii version of Tomb Raider: Anniversary there is also the possibility of accessing minigames for activating devices. You will therefore have to move the Wii-mote on the screen as if it were a hand and move gears, dust bas-reliefs or rotate stones to gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas. The motion detection of the controllers is also called into action during some action sequences, in which you have to shake the Wii-mote and Nunchuck in certain ways for Lara to perform the correct movements to dodge attacks and get the better of her opponents. Finally, we must not forget a sort of bullet time that is activated by shaking the Nunchuck when we have a very close enemy who is about to hit us: Lara throws herself to the side while we continue to shoot. Technical realization Usually the technical analysis of a video game starts from the graphics. In the case of Tomb Raider: Anniversary it is instead a must to start from the sound, which can only be defined as ~majestic~: the music, but above all the effects, combine to create a truly exceptional atmosphere, which is best enjoyed by connecting the TV (or the Wii directly, if you have a cable with audio outputs) to a good stereo system. Together with the control system, TRA's audio contributes to a truly immersive gaming experience. The quality of the graphics is no less: Lara is really beautiful and moves convincingly, with smooth and well done animations, as well as a high level of detail. But the bulk of the work is done by the locations, which show huge spaces contrasted with narrow corridors, with a really high quality of textures, far beyond the normal standards to which Wii has accustomed us. Unfortunately, one cannot help but notice the very evident drops in the frame rate, due to the lack of optimization of a graphics engine which, in the absence of these problems, could have really amazed. The controls, entrusted to the usual Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination, respond very well to inputs and are quite precise. Comment If you love Tomb Raider and own a Wii, you can't miss this (new?) episode of the series. In reality, being relatively unfamiliar with the adventures of Lara Croft could even represent an advantage in approaching the title, given that the situations in which you will find yourself are more or less the same as always, with the fights playing a marginal role in front of the exploration and puzzle solving. Understanding which is the right way to find a new checkpoint can give great satisfaction, especially if you reach it after climbing walls and jumping to the limit. The Wii control system helps us in these phases, showing limits during fights but, in general, responsiveI do very well with the needs of the game. We are not dealing with a masterpiece or a completely new product, but Tomb Raider: Anniversary stands as a really good choice if you are looking for a bit of adventure and you are not afraid of having to solve puzzles to figure out which direction to take . Pros: Atmospheric sound Detailed graphics Effective control system... Cons: ...apart from a few cases Frequent drops in frame rate Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2007-12-14", "grade": null}
