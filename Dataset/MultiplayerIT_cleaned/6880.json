And so, after an early access that lasted longer than we could have expected, finally the final version of the creature of Brian Fargo and his inXile Entertainment is finally available on the market. The writer spent almost 50 hours in total with the game before drawing the sums necessary to write this review and it was absolutely not easy to reach a definitive judgment on a product that seems to be completely dedicated to the historical fans of the series while deliberately ignoring the most recent trends of the market. Divinity: Original Sin included. Wasteland 2 is in fact an extremely classic RPG, which draws heavily from its official predecessor, which in turn inspired the first two Fallouts, and tries to reproduce the gameplay of the time in practically every single aspect: on the other part is just what the backers asked the development team. Wasteland 2 is a pleasant return to the origins of the genre: beautiful but not for everyone Thus spake Vargas The title is set 15 years after the events narrated in the original chapter; the nuclear holocaust begins to become a rather distant memory and the Rangers have managed to restore a minimum of order in the Arizona wastelands. However, America, or what's left of it, is still far from being a peaceful and safe place given that mutated monsters, gangs of criminals and the ruthless and shady figures who inhabit the territory continue to dominate, reducing to iron and fire the few camps and massacring the population without protection. Our adventure begins with Snake Vargas, the leader of the Desert Rangers, about to promote us in the field to put us on the trail of the murderer of a historical member of the organization, who has just been buried in the barren soil of New Vegas. Obviously the collection of clues necessary to track down the outlaw is only a pretext to wander around the Western United States crossing not only Arizona but also California, intelligently represented by a devastated Los Angeles and in the hands of the most absurd psychopaths, until discovering a long story made up of numerous cliches, typical of the genre, but also of pleasant subplots. What impresses from the first minutes in which you become familiar with the game is the amount of written content that can be accessed. It is not just a question of missions and tasks to be carried out but between dialogues and thousands of descriptions for each single object present in the post-nuclear world, it is very easy to be taken aback and sometimes even bewildered by such a mass of texts to read. In this regard, it is a pity that the quests are probably the weakest point of a production that otherwise amazes with its vastness. Let it be clear that we are not faced with a real negative aspect but too often we find ourselves carrying out actions and following too approximate indications and even the narrative cues in these areas seem to be affected. The mission diary is never very clear and the game map often doesn't help by offering precise points of interest or by making the player understand adequately what the place to reach is and very often the objectives of the quests are generic, lacking in real impact and they force us to roam the environment killing yet another enemy only with the hope that he will drop the necessary item to the non-player character who offered us that mission. It almost seems to be faced with the most insipid quests of any second-tier MMO. And it's really a shame given that on many other occasions the narrative of Wasteland 2 places us in front of moral choices that even have repercussions on the situations encountered in subsequent moments, sometimes even altering the scenarios we find ourselves going through and the subsequent quests we can have access. All this dramatically stimulates replayability which, never as in these cases, will certainly make fans of the genre happy by offering real alternatives to how the game world presents itself in front of our characters. In short, the impression we had at various moments in history is that Brian Fargo's team wanted at all costs to offer a very vast game world in an attempt to offer many interactions with the result of making it appear too dispersive, sometimes even little blended. We know we're unpopular with this rating but probably pror in cases like these, a shorter but also more intense, condensed and refined story would certainly have benefited the entire gaming experience. Beyond the story there is more But let's move on to the actual gameplay after such a long introduction related to the plot and narrative. With a perfect adherence to the past of the series, Wasteland 2 forces us to start the game with a team of four different characters that we can create from scratch or select from a small list of pre-packaged figures. Never as in this game (or as in the role-playing games of the past), the heterogeneity among the members of our party is crucial to be able to face the most diverse situations in the best way. To identify our alter ego, in addition to the inevitable and usual statistics capable of determining strength, speed, charisma, coordination and so on, there is in fact an enormous amount of skills ranging from skills in the various types of weapons present in the game ( ten including melee weapons) to the most disparate active skills (from medicine, to deactivating alarms, to burglary, to the possibility of repairing toasters or manufacturing weapons) up to a swarm of passive skills that allow you to deal with better the adversities of the environment. Perception is one of these since it allows you to automatically detect any traps present in the environment, and we guarantee you that Wasteland 2 from this point of view is too ruthless with explosives placed almost everywhere often without a real logic other than that of make the player curse; or there is the Leadership which provides attack and defense bonuses to the characters who are in the vicinity of the leader or the Hiker skill which allows you to avoid or escape from random encounters which it is possible, unfortunately, to encounter during the movement phase in the map of the region. Yes, because Wasteland 2 has exactly that typical RPG structure of the past with an enormous series of different locations, connected to each other by a sort of ~overworld~ of the two regions of Arizona and California, where it is possible to move very quickly by consuming the water reserves of the team to reach the various areas where to carry out the quests, discover new locations and also find yourself entangled, alas, in the random raids of mutants and humanoids. Over time, building a team capable of doing a little bit of everything is crucial especially when we begin to have twenty or thirty hours of game behind us also because leveling up is less easy than one might imagine, the points to spend on skills are always very few and, even if in the course of the adventure we will be able to hire three more characters in our squadron, Wasteland 2 is one of those games that does not forgive. Not having a doctor in your ranks or having omitted some active skills because they are deemed useless can often force you to reload old saves when the situation begins to become too frustrating or even to start over to pursue other evolutionary paths. From this point of view, having participated in the various phases of early access which forced you to start over each time, certainly represented a considerable help for the writer and for veteran players. It is interesting to note that even the competence in dialogues is divided into several skills that allow the interlocutor to be persuaded on several levels; action that goes well with the narrative structure of the game that reaches its peak in the numerous (infinite?) chats that we can have with the countless NPCs scattered throughout the game world. In addition to choosing the various topics to guide the conversation, which will unlock as we deepen the question and answer, we can even try to manually write any topics of interest. A feature that is certainly nice but absolutely useless for the purposes of the plot. It is a pity that all this versatility, depth and sometimes freedom of action clashes violently with an aesthetic customization reduced to a minimum given that during the creation phase, our characters will have a ridiculous number of options available to choose from to be different from each other. A bullet is forever Obviously Wasteland 2 is not only history, character creation, quests and exploration but it is also, indeed above all, fighting. Like any good self-respecting RPG. In the work of inXile, these are turn-based in a mix that closely resembles the gameplay of XCom and that of the first Fallout (and of course its official prequel). Everything is based on action points: each character has a certain amount in turn depending on his stats, from anyactive bonuses and those retained from the previous round. Each activity consumes a certain number of them: from movements to reloading the weapon passing through the change of posture. Obviously, even the decision to fire the weapon consumes action points and in this case it is possible either to attempt a ~headshot~ by consuming a large quantity or, in the case of some paraphernalia, it is possible to change the rate of fire to perform bursts of bullets or unload a whole shotgun. Naturally by changing the number of action points consumed. It is also possible to leave the character on the defensive by having it automatically attempt to shoot if an enemy enters its line of fire. The order of turns between characters and enemies is also decided by the initiative statistics and of course can significantly alter the difficulty of the encounter. Furthermore, it is always possible to exploit the elements of the environment to use any covers (which can almost always be destroyed) and interrupt the lines of fire. Each of the elements described above influences the probability of hitting the opponent or of being hit by a bullet and, even if very often these probabilities seem to be more negative than indicated, it must be recognized that the system works very well: it is extremely tactical, reasoned , takes into account friendly fire, must be managed with great care in the light of the very scarce resources to heal oneself and the very small number of projectiles to which one has access and can give great satisfaction even if there is no doubt that the fights tend very quickly to become very repetitive and they are victims of certain deficiencies implicit in the system. First of all, Wasteland 2 seems to favor firearms over melee weapons: getting close to an enemy is a very long and dangerous work as no stealth mode is implemented and it is infinitely more comfortable and profitable to try to kill or deprive a large number of life points an opponent from the maximum possible distance, perhaps with a nice sniper rifle, even before starting the fight (which starts immediately after the first shot has been fired). In the same way, when weapons capable of doing area damage (grenades above all) begin to come into play, the fight becomes unbalanced making them practically essential for any battle of slightly above average difficulty. Furthermore, as written a little above, it seems that the possibility of missing the opponent or seeing one's weapons jamming is enormously higher than what is actually reported by the on-screen interface. It has happened to us on many occasions that, in cascade, three or four characters from our team find themselves with the weapon jammed one after the other, losing precious turns in the middle of the fight, when this probability should be less than 2%. If we really want to go nitpicking, we wouldn't mind having the possibility of hitting the enemy in different points, perhaps generating different passive penalties, when instead it is only possible to aim at the head in search of critical damage. The flavors of an ancient past Where inXile's work shows the most side is undoubtedly in the technical aspect: the most neglected of the entire production. With an intelligent decision, the boys of the team have in fact decided to evidently put aside the search for cutting-edge graphic solutions in an attempt to invest every single dollar raised by the Kickstarter campaign in the gameplay and in the content aspect of the game. For all these reasons Wasteland 2 is all too close to the past with very static environments, certainly varied and valid from an artistic point of view, also thanks to a careful use of the color palette, but which are also too sparse on some occasions. The characters, but especially the enemies, then have really poor animation sets and are made up of models that look a lot like each other and never manage to shine for originality. Even from an audio point of view, things are not much better: the game is dubbed in English only in some small parts, while the presence of Italian is noted for all the innumerable written texts. The translation is rather approximate but, as the team that is taking care of it has pointed out to us, it is still in the beta phase and will be corrected quickly with the next patches. Accompanying music is forgettable very quickly. However, we must point out that the work done by the development team on engine optimization and bug fixes is commendable: during our long test Wasteland 2 certainly crashed more times than expected.", "date": "2014-10-01", "grade": "8.0"}
