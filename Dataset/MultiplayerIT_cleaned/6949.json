Practically an assist provided by the major to independent titles or almost to be able to show himself in an unexpected empty showcase, before the inevitable return of the official Tiger. So here is that The Golf Club could play its cards seriously, arriving on the market with practically no competitors (apart from the semi-arcade Powerstar Golf) and occupying the niche of more classic golf simulations on its own. However, The Golf Club also proves to be a project driven by a genuine desire to bring something characteristic to the panorama, indeed rather limited, of the sportsmen of this discipline, and demonstrates this with its salient elements, i.e. the control system, the generous track editor and multiplayer sharing. Not being able to count on the original names and famous and expensive brands, The Golf Club leverages the initiative spirit of the players, putting an interesting creative tool in their hands and hoping in this way to cement a community of digital golfers capable of shaping the own gaming experiences, in a sort of golfing response to games like TrackMania, given due proportions in terms of potential audience. An interesting challenge, but successfully overcome? The momentum of HB Studios is commendable but the various flaws that afflict the general realization and which affect the usability of the game cannot be ignored, even if the perception of these can vary based on how willing one is to get caught up in the magic of virtual golf. One thing is certain: those who want a golf simulation on next-gen consoles currently have only one choice available, and fortunately it is a choice that has several positive sides, although also ample room for improvement. It really could have been much worse. Matter of touch The Golf Club throws us into the middle of the green fields with a truly old-fashioned simplicity and after a selection screen for the game mode we immediately find ourselves face to face with the club and the ball. By now accustomed to long and intrusive tutorials and ultra-explanatory interfaces, the fact of starting immediately simply with a short circuit and without the slightest explanation of what to actually do can leave you confused. You find yourself - think - even forced to consult the instructions to understand more precisely how to tackle the first swing, learn about the usefulness and functioning of the effects and additional shots and better orient yourself with the control system. It may seem paradoxical but especially on consoles it is in fact a thing of the past, which immediately puts this title in a particular light, rather positive for all those looking for a bit of detachment from scripts and tutorials. In short, there is practice to be able to obtain good results, and this starts right from the first tracks, because the control system is based entirely on the sensitivity of the player on the right stick (in addition of course to the application of the classic effect modifiers) without the aid of bars or reference levels. In the same way, the classic and explicit projections of the trajectories are also absent, eliminated in favor of a simple circle to indicate the area towards which the player is pointing, obviously net of wind and various disturbing elements. It is a question of understanding the rhythm and timing of the swing, as well as the effect applicable at the moment of the hit based on the trajectory traced by the stick as it moves back and forth, which requires a certain dedication and sensitivity because the movement at the moment of the hit becomes fundamental in every slightest variation. Something similar to what was also seen in Tiger Woods, but in this case much more sensitive and demanding, which shifts the general difficulty rate and the learning curve upwards. It is therefore not surprising if for beginners any tour can seem somewhat selective, it is simply a matter of becoming familiar with the control system and with the tools made available by the game, such as the different shots and options to select such as iron and effects to set. Tiger Woods gives way to The Golf Club: does the next-gen also reach golf courses? Golf minecraft The game modes do not deviate from the naked and raw experience of simple golf, with the possibility ofi tackle the holes individually, in itineraries or within tours and tournaments, all obviously without licenses and official references as well as a sort of ~career~ in the classic sense is missing, beyond the possibility of creating a character and keeping track of all his achievements and successes. A decidedly concise offer compared to what we are used to finding in triple A sportsmen of these terms but still sufficient to recreate the pure and simple golf experience, solo or multiplayer. The game world is also entirely interconnected, which allows you to play multiplayer by organizing matches or participating in ongoing sessions or to continuously confront other players displayed as ~ghosts~ on the playing field, simply as placeholders and trajectories around us. a choice also in this case simple from the point of view of technical realization but rather effective in enriching the sense of general challenge. However, the option that essentially characterizes the whole game is the powerful internal editor, called ~Greg Norman Course Designer~, which allows you to act on a large amount of variables and elements in order to create new holes and courses by acting more or less minutely on all aspects of the scenario. It starts from the selection of the setting among the five available (alpine, desert, coastal and rural) and then proceeds to a progressive characterization of the fields, through different degrees of customization. At the beginning it is a question of setting the quantity of main scenery elements (trees, water, reliefs) on the basis of percentage parameters, with the distribution of these which is calculated by the CPU, but once the layouts have been built, on a procedural basis, it is It is possible to go and modify each hole with a large number of options and additional elements, thus going to draw each course more or less precisely. The potential is clearly infinite, and it is probable that the most willing ~builders~ can go so far as to recreate real courses or build holes as strange or spectacular as possible. The results are then shared with the community, which can assign a score to each itinerary, in order to also create a qualitative selection from below as regards user creations. Xbox One goals The golf Club contains 24 unlockable achievements for a total of 1000 points. Given the nature of the game, all achievements are linked to particular performances to be achieved on the golf course, both in single sessions and cumulatively, across various matches. Many are obtained quite naturally if played continuously but several require real masterstrokes. Relaxation or exhaustion? The main problem with The Golf Club is probably the technical implementation, which highlights a lack of optimization both in terms of graphics and some structural aspects of the game. Each action, especially as regards navigation through the menus, is characterized by a perceptible input lag, which in certain cases becomes unnerving, especially within the complex editor, in which it is also necessary to resort to numerous options and sub- menus that further weigh on the situation. The procedural creation of the scenarios is certainly an expensive operation for the processor, but the relative simplicity of the graphics sector should have counterbalanced this heaviness in managing the menus. Certainly the sport in question lends itself to a cadenced and contemplative pace, but nervousness can often take over when the input lag becomes so systematic. On the other hand we find the graphic scaffolding of The Golf Club, another aspect that certainly characterizes it as a production that is not of the highest profile, probably going to place itself in the average of the latest golf productions for the previous generation of consoles, without obvious progress. Also in this case, however, the question of the different resolutions between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 emerged, but frankly this point seems to be the least of the technical problems afflicting the game, for which it can be said with certainty that HB Studios does not has really fully exploited the potential made available by the next-gen with the Unity engine. Furthermore, in the quick overviews there are evident problems that one would like to see by now outdated such as clipping and pop-up of polygonal elements frankly not justifiable by the graphic mass, given the relative simplicity of models and settings. The glance, however, remains pleasant and this is a positive thing in a rather static game, while in motion the graphics engine reveals its limits almostnt obvious, but which can be overlooked. The strongly positive element, however, and fundamental for the gameplay, is the management of the physics applied to the ball, which responds convincingly both in the aerial phases and on the ground, based on the different conformation of the terrain. From this point of view, the work done by the team appears excellent, with positive influences also in terms of gameplay.", "date": "2014-08-28", "grade": "6.8"}
