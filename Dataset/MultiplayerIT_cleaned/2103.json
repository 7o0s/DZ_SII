{"name": "Super Smash Bros. Melee", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-smash-bros-melee_a.html", "text": "Beat 'em up to what extent? The main feature in Super Smash Bros. Melee is to beat up the opponents on the screen as much as possible, but nevertheless forget about the various Virtua Fighters, Dead or Alive, Tekken and company. The first fundamental difference lies in the fact that, although the game is completely in 3D, the fights actually take place on 2 planes (vertical and horizontal) and the environments have a fundamental importance during the fights being almost completely interactive. Another big difference lies in the simplicity of the combat system, very intuitive compared to the more complex fighting games, but which makes it fearfully playable from the start, in fact, a few games are enough to immediately understand the fighting style of each character. Even the fights are totally original; the victory is not awarded to whoever knocks out the opponent, but whoever manages to throw the enemy out of the ring wins. How? Forget about the energy bars at the top of the screen which usually indicate the health of your character, in Super Smash Bros. Melee each player's energy is expressed as a percentage which, starting from 0, can well exceed 300%. These numbers indicate the percentage of ~hits~ taken and given during the match; the higher the figure, the easier it will be to throw the opponent or be thrown out of the playing area and therefore end the match following a sufficiently powerful blow. To make the clashes more spectacular, we take care of the interactive scenarios in constant movement and an infinite series of weapons and bonuses that are randomly provided during each game. In each of the numerous settings, there are a series of platforms that have a similar function to those of normal platformers, i.e. they can be crossed, used as a support and most of the time they are decisive for the assignment of victory, being almost always in motion . The commands As we said, the control system is quite simple and intuitive, but despite this, the moves available to us are really many and considering the use of an infinite series of power-ups, special weapons and various bonuses, which constantly rain from the heavens, one realizes the industrial quantity of attacks that we can carry out. The A key is assigned the main attack which varies according to the direction that we give with the analog stick, the B key is instead used for the special attack, which also varies according to the direction, much more powerful and choreographic but which requires also a greater waste of time for execution. X and Y are used to jump (the stick can also be used), L and R activate a block in the form of a barrier while the Z key is used for grappling. Obviously each character has a different set of more or less spectacular moves and special attacks. Mode Super Smash Bros. Melee is a title that brazenly begs to be played in multiplayer. The 4-player mode is probably one of the funniest and most playable of all existing games, an experience you absolutely must try and for which it is worth having the 4 controllers and finding 3 friends willing to spend several hours of healthy fun. Nonetheless, even in single player the fun is guaranteed by an almost infinite series of modes. Just to name one, I want to underline the adventure mode which is actually a cross between a platform and a fighting game useful above all to break the possible ~monotony~ (allow me this horrendous term) of the single player game. Still there are some subgames such as throwing the bag or knocking down targets scattered in a path that keep boredom at arm's length from Super Smash Bros. Melee. Playing alone, each type of mode, once completed, allows you to unlock bonuses such as secret stages, new characters, music and statuettes depicting all the protagonists of the game to be kept on the memory card and admired in total 3D, thanks to a special screen. Everything obviously guarantees a very high longevity, because before being able to unlock every secret and all the statuettes you will have to work hard. Having said this, however, it should be noted that the true spirit of the game is multiplayer and there is no doubt that the best way to have fun with SSBM is to play it in 4 people, in this way the title becomes practically infinite. Feast your eyes dLet's get over it right away, let's get over it and never talk about it again some seabeds aren't always beautiful and they slightly clash with the rest of the game. That said, I can't do anything but praise the work done by the developers (Hal Laboratory): first of all, the presence of the 60-50 Hz selector at startup should be noted. Graphically, Super Smash Bros. Melee is an excellent title; the characters are animated very well, made in an impeccable, sometimes even maniacal way. But given the frenzy of the game and because of the view which is very often far away to allow you to follow all the characters present in the play area, this aspect may escape you; so the developers had the brilliant idea of allowing the player to stop the game at any time (by pressing the start button) and to be able to zoom and rotate the camera to your liking on the chosen character so as to admire every little detail that makes it up. And it is here that you will notice the perfection and beauty with which the characters are built, made up of an enormous number of polygons. The textures covering the protagonists and their surroundings are top-notch, and the light/shadow and explosion effects are absolutely fantastic. The game runs constantly at 60 frames per second without accidentally dropping a single one. At any time, in any situation you find yourself in, even with the screen crammed with characters, special effects and so on and so forth, the graphics engine shows no sign of uncertainty. Feast your ears too Promoted with flying colors the sound department. All the classic music of the protagonists of the game are reproduced with great care, such as those of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Mario etc. In short, you will never get tired of listening to them and they represent an incredible gem for fans. The same goes for the sound effects: each character has its own voice made up of screams, little words and various noises and, while some are absolutely hilarious, others are perfect reproductions of the sounds of old Nintendo games. The noises of explosions, bonuses and various weapons are also excellent. Nothing to add and nothing better to be desired in this respect. Let's end it here After this incredible sweetheart that I allowed myself, it is almost useless to add that Super Smash Bros. Melee is a title to have at all costs; it's definitely one of the funniest games I've ever played in recent years. Although it is a game strongly devoted to multiplayer and practically infinite in this mode, even those who are used to often playing alone should treat themselves to a copy of the game. Not only because it is very long to finish in single player and will keep you busy for a long time, but above all because it would be a real shame not to have it at home when you are in the company of some friends. Surely, in the long run, you might get tired of playing alone. Super Smash Bros. Melee is a gem for fans who are unlikely to give up: the whole Nintendo world is re-proposed through its most charismatic characters re-proposed in the best graphics (Link, an example above all). Surely those who have never owned a Nintendo console may not fully appreciate it. This is exactly why I don't feel like recommending it to everyone. However, those who want to have fun and experience something new should rush to buy it, because it should be noted that Super Smash Bros. Melee is decidedly different from modern fighting games... indeed... but who said it's a fighting game!? Pros: Awesome Multiplayer Awesome Multiplayer Great sound Great graphics Lots of modes Great characters Cons: Not everyone might like it Some underwhelming backdrops Better in multiplayer Super Smash Bros. Melee In a world of video games where the fighting game genre is now dominated by muscular characters, martial arts experts, ~abundant~ women and an exasperated search for technique and tactics, Nintendo will take care of bringing a breath of fresh air and fun unparalleled with an atypical fighting game which, in a small mini-DVD, contains years of history of the great N and all the characters that made it famous. Mario, Luigi, Link, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Yoshi, Fox McCloud, Samus are in fact just some of the many heroes of the most famous Nintendo titles, all present together passionately to beat each other up in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Obviously, the possibility of being able to see all these characters enclosed in oneunique game, represents a kind of dream that materializes for all the ~Nintendomaniacs~, but don't be fooled, because SSBM is absolutely a game for everyone and it's so much fun that it wouldn't even be right to let them enjoy it alone!", "date": "2002-06-07", "grade": null}
