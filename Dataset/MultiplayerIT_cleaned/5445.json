Also in the case of Uncharted: The Legacy of Thieves Collection it is an absolute debut, given that the adventures of Nathan Drake and his friends had never before gone so far as to explore the territory of the Windows platform. wanted to take a little more time and start with the Nathan Drake Collection, so as to offer PC users the complete saga instead of what basically stands as its epilogue; but in purely qualitative terms we are in any case faced with a very relevant event, given the goodness of this collection both in terms of narration and in terms of technique and gameplay. After the uncertainties related to the conversion of Marvel's Spider-Man, curated by Nixxes, we were really curious to understand how the guys at Iron Galaxy Studios had treated the splendid original work of Naughty Dog. In two words? Very good. But if you want the details, continue reading our review of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection for PC. History Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, Elena and Nathan in front of the PlayStation Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is the remastered collection of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, respectively the final adventure of Nathan Drake released in 2016 and the independent expansion starring Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross arrived the following year. These are in fact the latest productions related to this excellent franchise, awaiting any new chapters which, however, have not yet been announced by Sony. So if as a PC user this will be your first contact with the series, we suggest you watch some videos summary on the history of Uncharted before starting the fourth episode, in which we find a married Nathan who practically retired from his career as an explorer and adventurer after the many expeditions completed also together with his wife Elena. But something forces him to get back on track: the return of Sam, the brother that the protagonist believed he had lost fifteen years earlier. After contracting a large debt with a drug lord, Sam absolutely must get hold of the legendary treasure of the pirate Henry Avery, so the help of Nate and of course his friend Sully will prove to be essential; also because on the trail of the important discovery there are the ruthless millionaire Rafe Adler and the skilled Nadine Ross, head of a group of mercenaries who will not fail to give us a hard time during the adventure. a Thief truly lacks nothing: Neil Druckmann and Josh Scherr have been able to outline the characters perfectly and set up a narrative system that combines spectacularity and feelings in an excellent way, supported, moreover, by an extraordinary quality Italian dubbing, which further enhances all the elements at play. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, the unusual couple formed by Nadine Ross and Chloe Frazer As for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the plot touches different strings, but is equally engaging and interesting. In this case the protagonists are Chloe Frazer, an adventuress with a stormy past as well as a former flame of Nathan Drake, and Nadine Ross herself from A Thief's End, who work together to find the precious Ganesh's Fang. Hidden somewhere in the Western Ghats, the The artifact is also in the crosshairs of Asav, the ruthless leader of the rebel forces who wants to take possession of the legendary object because it gives him absolute authority in front of the people, allowing him to start a revolt that leads him to control the region. United by an unusual friendship, Chloe and Nadine will have to deal with the troops in the pay of Asav, but also with their respective pasts. Gameplay Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, one of the first climbs of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End From a structural point of view, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is still a jewel today, capable of mixing a cinematic narrative and exciting game sequences that leverage four elements: climbing, exploration, fighting and puzzle sections. The balance between these different aspects is not always perfect, but the resulting experience is extraordinarily enjoyable and well refined, from the flashback-style tutorial with all its narrative value to the exploration phases aboard an off-road vehicle in Madagascar. in all cases it is the level design that plays a leading role, and the fact that the ambientions are splendid represents a not insignificant extra in view of our wandering in search of the right passage, the platform to reach, the handhold to hold on to to push us towards the next battle, towards the next enigma or the next, magnificent sequence of interlude. The novelty of the grappling hook at this juncture is absolutely welcome, as it further enriches the gameplay, creating a series of new and fun situations. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves compilation, the open map scenario in Madagascar The challenge is not exaggerated, far from it: the experience is always enjoyable and relaxing, the checkpoints are practically instantaneous and therefore you can concentrate on what the game actually has to offer, rather than getting wrapped up because you are unable to solve a puzzle, you can't find the right way to continue or a firefight with Adler's mercenaries seems too complicated to overcome it unscathed. Despite this, the arsenal is confirmed to be varied and interesting including pistols, machine guns, shotguns and grenades. The Lost Legacy tries to experiment with something different, including new maneuvers (see swinging with the grappling hook), extra weapons to recover in the scenarios and a greater amount of fighting. Its nature of expansion ends up compressing the various elements and the result is a denser experience, which manages to avoid proposing the same solutions too often and in the end it is confirmed as very solid and well written. The PC version Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, Chloe and Nadine aboard the off-road vehicle After the port of Marvel's Spider-Man made by Nixxes, which actually gave us some headaches, we were really curious to see Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves at work on PC, in this case as part of a conversion curated by Iron Galaxy Studios. It is true, the number of adjustments available is not as large as in the case of the video game dedicated to Wall Climbing, but in general we are dealing with a well-optimized product, which manages to be very consistent and offers excellent scalability. The great protagonists are upscaling technologies, which include DLSS 2.0, FSR 2.0, and a traditional mold percentage scaler. It is interesting to note how the system indicates the actual rendering resolution for each different preset: considering a 2160p output, choosing ~quality~ the game runs at real 1440p, which drops to 1253p on ~balanced~, 1080p on ~performance~ and 720p on ~ultra performance~. However, with an RTX 3070 we managed to use the standard scaler at 70%, thus obtaining an effective 1512p and a stable 60 fps at maximum visual quality. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection, the main graphics options screen The advanced settings screen allows you to select a general preset or modify individual items relating to textures, model quality, anisotropic filtering, shadows, reflections and ambient occlusion, with antialiasing mysteriously absent. An indicator provides the impact on video memory for any choice, while an internal benchmark has not been inserted but there is a frame counter to understand how the game behaves. Ultrawide monitors are also supported and the accessibility options are numerous. As for the quality of the technical and artistic sector of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Uncharted: The Hidden Legacy, there's not much to say: yes these are two visually extraordinary titles, in which nothing is left to chance; capable of involving with incredibly spectacular sequences and astounding thanks to the details of a thousand wonderful and evocative panoramas.", "date": "2022-10-18", "grade": "9.0"}
