{"name": "Giulia Passione: Amiche &amp; Segreti - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/giulia-passione-amiche-amp-segreti-recensione.html", "text": "We are dealing with one of the titles belonging to the well-known ~Giulia Passione~ series, which has brought to the market for a young and very young audience a line that seeks to wink at the interests, needs and lifestyle of the infantile and pre-adolescent population to which it is addressed. With greater or lesser success, depending on the case. This time we find ourselves analyzing a ~non-game~, a risky and undoubtedly interesting experiment with a very specific target: girls and teenagers. Giulia Passione: Amiche & Segreti is a real simulator of a secret diary, that object which for the younger ones is considered almost sacred and takes on two different roles in the life of those ages: that of secret and privileged confidant, a bulletin board on which express all one's emotions, the key events, the expressive imagination and that of a privileged means of communication with the friends of the heart, those to whom we confide our most intimate thoughts and desires. And it is just like a diary that presents itself to us, entering on the two screens vertically, forcing us to a booklet view more suitable than ever. To be able to use it we will have to enter a secret code which in all ways resembles the padlock of traditional diaries and which will serve as an access password. At this point we have to create our profile, one of the most important things, considering the fact that the Wi-Fi functions that will allow us to communicate with our friends and make comparisons between profiles for a series of tests such as calculating affinity. Infinite customization: a limit to creativity? The cards are complete with all the main options, including nickname, name, date of birth, zodiac sign. But also the summary of relationships with our friends, the time dedicated to them, affinities, hobbies and a list of favorite singers, actors, movies and more. Obviously the avatar cannot be missing, to be personalized with clothing, hairstyles and accessories. Customization is in fact one of the main features offered by this software, thanks to the considerable availability of options of all kinds, without neglecting the decorations for the paper on which to write virtually, doodles, doodles and what a little girl is supposed to use to fill pages of your diary. It is about the beauty of more than 500 elements that are made available to us to customize our alter egos and the fact of having the possibility to change the color of each single decorative element makes the choice practically infinite and almost impossible to find a single element of the own diary that is identical to that of a friend. However, it is the same diary, which is logically the focal point of Amiche & Segreti, a diary that in addition to being so highly customizable allows us to manage our pages in multiple ways . In fact, everything we write can be encrypted, accessible at different levels of security, readable only by certain contacts and, in essence, truly secret only for those we decide it is. There are 150 pages available on which to write our thoughts and secrets, which can be saved and kept as long as we want. In addition to these pages, however, we will also have 240 special pages available. These additional pages essentially serve to complete our profile, expressing thoughts, opinions or considerations of any kind that are pertinent to what distinguishes us or to the daily mood we have chosen for the current day. There is also an agenda, to surround everything, to make the diary more similar to a large organizer. To all this goodness of customization, additional graphic elements, options and expressive possibilities, however, there are two major limits, in our opinion opinion: one is that deriving from the impossibility of keeping our diary over time. Anyone who was a kid once will know how sacred this object is and how beautiful it is to reopen its pages after ten, twenty, thirty years, to rediscover who we were when we were ~little~. This of course is frustrated by the very nature of the software. Indeed, once all the available pages have been filled, how can we not lose our precious thoughts and feelings expressed? The second problem derives from the creative limit: however enormous the availability of customization options, all the designs or added elements are not were designed by us. Having an electronic diary naturally does not mean not being able to have a traditional one, the choice remains, as it should be, with the girls themselves. Comment With Giulia Passione: Amiche & Segreti we are faced with what can be considered a realio trend experiment, thanks also to the attention that has been dedicated to its development and to the participation in the project of the psychiatrist Paolo Crepet and to his supervision of the 48 psycho-aptitude tests that we find inside. Ultimately, a title studied with great care, but which leaves one perplexity: are we sure that today's girls have transferred so much of the habits of the girls of the time to digital that they prefer a virtual diary to a real one? The customization options offered are really many, but can they replace the ~real~ customization, the one that expresses the individual's creativity and is so dear to those ages? Can we renounce the preservation, over time, of what we have been able to impress on our lives between the pages of the diary? These questions can only be answered by the end users: today's little girls. Pros A real secret diary Great level of customization Multiple mini-games, quizzes and interactive options Cons Limitation to creativity May not keep up with ~paper~ Interview Giulia Passion presentsFriends & Secrets Dario Migliavacca answers Multiplayer.it: What was the greatest difficulty in developing Giulia Passione.Amiche e Segreti? Dario Migliavacca: The greatest difficulty was telling the members of the development team. Seriously, after two chapters of Spliner's Cell this title represented a challenge that has accompanied us in the last year and a half. From a technical point of view, the difficulties were more related to the integration of the very deep psychological aspect and the creation of a free game scheme in which the players could express themselves freely. M.it: How is the situation of game developing in Italy? DM: I can't answer due to situations outside Ubisoft. As far as we are concerned, in any case dependent on a structured reality like that of Ubisoft, we have often been engaged in the development of ideas and solutions coming from other studios. Giulia passionAmiche e Segreti has given us the opportunity to act autonomously and independently. From a purely technical point of view, we opted for a solution that expressed a decidedly high level of quality. M.it: How long did the testing phase of the title last? D.M.: The testing phase was very complex due to the infinite possibilities that the title offers. Indicatively, this phase lasted many months and involved a team of about forty people. In fact, the game has an extremely unpredictable trend that adapts and evolves differently for each player.M.it: Friends and secrets, therefore, is it detached from the previous titles in the series both at a technical level and at a content level? D.M.: Yes, this is the first chapter that distances itself from the previous episodes because it goes deeper and takes one more step towards a level of play capable of fully satisfying even the occasional player. We have focused a lot on quality and I think we have achieved our goal. Remote socialization Perhaps one of the most important features of Amiche & Segreti lies in the communication possibilities it offers: through DS sharing we can in fact play a series of mini-games with our friends, take group quizzes and, in general, entertain ourselves in various forms, all linked to your own profile and that of your friends. In Local Wireless we can exchange objects and avatars with a friend of ours, as well as send him pages from our diary. Two-player voice chat via Wi-Fi is also possible, a probably fundamental option that allows you to communicate remotely with our best friend. Even the graphics, which are very reminiscent of the colorful style of the 80s, are quite pleasant and it fits really well into the software which, in general, is very usable. There is no shortage of tests, options such as the ~surprise cookie~, a real fortune cookie to be opened to find the message of the day, which are very useful for making everything more varied and making you want to come back, day after day, to find out the news of the case.", "date": "2008-10-15", "grade": null}
