{"name": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12.html", "text": "The game Let's immediately see, as usual, what are the main menu options that we are faced with when starting the game: Career Mode  It is the main game mode that allows you to unlock the arenas (in fact, at the start of the game we can only use the first available). After selecting the skater and the arena to play in, we can finally leave. We immediately notice that the objectives to accumulate Pro Points, which we need precisely as mentioned to unlock other things or to improve our skater's skills, compared to the previous episode of the game, are not assigned to us ~all and immediately~ but by running around the arena we will find characters (some really extravagant) who will assign us various missions to complete to grab the hard-earned Pro Point. There are 16 ~missions~ scattered throughout the playing area for each level, some simpler and others obviously less so: to give you some examples, you will find other skaters who will ask you to beat their score in a given maximum time or you will find people who will ask you to collect the letters C-O-M-B-O with a single trick and then other ones, especially depending on the game arena in which you will be engaged (in Alcatraz in a mission you will have to try to escape an ex-con who was lost). Single Session  Here instead, after selecting skaters and arena, you will have to try to make your best score in 2 minutes of maximum time. Free Skate  It's just you and the arena: no missions to accomplish, no time limit. Create-A-Skater  One of the most popular game modes from the last episode, where it was introduced. Create your character in your image and likeness and use it in the other game modes making it a real pro. Build Park  Even on Xbox for the first time you will be able to really build your own ~amusement park~: you can insert ramps, railings or pipes on which to grind, insert empty swimming pools, buses, bleachers or other things with which to make more complex and spectacular tricks. Arenas, characters and surroundings For the sake of information, I would like to tell you which are the 14 characters that you can use (and improve) in the game: Tony Hawk (obviously), Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero (complete with electric guitar), Harem Campbell, Rune Slifberg, Eric Hoston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrei Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas; to these must obviously be added another 5 slots available to insert the characters you created (for example, I also include Lambo... hehehe... but it's scarce doh!). Returning to serious matters, I will now list the 9 available arenas (to which a tenth must be added, i.e. the one you may have created): College, San Francisco, Alcatraz, Kona, Shipyard, London, Zoo, Carnival, Chicago. Technical Phase In THPS4 we note, as already mentioned above, a clear improvement compared to its predecessor. The levels are incredibly vast and you can interact with practically anything (although this last one is actually nothing new). The textures of the objects have been perfected and any hint of aliasing on the screen has totally disappeared; they are just a bit annoying and some bitmaps of objects such as tree leaves clash with the rest, especially when you get too close. In my opinion, the animations of the skaters during the evolutions have also been improved and among other things it should be noted that the game does not show the slightest sign of slowdown even when playing in split screen. A final mention should be made regarding the sound side: it should be noted that the music featured in THPS4 is particularly spot on (among the various artists stand out AC/DC, the Offspring, the Sex Pistols, Iron Maiden, Public Enemy and many others still for a total of 35 tracks) but if in any case they are not to your liking you can use the soundtracks saved on the hard disk of your Xbox as usual. Concluding Finally, I would like to say with peace of mind that the Neversoft programmers have once again hit the mark with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, improving the game, making it even more fun and vast, which certainly at least increases its overall longevity . In short, the title is certainly a must for all lovers of the genre, especially for those who had fun with THPS3, and also for those who have never tried theseries: fun will be guaranteed in any case! Introduction It was this spring that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 arrived on Xbox, a must for fans of the genre and not, but unfortunately a game that had limited development time and which was practically nothing more than a simple conversion of the PS2 version, albeit with some graphic improvements and small innovations. And it is precisely today, 21 November 2002, that the new, revised and even more improved version arrives on the shelves of our shops, which will be capable of ensuring several hours of play even for those who do not like this sporting discipline.", "date": "2002-11-20", "grade": null}
