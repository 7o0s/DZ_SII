In recent weeks, the developers have repeatedly insisted on the ~spectacularity~ of Crysis on current generation consoles, due to some particularly significant improvements in the graphic and technical sector. Our entire play session took place on PlayStation 4 Pro - so on the maximum Sony hardware currently has to offer - in anticipation of the PS5 launch. Between ups and downs, between remarkable scenarios and clearly overlooked details, the game world of Nomad seemed different from that of thirteen years ago, but not as convincing as it could have been. Technical compartment Needless to go around it, those who are potentially interested in re-purchasing Crysis Remastered on PlayStation Pro need to know the technical sector of the title. We are talking about a production that over the years has become the benchmark for PCs, a way like any other to demonstrate the power of the various devices: ~does Crysis run on it?~ it is now a catchphrase. There is no shortage of possibilities, you just need to know what to activate and where. Before starting your game on Crysis Remastered you should necessarily go to the graphics settings available on the console, and from there choose what you need. The title offers the mode dedicated to ray tracing (which we will talk about), the performance mode (1080p with unlocked frame rate, which however we did not seem to reach 60 fps too often), and the quality mode (1800p and 30fps). If you aim for ~fluidity~ our advice is obviously to aim for the performance mode; also consider that frame rate drops are not entirely uncommon, especially during fights against many enemies. Conversely, if those extra 720 pixels make a difference to you, you'll select the quality mode. Finally, a 4K television also allows HDR to be enabled, regardless of the graphic settings indicated above; Basically HDR will always be disabled, so you will have to act manually. Ray tracing On PC Crysis Remastered supports hardware and software ray tracing, while on PlayStation Pro only the second of the two is available; the fact that it is linked to the Crytek graphics engine naturally allows it to also work on current generation consoles, net of the necessary compromises. Simplifying the right, it is possible to define ray tracing as a more advanced rendering technique: the aim is to render the lighting of the environments, the rays of light, the reflections, the shadow areas in a realistic way. These are minor details, which overall make the game environment much more believable and visually satisfying. The real problem of Crysis Remastered is that this technology (beyond 60 or 30 fps) is applied to what basically remains - the name says - a remastered; and which therefore can benefit up to a certain point from similar improvements on an aged structure. Many Crysis textures, by way of example, would have needed far more interventions at the base. Let me be clear: by enabling ray tracing, or even simply the quality mode, the graphics of Crysis Remastered are very satisfying, especially in environments illuminated by sunlight; the general glance is satisfactory. Overall we are talking about a title that compared to the PlayStation 3 version has been significantly improved in certain aspects, much less in others. The problems begin when you realize (and it also happened on Nintendo Switch) that the surfaces of the boulders on the beach have something wrong (up to the real graphic glitches), when the sand appears almost grainy, when the bushes seem to come from weight from the last generation of consoles, with mere interventions to improve its resolution. It is not clear why Crytek has not fully invested in this operation: it would have been appropriate at this point, perhaps, to think directly about a remake. Playstation 4 trophies Crysis Remastered on PlayStation 4 brings with it a glittering Platinum Trophy: to get it the most difficult tasks to perform will be to complete the game on the highest difficulty level, and clean up the game map from all side missions. Nothing too difficult, especially if you master FPS perfectly. Gameplay If the graphic and technical improvements of Crysis Remastered do not fully convince due to the compromises mentioned above, for the gameplay the matter is different: here the production has really remained anchored to thelast generation. If Crysis amused you 13 years ago, chances are it still does; but don't take it for granted. Many aspects have aged badly (if not very badly), especially the artificial intelligence of the enemies: then it was at the forefront, now it does not seem that the North Koreans have enlisted the most brilliant minds of the population. Even the destructibility of environments and objects, once remarkable, is no longer a big deal, nor has it been revised; and so the weapon aiming system and more generally gunplay. Crysis Remastered is like those old people in authority who are invited to a lunch, and who are dressed up: everyone respects them and compliments them on their new clothes, but the good old days are long gone. You might also consider the comparison with modern times unfair: turning a blind eye, Crysis Remastered is still perfectly enjoyable as an FPS in a sufficiently large and freely explorable game world. Traveling the length and breadth of the island, acquiring new weapons and modifying attachments, taking control of vehicles and crashing into enemies is still as fun as it was then. It's just that, out of the blue, a detail out of place or a mechanic aged worse than the others will remind you that you are playing something from another era.", "date": "2020-09-20", "grade": "7.0"}
