{"name": "Airblade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/airblade.html", "text": "Mom, will you buy me a flying skate? Ethan, protagonist of Airblade, sets off in search of his friend Oscar, who disappeared following his dismissal by GCP Corporation. The only trace available to Ethan is an anti-gravity skateboard (airboard), stolen from the GCP by Oscar, an extraordinary means of transport ready to also become a fearsome weapon if necessary. Unfortunately, the GCP wants at all costs to repossess the airboard that our hero unknowingly took possession of. Marty McFly's imitator, will Ethan be able to defeat the powerful enemy and embrace his friend again? We talk about skate boards and immediately our thoughts go to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater who has been the undisputed ruler of the genre for some time now. Although this time we have to perform on an unconventional table, the almost kinship link of Airblade with Activision's masterpiece is clear. Compared to Tony Hawk, however, we have tried to introduce some elements capable of making it not only a game based on the usual tricks but also an adventure game with a plot to develop. A city made for skaters And so the story mode is entrusted with the non-secondary task of giving a certain depth to the game and at the same time unlocking levels that can be used with the other modes. The adventure is in fact divided into various levels (not too many to tell the truth) that we will have to face in sequence, reaching the objectives that each of these will require within the established time limit. As a result you will find yourself having to deal with your table of the evil GCP ~gorillas~, trying to disable spy vehicles, satellite dishes, searchlights and numerous other sub-targets. The airboard can be used both to perform amazing stunts and to hit enemies and objects with considerable violence. Taking advantage of railings, poles and ramps you will be able to perform real circus acts which will not have the only task of making the action more spectacular but also of increasing your score and above all of providing you with a considerable push force (turbo) which will allow you to move at a much higher speed. The interaction with the settings is decidedly good and almost every element on the screen can acquire a different utility depending on the situation. In fact, you can cling to cars and get towed, break windows, run over tables, chairs, boxes and anything else you happen to find on your way. The tricks and the stress... Despite a certain repetitiveness of the actions, Airblade turns out to be quite fun to play thanks to a certain ease of execution of the tricks. Airboard control shouldn't cause you big problems even if in some situations it proves to be rather imprecise. Unfortunately there are sore points in Airblade starting with the excessive difficulty of some levels and the frustration caused by the systematic failure of some objectives. After repeating the same level 5, 10 or even more times, you will almost spontaneously wonder if the resulting dose of stress will not force you to get rid of the game sooner or later. Added to this is the fact that the story mode proves to be far too short to complete even if the challenge will subsequently consist of trying to improve one's performance in each of the levels in order to unlock additional characters and options. The multiplayer mode is very interesting, really well done and which allows 2 players to challenge each other at the same time in a stunt competition, or to organize a mini-tournament between 8 human players who in this case will perform to the bitter end. Italian is better As had already happened in another recent Sony Europe title (This is Football 2002) the strong point of Airblade is still the technical realization. Extremely detailed settings frame our missions, presenting a remarkable clean image and an almost total lack of the youthful defects of the PlayStation 2. The reconstruction of entire city districts is undoubtedly convincing thanks both to a considerable variety in the construction of the buildings and to the presence of surrounding elements (garbage bins, chairs, benches...) which only increase the realism of the scenes. The rendering of the main character is also good, also equipped with very well done and always very spectacular animations. The sound, for its part, performs its task quite effectively. While it is more than appreciable that it completes itlocalization in Italian and therefore also the dubbing of the voices, the music that accompanies the game phases are instead rather monotonous although appropriate to the type of game. Airblade or Tony Hawk? In conclusion I believe that Airblade is a good title which, despite some undoubted qualities, can be considered only a tasty appetizer in view of the much more awaited Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. The excellent graphics and the spectacularity of the tricks are unfortunately not enough to make of the Sony game an unmissable title that can probably only be considered as such by maniacs of the genre. Greater attention to some elements of the gameplay and a longer main mode would probably have had different effects but for these I think we will have to wait for the sequel, if there ever will be... Pros: Fun and spectacular Great graphics All in Italian Cons: Sometimes frustrating Story mode too short Some difficulty in control Back to... the past It was the year 1985 when Michael J. Fox led to the success Back to the Future (Back to the Future), the first successful chapter of the trilogy directed by the excellent Robert Zemeckis. In the film, Marty McFly (Fox) travels through time with his scientist friend Doc (played by Christopher Lloyd) and travels back to the year 1955 where he meets his parents and Doc himself, 30 years his junior. Four years later, in one of the most spectacular scenes of ~Back to the Future: Part Two~, Marty, in a hypothetical futuristic city of 2015, tries to escape some thugs aboard a prodigious flying skateboard. After a series of incredible stunts performed with the modern ~board~, McFly manages to get rid of his pursuers and get to safety. This scene has undoubtedly become a source of inspiration for Criterion Studios, a development team in the orbit of Sony Europe, which dusts off the idea of modern skateboarding in the new Airblade, an action game due out in the next few days.", "date": "2001-10-31", "grade": null}
