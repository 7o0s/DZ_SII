{"name": "Hitman Sniper: The Shadows", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-sniper-the-shadows-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Hitman Sniper: The Shadows catapults us back into the stealth atmospheres of the series developed by IO Interactive, proposing in this case a mobile spin-off in which, however, the historic protagonist of the franchise, Agent 47, is not present. In his place we find six new assassins eager to replace him: Knight, expert in headshots; Stone, with its proximity bombs; Kolzak, capable of poisoning targets; Espelho, with his penchant for fire; Soji, equipped with acid bullets; and finally Kiya, a veteran capable of striking his victims like lightning... literally. Gameplay Hitman Sniper: The Shadows, Knight prepares to strike The gameplay of Hitman Sniper: The Shadows is inspired by the Sniper Assassin mode, introduced with Hitman 2 (review). We are therefore faced with a precision shooter like there are many on iOS and Android, but with an extra gear represented by the stealth component, which substantially influences our strategies and stands as an essential element for success in various missions. In fact, we will not be asked simply to eliminate a series of targets within different scenarios, but to do it by disguising the killing from time to time and making it pass for an accident. An electrical panel that gives off sparks? An ember that spews flames all around? A chandelier falling? An exploding fire extinguisher? In each location we will find dozens of possible solutions to carry on our task without setting off alarms. Clearly the artificial intelligence of the enemies is in rose water, let's say so: as per the script for any stealth experience, the guards and passers-by will not connect these continuous fatalities to the presence of a sniper who is targeting them from a distance, unless they are faced with the body of a man with a bullet hole in his head. The formula is intriguing and creates many fun situations, in which it is possible to eliminate several enemies at the same time or to carry out actions of great elegance, such as a shot while the target is moving. But when something goes wrong, the mission immediately takes a turn for the worse and you have to close it quickly before the guards start shooting at us, determining the game over. Hitman Sniper: The Shadows, the tactical view highlights the targets The touch control system allows you to move the pointer by touching the central part of the screen, after activating the viewfinder mode, possibly increase the zoom, use a sensor that highlights the objectives in turn, reload the weapon as needed and take advantage of special abilities of each of the six available characters, which we will be able to unlock by putting our wallet or recovering schemes and virtual currency. In this sense, unfortunately, the free-to-play model makes itself felt too soon, to be precise during the third of the six currently available chapters. In fact, the system will ask us for a certain level of power to be able to proceed, but to obtain it we will have to try our hand at the competitive mode (an asynchronous race in which two users challenge each other to see who has the highest score) or replay the missions already completed, but with severe limitations on the rewards obtainable. Graphics and sound Hitman Sniper: The Shadows, the competitive mode with the score counter The Hitman series has always been characterized by an extremely clean and detailed style, capable of giving great depth to the scenarios, and Hitman Sniper: The Shadows in its small way tries to do the same, delivering us locations full of details, interactive elements and moving characters . In short, the graphics of the game can be viewed with pleasure although the variety of panoramas is not extraordinary. The sound is decidedly less brilliant, which on the music front does nothing but propose ~ambient~ songs unable to stand out, as well as effects that are only functional to the action: pity, we would have expected at least a strong central theme for such a well-known brand.", "date": "2022-03-06", "grade": "7.8"}
