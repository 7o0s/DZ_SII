{"name": "Tenchu: Return from Darkness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tenchu-return-from-darkness.html", "text": "Tenchu vs Ninja Gaiden, or the technical sector Tenchu: Return from Darkness is basically a Steath game, albeit with strong action and combat elements. Looking at its first incarnation on Sony's rival console, it's a definite step forward in several directions. First of all in the general cleaning of the image, then in the absence of aliasing and finally a general quality of the improved textures. Which is no small thing, you will remember that Tenchu certainly didn't make the PlayStation2 hardware shine, while now it can boast of a video sector that is at least respectable and enjoyable, even if far from the glories of some of the latest productions such as Ninja Gaiden, to which a thought, playing Tenchu today, always goes. Regardless of the overall look of the game, the designers did a really good job of recreating the Japanese late 1600s settings in every detail. Houses, temples, rooms, objects, people and environments are believable, curated and inspired. Inspiration that also originates from a good audio sector that includes slightly retro sounds and melodies, but of sure effect. There is no shortage of typical Japanese noises such as the Koto, the beats of Bamboo and the Buddhist bells which help to create a certain feeling between the historical setting and the players. By its very nature as a Stealth game, Tenchu must offer the player a fair amount of freedom of movement within the game environment. The level design, for this reason, is well done, giving the joypad holder an adequate sensation of freedom of action. Certainly an important factor, but which, due to some non-light defects in the game, which we will now talk about, undermines its potential and makes the value of the game partially unexpressed. Tenchu vs MGS, or the Gameplay Having ascertained the fact that we are faced with a visually only discreet title, let's analyze the actual game, pad in hand. And here comes the pain. Impossible not to start by talking about the view framing system. During the movement of the character, the camera does its duty as in any self-respecting 3D action game, unfortunately during the stealth sections we are faced with situations that defining frustrating is an understatement. The view often remains blocked in the vertical axis preventing the player from understanding where exactly it could end up and what is around it. The programmers have well thought of inserting, by pressing the white button, the possibility of using the room in a free way. Too bad they forgot to activate it even when the character is not standing still. In fact, the possibility of rotating it is only thought of by contemplating the complete immobility of the character. Absurd. Continuing to play, one realizes that the only thing that has been implemented is the graphics. Everything else remains almost unchanged compared to the monolithic counterpart, defects included. The enemy AI is at an all-time low, where a game like Pac-Man would have a lot to teach Tenchu. If on the one hand it is true that the enemies, at each of our missteps, will identify us very easily, it is equally true that they will forget us as soon as we have turned the corner of the building, demonstrating a not indifferent stupidity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, a good level design and excellent freedom of movement are therefore of little use if whoever is supposed to find and fight us does not follow us and does not ~track~ us wherever we would go. The tension is lost, the suspense that a worthy Stealth game should have is lost. Furthermore, the enemy samurai do not even demonstrate that they have fully learned the art of Bushido and swordsmanship, as their attacks against us consist of simple attacks-backs-advances-attacks and so on ad infinitum, without a whit of tactics or team spirit in multiple attacks. Online is better We dedicate this last chapter of the Tenchu: Return from Darkness review to its peculiarities in the version tested for Xbox, that is, let's talk about its strengths. First of all, the inclusion of a very welcome online mode via Xbox Live does not escape! which allows you to play in cooperative mode with another person. Factor already fun in itself regardless of the game, it is even more so when it comes to Tenchu, an action-stealth title where cooperation is extremely satisfying and innovative. If playing online is not to your liking but you have some trusted friends by your side, it is now possible to challenge each other in a juicy Fight mode, which effectively transforms Tenchu into a 3D fighting game. Although the combat system is initially designed to adapt to an action game, Tenchu's versus mode is still funand something more that never hurts. These last features have obviously been added to give greater appeal to a product that at this moment is going to collide on the market with Blockbusters such as Ninja Gaiden, from which it comes out defeated from a graphic point of view, and the new Splinter Cell, from which he comes out defeated from the Stealth point of view. Comment Even with a cursory reading of this review, you will have got a very bad idea of Tenchu. The title under examination is not without flaws, it is undeniable, but it is equally true that its strengths are others, regardless of the exclusive contents of the Xbox version, which are very appreciable anyway. The beauty of Tenchu lies first of all in the beautiful feudal Japan settings that inspired memorable Anime and films, and for this reason they made us love stories of Samurai and Ninja, secondly, in addition to the charm of being able to impersonate one of these characters, there it's definitely the narrative style that Tenchu plays with a lot. There are three selectable characters, and using each of them not only will the story change, but we should never repeat the same schemes and the same levels, on the contrary the story will build itself little by little having to play it with all the characters and will be reworked at back by the player, who will find himself recomposing many pieces of a puzzle that will only be completely clear at the end. A way of telling a certainly original video game that is somewhat reminiscent of the one used for the recent Forbidden Siren. In conclusion, where Tenchu cannot compete with better titles than it in terms of playability and technical sector, the pleasant story and the narration mode make it a unique game from this point of view. Here is found, summing up, the ~why~ of Tenchu: Return from Darkness. Pros: Storytelling Style Evocative Atmosphere Co-op via Xbox Live! Cons: Whimsical cameras AI enemies laughable aesthetic sector not in step with the times A Stealth game that comes from afar The amount of porting, both from other consoles and PC, needn't scare Xbox users. In almost all occasions, the version of the large green X is certainly improved from a graphic point of view, but also leveled and filed in gameplay. This is also somewhat the case, albeit in part, of Tenchu: Return from Darkness, which is none other than that Tenchu released on the market almost a year ago for PlayStation2. This is a long-lived and original saga, born at the time of Psx during which it clashed with the direct rival in the Stealth game genre, Metal Gear Solid. Not modern and contemporary settings, not a purely military and western story, but Tenchu stood out above all because the narrative took place in ancient feudal Japan in the midst of wars between Clan, Samurai, Ronin and Ninja. What better opportunity to take full advantage of the cunning, espionage and stealth motif than to be able to impersonate a Ninja in the midst of their most brilliant historical era? Tenchu offers you exactly that.", "date": "2004-06-25", "grade": null}
