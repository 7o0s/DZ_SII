{"name": "Tomb Raider: Legend", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-legend_b.html", "text": "Heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, the story behind Tomb Raider sees a young and cunning explorer, Lara Croft, engaged in a series of adventures from which she emerges richer and stronger each time. Equipped with a respectable window sill as well as exceptional athletic abilities, the protagonist finds herself facing forgotten and threatening civilizations, traps of all kinds, ferocious beasts and endless chasms. Given the enormous success of the episodes developed for the various consoles over the years, Lara could not avoid appearing on the screen of our mobile phones as well. In this sense, Tomb Raider: Legend is only the latest product available for our terminals, characterized by polygonal graphics that make it rather selective in terms of hardware requests. The plot of the game revolves around the finding of the mythical sword Excalibur, which somehow has to do with Lara Croft's mother who has been missing for years. The stern explorer, with the help of her assistants, must therefore penetrate inside some buildings and then travel to the most remote corners of the planet, in a fight without quarter with an organization that wants the legendary relic for itself. All this takes place through two different phases: a platform section, characterized by the presence of jumps and points to climb, and a purely ~action~, in which you have to eliminate the enemies that appear on the screen as they appear. In the first case, we will have to navigate ledges, scaffolding, rocks and more, making jumps when necessary and holding on to ledges to continue. Very often we will find ourselves faced with holds that collapse after a few moments, and which therefore force us to make a move to move on to the next hold. As for the ~action~ sections, they are characterized by a view very similar to that of the Tomb Raider video games for consoles, therefore in the third person, with Lara who can move in the four directions allowed by the joystick of the mobile phone. When an enemy shows up, a crosshair automatically appears that changes color from yellow to red, representing the effectiveness of the blow we'll deliver depending on the moment. Very often stalling until the target becomes more vulnerable proves to be a risky affair, since the opponents will not sit idly by and, on the contrary, will immediately start shooting at us. Avoiding bullets is not the easiest thing in Tomb Raider: Legend: our character can move quickly and perform somersaults, but the response times to commands are not immediate and the procedure is often cumbersome. Much better to find a shelter, from which to lean out only to shoot... at least until they decide to throw a grenade at it, of course. As could be expected from such a product, the technical realization of the game is excellent, with smooth flowing polygonal graphics and good use of colours. Lara's animation is of a good standard, and the locations boast a certain level of detail. Unfortunately, the same thing cannot be said of the enemies, characterized by very simple and angular models, not up to the rest. To move from one section to another you need to wait for the loading times, which however never last for more than a few seconds. The sound sector tries, within limits, to keep up with the graphics: if our mobile phone allows it, we can listen to music and effects at the same time. Both are well made, and have independent volume adjustment. The control system is surprisingly simple, given the three-dimensional scope: by acting on the joystick it is possible to move the character, who can perform somersaults and slides thanks to the double pressure of one of the directions. The 5 key is used to fire, with the weapon automatically reloading once it runs out of bullets. Unfortunately, the response to inputs is not always instantaneous. PRO High level polygonal graphics Simple and immediate control system Good number of internships AGAINST Linear and repetitive action Response to commands sometimes not immediate For Symbian only", "date": "2008-04-18", "grade": "S.V."}
