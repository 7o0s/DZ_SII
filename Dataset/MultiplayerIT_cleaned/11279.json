{"name": "Midnight Play! Pack - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-play-pack-recensione.html", "text": "Block Breaker Deluxe Let's start with this Arkanoid clone because it is the ~highlight~ of the collection: fast, lively and peppery at the right point. The title offers a total of 50 levels divided into trances of 10 and your aim is obviously to overcome them all. Why? Because at the beginning a very provocative girl invites you to become the coolest in the neighborhood, and to do so you just have to beat all the dupes cooler than you. In addition to control of the platform via touch, the game offers a wide range of power ups, some already seen many times, others more original such as the yo-yo, which will allow you to destroy even the toughest bricks. You won't have to worry only about this, in fact in each level you will be given a goal such as ~do not lose a single life~, ~collect all the bonuses~, and so on, which will accumulate your score. Each level also hides a gift, which you'll have to collect when it unexpectedly starts falling from the brick you've just destroyed. It is not enough. Power-ups can be upgraded, and once you unlock bonus levels that give you access to upgrades, you'll find out just how beneficial they are. Block Breaker Deluxe is the most active and entertaining game of the lot, but that doesn't mean that others won't be able to entertain you in their own way. Midnight Hold'em Poker It's a Texas-style poker game, no more, no less. There are three variations of Hold'em, namely Classic, Omaha, and Omaha Hi Low, and you can play them in different modes including quick play and tournament, both single and multiplayer (requires as many cartridges as players). The game table and the players are represented in 3D and dubbed in Italian, even if the dubbers probably weren't at all, and the result is unintentionally comical. At first only tables of four will be unlocked so tournaments will see a turnover of players until first place is decreed. By winning tournaments you will access bigger tables for more classic games. The AI isn't the most elaborate, a lot of times, at least in the lower levels, just shoot high to make all players who don't have a safe hand fold. For the rest if you like poker you will have ways and opportunities to spend some time there. Midnight Play! Pack is available for Nintendo DS. Midnight Pool It is a 3D simulation of billiards where you can play 8 ball in the UK and US variants and 9 ball. You can play in arcade mode and in story mode where you will travel around the United States of America in search of challengers. The shot is made by moving the cue using the touch screen while you can also help yourself with the keys to take the measurements. Effects and shots to blow up the bowl are also available, subtleties that you can use in the challenges that your opponents will submit to you, where generally you will have to pocket a ball protected by a wall of other balls. In short, a bit ~Mr. 15 balls~. The simulation is perhaps a little too permissive but if you want to increase the challenge, just remove the indicator that suggests the trajectory of the ball. Apart from a somewhat hesitant 3D engine, there is nothing else relevant to report. Midnight bowling The Bowling game in Midnight Play Pack is not much different from the one seen in 42 Timeless Classics. The only difference is that after making the shot you can adjust the effect of the ball to correct any errors. The launch is directed via Touch Screen and with a stretch on the track you can decide both direction and speed. In story mode you can proceed with your career, unlock costumes and characters, or you can play multiplayer, even here with the multi-cartridge (even a single DS would have been enough). The matches, however, flow away one shot after another without the player paying due attention to either the game or the shot in particular. Platinum Solitaire What's better than a nice collection of solitaire games? Here you will find 6 in all, among the best known and played on PC and mobile phones. In addition to the classic Solitaire, that of Windows to understand us, there is also Free Cell, Spider, Pyramid, Golf and Yukon. In casino mode you can play at 6 casino tables that will be unlocked gradually, each with their own favorite game that will guarantee better winnings. Before the game you can also bet on how many cards you will be able to save, and in case you will win or lose the pot. As some would say: ~That's all folks~, after all it is a solitaire ... what did you want lightsabers? Comment Midnight Play Pak is a nice, thoughtfully crafted collection of games. If you want to spend some quiet moments, if you are looking for fast fun but also suitable for longer uses, or are you interested in some of the gameshi included in the package you can consider buying the entire game. Don't worry if you don't know the rules of the games, within the software there are tutorials and all the rules you need. The heaviest absence is that of online gaming, which would have allowed the title to shine in another light and us to be able to challenge players from all over the world in games of Texas or billiards. In the absence of multiplayer (since the game doesn't even allow game sharing on local Wi-Fi) the only stimulus that drives the player is just the desire to spend time without too much effort. The story modes are little more than a pretext and all the attention of the product is reserved for the games included, so that the player looking for something else will find very little. Pro Block Breaker Deluxe Fairly built 5 games in 1 Cons Low to medium challenge No incentive to continue Midnight Play Pack needs to be clarified, it's a collection of games, not mini-games. The Nintendo DS cartridge contains 5 titles of different technical workmanship and completeness, which overall make up a more than discreet collection. It should also be added that what you will find in the cartridge is not original material, it is in fact the conversions of some titles already released for mobile phones, and that the adaptation work has been carried out with due attention so much so that the result does not show signs of its genesis . Both in terms of graphics and commands, the game does not present particular false notes, and the best satisfactions come precisely in the control system via Touch Screen. There isn't much to do, mostly dragging and dropping, but the whole interface and controls run smoothly. Midnight Play! Pack offers 5 very different titles, immediately selectable, and they are: Midnight Bowling, Midnight Pool, Midnight Hold'em Poker, Platinum Solitaire, and Block Breaker Deluxe. Once a game has been selected there will be no link with the others (other than a reference to the initial menu), and this is the only sign that betrays the collecting nature of Midnight Play! Pack. Each game has its own profile, options, scores, career mode and graphic style. We present them to you one by one.", "date": "2008-07-29", "grade": null}
