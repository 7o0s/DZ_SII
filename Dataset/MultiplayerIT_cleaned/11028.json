{"name": "Call of Duty: World at War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-world-at-war-recensione.html", "text": "As usual, the plot unfolds along two parallel lines: we will thus play the role of Miller, an American soldier who escaped from Japanese captivity shortly before his execution, and Petrenko, a Soviet soldier engaged in Stalingrad to face the German offensive. Unfortunately, we must note that in the absence of a cohesive narrative plot, the player's identification is very limited: the transition from one front to another is very ~forced~, and is not supported by an adequate narrative frame. The inevitable historical films that precede the various missions are in fact very disappointing, and only partially help to frame the events that will soon be experienced firsthand. Never sayBanzai!!! In World at War there is the usual obsessive attention to war details: thanks also to the reconstructions of the veterans consulted by Activision, we will be faced with guerrilla techniques very close to those actually used just over sixty years ago. This consultancy work is especially tangible in the Pacific campaign, in which the Imperial Japanese army will become the protagonist of sudden ambushes and suicidal melee attacks with the bayonet. In similar situations, the tension is palpable, and the emotional involvement rises, thanks also to a much more pronounced crudeness than in the past: violent torture, flapping limbs and authentic rivers of blood are the order of the day, and give World at War the goryest historical FPS scepter ever. The level of ~gratuity malice~ is further exacerbated by the very rare narrative crossroads granted to the player; for example, at the end of the Russian campaign we are faced with a small group of unarmed Nazis ready to surrender. It is possible to decide whether to spare their lives, or to drill them without the slightest delay. Team that wins, should still be improved Pad in hand, the feeling you breathe is the same as always. Your deeds are accompanied by great pathos, and find, in even a few novelties, a welcome breath of fresh air. The most important innovation is represented by the introduction of the flamethrower, a weapon that radically changes the way of dealing with enemies. Its unexpected firepower, combined with a level design that promotes its use, make the game sessions in which you will have the opportunity to equip it in your arsenal very fun. Arsenal which obviously includes a large number of weapons, taken from all four armies, and reproduced with great fidelity. The rotation envisaged by the developers (for each mission you will always have different armaments) helps in the practice of almost all of the weapons available, even if you will inevitably end up preferring a limited rate of fire, rather than the versatility of the machine guns. Unfortunately, all that glitters is not gold: all the limits that have always undermined the series are still present, suggesting that Activision has no intention of distorting the soul of the saga. Therefore, we continue to have the feeling of being guided by a sort of autopilot: the missions in fact have a single resolution track, and force the player to achieve very little variety of objectives. The repetitiveness is fortunately interspersed with some rare moments of exaltation: in particular, we appreciated the ~sniping~ mission of Stalingrad, and the unprecedented air-naval battle off the coast of Okinawa, in which on board an aircraft full of machine guns we first sunk impressive Japanese boats, then shot down the Japanese fighter piloted by the famous suicide bombers. Other historical defects, such as the infinite respawn of enemies until the next checkpoint is reached, are problems that in 2008 are difficult to tolerate, and greatly ruin an otherwise much more engaging gaming experience. All this without forgetting the amount of suspicious deaths you will encounter, especially at the more advanced levels of difficulty, and a very underdeveloped AI of the companions. The war moves to Silent Hill By completing the campaign, you will unlock a nice option called Nazi Zombies. This mode, which can be tackled in the company of three friends, will see you busy keeping away from a ruined building hordes of living-dead ready to dine on your guts. By killing them, or by repairing the barricades on the windows, you will earn points, useful not only for buying ever more devastating weapons, but also for unlocking otherwise inaccessible areas of the house. Very similar in concept to the ~Horde~ mode of Gears of War 2, Nazi Zombies is a pleasant diversion from the much more reasoned gameplay of the remaining multiplayer modesplayer. It's World War II! The multiplayer sector is, as always, the flagship of the production. First of all, there is the awaited introduction of a cooperative mode, which allows up to 4 players to tackle the main campaign. The exoskeleton on which the competitive part is based is instead the same as the majestic Call of Duty 4. Once again we start with a limited number of weapons and perks available: only with experience is it possible to earn more armor piercing, and abilities more inclined to your style of play. Obviously, all the techniques present in the last chapter make their return, such as martyrdom and the UAV jammer, which are accompanied by some unpublished introductions, among which the aforementioned flamethrower stands out. Once landed on one of the thirteen maps available, one immediately realizes how there is a sort of return to the past: the huge dimensions of some arenas, combined with the presence of a large number of tunnels and escape routes, offer a gameplay much more thoughtful than the frenzy of the fourth chapter. It is perhaps for this reason that the developers have introduced the presence of tanks in four maps, useful for fueling that sense of devastation otherwise difficult to recognize. The bonuses that can be won after five and seven kills in a series are very interesting; if the artillery attack is comparable to the aerial bombardment of Call of Duty 4, much more original is the deployment of lethal wolfhounds which, even more insidious than the helicopter, tear apart a large number of enemies. It's World War II! The modes on which you will compete are the most diverse, and able to satisfy the tastes of all players: Deatmatch: queen mode of any self-respecting FPS, it is present both in teams and in a ~rambesque~ all against all. War: is one of the novelties of this fifth chapter. To win, you will need to capture certain strategic points marked on the map, and keep control of them for as long as possible. Headquarters: an area appears on the map to be conquered in the shortest possible time. The team that conquers the headquarters will no longer be able to take advantage of further lives; once destroyed by the opposing team, or maintained until the end of 60 seconds, the headquarters is moved to another area of the map. Domination: 3 flags appear on the map: the team that manages to keep them for the longest wins. Sabotage: in the center of the map there is a bomb: to win you must seize it, and trigger it in the enemy base. Capture the Flag: the second new mode: the goal is to steal the flag from the enemy base, and make sure that yours remains firmly in place. Search and Destroy: it was the real revelation of Call of Duty 4, here presented without particular variations. There is one team that attacks, and one that defends two positions. To win you must either achieve your goal, or exterminate the opposing team. In this mode, the player has only one life left. Deathmatch, War and Search and Destroy can also be tackled in Veteran mode, which heightens the degree of realism, eliminating the information on the screen, and limiting the shots necessary to send you to the other world to the minimum. Unfortunately, the great variety proposed is not supported by an adequate netcode. In our sessions we have in fact recognized a very annoying lag, very little visible, but tremendously tangible, especially in hand-to-hand clashes. Furthermore, it leaves us dumbfounded to note that the bugs already identified in the Xbox 360 Beta have not been fixed. The most serious of all, is the possibility of ~breaking through~ the terrain of the map, and lurking, without the possibility of being hit, under one's enemies. The respawn is also often problematic: in fact, it happens too frequently that after a few moments from the rebirth, the enemy is behind you, leading you to violent curses that certainly will not make your neighbors happy. The hope, however not at all remote, is that a patch will soon be released that can remedy all these problems. Technical compartment Technically speaking, World at War proposes an almost unchanged version of the graphics engine of the last chapter. The polygonal models are thus very solid and full of details, well supported by realistic and varied animations. However, it would be reasonable to expect greater interaction with the surrounding environment, and more accurate fire physics; the flames, in fact, do not spread reliably, having the same effect whether a shrub, a piece of wood or a corpse burns. However, the general visual impact is of the first order, and above all, the fluidity with which the framerate handles even the most agitated situations. Technical compartment Another strong point of the title is the audio sector: the soundtrack is among the best ever, and will drag the player throughout the course of the adventure, while the sound effects stand at the usual levels of excellence, both as regards environmental noises, than those of the various armaments. Last but not least, the English version we tested even featured two exceptional voice actors: Gary Oldman for the Russian countryside and Kiefer Sutherland for the American one. Comment World at War is, in a nutshell, yet another reinterpretation of the Call of Duty brand, with its many advantages, but also with increasingly annoying flaws. If it is true that the reproduction of the conflict is always real, it is undeniable that the saga needs a sharp shift towards greater depth that can make the (few) hours useful for achieving the objective more intense. A sort of step backwards compared to the last chapter was also recognized: if Call of Duty 4 had been able to dare, not only for the renewed setting, but also for some new gameplay choices, World at War instead showed itself to be simple conservative , not presenting any significant innovations. However, it remains a highly recommended title not only for fans of the saga, but also for all those who are looking for an intense multiplayer experience. Pro The Flamethrower! Very complete multiplayer mode It's Call of Duty, with its strengths ... Cons ... but also its historical defects, such as excessive linearity Few new features Single-player too short and poorly narrated Call of Duty: World at War is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
