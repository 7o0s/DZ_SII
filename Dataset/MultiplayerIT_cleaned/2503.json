{"name": "The Sims 4: Fenomeni Paranormali", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-4-fenomeni-paranormali-recensione.html", "text": "September 2021 will mark the seventh year of life for The Sims 4 and the Maxis home simulation opens 2021 with a new Stuff Pack entitled Paranormal Phenomena, released on Origin, Steam, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on January 26th; after the Star Wars Game Pack and the substantial Expansion Pack dedicated to Monte Komorebi, the arrival of a Stuff Pack was foreseeable, which however appears to be extremely anomalous. In fact, usually the Stuff Packs are precisely fillers that add objects and elements of the CaS (Create a Sim. ~Stuff~ in Italian can be translated from English as ~things / stuff~). Paranormal Phenomena, on the other hand, stands out for adding some new game dynamics, favoring them over furnishings and clothes. Let's see together in detail what it is about in our review of The Sims 4: Paranormal Phenomena. Marie Laveau, is that you? As could already be seen from the trailer, Paranormal Phenomena is entirely dedicated to the occult and the supernatural: ghosts, possessed objects, out-of-body manifestations and much more will enrich our gaming experience. As we said at the beginning, we are faced with a decidedly anomalous Stuff Pack, so much so that the quantity of objects that we will find in the Build and Buy mode is extremely limited: we are talking about no more than 30 objects, an upholstery, a parquet and a handful of clothes and hairstyles. And this is a great pity, not because this creates an imbalance in the content quantity/price ratio of the expansion (which we remember for the Stuff Packs is 9.99) but because of the influence and artistic inspiration of Paranormal Phenomena, so fascinating that we want to absolutely want more. If a clearly Gothic style was used for Vampires, while many objects with a medieval flavor had been inserted for the Kingdom of Magic, both styles that do not go very well with contemporary homes and lifestyles, that of Paranormal Phenomena is an ancient but suitable for every home. To clarify: the basic living room that you find in the ready-made rooms in the Build and buy section could be a New Orleans living room from the early 1900s but by combining objects with an antique flavor with more modern decorations, such as plants in bowls of glass or shabby chic lanterns to hang from the ceiling, the result is elegant and full of character. Together with a few other available expansions, Paranormal Phenomena is certainly a Stuff Pack that stands out in terms of style but, as we said, the big problem is that there are few objects. The stylistic choice undoubtedly plays its part by creating a decidedly interesting atmosphere within the expansion, but how exactly do these paranormal phenomena manifest themselves? In order for your Sims to live this creepy experience, you must first move the family into a ~haunted house~ residential lot: here it is important to clarify that the haunted house is not a part of the house but a type of lot, the which means that it has its own specific purpose and, therefore, you will not be able to create haunted places that are not houses, no apartments, small houses or public places. The Sims 4: Paranormal Phenomenon: A paranormal encounter with a ghost At first glance, this seemed like a big problem, but after trying the expansion for a few hours, we also formulated a theory that justifies this choice. Paranormal phenomena greatly influence our Sims and the related game mechanics now have a particular functioning; it is legitimate to think, but we would like to clarify that it is our assumption that the choice of the intended use of the lot as a haunted house prevents the problematic interference of the other game dynamics within the paranormal phenomena. In short, a somewhat cunning way by the developers to separate and manage the novelties of this expansion without creating interference with others. Not that this is actually a big deal, in fact if your Sims are going to live in a haunted house they will have very little time to do anything else because managing a haunted house is pretty much a full time job. At all times, especially at night, you will find yourself having to solve some problem: eliminate possessed objects (such as creepy dolls, which will appear out of nowhere in your house), pulverize hand-shaped crystals that emerge from the underground, clean puddles of slime and erase bizarre occult symbols branded on the floor: All this will increase the level of spiritual serenity of your home, a modifier that regulates the manifestation of paranormal phenomena: the less the house is serene, the more these will be present within the walls of the house. Another essential thing to do is refresh the spiritu energywings of the house using the sance table: there our Sims will be able to develop and improve their Medium skills, which will allow them not only to cleanse the spiritual energy of the house but also to contact the spirits of the underworld and learn to draw with chalk occult symbols in each location. Needless to say, numerous spirits will visit us in our haunted house; our host of the paranormal world will be the ghost of Claude Ren Duplantier Guindry, a well-known occult investigator and second-professional seducer. This ghost will introduce us to the main mechanics of the game, explaining everything we have illustrated so far. The Medium skill has 5 levels and at each level, as usual, our Sims will learn to do something different: once they reach level three they will be able to summon Ossilda, a historical character from the Sims saga who also returns in Phenomena Paranormal. Paranormal investigators The Sims 4: Paranormal Phenomenon: A sance For the uninitiated, Ossilda (in English Bonehilda) is a skeleton dressed as a sexy maid who will clean your house, take out the trash, fix broken faucets and try to seduce any well-disposed man in the house. But that rascal Ossilda will not be the only presence to visit us: there will also be other ghosts, more similar to little Poltergeists, more or less mischievous with whom you will have to try to forge a relationship so that they don't torment the tenants of the house, giving them small objects crafts and exchanging a few chats. At level five, therefore at the maximum of the Medium skill, you can ask Guindry to become paranormal investigators like him by unlocking the profession of the same name in the freelancer section. You can also buy the rewards shop license... and speaking of rewards, Paranormal Phenomena will introduce two very expensive ones in terms of points, the aforementioned paranormal investigator license at a cost of 3000 points and Brave at a cost of 8000; Thanks to the latter, Sims with this trait don't scare so easily. By reading the description of the award, brave Sims recover their composure faster and are indifferent to the presence of supernatural beings such as ghosts and skeletons. In fact, the update patch for this expansion adds the terrified emotion, a sudden emotional trait that is strongly enhanced by this expansion and which will make everything much more complicated since terrified Sims are not very inclined to collaborate after having a good scare ... and if you play in a haunted house this could happen often. Of course, you don't need a ghost to scare your Sim, a sudden event or the sound of thunder will make them uncomfortable. The two rewards are particularly expensive but it is also true that more points can be obtained by choosing to face the experience in Heroic mode. The Sims 4: Paranormal Phenomenon: to each Sim his own ghost To activate it, it is necessary to place the ~Helping Hand~ object in the house at a cost of 80 Simoleons, the description of the decoration reads: ~it has the ability to slightly alter the rules of a haunted house. It is able to complicate the situation or to ensure that a certain ghost does not appear at night. These are completely optional rules and can be deactivated if the player changes his mind~. In fact, the most demanding paranormal phenomena manifest themselves during the night hours and every time the Sims arrive at the beginning of the new day without the occurrence of nefarious events, you will earn points that can be used in the prize shop; by activating Heroic mode many more will accumulate but obviously the ghosts will become more annoying and in general the haunted house will be very uncooperative. The only but important criticality highlighted by trying this new Stuff Pack is the constant impression that the developers have made a mistake in cutting the expansion. To be a Stuff Pack, as we said at the beginning, Paranormal Phenomena has many extra gameplay dynamics and fewer various objects and accessories, an expansion with a very self-sufficient nature, and this is obviously a good thing for those who decide to buy it at full price. On the other hand, however, there is a strong feeling that the good ideas present in Paranormal Phenomena needed much more space to be developed appropriately: the Medium skill is certainly interesting, for example, but in addition to having a sensible use almost exclusively at 'interior of a haunted house, with a little effort can be brought to the maximum level by the most experienced players in an hour of play.A missed opportunity, as we said at the beginning, for the splendid inspiration where the boho style would have deserved many more objects, upholstery, floors, clothing and so on. Also because the theme of the paranormal is something that not only has always belonged to The Sims but many fans of the game really like it.", "date": "2021-02-19", "grade": "7.5"}
