{"name": "Call of Champions", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/157042-call-of-champions-campioni-si-nasce.html", "text": "If you have a minimum of experience with multiplayer online battle arena, for friends MOBA, you will know that it is a genre with great tactical depth, both in terms of the mechanisms that characterize the gameplay, exclusively competitive, and in terms of learning the skills of the various characters that make up the roster. To win matches, simply having a close-knit team is not enough: it must also be well balanced, made up of users who are familiar with their own avatars and are therefore able to make the most of their skills, also and above all with a view to the ~growth~ that happens in every single game. In recent years there have been several MOBAs on mobile devices, and the reason is obvious: the touch control system goes perfectly with real-time strategy; therefore we are talking about a vein with enormous potential, especially if played on a tablet. Despite the excellent results achieved by some productions, what no one has done so far is to ~disassemble~ certain characteristic elements of the genre to adapt the experience to a portable context, and this is precisely the bet of Call of Champions, the new title developed from Spacetime Studios. By catapulting us into short-lived three-on-three matches, just five minutes, the game effectively eliminates the ~growth~ factor and even the traditional minions, immediately making the specials of each character available to us. In short, everything and immediately, apart from the champions: for them, playing for free, you have to respect a strict rotation or put your hand in your wallet. Call of Champions plays the immediacy card to offer a different MOBA experience than usual Call to arms Once Call of Champions is installed, it is not possible to try the versus mode immediately, but you must first have some experience with the bots and assimilate the game mechanics, however rather simple given the ~slimming cure~ carried out by the guys from Spacetime Studios. The map is small and the objectives are always the same, that is, you have to destroy the enemy towers until you reach their base, but the development of the action is different from other MOBAs. In the first place, as mentioned, there are no minions: their barrier function with respect to the attack of the towers is performed by ~spheres~ that we can push on a track so that they take the shots for us while we take care of damaging the structures , hoping that the enemy team is busy doing something else in the meantime. There are basically two lanes, an upper and a lower lane, but a teleport function to the base is missing, eliminated due to the limited distances and short times for respawning. The lack of perks, coins and an in-game shop imply that the characters are immediately ~enhanced~, ergo you simply need to learn how their moves work to become competitive, and perhaps pay attention to the best attack sequences to be able to deal massive damage and stay alive. Unfortunately, communication within the teams is lacking, also because it would not have been possible to implement it, given the characteristics of the experience, but on the technical front a good job has been done, in particular as regards the design of some champions, which is quite original. What leaves us perplexed is the combat system, a little too slippery and imprecise, at least on the iPhone (we imagine that on the iPad the situation could be better thanks to the larger screen), as well as the already mentioned cuts to the gameplay, which reveal the limits of a production designed probably only for novices of the MOBA genre. We must also add that in terms of monetization, the game perhaps dares a little too much, setting - as previously mentioned - the definitive unlocking of the characters at rather high prices.", "date": "2015-10-03", "grade": "7.0"}
