{"name": "Evil Dead: Regeneration", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-dead-regeneration.html", "text": "My name is Ash. Hardware department. The asylum shakes, cries of terror are heard and Ash understands that something is not right. So he begins to wander around the building and realizes that it is invaded by dozens of undead that are anything but friendly. Armed initially with a simple pistol and only his hands (indeed, only his left hand...), he makes his way among menacing creatures until he finds his equipment: the faithful ~arm~ chainsaw and a double-barreled shotgun. He single-handedly exterminates all the zombies in the asylum, then hears a familiar sound... The evanescent face of Professor Knowby, discoverer of the Necronomicon as well as victim of its spells, appears before him to warn him: Reinhard wants to use the Necronomicon to organize an invasion of the dead. Invasion that can only begin with the sacrifice of a beautiful girl... To close the gates opened by the book, Ash will have to carry little Sam with him: a dwarf half alive and half dead, that Dr. Reinhard has thus transformed with his own experiments. Practically immortal (you can throw him everywhere and watch him fall apart), Sam knows the formulas to recite to close the gates and acts, in practice, as a ~container~ when you need to transport a evil soul from one place to another The jokes between the two characters are wasted, with Sam who never stops talking nonsense and Ash who threatens him in a different way every time. Everything is recited by the voices of Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother), in an exceptional way but unfortunately not subtitled in Italian: those who do not speak English will inevitably lose something. When facing an enemy, you can defeat him using a whole series of combos and then finish him off with a real ~fatality~. Give me some sugar, baby. Evil Dead: Regeneration is in all respects a scrolling fighting game, whose structure is varied by the possibility of controlling Sam in some situations and by the need to activate switches to access the following areas. If the first expedient is put into practice in the more traditional way (in this case Ash momentarily ~possesses~ Sam's body, using a special hot spot), the second turns out to be quite original: you have to feed three souls to a tentacled monster evil, therefore the souls in question are found and Sam is used as a container for them, with the obligation, however, to defend him from enemy attacks until he returns to the presence of the monster. The rest is simple: you kick the dwarf's backside and feed it to the guardian, who emits a pleased burp and allows you to enter his mouth to access the next stage. On leaving, however, you will realize that you have just taken a tour of the digestive system of the creature, complete with an exit hole... The structure of the stages is linear and it is difficult to get lost. Every now and then you come across a power-up (increases your life bar, shooting range, etc.) and you find new weapons, which Ash can use in pairs and independently or in combination: in his left hand a firearm (pistol, shotgun or rocket launcher), in the right hand a chainsaw (there are two available, one standard and one deluxe: the scene of Ash finding the latter and saying where have you been so far?, then kiss her, it's just one of the gems of the Evil Dead: Regeneration script), a harpoon or a flamethrower. When facing an enemy, you can defeat him using a whole series of combos and then finish him off with a real ~fatality~, which can be activated by pressing the Triangle key at a certain moment. We will therefore see Ash sink the chainsaw into the body of the undead on duty and make his head explode, or shoot him while he turns around, or even decapitate the opponent. The control system, combos and overall combat work very well. As you fight, you collect units of red (vital) and yellow (spiritual) energy, with the latter filling a special bar and allowing you to momentarily transform into a very powerful evil version of Ash. The level of challenge of the game, however, makes the upgrade practically useless Klaatu Barada Nikto! The making of Evil Dead: Regeneration is respectable. The speech turns out to be broader than usual, as the developers have managed to include in the game a whole series of sequences that refer to the work of Sam Raimi: the ~runs~ in the forest (complete with a distorted cry), the fights ~ behind the scenes and the swaying shots. As far as fidelity to the saga from which it was born is concerned, EDR simply deserves applause. The voices of Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi, in this onesense, represent the classic icing on the cake, which unfortunately the Italian publishers have not been able to exploit: there was no need to dub the countless gags between Ash and Sam, but the presence of subtitles (also in English, like the others) would have made them accessible to all. The beauty is that the subtitles are also missing in the Extra section, in which Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi talk about the ideas inside the game and their contribution to it what a pity. Ash's character is very well done and boasts a great number of animations. A similar speech must be made for little Sam, who however always falls apart in the same way. The enemies are many and different from each other, each with its own characteristics and its own modus operandi. There are also several bosses, distinguished by a good level design. Probably the lion's share goes to the scenarios, however: each stage is very large, full of details and moderately interactive. All the cars you will see are strictly ~70s~, to stay in line with the spirit of the films, and several locations clearly recall the events seen in the trilogy. The sound sector is in line with the graphic one: music, voices and effects are of good quality. PS2 vs Xbox Evil Dead: Regeneration is available for both PS2 and Xbox. The differences between the two versions, as usual, come down to the details: on the Microsoft console the game runs slightly more smoothly (on PlayStation 2 we are just under 30 fps), and the textures show a better quality. Comment Those who loved Sam Raimi's trilogy, those hoping for the making of a fourth film (director's commitments permitting) and those who, in general, appreciate well-made video games will find Evil Dead: Regeneration an extremely valid, fun and engaging product. On balance, the game has only one flaw: it's too easy. The developers have evidently dosed the general difficulty badly, as evidenced by the fact that Ash's ~bad~ mode is almost never used to get out of trouble. This is a problem that certainly affects the life expectancy of EDR, but which in any case does not affect its enjoyment. Pros: Very faithful to the movies Technically sound Efficient combat system Cons: Too easy Localization non-existent Tie-ins are controversial products, which often only exploit the popularity of famous characters and stories to sell. For some time, however, a pleasant counter-trend has been taking place and Evil Dead: Regeneration is a proud example of it. Developed by THQ with the active participation of Bruce Campbell himself (who, for the uninitiated, is the lead actor in the The House trilogy, directed by Sam Raimi), EDR narrates events that evidently take place after the second film and which are introduced in pure ~Raimi style~: Ash is in a criminal asylum, accused of the murder of his friends as well as other people while they were possessed by evil, in the famous ~house~. The only one who believes his version of events is his attractive lawyer, Sally, who has found among the notes of the director of the plant, Dr. Reinhard, information that supports the version of events provided by Ash: there is a book cursed, the Necronomicon ex Mortis (clear reference to H. P. Lovecraft), who has the power to open gaps between the world of the dead and that of the living. What the beautiful Sally doesn't imagine is that Dr. Reinhard is not only fully aware of the capabilities of the Necronomicon, but uses it himself to obtain the power to dominate the world. During one of his experiments, however, something doesn't add up and a badly recited formula transforms the scientist into an undead, intent on bringing hell to earth, literally.
