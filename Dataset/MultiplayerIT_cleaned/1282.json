{"name": "Spy Hunter 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spy-hunter-6.html", "text": "An equally non-existent aesthetic care corresponds to the narrative structure. Movies aside, the game's graphics engine is quite fast but jerky, with poorly defined and grainy textures that prevent you from seeing the horizon with a further burden for the Xbox version, where the greater image cleaning highlights even more the obvious flaws. The only positive note goes to the music, a decent selection of hard rock and industrial songs inspired by the mood of the Bond Movies. However, it is useless to hesitate further in the description of such a superfluous plot and aesthetic aspect. The graphics are accessory: what matters is that the same lack of care and style affects playability. The machine's crosshair makes it difficult to target enemies; distance makes it impossible; the action boils down to imprecise shoot-and-shoot even when ineffective variations like pointless off-road mode (just a one-off button press) or water driving are introduced. The levels alternate excessive ease with maximum frustration, often due to the bad control system; the multiplayer modes have not seen an ad hoc design, they are boring and ~glued~ verbatim from the mode to a player, as if this were enough to make the gameplay of a game multiplayer Comment Spy Hunter 2 is physical and irrefutable proof of Midway's exploitation of players, especially younger and inexperienced ones, through many of its titles: it's rushed, with lacking gameplay and a backward technology engine. The frenetic action thus conceived looks more like a topsy-turvy landslide in which both the game and your patience are ruined than a captivating tunnel to dive into. Not recommended for everyone, except for a rental and five-six hours of fun that you can't do more against the computer. Pros: Fast-paced To be played without brain Cons: Mediocre graphics engine Poor control Rushed and superficial levels and gameplay Spy Hunter 2 is the sequel to the first 3D version of Midway's racer/shooter. SpyHunter, in turn, was taken from the original bitmap top-down arcade game. The presentation recipe of the modern version was quite direct: Jamesbondesque spy plot of the Z series and a multitude of racing levels without any pretensions, stuffed with weapons and explosions of enemy cars, all for a title that is just discreet, unpretentious, certainly not above average or innovative. Today, in 2004, the sequel to Spy Hunter offers almost nothing in addition, with the aggravating circumstance of remaining flaws and time running out. The Midway title, developed by Angel Studios that recently became the San Diego division of the famous Rockstar Games, not only fails to entertain beyond the short amount of time necessary to finish its levels (in spite of the useless multiplayer modes), but manages to go beyond structural flaws such as the control system, level structure and presentation, which always remain mediocre and betray rushed development, Midway's proverbial lack of compromise between art and commerce and a hasty fire sale in the midst of label changes. Dirty laundry is recycled in the family In Spy Hunter 2 the levels always offer the same gameplay: run, shoot enemies, avoid being hit, unlock another level. By overcoming the levels, new cars (or, better, upgrades to them) will be unlocked, but during the game it is also possible to transform the car into hovercrafts, adapt it to off-road mode (sic) with a button and so on. Being an arcade racer with shooter elements, it's easy to guess that the potential fun comes only from frenetic action and without too many thoughts. Which, vaguely, works, at least for those few levels where the coarse control system, the poorly calibrated difficulty and the imprecise collisions do not prevent you from enjoying them. The unlocking of the levels, the only thing that distinguishes it from its predecessor, appears practically superfluous, given that the adventure elements of the game are reduced to inconsistent crossroads and slightly different paths from the punctual run-straight-and-kill-all of the levels. What is the meaning of a button used for off-road mode, then, when the only thing that changes is the moment in which you understand that without pressing it once you skid, is a mystery. The desire for variation is therefore based on the plot. One would gladly not talk about such a sterile plot. And not so much for its intrinsic value or the importance of storytelling in an arcade shooter / racer, but for althree reasons, among which the plot of the game, however superficial, should serve to support the diversified access to the levels, which is in any case ultra-linear. As for the narration interspersed in the form of cinematics, imagine a pseudo-espionist-racing plot worthy of the worst James Bond clone and rendered as an intro to your chagrin, complete with a vaguely praying mantis beauty, transgression discount phrases and curves to Lara Croft. Add stylish names, full of acronyms and numbers, for unattractive cars and plasma weapons to be used against the enemies at the wheel in the mad race against the spies on duty interspersed with jokes like ~ah, politics... but you only think about killing everyone~.", "date": "2004-06-16", "grade": null}
