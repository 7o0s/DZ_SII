It is clear how a hole in the water has been made: the title turns out to be interesting for the elements and skills introduced, but it complicates everything unnecessarily with an interface which, paradoxically, should be simplified given the lack of structures. Certainly the idea of being able to increase the experience of the units with RPG elements would be good but on balance in melees life becomes complicated between a myriad of buttons and possibilities. For those accustomed to the intuitive commands of the various Command & Conquer, we recommend at least one try: the interface and the lack of buildings could prove to be detrimental. Instead, those who love to experiment with all types of RTS could find a valid alternative which, however, is penalized by bugs and moments of pure boredom. Pros Introduction of RPG elements Lots of units Satisfying graphics Cons Absurdly complicated interface Slow and frustrating gameplay Several bugs in the AI Fujitsu San, kamishu wan! Ya, Ya! The audio department suffers from ups and downs: the dubbing is excellent, which in addition to the classic English sees the soldiers speaking in different languages. For the World Forces we have dialogues in German, French, and other European languages; for China and the Order the characters speak in their mother tongue (Chinese, Arabic and a mix of others) while in the briefings we will hear a narrative voice making an effort to speak English! Well done! The sound of weapons and vehicles is also normal, with the sounds in the right place. Negative note instead for the music: they vary according to the faction, rarely offering a worthy accompaniment for the missions. For example, with China you can hear vaguely oriental tunes that match the action like cabbage for a snack. fog of war WoT graphically poses a dilemma: are we faced with a high quality product or something disguised? Evaluating the various parts we find that the attention to detail is high, as well as the zoom level; It is possible to distinguish the faces of the soldiers, making the game look like a sort of ~The Sims~ with a war background! Unfortunately the defects noticed in the preview phase have remained: the maps alternate between some excellently made and others below the sufficiency; on several buildings we find repetitive textures and too often an additional fogging effect to the classic ~fog~ that hides the scenery. Conversely, cities like Paris or London are well built, as are the different vehicles. The problem lies in the color palette, where faded tones stand out contrasted by overly colorful explosions. Overall, the game is up to today's standards but lacks in some choices that ruin the whole. The initial impact and the screenshots that run on the net are partly deceptive. On the other hand, the area at the end of the map is shameful: at every edge we find the void! (Stuff from games from 5 years ago). Given the abundant use of fog they could deigned to cover the edges of the levels rather than making them look like gigantic plastics suspended over nothing. The obscene briefing screens also remained: so much, too much text that bores you right away and pushes you to click to continue. The cutscenes are made with in-game movies and with some images and animations that integrate little into the whole. Ultimately, the good initial premises partially lead to mediocre, giving us an incomplete product in the graphic framework. War on Terror War on Terror (WoT) is a real-time strategy that tries to break away from the usual canons of the genre. The programmers of Montecristo have made precise and somewhat risky choices to try to renew the genre. Unfortunately things didn't go as hoped and the result is certainly not the best. The game is set in 2008 and features a similar storyline to Command & Conquer: Generals, with even the factions being virtually identical! A terrorist group called ~The Order~ wants to subvert the world order with terrorist actions and guerrilla warfare. To contrast it on one side we find the World Forces, or the classic United Nations, on the other China, which is involved in an internal war in the country which is no longer able to protect its people. And so far nothing new. The innovations lie in the total elimination of the resource accumulation and building construction part. In practice, we have tried to focus everything on action, which sees the possibility of deploying more units on the field depending on how many ~command~ points we will earn by achieving certain objectives (primary, secondary, bonuses and secrets). It is interesting that the units that gain experience will continue to be available in subsequent missions and will have a growth andspecial skills typical of an RPG. total elimination of the resource accumulation and building construction part War on Terror Each of the three armies can count on different types of men and means, each with its own particular characteristics. In total we will have about seventy units, which in turn will be able to enjoy about sixty skills (such as healing of the troops, enhanced secondary weapon, particular aim and many others). The problem is created in battle, where the management of everything becomes absolutely confusing, difficult and what is even worse, it makes the use of particular skills almost useless! In fact, as soon as our forces see an enemy, they will shoot us en masse and it will almost never happen that we have to resort to the icons reserved for special actions. To aggravate the already sad system we find an interface that cannot be more messed up! Six semi-transparent windows filled with continuously updated icons and text. Given the continuous unfolding of events, most of the dialogues and objectives will appear in the upper right corner, distracting you from the action or forcing you to lose pieces of text due to the actions. The map management commands are the classic ones of the genre but the game is not like Command or Empire at War in which you have a bird's eye view of everything: here it will become a must to rotate, zoom and move to see the units, often covered by buildings and various objects which, in addition to the nearby ~Fog of War~ make it impossible to see the enemies. Terror Time The preview disc dating back to December gave us a taste of the problems that afflicted everything: bugs, constant crashes, undecided units Although some things have been optimized, we find that not infrequently our men get stuck somewhere on the map , refusing to continue in any way. Instead, the enemies attack in ridiculous groups or with often overwhelming mass reinforcements, which force you to reload the game to look for other solutions. So far it could also be fine but the other big problem is the slowness of the game: the battles require the units to fire a lot of shots to knock down the enemies, even the heavy weapons do not cause much damage and therefore the progress in the missions sometimes it's totally boring. Here too a paradox is created; lengthening the action becomes cumbersome and frustrating, especially in cases where small squadrons or characters such as heroes are managed. Of these there are about ten, all with their own abilities. Beware Starforce! Warning: This game makes use of the now famous (to say the least) Starforce protection. It is now in the public domain that the latest versions of the aforementioned protection, due to a rather invasive procedure, can cause malfunctions or, worse, breakage of optical devices. Furthermore, it seems that they do not guarantee sufficient compatibility, both hardware and software, which can cause incorrect recognition of the disc, even if it is original, and therefore the failure to start the game. The manufacturer has denied, declaring that it is slander, but the affected players do not seem to be of the same opinion. So far, both developers and distributors have not yet decided to indicate the presence of this protection in the technical specifications. For this reason we, to be honest, prefer to inform you. Every decision is up to you. World Forces vs China vs Order Multiplayer allows you to play the classic modes with a couple of variations: we have the usual one-on-one deathmatch; the ~conquer the flag~ both in the version of hunting the enemy one, and with a single flag in the center of the screen (whoever brings it to the base first wins). Finally the ~king of the hill~, where you have to conquer certain territories. The game supports all connection types, IP, LAN and Internet. Surely WoT gains a lot, given that one or more human opponents (you can play with up to eight people) allow you to make the most of the characteristics of the various armies.", "date": "2006-05-05", "grade": null}
