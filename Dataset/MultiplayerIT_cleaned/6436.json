The review is over, you can also go and read the vote. Still here? Do you want to know the reasons for such a peremptory statement? Let's start from the beginning. It was a dark and stormy night when Goat Simulator, a joke turned video game, appeared on the market. Despite its ephemeral nature, the game of the goat that breaks things had its own purpose and was fun in its own way. The entire game condensed into one image Of course, it was nothing but goliardia, but it worked because there was intelligent work behind it, visible even only in the composition of the absurdities that alternated on the screen. Moreover, he had a nobler goal, which was to make fun of serious simulators; the various Farm Simulators and associates, which are in any case video games with all the trappings. Grass Simulator is a bad joke. Very bad. He would like to follow the same vein, but he arrived late and without the slightest ability to elicit half a smile. It's the idiot friend who copies the joke of his brilliant friend and wonders why it didn't make him laugh, without being able to blame himself and his own unusual incapacity. She is the woman weighing two hundred kilos who wonders why people laugh at her despite wearing the same leopard-print thong that the model was considered sexy on. Here, before starting to do anything, it would be a good idea to do the minimum of self-analysis and, if necessary, self-criticism that helps not to sink into ridicule. The author of Grass Simulator, a certain Daniel Davies, didn't do it and came up with a work that goes beyond disastrous. It should be noted that Grass Simulator was launched as definitive, although only version 0.20 is still available, which could be considered a half-scam, except that in this case those who bought it knew perfectly what they were getting into. In short, we are faced with a perverse form of shared stupidity which, as such, is ennobled as a social fact by transforming itself into a more complex phenomenon. We reviewed Grass Simulator... it was tough, but we did it Why the review Someone could object to the fact that the one on Steam is not yet the definitive version of Grass Simulator and that, therefore, it shouldn't be reviewed. In this case we have chosen to do otherwise for two fundamental reasons: first of all because the game has been pulled out of Early Access and, therefore, regardless of the number it reports, whoever created it has reported it as finished and purchasable. Furthermore, we simply do not believe that it is possible to get something good out of this random mess, even with all the effort in the world, so we felt compelled to inform you of its existence and to give it an opinion to make anyone desist from the purchase. Randomly done Currently, spending the 9.99 (7.99 until April 8) needed to purchase Grass Simulator takes home the fair of bugs, as well as an incomplete title that will probably die where it arrived, because in actually there is no video game idea behind it, but only the typical attitude in the form of a video game of the many trolls that run on the internet. By launching it, you have the opportunity to select one of the seven modes offered and nothing else. Let's get rid of the online mode, which simply doesn't work, and hurt ourselves by seeing the others one by one. In ~Classic~ you go around a meadow exploding badly animated cows with one of the four weapons available: a pistol, a revolver, a 1930s Chicago-style machine gun and a mace. How much creativity But does it really cost about ten euros? In truth, the only weapons that work are the first three, since the mace does not cause any damage. They must have put it there to make up the number. Going around you can collect two bonuses, one capable of slowing down and the other of accelerating the game speed and... stop. Absolutely nothing else is done. There are no objectives, there are no actual enemies, there are no items to collect, there is nothing at all; apart from the invisible barriers that delimit the map and the trees positioned as wildebeest reproductive organs. On the other hand, there is no shortage of bugs, with cows sinking into the ground, jumping animations, graphic glitches everywhere, textures that disappear and so on and so forth. We switch to the ~Grass~ mode which does exactly what it promises by transforming us into a blade of grass in a small courtyard. All we can do is rotate the view with the mouse and watch the day go by. The ~Dubstep~ mode, on the other hand, would like to be a kind of visionary surreal moment, with hallucinated cows that rotate, fly, project beams of light and disappear into a shaky sky. Not here eitherdoes absolutely nothing. We don't know if it's better to describe her as pathetic or pathetic. The ~Range~ mode, on the other hand, is even worse, given that you are inside a shack with fake walls and you have to shoot at targets as big as billboards with one of the three weapons already listed. Obviously the targets are immobile, to give that extra thrill to vomiting when it goes up the esophagus. Funny how hemorrhoid surgery. Furthermore, it is not clear what such a mode has to do with a game that should theoretically simulate grass. Let's move on to the ~Snowfall~ mode, which is identical to the ~Classic~ mode, only set in the snow and with graphics that look like they were ripped from Skyrim. Finally, the ~Bad Disco~ mode is identical to the Dubstep mode only that the cows move in a whirling rhythm dragging strobe lights behind them. That's all. In total you can see everything that Grass Simulator has to offer in about ten minutes, excluding bugs and uploads.", "date": "2015-04-06", "grade": "1.0"}
