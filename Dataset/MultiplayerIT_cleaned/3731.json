{"name": "The Princess Guide per Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-princess-guide-recensione-switch.html", "text": "Nippon Ichi has become famous for some small masterpieces that it has developed or even just published over the course of various generations, among which the strategic titles belonging to the Disgaea line certainly stand out, now released on practically any platform. Nippon Ichi, however, has quite a few skeletons in the closet: decidedly mediocre games, sometimes really bad, which have often passed on the sly and which few know or remember. The Princess Guide is not one of them, we want to premise it, but neither does it represent the quality level that has made the Japanese company popular, even if it fits perfectly into the experimental strings that have distinguished it for years, especially in the field of strategic titles. In our review we will explain to you what convinced us and what didn't in this strange hybrid RPG. Four princesses looking for trouble The Princess Guide tells the story of four princesses who rule over an enchanted world divided into four regions. At the beginning of the game, after having created our alter ego using a very simple editor, we will have to choose which princess to start the adventure with; later, once the first subplot is completed, we will also be able to play the others and finally follow a main narrative thread that intertwines the stories of the princesses. Don't expect much, however. The Princess Guide tells an unpretentious fantasy story, focused above all on the bizarre personalities of the four young girls: Liliartie, for example, is a combative warrior who wants to defeat the dragon that terrorizes her kingdom... and gobble it up. Our job, as a mentor, will be to prepare them for the crown by scolding or praising them. The choice, which occurs occasionally during the funny dialogues dubbed in Japanese and subtitled in English, does not affect the story, but only the characteristics of the princess: courage, wisdom, faith and so on. The problem is that this is only one of several mechanics that The Princess Guide explains only briefly. What these characteristics are for is not clear: we only know that, by increasing them, the princess gains bonuses, but we don't know how they affect her performance in battle. Much of the progression in The Princess Guide is based on the so-called ~trial and error~. In fact we can also scold or praise the princesses during the fights, for a maximum of three times per mission, but only by doing so will we find out which of the two actions will heal her and which one will instead give her a bonus to attack or defense. Strategy or action? The Princess Guide is a nebulous game in many ways. At first glance, the world map - a network divided into nodes representing various locations - resembles those of strategy titles. Once a destination is selected, the chosen unit will move in place while the enemy units roam around on their own and, of course, crossing them begins the fight. The fights take place in real time in tiny randomly generated dungeons. The player controls the commander - who can be his alter ego, a princess or a series of anonymous mercenaries - while the artificial intelligence takes care of his soldiers, up to three units. At this point, The Princess Guide fits into each other different gameplay mechanics that explain in detail is very complicated. The control modes of the commander are essentially two. Battle mode unbinds him from his followers, giving him the ability to use a few more attacks than usual, while the soldiers roam around on their own and attack the enemies of their choice. Commander mode, on the other hand, keeps units glued to the commander: the latter cannot use certain hits, but can order his units to attack whenever he wants. Once you reach a certain level of Dominance - a percentage that the game doesn't explain how to increase, among other things - you can choose between different types of formations that guarantee the team various bonuses to attack or defense. A Chinese paper-style relationship governs the effectiveness of certain units against enemy data and vice versa, so the strategic component lies in preparing the teams before tackling the various missions. These - divided into main and secondary, as always - become more complex as the campaign is completed. They often require you to defend a certain map node from enemy units, intercepting them before they reach it, and sometimes you will need to deploy several formations to prevent multiple enemies from reaching different locations. As we said, moving around the map takes placein real time, and once a formation has been deployed, it cannot be changed unless it is recalled to the base, after which we will have to wait a certain number of fictitious hours before being able to deploy it again. This is a substantially useless mechanism, given that the player can speed up the passage of time by holding down a key, which only serves to slow down the progression and penalize an incautious choice. Fortunately, there is no real game over and you can repeat missions immediately after failing them. Cute but deadly The difficulty curve is quite steep not only because of the multiple interlocking mechanics that the game explains quite poorly, but also because the enemies get stronger and stronger in just a few keystrokes, sometimes forcing us to grind repeatable missions or random fights to try weapons and improve our commanders. The artificial intelligence of the support units that follow us is quite incomplete and you can't really count on them, especially when the opponents surround us from all sides: in these cases, we are often forced to flee around the map, looking for the best moments and angles to attack your enemies before fleeing again. The princesses use slightly different fighting styles, but in the end the fights tend to all be alike and even the Relics only affect them relatively. Relics are devices scattered around the map that sometimes guarantee benefits to those in the activation area, but more often they are real traps that we can use against enemies. By activating the various Relics in the maps, the skills of the various princesses are also improved, unlocking bonuses and other passive skills. In this respect, The Princess Guide tries to resemble Diablo-style titles, filling the player with weapons and items with random stats that sometimes grant new attacks to commanders, but more often it all results in a rain of useless loot than anything else. it is difficult to manage due to unclear inventory. The Princess Guide just seems like a more polished game in terms of appearance, rather than substance. The 2D graphics are very colourful, the sprites defined, the interface has a sparkling and innovative style, but in the end the fights result in an orgy of pixels that swarm around the screen, filling it with special effects and explosions that stifle any pretense of strategy.", "date": "2019-04-09", "grade": "5.5"}
