And consequently a certain commercial success limited to their sector. In fact, it is undeniable that many of these products, which by focusing on aspects such as playability, innovation or immediate fun, manage to involve gamers on par or almost as the most popular titles in technical terms. A sub-genre of casual that attracts a lot of people's tastes is undoubtedly the one relating to animal life ~simulators~ and specifically those that allow the gamer to choose, look after, grow and entertain a virtual puppy, be it realistic , that is, based on real creatures such as foals and cats, or imaginary ones, such as unicorns, dragons or strange crosses between monkeys and puppies, as in the case of Sony's EyePet series, which in addition to what has just been described has also always focused on the so-called reality augmented as the main feature (and which we will discuss separately later). Like the game that preceded it on PlayStation Portable a year ago, Sony's puppies return to the portable console with this Eyepet adventure, a title that needless to say is clearly aimed at an audience of children. Pamper and teach Eyepet All'Avventura is almost identical to its predecessor, from which it takes many aspects related to gameplay and then adds new features, such as more dynamic sections related to the exploration of some levels together with the puppies, along the lines of a platform game with side view, for the purpose of retrieving objects or just for fun. To do what has just been described, you must first join the EyePet Explorers Club. Once becoming a member of this association, the player can, as mentioned, make his pet perform a whole series of playful activities, which on board a special submarine transport vehicle moves within some platform-style scenarios in search of new clothing, treasures, toys, objects abandoned or lost by other eyepets, tokens to be used to unlock new content and so on. Obviously, given the nature of the product, the level of challenge of these phases cannot be defined as complicated. So, if we exclude the risk of getting lost a bit during exploration due to the lack of a game map, basically each area does not constitute a real problem for the player and you can still complete it by discovering almost every secret on the first shot. However, the presence of these game sections is in our opinion a welcome addition by Sony which thus offers a certain variety to the general playability of the product and a good longevity thanks to those extra unlockable and collectible contents that will delight all fans of these virtual gadgets. For the rest, the game involves the usual activities that take place with a virtual puppy to look after. And here the augmented reality mentioned at the beginning of the article comes into play. Travel the world, travel For those unfamiliar with it, it is a technique that allows the superimposition of virtual and multimedia elements on the real everyday experience. In our case, thanks to the Go! Cam and a Magic Card included in the package or recyclable from the predecessor, you can create the basis for being able to ~physically~ interact with your pet. By pointing the camera lens towards the card, the virtual EyePet appears on the PSP screen inside the real environment framed at that moment. To caress it, just move your fingers in correspondence with the real space and in the direction of the puppy's silhouette, in order to see this gesture reproduced on the video on the little animal's body. The feeling of actually touching the puppy is strong, thanks to the excellent work done by the console, and it is an experience also corroborated by the way in which he interacts with us, with movements and animations that really seem to be instinctive and natural. Immersed in the player's reality, in his kitchen or in his living room, for example, the puppy then interfaces in various ways with the objects around him. In short, it really seems to be able to have an animal next to you, to cuddle it and play with it, especially since you also have to wash it or feed it. In conclusion, summing up, even if this Eyepet adventure is more complete than its predecessor always on PlayStation Portable and the sfide in it are not lacking, in the long run its nature could be a little tiring, especially perhaps after the novelty factor constituted by the additions to the playability are decreasing in the first hours of the game. However, if you are aware of the type of product and its ~function~ different from all other video games, then you cannot fail to appreciate a title of this kind which is a good pastime that knows how to entertain and excite.", "date": "2012-03-14", "grade": null}
