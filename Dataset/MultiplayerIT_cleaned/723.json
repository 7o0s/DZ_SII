As in the first episode, in fact, we will take on the role of 3 soldiers ~ simple belonging to the armed forces of Russia, England and the United States. What changes is the order of the campaigns since this time we will start our adventure with the Red Army and end it with the stars and stripes infantry and in the middle we will be engaged in Africa with His Majesty's troops. This time the possibility of being able to start the campaign with another soldier even before the conclusion of the previous one was introduced, after having completed only some of the missions of the other campaign. Perhaps someone will opt for a patchy experience but the writer has found it more logical and immersive to conclude a soldier's campaign and then move on to the next one only after. War legends As written at the beginning, the basic structure of Call of Duty 2 has remained similar to its predecessor: we are facing an FPS with immediate gameplay in which together with our fellow soldiers controlled by artificial intelligence we will have to deal with the Nazi troops in every corner of the world and complete the various objectives that will be given to us from mission to mission with only two weapons available (good variety in the arsenal between pistols, automatic machine guns, sniper rifles and so on) as well as grenades and smoke bombs. As in the first COD, the behavior and attack sequences of the enemy troops are scripted but the main novelty of this second episode lies in a greater general complexity of the game maps: if Call of Duty was accused of excessive linearity, the second episode has been enriched with possibilities and alternative ways to resolve the most difficult passages. It will thus be truly fascinating and full of adrenaline to find the right alley in the abandoned city to organize an attack from the rear of the Wehrmacht soldiers, catching them by surprise in order to have a particular advantage in the firefight. We are certainly not talking about a title with a particularly high freedom but in any case it will be much more difficult to find more or less invisible obstacles during the levels (which happened not infrequently in the first COD) and the alternative possibilities given greatly increase the feeling of realism and interaction. As far as the use of the means is concerned, however, the news is really in its infancy. There will be some missions in which we will have the command exclusively of the machine gun placed on top of an armored vehicle that will move completely independently of our will while in the African campaign with the British troops we will instead be able to maneuver a powerful tank in the dunes of the Sahara. To be honest, however, the parts with the means are perhaps the least inspired and engaging that Call of Duty presents in the single-player campaign. if Call of Duty was accused of excessive linearity, the second episode was enriched with possibilities and alternative ways to solve the most difficult passages As regards the game structure in the strictest sense, COD 2 is based on a system of pre-established checkpoints which never make the experience frustrating (indeed, at the second difficulty level among the 4 present, the game tends to be slightly too easy). Another element that directly affects the gameplay concerns the energy of our alter ego: a bar will never appear on the screen to indicate our status, given that the end of the game will occur when the soldier is hit by a certain number of shots (or even by only one in case he is hit on the head or by a grenade) in a limited period of time with a system that refers directly to Halo 2. In fact, if we have been injured, it will be sufficient to find a hiding place to recover the lost energy and then return to life as before on the battlefield. Perhaps someone could criticize the system adopted and consider it unrealistic, but in the end finding medikits scattered around the world capable of healing us from all evil is not an equally very likely experience. Lifeblood One of the most criticized aspects of the first Call of Duty was certainly the longevity. Indeed, the single player campaign lasted under 10 hours. Fortunately this time, things went very differently: the three game campaigns divided into 27 missions, requireapproximately 13-15 hours of game to be completed, thus settling on a medium-high duration compared to its reference genre (for example a Quake 4 lasts a few hours less). The online mode comes to the rescue for the longevity of the title which, for sure, on Xbox Live will claim thousands of victims from the first days of the launch of the new console. The three key modes for FPS (deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag) are joined by two relatively more peculiar ones: ~Headquarters~ and ~Search and Destroy~. The first involves maintaining a position on the map for as long as possible, while ~Search & Destroy~ is a mode in which you have to place or prevent the placement of explosive charges. Then there is the killcam or the last seconds of your digital life from the point of view of your ~killer~. Compared to the PC version, which has 64 players per map, the console version is limited to 8 players with an obvious limitation which, however, does not diminish the satisfaction and fun that can be experienced in online games. Audiovisual show The great strength of Call of Duty, the immersive capacity given by the audiovisual realization, has been further expanded in this second episode. The Xbox 360 version of COD 2 is certainly one of the best launch titles of the Microsoft console, thanks to the thousands of details that define the characters and settings. The frame rate, except on rare occasions, is nailed to 60 frames per second, even when in the heat of battle you find yourself surrounded by dozens of soldiers and shrouded in fog raised by smoke canisters or hand grenade explosions, with devastating effects. The animations of the supporting actors who move around the backdrop in a completely convincing way are also beautiful, managing to give life to a perfect reconstruction of a digital war. The frame rate, except for rare occasions, is nailed to 60 frames per second, even when in the heat of battle you find yourself surrounded by dozens of soldiers Audiovisual show The only note that can be moved to COD 2, from a technical point of view, is the almost total lack of interaction between the environment and the soldiers. One cannot fail to be disappointed to see that, even when shooting a vehicle or a building with a bazooka, these are almost not scratched in the slightest and to see that not even a glass is broken when shooting from inside a building through a closed window . This detail, combined with the narrative aridity of the game, entrusted only to videos taken from the Military Channel repertoire and without even a cut scene accompanying the epic deeds of our soldiers, is the only real defect of COD 2, which a real masterpiece for all the other elements that compose it. And also for the sound, given that the audio system of the Activision-branded title undoubtedly gives life to one of the best video games ever listened to to date thanks to a perfect combination of excellently sampled environmental effects which, if broadcast by a system Surround 5.1, will literally make you jump in your seat. The effects, combined with the short musical recordings and the absolutely above average dubbing in Italian, help to complete the picture of a leading audiovisual system, even in the line up of the first next gen console. Comment Infinity Ward have managed to further improve all the most important elements at the base of the first Call Of Duty and to present themselves at the launch of the Xbox 360 with one of the most beautiful titles in the line up. The adrenaline, involvement and passion that Call Of Duty 2 is able to arouse in the most memorable phases of the game, frankly, have no equivalent in the panorama of fps in recent months. The console version, albeit with more limited online support than the PC version, establishes itself as the perfect alternative, given that it stands on the qualitative levels of the highest-end configurations currently available on the market. Aided by a well-adapted joypad controls, a compelling single-player gameplay structure, and online modes that are sure to create a thriving online community, COD 2 is one of the most highly recommended titles as a starting point for the next generation. Pros Monumental audiovisual impact Longer running and less linear than the first episode Refined artificial intelligence Cons Very disappointing interaction with the environment Some minimal graphic bugs Weak narrative structure Strengthened by the unanimous approval received from critics and the public with the first episode, Infinity Ward returns to the trenches of the Second World War with Call of Duty 2, also throwing himself into the fray ofThe launch of Xbox 360. Certainly the programmers have made some variations and significant improvements to the play system of their title, but the strong point of their brand has remained the same, raised to the nth degree: the immersive capacity of their work. If someone still has doubts about the drama of a war conflict, about what war really means, COD2 is probably the best surrogate to be able to understand what it means to participate in such a situation. No other title before has ever brought the gamer closer to understanding the total loss of humanity when facing the enemy, having to shoot a wounded enemy soldier to finish him off because he could always shoot us before expiring, talking to a fellow soldier and a second later to see him dead in a pool of blood. Although it is a war game, perhaps the deepest meaning of the title of the Infinity Ward programmers is a pacifist message, far from the propaganda that has always filled the means of mass communication, whether they were newspapers, the radio and the posters of yesterday, or the television medium today. To help in this also the many maxims that peep out at each game over.", "date": "2005-12-01", "grade": null}
