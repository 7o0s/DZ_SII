For general questions regarding the game, we refer you to the other article, which will provide you with an exhaustive picture of all its aspects. The perfect starting point is the configuration menu, which offers us the possibility to select one of the pre-set graphic profiles or to manually modify the individual options. In reality, the executable takes care of automatically detecting the best configuration on first start, and then leaving the user with the possibility to go and tweak the individual items in case of problems. Note that Fallout 4's look and feel can only be configured when outside of the game. The internal menu dedicated to graphics allows you to change only the settings relating to the interface (color, transparency and so on). In general we can say that the Bethesda title does not offer many configuration options. Also note that if a controller attached to the PC is detected, the system uses it by default for game commands, excluding the mouse and keyboard. We will talk about this aspect later, dealing with the control system. In general, however, it is important to note a certain lack of configurability. To say, the audio section offers only five sliders for the various volumes. In short, if you want to tinker a bit with the game's values, you have to go looking for the configuration files in the installation folders and modify them by hand (or wait for some mod that allows you to do so). In short, until now the PC version of Fallout 4 is in line with the console versions ... in every sense. We also reviewed the PC version of Fallout 4: let's find out what it's like! Graphic rendering Before commenting on the graphics, it is fair to note the greater cleanliness of Fallout 4 compared to any other Bethesda title in recent years. It's true, there are some bugs, but those who criticize the game for this reason evidently don't remember the dragons that flew as opposed to Skyrim, the broken quests present in quantity in all the developer's other RPGs, including Fallout 3, the blocking bugs, system crashes and so on. Fallout 4 has a very tolerable amount of glitches, far less problematic than those experienced in other blockbusters this year such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In short, from this point of view it is right to applaud Bethesda because they have worked very hard to launch the game in a more than acceptable state even on PC. Having said that, the time has come for the painful notes. The system requirements of Fallout 4 are very affordable, but honestly we would have preferred to spend a little more to run it and see something better. At least something in line with what has been seen in other titles. Let's not use too many words: Fallout 4 is, from a graphic point of view, worse than its direct competitors, a defect that is even more marked on PC. The images that you find accompanying this article have been captured in ~Ultra~ detail and clearly show all the limits of the game engine. The PC version is only slightly more detailed than the console version, from which it doesn't differ much. It is true that the Commonwealth is literally overflowing with objects and it is probable that if one had chosen to push too much on the visual rendering there would have been major problems with fluidity even on very powerful machines, but some limits are not really acceptable. Physics has also been altered by nuclear warfare The general feeling is that of a stark and washed out world, capable of producing good landscapes, but lacking in detail. In short, quantity was preferred over quality. For example, it's true that the character editor is very powerful and allows for extreme personalization of the protagonist, but it's also true that Fallout 4's human models aren't beautiful. Of course, you have to choose: such a powerful tool requires some sacrifices in terms of overall yield. The alternative way is that of the aforementioned The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (to mention another title), that is, the creation of more refined and defined models, but which are repeated throughout the game. Another problematic aspect of the technical side of Fallout 4 is the physics simulation. As before - the game world is really full of stuff and applying physics to everything would have been problematic from a performance point of view, but what there is is really poor. Just take any object and throw it on the ground to check its compositionanomalous and unrealistic movement, with thuds even of what should bounce. In short, someone near Bethesda should have played at least one game of Grand Theft Auto V... Performance There would be other examples to demonstrate the graphical poverty of Fallout 4, but we believe it is already clear that not even the PC version shines from this point of view. Indeed, as already mentioned, it is even more penalized than the others, because it was reasonable to expect much more. Fortunately, the game is very fluid. On the test system, an Intel Core i7-4770 with 16GB of RAM and a GeForce GTX 960, it never faltered, even in the most chaotic moments. Detail was set to Ultra and we tested it at 1080p. Of course, it should be noted that some animations of the protagonist seem to be related to the frame rate, i.e. they are faster as the fluidity increases. It's not exactly the best, but it's a problem that can be solved without trauma through patches. Area transition loads are slightly faster than those recorded on consoles, but in this case it is the system itself that is intolerable, when by now all the open worlds on the market have amply demonstrated that they can handle data streaming in real time in the passages from internal to external and vice versa. In short, it's time for Bethesda to update the engine of its role-playing games, because some technical solutions are starting to appear moldy and create absurd situations in 2015. For example, entering an environment that must be loaded while fleeing from enemies can lead to finding them on you as soon as it reappears in the game. Interface The interface deserves a separate paragraph. As we explained at the beginning of the article, Fallout 4 recognizes by default if there is a controller connected to the PC, using it exclusively for commands. What does it mean? That the mouse and keyboard are put in the background and must be activated. It's actually easy to say that the entire UI was conceived with a controller in mind, given how awkward it is to manage any other way. To say: using the keyboard, the default key assignment has several flaws, flaws that manifest themselves above all in the crafting phase, where for example to confirm the recycling of an object you have to press the Enter key, releasing the mouse or moving the left hand. Of course, it is possible to configure them yourself and solve them, but there is no doubt that there has not been a great deal of attention to what remains the most widespread control system on the PC. The menus themselves have not been adapted and do not exploit the possibilities offered by the mouse in the slightest. So we find ourselves for the umpteenth time scrolling through the lists of objects, already seen in Skyrim and Fallout 3, which can only fit using the analog stick of a controller, even if CD Projekt RED demonstrated with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to be able to create a usable inventory with all control systems without sacrificing clarity and usability. We're sure that as usual MODs will be produced in profusion to fix Fallout 4's inventory, but is it possible that every Bethesda title on PC needs external interventions to see a decent adaptation? Yet Skyrim has sold millions of copies on this machine, as have previous Fallouts. Even Fallout 4 itself is already well over a million copies on PC. So the excuse of the few sales that would not justify certain interventions, in this case just doesn't hold up.", "date": "2015-11-12", "grade": "8.9"}
