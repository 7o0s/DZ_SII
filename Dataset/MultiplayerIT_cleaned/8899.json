{"name": "Serious Sam 3: BFE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96141-serious-sam-3-bfe-fino-allultimo-respiro.html", "text": "Who remembers Serious Sam 2? Few, we imagine. The least successful chapter of the series, currently made up of three episodes (six with the various spin-offs), was also the one that had most succumbed to the compromises of modernity. Compared to the first chapter and its spin-off, the action was slower, the levels smaller and, in general, the difficulty had been lowered to allow everyone to get into the game. Obviously there were few players who were truly satisfied with those choices, especially on the PC front. With Serious Sam 3: BFE, Croteam has chosen to go back to its origins, not caring about modern shooters to offer pure and uncompromising gameplay. You won't like Serious Sam 3: BFE if you appreciate the profusion of scripted sequences in Michael Bay-inspired titles, if you like that kind of treacherous energy cheat that recharges itself (which would be more realistic than the rotating medkits scattered around the maps, someone has yet to explain it to us), if you adore unbreakable covers and if, fundamentally, you appreciate the ease and brevity of modern titles that are finished in a breath, are ultra linear and do not give any problems to the player, always guided and pampered in what he does. If, on the other hand, you want to burn your mouse and have continuous adrenaline rushes, while demonstrating to yourself and the world what it means to frag hundreds of enemies at the same time, then you will find Croteam's latest effort simply sublime. Serious Sam 3: BFE cares about everything and everyone and returns to glorifying the player's skill above all else, implicitly stating that ~new~ is not synonymous with ~beautiful~ and that changes aimed at tickling the barbaric tastes of the masses bring to involution rather than evolution. To truly appreciate it, you just need to be ready to accept the challenge and leave the comfort of the sofa at home. No covers. All man Serious Sam 3: BFE is hard, damn hard. Since the first two levels, which also have a relatively slower pace than the others. The start is quite calm, with Sam finding himself in a Cairo destroyed by the attack of the aliens and initially forced to fight unarmed against one-eyed beasts and the classic headless alien soldiers. A few steps among the rubble and you have learned a couple of fundamental concepts to survive: Sam is a cool guy who rips out eyes with his bare hands, Sam is a cool guy who rips out hearts with his bare hands. In short, the usual tamarro that fits perfectly with the type of action. What glasses... From the gun onwards everything is a crescendo. Paradoxically, the beginning makes us fear another Serious Sam 2, with battles on a limited scale to meet everyone's abilities, but it is only an appearance and a way to enjoy what comes next. Before long the streets of the city become hell, the bullets multiply, enemies start erupting from everywhere and the pace of the action becomes syncopated to the point that sometimes you quit the game just to catch your breath. drink a glass of water and then get back into the fray. The effect can alienate, especially if you are no longer used to shooting without covers, but then you begin to savor forgotten sensations, such as the taste of a lightning-fast 180-degree turn in a jump with lateral strafing, concluded with a shotgun shot which transforms the enemy whose blow we have just dodged into a cloud of blood, and it makes you think that it will also be old stuff, but that in recent years certain vertigo and certain gambles in the FPS genre no longer exist. Without compromises Still, Serious Sam 3: BFE has nothing new, especially if we take the first two chapters as a yardstick. The weapons are those, with only a few additions, and the same goes for enemies and levels. Speaking precisely of level design, with the increase of monsters, both in quantity and in size, Croteam does nothing but dramatically expand the arenas where you fight to produce epic battles in which the scenario becomes mere scenery to be knocked down with blows of missiles or cannonballs. Big, but with a little effort it will go down like the others The final level, already history, is pure frenzy for at least two straight hours (even three, but a lot depends on the selected difficulty level), with the player's hand starting to hurt due to the large quantity of bullets fired and which the jump key was pressed. Sure, some might see it as an all too radical title in its desire to reaffirm a past that, in fact, no longer exists at a videogame level. Before Serious Sam 3: BFE, two titles like RAGE and Duke Nukem Forever, accused of being too old-fashioned, appear only as hybrids that are not very successful and full of compromises, where the old school remainsand in the background. The writer of this review can boast of never having died in RAGE on hard difficulty, especially thanks to the integrated defibrillator cheat, while in a single level of SS3, played on normal difficulty, it is difficult to count the times he was forced to reload... What worries you? If yes, turn away and move on to something else. The alternative would be to play it at a humiliating easy level, where the pleasure of razing an army of approaching enemies to the ground with the machine gun with rotating barrels, or that of creating a breach in a wall of beasts with a cannonball, would invariably come less. Aliens, pyramids and multiplayer To exemplify the game let's take the level of the pyramids. Before reaching them, you have to fight hundreds of enemies in the neighborhood adjacent to the archaeological area. The level is surrounded by the desert, where it is impossible to venture because of a giant Dune-style worm that occasionally peeps out showing its immense size. The road isn't long, but advancing is difficult and often, overwhelmed by the number of enemies, one is forced to retreat to seek shelter (especially when that cursed helicopter arrives). Done wrong or are you just happy to see me? The neighborhood is a maze of streets and ravines where ammunition and other battle goodies are hidden, but to fetch them without first clearing the road of alien scum is tantamount to suicide, as it is suicide to try to run forward to avoid enemies. There is no mercy for the player and quick saves themselves can prove to be a double-edged sword, in case you don't realize you are about to save at an inopportune moment (for example when there are undetected enemies in the vicinity). Fortunately there are checkpoints to create safe points from which the player can resume safely in the event of a degenerate situation. Played in multiplayer, Serious Sam 3: BFE is a... Serious Sam. The modes that have characterized the past chapters are all there, including the cooperative one, which multiplies the fun by the number of players with brains active in the game. There are also the classic modes, a bit snubbed lately, all or almost all oriented towards the wild frag. Of course, from this point of view a little more could have been done with variety, perhaps thinking of a new way of exploiting the immense levels, but even here it was decided to keep the spirit of the originals, with all the controversies that a choice similar may result. In fact, the sense of deja vu is great, especially for those who have played the re-editions of the old chapters online. Those who will appreciate it the most are those players who haven't found a competitive multiplayer mode for years and who, above all, hate legalized camping with ~fine weapon~ for the inept, key features of many other games, often even the most famous ones. A serious engine Serious Sam 3: BFE inherits, in addition to everything we have already talked about, also the same graphic impact of its predecessors. In short, taking into consideration the individual elements, Croteam's game is not surprising, especially in terms of texture detail, often very washed out. But where it amazes, often leaving you speechless, is in the construction of huge landscapes and in the management of the high number of enemies deployed simultaneously. But how many beautiful ancient columns to knock down! It is quite obvious that, having to move such a large amount of three-dimensional models simultaneously in open levels, a compromise has been sought so as not to weigh too much on general performance. Speaking of the latter, many will be happy to know that the level of configurability is very high, with dozens of graphics options to customize to find the perfect performance for your system. On the other hand, those who don't like wasting time with configuration menus will find an excellent ally in the automatic system. However, some performance problems detected by some events should be reported, some of which forced Croteam to release a patch and then... immediately release another to fix the problems caused by the first one. The worst aspect of the game is certainly that of the soundtrack, copied by weight from the previous chapters, without worrying too much about updating the music and sound effects.", "date": "2011-11-29", "grade": "8.5"}
