{"name": "Paraworld - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paraworld-recensione.html", "text": "that the real-time strategy genre needs a strong dose of innovation is a concept shared by the vast majority of enthusiasts Paraworld projects us into a world that is only partially similar to ours: first of all, the term ~old age~ does not exist since time will not be a source of change for our body and it is precisely for this reason that Jarvis Babbit, the scientist who had discovered this dimension, he locked up his younger colleagues: not to share the discovery with all of humanity but only with the adepts of his esoteric secret society. War is Over? But Paraworld is not a paradise and unfortunately there is war in this parallel dimension too. Opposing each other are prehistoric-like tribes but still equipped with particular technologies aimed at warfare (each has unique characteristics that the player will have to make the most of to have an advantage during conflicts). For combat then, the inhabitants of Paraworld have also found a way to tame the dinosaurs present in their world and as you can easily understand, the ~fire~ power of a T-Rex or the devastation capacity of a brontosaurus are literally shocking . Paraworld tries to turn the tables on real-time strategy Having analyzed the background of the title of Sek's Berlin programmers, let's try to examine the more strictly playful component. As written in the introduction paragraph, Paraworld also tries to change the cards on the table of real-time strategy: if the collection of resources is partially confirmed in the standards, the first novelty is represented by the ~experience~ factor in battle which allows one's units to upgrade and acquire new capabilities. Between the macabre and the grotesque, the unit of measure of experience is represented by the ~skulls~ of enemies killed in war. Another innovative aspect of the title starts from this element since you will have to forget the immense armies of other RTSs: in Paraworld we will have a limited number of units available (exactly 52) and the more we level up (there are 5) the more they will be limit the troops under your control until you have only one unit at the top of the pyramid upgrade system. Moreover, depending on which element we raise to the maximum level, the (positive) consequences will be different on all units of each upgrade level both in terms of combat and for the construction of buildings. Paraworld also presents a particular graphical interface on the left side of the screen renamed Army Controller with which we will always be able to keep all our men under control To all this particular system, further enriched by the presence of the most typical heroes, Paraworld also presents a particular graphical interface on the left side of the screen renamed Army Controller with which we will always be able to keep all our men under control and give them precise orders without even going to view them in the game itself. To make the gaming experience even more varied, there are also various RPG-style subquests (almost touching the adventure) which, according to the writer, however, turn out to be the least successful aspect of the game, nullifying (fortunately only in part) the excellent rhythm created by the level design of the more typically RTS missions. Diverse and alive Moving on to the technical aspect, one can only be impressed by the excellent work done by the three-dimensional graphics engine. The programmers make the best use of the vertex shaders and offer settings which, in addition to being very varied, are above all very ~alive~ (the wind blowing on each element of the vegetation is a real spectacle) to the player's eye. The very intense color palette and the character design of undoubted value are also decidedly commendable with the positive peak represented by the enormous dinosaurs present, animated in a truly convincing way. To have all this magnificence, however, you must have a medium-high range PC since the minimum requirements are indicated by a 1.6 GHz processor, 512 MB of ram and a video card with 128 MB but to go beyond the simple starting the program you will have to be closer to the recommended configuration which includes a 3 GHz processor and a GB of ram. Before closing the considerations on the aesthetic aspect of Paraworld, the excellent musical accompaniment worthy of a good cinematic feature should also be praised (sorry for the obviousness but it is easy to relate it to Jurassic Park) while the lack of Italian localization of the remaining English dialoguesese (but still subtitled in our language). the programmers make the best use of the vertex shaders and offer settings which, in addition to being very varied, are above all very ~alive~ Before reaching conclusions, let's look at the duration of Paraworld: in single player the title takes around 20 hours to complete, even if all bonuses and side quests could significantly increase the time spent alone in the parallel dimension. Then a multiplayer component is inevitable which provides the possibility of playing, on the 15 maps available, up to a maximum of 8 users: the more than typical deathmatch and team deathmatch modes are joined by the more sought after (at least in terms) Defender and Domination. The first is none other than ~one against all~ in which the unfortunate of the situation will have to try to resist annihilation for as long as possible. Domination, on the other hand, is a more high-sounding way of calling the ~capture the flag~... Final comment Paraworld is undoubtedly a nice breath of fresh air in the real-time strategy field. We are not facing a real revolution but we are witnessing small innovations in the management of troops, in their upgrade and in a gameplay full of elements from other genres. However, it is precisely in the RPG component, present in some quests, that we have found the only not entirely convincing element of the Koch Media production which under all other perspectives remains on excellent levels starting with the technical-aesthetic component, without forgetting the good plot and the originality of the background (not so much in an absolute sense as in the genre of RTS). If you are not afraid of dinosaurs, Paraworld is undoubtedly one of the most interesting real-time strategy games of recent times. Pros Many appreciable innovations Excellent technical realization Original setting for an RTS Cons RPG component not entirely convincing Lack of localization of the dialogues in Italian Wish to change That the real-time strategy genre needs a strong dose of innovation is a concept shared by the vast majority of enthusiasts. And so over the last few years, many development teams have tried, more or less evidently, to make changes to the more properly structural component of their RTS. Paraworld also plays its cards in this way but tries new ways also in terms of the imaginative universe of reference: no real conflicts of the past, no cyberpunk science fiction but a parallel dimension reachable through some portals in which three young scientists are locked up with a trap that they will have to forcibly put their own lives at stake.", "date": "2006-09-27", "grade": null}
