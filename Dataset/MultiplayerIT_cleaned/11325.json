{"name": "The Overtaker 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-overtaker-3d.html", "text": "A lot of water has passed under the bridge since Catacomb 3-D and Wolfenstein 3D, the founding fathers of the first person shooter genre, released for PC in the early 90s and developed by id Software. It was the birth of something completely new, which would have given rise not only to the resounding success of Doom, but also to an endless array of clones that still crowd the store shelves today, not only for PC but also for the various consoles. Over the years, FPSs have evolved from all points of view, and for their debut in the mobile sector, only a technical adaptation of the various terminals was expected, which until recently were unable to handle this type of graphics. Now it seems that all the development teams are trying to do something good within the genre, and Gameleons lays the foundations for a very interesting product, in which you don't drive the usual soldier but a sort of of robots, which must comply with the alarm systems of the laboratory in which it is located and face the threat posed by human soldiers. The original ideas of the game are not so much in the plot, just mentioned and never deepened, but in the possibility of taking over the body of one's opponents to turn around and eliminate them with their own weapons. The first approach with The Overtaker 3D is quite simple: the first of the twelve stages to be tackled constitutes a sort of tutorial, in which we are explained what to do and how to do it. The control system is immediately simple and immediate, with the joystick assigned to the movement and the 5 key which is used to fire the equipped weapon. We have to shoot a soldier so that he is momentarily paralyzed, then approach him to take control of him: at that point we will have his weapons and his vital energy available to complete the level and eliminate all the enemies we come across. The fact of being able to ~steal the body~ of enemies implies the possibility of abandoning a soldier who is now wounded or out of weapons in favor of a ~fresh~ one, while the collection of various weapons and objects works like in any other first person shooter. What changes, for sure, is the aiming system: when we have an opponent nearby, he will be automatically hooked by our viewfinder, to which we will only have to shoot to put him out of action. This function compensates for the lack of a command to move to the side, but in fact makes the clashes without particular depth: avoiding shots is almost impossible, so to stay alive you have to attack first, perhaps while the enemy is turned away. Another thing missing is the map, so we'll have to orient ourselves within the locations: this turns out to be a bit annoying, but it's even more annoying to note that the size of the stages is rather limited, and therefore we won't find particularly difficult to understand which way to go. To make things a little more complicated there will be the usual system of locked doors, so we'll have to find the right switch first and then we'll be able to move to an as yet unexplored area. The graphics engine used for the game is excellent, without a shadow of a doubt: the scenario flows rather fluidly, without uncertainties, and the level of detail is always more than acceptable. Even enemies, in the form of two-dimensional sprites, don't become the usual pile of pixels when they get close. The various locations are differentiated above all on the basis of the choice of colours, but the general result is more than discreet. The sound accompaniment is essential, as usual, while the control system performs well in every situation and, above all, allows the simultaneous pressure of two different directions, to move while turning.
