Urban's cry reaches all the western lands where the noble lords, moved by faith and the promised loot, decide to support the papal project and begin the march towards Jerusalem, which will culminate in the siege of the city which took place in 1099. Obviously the story is much more complicated than that, but space is tight and summarizing all those events in a few lines is impossible. After all, we are not here to write historical treatises, but to introduce a video game. Published by FX Interactive at a budget price, The Crusades is a real-time strategy game not too covertly inspired by the Total War series, of which it takes up some mechanics by inserting them into a simplified game structure, which adopts a more classic vision of the genre, above all at the concept level of the single player campaign, consisting of a series of linear missions introduced by a management phase. Before launching into battle it will be necessary to choose the troops, buy new ones, ask for reinforcements from allies, assign or sell relics to the selected noble and so on. Among the most important preliminary actions, there are the choice of the secondary missions of each map, which can complicate life a lot but which raise the reputation with the factions by yielding extra resources, and the training of the troops, with which it is possible to distribute skill points, improve the attack and defense of units or equip them with a captain. Bible and sword Once in the field it is possible to pause to study the maps and the visible forces. The first mission works as a tutorial and explains all the basic mechanics, including some power relations between the troops. As always archers are great against infantry, spearmen against mounted troops, crusaders for photos and heroes for collecting items. As Total War teaches, it is possible to exploit wooded areas to hide and set up ambushes, although in the course of the game it is more likely that the CPU-led armies do so. The pace of the game is rather slow and it is clear from the first skirmishes that making tactical mistakes can cost you dearly. It doesn't take much to transform an apparently well-planned action into a complete defeat and it is not rare to experience substantial troop losses due to carelessness in the assignment of orders. Just forget to factor in factors like unit fatigue or weather changes to end your crusade ignominiously. Therefore, if a minimum of planning skills is already necessary from the first missions, in the advanced ones, especially by activating all the secondary objectives, it becomes essential to win. Unfortunately, the lack of some options seen in other games is felt, especially as regards the selection and management of troop movements. The successful simplification, which will be appreciated by less shrewd and more direct strategists, is castrating on several occasions, sometimes creating confusion when assigning destinations or targets. Nothing tragic when you got to grips with the interface, but you could definitely put in a few more buttons for lineups. He knows that everything passes and everything leaves a trace Technically we are dealing with a fairly mediocre product. The close-up shots highlight the great lack of detail of the units, with just passable animations and some too many squaring, while the overviews involve a general flattening of textures and objects. Although the visual rendering is not exceptional, the graphics engine is decidedly heavy and at a high level of graphic detail the framerate undergoes very annoying and unjustified drops for what you see on the screen, also counting that a game like King Arthur manages to do a lot better while being much more fluid. From an audio point of view, however, there are no ups and downs but only downs: the background music is not very inspired and unsuitable for the setting, moreover it has moments of asynchronous dramatization with respect to the action, i.e. the music rises in intensity in the dead moments tricking the player into looking around for an attacking army that will never arrive. The sound effects, for the sake of adaptation, are few and below average; just good to cover the silence.", "date": "2010-08-03", "grade": "7.0"}
