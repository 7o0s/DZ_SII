{"name": "Final Fight - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fight-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday The release of Final Fight in arcades in the early 1990s coincided first with an earthquake of unknown proportions, and then with the consecration of one of the greatest long-sellers of all time. Final Fight took to the extreme the sensation of speed, violence and adrenaline that other scrolling fighting games, the dominant genre at the time, could only suggest in comparison. With detailed sprites of unimaginable size, an adult and incisive comic style and the state of the art of visual cleaning of the time, Final Fight was and remains in the arcade a game with remarkable eye candy, with a very strong and recognizable style. The modern and apt soundtrack, full of memorable refrains and embellished with digitized sound effects, completed the gestalt. But the game's greatest offer was obviously in the frenzy of mechanics, capable of giving the best with two players. The choice between three characters with different ratios between speed, assault power and use of weapons, taken for granted today, was not at all at the time. As were the extreme variety of weapons that can be used against enemies, the destructive interaction with the environment, the lethal Haggar's flying pile drivers, the rotating special shots to get rid of enemies, the fights against bosses at the end level always different and differently lethal. Final Fight was a furious exercise in violent multiplayer advancement, slightly repetitive but with enough memorable situations and a pace to never tire. What is it today Today Final Fight, in its arcade version, remains everything it was in the past. But the same cannot be said of the present version for Wii, which is the hasty port for SuperNES proposed by Capcom in the period of launch of the console. The reason is obvious: the version available today for Wii, originally published for the sixteen-bit Nintendo, had been deprived of so many elements of the original that it almost made us regret the conversion. So fifteen years later, and after numerous other versions, sequels and conversions, its complete revival in the catalog can really horrify. The major flaw of Final Fight for SuperNES/Wii is certainly not that it presents itself with a slightly less incisive audiovisual appearance than that of the original, that it lacks a level due to alleged support restrictions (actually laziness in compression or choice to sell less capacious and cheaper cartridges), and not even the even more painful one of eliminating Guy, one of the three selectable characters. The biggest flaw, the one that irreparably undermines the conversion downloadable today on the Wii, is the absence of the multiplayer mode. Playing Final Fight without a beating partner is tantamount to undermining the very sense of maximum enjoyment that can be obtained from this game, a bit like playing Street Fighter II with a broken key or GTA without the possibility of beating up passers-by . To complete the list of hardships there is also the elimination of the beautiful and shaken thugs of the original, replaced with men in a moment of apex, fortunately never reached again, of Nintendo's itchy preventive censorship policy of the time. What is it today The arcade version of Final Fight is a game that you'll need to play until you pass out at least a couple of times before you can call yourself a video game enthusiast, and it would get four stars for its furious multiplayer adrenaline and its vicious and violent aesthetic. But in this SuperNES/Wii version, too many things have gone wrong: excellent reasons, then, to leave the game on the shelves; and, today, still valid to avoid downloading it for a fee, also considering the presence of other complete commercial conversions. Final Fight is more than a game: it's a piece of history, an evolutionary link, a source of videogame amarcord. No one, among those who lived and played in the years of its rage in the arcades, could try to deny having invested and squandered capital in furious beating sessions with the fighting game produced by Capcom. Today the game returns to Wii, but it is not the original arcade version. For the price of 800 Wii Points, owners of the new Nintendo game station will be able to download and play the SuperNES conversion, which is devoid of a character, a level, the crooked hoodlums and multiplayer mode. Is it always Final Fight?", "date": "2007-06-04", "grade": null}
