{"name": "Tutti al Luna Park!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82573-nuovo-carnival-arriva-il-luna-park-tutti-al-luna-park.html", "text": "Luna Park has always been seen as a mysterious world full of surprises, pure fun made up of dozens of attractions that appeal to young and old alike. Anyone who loves all of this can comfortably sit on the sofa at home and play New Carnival, which guarantees various events and contents worthy of a real amusement park. The title offers its players various types of game and succeeds in its intent through an always exciting and fun path. Let's start from the approach: a nice entrance managed by the Luna Park's ~magic hatter~, a nice little man who will then accompany us throughout our journey where, giving us a warm welcome with his mustache and wand, he will help us in our adventure through useful practical advice on the games and technical explanations of the same. Nuovo Carnival contains various new games and attractions not common to other games, supported by over 300 prizes ready for you including the most important: the crown of Grand Master of the Funfair. A peculiarity of the game is its compatibility with Wii MotionPlus, which offers greater precision and playability even if it is not necessary for the excellent rendering of the game. Come, gentlemen, come! Once the console is turned on, all that remains is to start playing: our ~magic hatter~ will therefore ask for the number of possible players, ranging from one to four, to be selected from as many playing cards that indicate the numbers at our disposal. In case there are more than two participants, it is possible to play in turns or simultaneously in split screen, while in some mini-games it is necessary to share the same area, as in ~Haunted House~, where you find yourself in the same trolley, each aiming at the demons around . Achievements, prizes and personal bests are tallied individually and can be found in Player's Avenue. It is possible to create your own alter ego choosing from the categories of boy, girl, woman and man. Obviously each character will have his name and in addition to that, the vast choice of hairstyle and total look where there are very few constraints that will be unlocked later only through a good execution of the game. Also in the Avenue of the Player, you can check your personal record and closely manage the deposit of accumulated prizes. Naturally the Luna Park offers us the sensation of actually being in an amusement park, just think of the virtual owners of the games who will create the right environment to start the game: they will charge us giving us advice, often they will also be sincere saying that we could have done better. In short, everything is real and helps immerse us in our game. The crossroads: Carnival and its thousand directions Initially you find yourself in front of a sign showing the five avenues available to you. Each destination includes different games and therefore objectives and paths to reach. As previously mentioned, we have the possibility to choose an optional path: a series of directions that will allow us to unlock objectives internally. For example, Viale Mistico contains some really interesting minigames such as William Tell, which particularly struck us since it falls into a truly ancient game category and, as the story itself tells, it is about aiming and hitting an apple that will move away with each shot increasingly making the enterprise more difficult. Of course, everything is managed by the Wii Remote with which you just aim, zoom with A and shoot with B. In Viale Topo, on the other hand, we were thrilled by the Haunted House, where while shooting ghosts, you have to be quick and shrewd to earn more points. Nuovo Carnival is a game for which it is not necessary to be real experts, indeed the determining role is played by the simplicity of each component except in some cases, such as Rimbalcesto or Vaschetta Rimbalzella where precision and skill will really determine victory. This title can be an excellent way to feel like a child again, perhaps while eating popcorn comfortably on the sofa at home.", "date": "2010-11-24", "grade": null}
