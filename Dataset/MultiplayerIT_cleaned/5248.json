{"name": "La strada giusta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174921-ride-2-la-strada-giusta.html", "text": "Exactly a year and a half has passed since Milestone, the largest and most productive Italian software house, published the first chapter of the new RIDE series, a controversial work which, despite the good foundations in terms of playability and variety, however, it has not managed to establish itself in the hearts of all virtual centaurs, due to an overall dated technical sector, some bugs and problems that have emerged especially in the console versions, such as the infamous and biblical loading times. Despite the undeniable mistakes of youth - it was the rest of the first, new intellectual property for the Milanese house after fifteen years - we still appreciated the courage expressed by the developers and the willingness to go and fill an important gap in the field of racing games , placing a (fun) motorcycle title capable of winking at the alchemy of Gran Turismo, thanks to a vast selection of bikes, customizations and a long-lived and layered career mode. A couple of weeks after the publication of the Ducati - 90th Anniversary spin-off, the awaited announcement regarding the development of RIDE 2 has arrived from Milestone, with the clear aim of perfecting and expanding the recipe of the original work, fleshing it out with new categories of bikes, tracks and modes. But not only. Launched last October 7 on all the main current platforms (Wii U excluded), we tested it thoroughly in the PC version, and we can already tell you that the steps forward have been different and tangible. Milestone's two wheels whiz back in RIDE 2, a more mature and complete chapter than the original Something extra If you didn't appreciate the first chapter at all, the risk of being burned even by its ~big fat~ sequel could not be completely excluded, however it would be a serious mistake to underestimate the painstaking work done by Milestone to improve the variety and solidity of the offer, which appears much more mature right from the access to the menus. The start screen, in fact, begins with the close-up of the cockpit of a motorcycle that lights up when the start button is pressed: the result is decidedly elegant, also thanks to the crystalline sampling of the engine and the various sound effects. Having appreciated the very first novelty, we were also pleasantly surprised by the renewed organization of the menus, more fluid and cleaner than the original work, while keeping various structural characteristics intact. The pages dedicated to the dealerships and the upgrade shop are now completely similar to those of the Forza series, with the possibility of quickly scrolling through the silhouettes of the racing cars, checking their performance (from the PP score) and quickly entering the showroom, where you can admire the details of the beautiful polygonal models. We also noticed that the uploads are significantly more streamlined, at least on PC. Important numbers are usually expected from the second chapter of a racing saga, and from this point of view RIDE 2 does not disappoint: the bikes have almost doubled, and thanks to the new categories, i.e. two-stroke (like the legendary Cagiva Mito), caf racer and supermotard, the threshold of about two hundred racing cars is nearly reached. This is an important added value that enriches the gameplay and also involves the previously appreciated classes, such as naked, superbike and super sports bikes. Among the new brands introduced, in addition to the aforementioned Cagiva, we find Magni, Mr Martini, Husqvarna, TM with the bad SMX Supermotard Competizione and Horex, which join other niche manufacturers and the much more substantial fleets of Aprilia, BMW, Yamaha , Honda, Suzuki, Ducati, MV Agusta and Bimota. In short, if you are passionate about two wheels, in the plank developed by Milestone you will most likely find the bike of your dreams, or perhaps the one you pamper in your garage. If two hundred vehicles are not enough for you, together with the game it is possible to purchase a season pass which will include all the DLC racing cars from now until July 2017, without forgetting the monthly program of free content announced by the software house in via Fara. The garage therefore amply satisfied us, and we can also say the same thing about the number of circuits, doubled compared to the original offer: in fact, we have gone from fifteen settings to about thirty, with the introduction of new - and very much in demand - types of tracks such as the Road Race Tracks, i.e. the mileage Northwest 200 and Ulster GP, as well as the infamous ~Green Hell~ Nurburgring Nordschleife. With the arrival of the supermotards, the ad hoc circuits could not be omitted, and in RIDE 2 we find the Castelletto di Branduzzo (Pavia) motodrome for this purpose, the ~South Milano~ track in Ottobiano and the Franciacorta ~DanielBonara~ in Bargnana Castrezzato, all fun, technical and very Italian routes. The gameplay relating to this specialty, as it was legitimate to expect, is ~contaminated~ by the valid ingredients already appreciated in Valentino Rossi: The Game, and is therefore pleasant and well differentiated from the rest of the offer.The country routes, among RIDE's most popular, are enriched with Hellenic Towers (Greece), Valley of the Vikings (Norway) and Eastern Mountains (Indonesia), all available in several variants and with conditions different weather conditions, while among the real circuits Monza, Vallelunga and the Nurburgring GP make their debut.The wide range of tracks ends with the city track of Macau, which accompanies the old Milan and Miami, and three ~Drag Strips~ dedicated to Still on the content front, one of the most interesting features of the first RIDE was the personalization of the rider and motorcycles, a further in-depth feature with hundreds of new parts; as regards racing cars, it went from 800 to 1200 components (many of which licensed), while clothing has gone from 400 to over 800 items, with the possibility of setting up to six distinct presets. Another fanciful novelty is the so-called ~racing tuning~ for sixteen specific models (ten superbikes and six supersports), which allows the bikes to be transformed into monsters to be unleashed in Pro Racing races. Centaur life Similarly to the previous chapter, the beating heart of the single player experience lies in the full-bodied World Tour, in which the player is committed to climbing a world ranking starting from the three hundredth position. The events, as well as in classes introduced by cutscenes, are divided into groups of increasing difficulty, furthermore at the end of each season special races (by invitation) are unlocked where you can conquer the most exclusive racing cars. The number of game modes has increased from ten to fifteen, and in addition to championships, quick races, endurance and time trials, there are other more original ones. In trackday, for example, a certain number of ~Sunday drivers~ must be passed within the time limit; in head-to-head you compete against another skilled centaur in the midst of rookies, while in Drag Race you embark on blistering drag races with a mandatory manual gearbox. Among the novelties of RIDE 2 we find the ~Perfect Trajectory~, where it is necessary to face a path between the cones, and Squadra VS Squadra, with two teams of four riders who compete to grab the best score. In the Challenges, daily and weekly races with specific objectives, it is also possible to win so-called ~Tokens~ to invest in the Bonus RIDE section, which allows you to unlock discounts, extra credits and improve the skill level of your teammates, to be engaged in a special menu. As far as multiplayer is concerned, in addition to the appreciable split screen, it is possible to face online races and championships with up to a maximum of twelve players and with a good filter system. In this regard, in our tests the netcode was solid overall, but there was some lag. In terms of gameplay, although there are subtle differences and improvements in the physical model, especially as regards driving in the wet, it is possible to refer to what was written for the first episode. We are therefore faced with the three classic solutions for the physical-dynamic model (standard, semi-pro, and pro), which allow us to pass from pure arcade to a system with some nuances tending towards realism, but without ever embracing the simulation proper . Playability, also enhanced by the features introduced in Valentino Rossi: The Game thanks to the collaboration with the VR46 Riders Academy, is always fun and rewarding, prompting the player to constantly improve their performance on the track. The differences between the various motorcycle classes are perceptible, and naturally a supermotard, a 700 cc naked and a very powerful superbike have completely different reaction times and behaviors, especially when experimenting with pro physics, which requires skilful throttle management and brakes if you don't want to end up constantly on the ground. In this regard, the rewind system has been made more permissive, while one has been added to the riding aids which makes it easier to manage the bike when you end up off the track. RIDE 2 is also exciting at intermediate difficulty levels, however the artificial intelligence, which once again makes use of the so-called Virtua Riders similar to the Drivatars of Forza Motorsport, sometimes appears too impetuous, overwhelming the player busy brushing the trajectories. Thanks to the performance points system and aiupgrades the balance between the different motorcycles has finally been improved, although in some classes there are still means that are still too competitive or too scarce. A look to the future Among the most discussed aspects of RIDE there was certainly the technical sector, considered by many to be backward from various points of view, despite being appreciated for the bikes and some tracks. Still linked to the old Milestone graphics engine, RIDE 2 unfortunately cannot work miracles, but several and substantial steps forward are undeniable, both in terms of optimization and in the quality of the visual impact. With our test configuration, which you find indicated in the box below, we were able to play it in 4K and 60 frames per second with all the details at maximum, with the exception of the antialiasing filter which weighs especially in Indonesia. Above all, the country settings, both old and new, give the best satisfactions, but also the city tracks have not been neglected. Suffice it to observe the new Macau, which although not comparable to the Surfers Paradise of Forza Horizon 3, has numerous details and a fair polygonal complexity. The Nurburgring Nordschleife and some sections of the very long Northwest 200 and Ulster GP are also very good, although some areas are a little too poor and aseptic, moving away from urban complexes. Among the best aspects of RIDE 2 there is certainly the lighting, capable of giving a discreet realism effect on certain tracks, also thanks to the care dedicated to shaders and part of the textures. The rendering of the mirrors, the view from the helmet, the rain effect and the animations have also been improved, while still presenting some smudges in the accidents. The roars of the engines are also good, well diversified from each other and with a certainly more realistic timbre: of course, there is no shortage of unrefined engines, especially among the fastest classes, but overall an appreciable job has also been done in terms of three-dimensionality. Returning to the graphic options, among the advanced ones we find the detail of the reflections, the quality of the motorcycle models, the AFX, the high-resolution textures and those of the track, which can use up to 4GB of video memory. Overall there are not many but they allow a good scalability, also in the light of the best optimization. With our configuration the fluidity is anchored to 60 frames per second in 1080p and 2K with all the details at maximum, while in 4K it can hiccup while the polygonal models of the bikes are loaded before a race and in other rare cases: unfortunately we have to underline the presence of a pinch of stuttering, which appears from time to time without however disturbing the enjoyment of the product. The hope is that it will be totally eliminated with a patch or with dedicated drivers.", "date": "2016-10-09", "grade": "8.2"}
