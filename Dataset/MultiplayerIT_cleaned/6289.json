The collection packaged by Konami nominally includes thirteen titles, even if often the experiences somehow repeat themselves: from the two famous scrolling fighting games for arcades to their transpositions on SNES and Mega Drive, passing through the reinterpretation in a fighting game key to encounters and sorties into the wild 8-bit territories of the NES and Game Boy. Structure and contents Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, the first arcade episode The setting of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is of a traditional nature, albeit with some solutions that leave us a bit dumbfounded. From the main menu it is possible to access the thirteen games we have mentioned, which are the following: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time (arcade) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time (SNES) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters (SNES) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist (Mega Drive) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters (Mega Drive) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game (NES) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project (NES) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters (NES) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan (Game Boy) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers (Game Boy) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue (Game Boy) As it is easy to see, many names are repeated and not by chance: they are almost always reinterpretations of the same product, although sometimes with notable differences. In general, the entire saga starts on coin-op and then arrives on consoles (with the sole exception of TMNT for NES), trying in some way to cope with the inevitable technological limits of the machines of those times, in particular the 8-player systems bit.Each title can be played by selecting the starting level and the degree of difficulty, as well as different display options (framed, full screen, stretched to reach 16:9) and filters, saving systems not originally present and even a rewind feature that allows you to rewind the action in case of problems. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, Turtles in Time for SNES We were talking about solutions that leave us a bit dumbfounded, such as the idea of inserting a preselection related to the chosen character even before launching a game from the collection, as if it weren't possible to do it in the original menu and, likewise, opt in advance for multiplayer for two or four players, locally or online, where present, i.e. in arcade titles and those for 16-bit consoles. After that, as with any self-respecting collection of classics, there is a virtual room where you can consult a large amount of materials related to the games included in the package: from the packaging to the manuals, from the advertisements to the comic book covers, from the preparatory sketches to the frames of the episodes of the various television series dedicated to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Gameplay: between ups and downs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, the first arcade episode As could be expected, the experience offered by the Cowabunga Collection is extremely variable in terms of solidity and ability to entertain even today. It's the two arcade games that dictate the pace and, despite all their limitations, they still prove to be very pleasant, fluid and colorful. Of course, the repertoire available to the characters is limited to say the least in the first of the two episodes, but Turtles in Time proves to be more complete and mature, introducing the now iconic opponent's throws towards the screen (we talked about it, not surprisingly, in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge review), improved animations and sound effects. you encounter a slipperiness and inconsistency that is still hard to swallow, even after all this time. It is therefore very interesting to note how the SNES conversion of Turtles in Time does much better from this point of view, enhancing each shot and returning a sensation of considerable impact, while making compromises as regards the animations. In that sense, The Hyperstone Heist is something in between.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, Tournament Fighters in the Mega Drive version The fighting game Tournament Fighters represents a more unique than rare case: the same game, not particularly brilliant, which however changes considerably depending on the platform, with the SNES version that frankly we didn't like very much, the nicer Mega Drive aesthetically and also as a roster and finally the NES which immediately turns out to be really too limited to be able to compete in any way with the ~older sisters~. In general, the transition to the 8-bit classics is perceived in a traumatic way: the age and the limitations of the original experiences are felt a lot, also with regard to collision detection, while graphic glitches and slowdowns can possibly be removed via an option. You're unlikely to release the four episodes for the NES and the three episodes for the Game Boy except out of curiosity, by the way. Update: the article has been updated to mention that there are options to remove the slowdowns and glitches present in the original versions of the games .", "date": "2022-08-29", "grade": "6.5"}
