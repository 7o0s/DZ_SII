Find yourself there, in the middle of the world of Star Wars (to say it nostalgically of the Italian name), which comes to life through a first-rate graphic sector, surrounded by the swarm of blaster shots, exchanges of jokes and other sound effects left imprinted indelibly somewhere between the ear, the brain and the heart, while in the background the immortal scores of John Williams gallop imperiously is an intoxicating experience. The exaltation could even last just a handful of games or even a few months, depending on how compelling the supporting game formula is, but unless you are intolerant of the imagery created by George Lucas you cannot remain impassive in front of the way in which DICE was able to understand its soul, then giving it body through the audiovisual wonders of Frostbite. In short, fanservice served on a silver platter. To the outings among the deserts of Tatooine, the frozen expanses of Hoth and the forests of the Moon of Endor finally adds one of the courses long coveted by fans, the Death Star, which also brings with it those that were seen as little justified absentees , or the battles in space. Have we reviewed the Death Star, the definitive Star Wars: Battlefront DLC? Use the force, Luke With Death Star, DICE has been able to make a virtue of license. The highlight of this paid content is in fact the new Battle Station mode, which reconstructs the ending of Episode IV: A New Hope in playable form. It is a type of game structured in three different moments, which alternate the two souls of Battlefront (combat between starfighters and infantry), refreshing both. The first round sees the Rebellion and the Empire face off near an asteroid field, with the former busy shooting down Star Destroyers and the latter, of course, having to stop them. The presence of specific objectives, made available under certain conditions, a bit like in Walker Assault, makes this mode more structured and tactical than the usual Fighter Squadron. And the gameplay also comes out well, given that the fact of fighting among floating debris and wreckage brings with it multiple ideas in terms of dogfight and opportunities to test one's talent as a pilot with respect to the substantially clear air spaces furrowed so far. The second phase takes place inside the Death Star, obviously reconstructed in great detail (you can also visit a certain waste disposer...). Here the game resembles a sort of Playload, with the rebels having to venture inside the base, reach R2-D2 (who, as we know, has the data to destroy the imperials' ultimate weapon in his memory), and return on the bridge, to extract it. The map, as alluring in scenic terms as it is ordinary in planimetric terms, does not turn out to be particularly brilliant and the dynamics in fact do not change much compared to the chaotic and spam-filled routine that ends up distinguishing Battlefront's indoor battles. If nothing else, the particularly high pace imposed by the lens, which forces an almost continuous forcing, both on the ~going~ and on the ~return~, makes the action always rather intense, suitable for describing the importance of the events. In the next fraction you're back outside, back on the fighters, flying over the surface of the Death Star. The events of the film are well transposed from celluloid to pixels, entrusting the rebels with the task of supporting their companions, eventually seeing the responsibility of slipping through the claustrophobic channels of the structure and attempting to deliver the decisive blow for victory fall upon them. Just like Luke Skywalker did. The impression of reliving the final stages of the chapter that almost forty years ago gave birth to the brightest star in the sci-fi universe as protagonists is really powerful, while playing in these situations. Quite a bit scaled down, however, Death Star comes out when you want to try your hand at some other modality, having to settle for only the Fighter Squadron (in the space areas just described) and Elimination (in three different areas of the interior of the base). In addition to routine but still appreciated additions such as a couple of new cards, Red X-wing 5 (Luke's fighter) and Advanced TIE (Vader's), two new heroes enter, Chewbacca and Bossk. Request to gran rumor, the Wookiee does not disappoint, proving to be a powerful and at the same time flexible character, thanks to the versatility of his crossbow. The bounty hunter is not bad either, who has considerable firepower, combined with some characteristics bordering on superheroes deriving from his belonging to the Trandoshan race. Lastly, the new entries in the arsenal are really excellent: the TL 50, a blaster which, in addition to whirling triplets, has a loaded concussion shot, and the K-16 Bryar, a pistol also equipped with a secondary function by the similar effects, valid on medium-long range. It is a pity that, as is now customary, they must be unlocked through the Hutt Contracts, making them enter that perverse spiral that pushes the chase for in-game currency and requirements that force one to get lost in delays or following specious objectives. A way like any other to try to artificially lengthen the longevity of a game that has always had big problems in maintaining its appeal already in the medium term, keeping people there to ~farm~, or to lead the not very patient into temptation. by clicking on the All in One item and put your credit card in hand, to have everything immediately.
