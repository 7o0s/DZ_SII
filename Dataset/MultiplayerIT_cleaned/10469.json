There is not yet a consolidated tradition of driving games on the iPhone, so it is with pleasure that we have welcomed the release of BMW Sauber F1 Team Racing 09, a title created under a BMW license which puts us at the wheel of the white and blue single-seater with the possibility to choose a driver between Nick Heidfeld and Robert Cubica. This choice clearly does not produce results on the track, as indeed in the vast majority of F1 simulations. After the introductory movie, we can play the classic quick game, compete in the time attack, try our hand at an entire season (limited to eight circuits, however) or purchase a package separately that includes some nice extra challenges, the cost of which must therefore be added to the 1.59 euros required for the purchase of the Artificial Life product. The game puts us in a position to adjust the car settings to meet our driving style, so we can change the tire compound, the height from the ground, the angle of the ailerons... all things that unfortunately on the track , it is very difficult to consider why we have to be careful not to crash and to brake at the right time, without losing speed completely. A factor, this, far from negligible. The need for speed BMW Sauber F1 Team Racing 09 is a fast, very fast racing game, but unfortunately it seems that the developers have only been concerned with this element, putting factors such as playability and fluidity of graphics in the background, which never as in this case appear closely related. The control system is in fact based on the accelerometer, ergo you have to tilt the iPhone as if it were a steering wheel for our single-seater to change trajectory, with no alternative possibilities. In short, it is not some relaxing entertainment that can make your return from work more pleasant, but a very demanding experience, which requires quick reflexes and a good dose of patience. The problems arise from the fact that everything moves too jerkily (looking at 12-15 frames per second) for it to be possible to approach the curves with the necessary precision. Added to this is an absolutely forgettable brake and accelerator management: located on the left and right of the touch screen respectively, these two buttons produce an immediate and non-gradual response. When we brake, the car does not decelerate: it stops; and when we accelerate, it literally rockets off. The addition of a sort of ~boost~ on consumption, in this context, unfortunately does not improve the reality of a rather poorly designed and manufactured product. Which is a pity, because the graphics in themselves are far from contemptible: the polygonal models of the single-seaters appear to be fairly well made, the sense of speed (underlined by kinetic lines) is high, there is good light management and the tracks appear reproduced quite faithfully. There are only eight cars in the race and the names are completely made up, the effect of the rain is convincing and the first person view helps to increase the immersion. On the other hand, there is little to say about the sound: if the roar of the engine is still saved, the collision effects are unfortunately out of place in their disarming simplicity.
