There are always fundamental differences between the characters, which it is necessary to exploit in order to solve different puzzles (those who jump higher, who are able to operate certain types of statues, or who manage to translate inscriptions in ancient languages, for example example), but most situations require the use of various types of objects. These, obviously, are the typical accessories of the Lego world: shovels, wrenches and various tools but also weapons of different types. The structure of the game is a mixture of action and adventure, largely focused on almost Zelda-style puzzle solving. In general, each area in which we find ourselves operating is full of small puzzles and puzzles to solve. Some of these are obvious and necessary for the continuation of the game, but many others are more subtle and hidden, and open the way to further bonuses and secret areas. In addition to simply eliminating enemies, it is necessary to identify these ~hot spots~ and operate on them to move forward, moving levers and mechanisms, collecting keys to open doors or operate gears, almost always with the need to use the various objects available to deal with various situations. Furthermore, being able to carry only one object and one weapon at a time, it becomes necessary to delegate the action to one or the other of the two characters available, and sometimes carry out a little backtracking or careful research to find the tool capable of unlock the situation. By always staging two characters, Lego Indiana Jones is a title designed to be fully enjoyed together with a companion, who can jump into action at any time by taking control of the ~sidekick~, otherwise entrusted to the (not very brilliant) artificial intelligence (although you can switch from one to the other at any time), and many of the puzzles involve the simultaneous and differentiated use of the two characters on the screen. Xbox 360 goals The amount of secrets and additional elements to discover is also demonstrated by the organization of unlockable achievements. There are 50 of them for a total of 1000 points, but the richest ones are intended for those who persevere the most in the search for treasures, bonuses and secondary roads. Completing each level adds 10 points to your Gamerscore, and as there are many, just progressing to the end can collect a tidy stack of points, but the achievement structure in this game certainly rewards the headstrong and well-meaning adventurer more. to engage in extra research. Super Deformed Indy It is obvious that a large part of the charm of this game is to be attributed to the historical scenarios and characters of the Indiana Jones trilogy. The reinterpretation in a Lego key is yes childish, but with its parodizing capacity it is extremely pleasant even for the older ones and those nostalgic for the old cinematic chapters, as is evident in the cut-scenes (always in Lego style) which precisely reproduce some scenes from the films implicitly making fun of them (if only for the need to transform them into ~silent~ scenes, and therefore closer to real gags). The care taken in the packaging of this title is demonstrated by both the good technical quality and the large amount of content. Graphically, the result of the transfiguration of the typical Indiana Jones scenarios in the Lego universe is remarkable, with elements of the backgrounds that exactly reproduce the components of the buildings we know from childhood with excellent technical quality, although in some cases there is an evident tearing problem avoidable by selecting the V-sync option (with consequent loss of fluidity, conversely). The musical accompaniment, on the other hand, is a true celebration of the historic Indiana Jones soundtrack, inserted exactly in the moments of the action corresponding to those of the films. The amount of bonuses - a feature also common to the LEGO Star Wars series - is impressive, and pushes you to play and replay the story of all three films until you discover all the characters and all the hidden treasures, which can then be consulted inside of the University, location that is the central point of the game. The story mode is not very long, but with these incentives the conclusion is extended by a lot, and children in particular will find themselves motivated to replay the levels to discover the elements left out during the first ~pass~.", "date": "2008-06-12", "grade": "8.0"}
