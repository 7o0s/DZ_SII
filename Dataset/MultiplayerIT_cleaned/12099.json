{"name": "Resident Evil: The Missions", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-the-missions.html", "text": "A dutiful premise: the game subject of this review is the 2D version of Resident Evil: The Missions, completely different from the three-dimensional counterpart. In fact, if the latter follows the style of the first console titles, what we are dealing with here is a sort of ~static~ FPS, a definition that we will immediately illustrate. The action is framed from a first-person view, which shows pre-rendered backdrops against which sprites of zombies and monsters of various types stand out: the user has the simple task of moving the crosshair left or right and shooting everything that it moves. An objectively very little developed gameplay, but which works very well thanks above all to a couple of well-studied tricks. First of all, the enemies that appear on the screen are all provided with a progressively filled indicator which, once full, allows them to attack: the player must therefore first identify the most dangerous targets, to shoot them and temporarily reset the threat. The various weapons then have different effects on the game's tactics: for example, the shotgun is powerful but takes a long time to aim, while the Remington 870 has automatic aiming but also limited ammunition. Resident Evil: The Missions also features a dynamic progression system: to give an idea, after the first level you can choose whether to face stage number 2 or 3, thus proceeding by crossroads up to the base of the pyramid made up of all 50 missions offered by the product. Consequently, to have access to each single scenario, it will be necessary to replay the Capcom title several times, an expedient capable of soaring the replay value without boring the user by proposing situations already seen. The nature of the missions is also quite diversified: we go from the indiscriminate killing of zombies to the protection of innocent civilians, with different variations in between that help in some way to alleviate the fundamental repetitiveness of the gameplay. Although it is therefore not a monument to videogame complexity, Resident Evil: The Missions can constitute a worthy and lasting pastime, even if not suitably supported by a graphic realization up to par. The Capcom product is in fact based exclusively on static backdrops that are not too defined and on rather rough sprites with few animations, therefore far from the quality standards that we are now used to finding in mobile games. PRO Simple and fun Quite diverse missions High replay value AGAINST Sub-standard graphics Limited targeting system", "date": "2007-07-25", "grade": "S.V."}
