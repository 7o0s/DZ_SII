Games, co-developers with Simbin of GT Legends and GTR 2, marks a turning point for Electronic Arts for its most famous automotive franchise. It is a real reboot, a completely new concept. Our need for speed is not satisfied in illegal city racing, watching out for the benevolent eye of the police, but as in a classic racing title, where progression is linked to our skill in a series of competitions around the world. The distortion of the game mechanics represents a risky bet that could alienate many historical fans of Need For Speed, but which in the light of our test is definitely won. In short, Shift collides head-on with the various Gran Turismo and Forza, also thanks to some interesting features that distinguish it from the competition. Levels, medals and stars The game unfolds through different types of competitions divided into 4 brackets: once you reach a high enough score, you unlock access to the world tour, a real automotive Champions League. The offer of competitions is very varied: in addition to the races even over several rounds against a maximum of twelve opponents, the special events against a single driver are definitely appreciated, while remaining within the ambit of the races present in the standard package of all the titles of this genre, we find the timed races, the elimination ones, some focused on duration, the cross and delight of every racing game lover and the drifts, which unfortunately represent the weak link of the lot, being that something more which however clashes with the inside of the game: unfunny, hard to master and frankly forgettable. In fact, the progress in Shift is divided into two distinct and separate parts, the level of the pilot and the calculation of the stars. The first evaluates our way of driving, whether we prefer precise or aggressive driving, thus counting, for example, the doors and the slips in the corners rather than the constant holding of the trajectory and the races without accidents. For each level advancement, there are cash prizes but also new liveries, finishes, rims but above all free cars and invitational competitions. The latter vary depending on how you drive, if you are a junkyard we will often run in elimination events, if you are a virtuoso of the trajectory we will find ourselves engaged in races against the clock. In addition to the cash prizes, which are used to buy new cars and the various car upgrade steps, Shift rewards the player with various medals, related to the achievement of objectives that refer to the way you drive and the cars used. They are of two types, the minor ones and the master ones, the latter are obtained as the minor ones are won, starting from the bronze one and ending with the platinum one. The stars, on the other hand, represent the evaluation yardstick of each individual competition. It is not enough just to finish first, but depending on the type of event it is necessary to obtain particular results in the race, which refer to the peculiar characteristics of the two driving styles. Once you reach a certain number of stars, the next tier of competitions is unlocked. We don't know if this is wanted in the design phase but unfortunately we are often forced to redo a race several times, because perhaps we aimed for the podium on the first attempt but if we also want to earn the bonus stars it may be necessary to throw our opponents off the road , send them into a spin or focus on drifting around corners. This introduces a criticality, or rather a certain underlying short circuit of the Electronic Arts game. Shift is a fundamentally simulative title, the physics of the car is credible and by resetting the aids it forgives little or nothing, why then insert objectives that induce the player to drive incorrectly by throwing the opponents off the road and sending them into a spin regardless of the safety of their vehicle and the desire, purely simulative, to be as technical as possible so as to set the best time? Simulation for everyone Dualism in game mechanics but also dualism in the way of interpreting the question of simulation and realism. The refined and meticulous mechanical tuning of the cars, but completely complete only with the purchase of the body kits, is another indication of Slightly Mad Studios' desire for realism. With every slightest change in set-up, a decisive change in the driving pattern is noticed on the car. In short, it is recommended to act up to downforce, height from the ground, gear ratios and so on, given that some cars, such as those with rear wheel driveore are hard racehorses to tame. The same sensation is felt with the automatic upgrade levels of the cars, which work in a similar way to those of Gran Turismo, and concern all parts of the car, such as weight, engine, clutch, nitro, suspensions but also for new interiors and tires wider and softer, to be applied rigorously in full so as not to show up on the track with an unbalanced and not very reactive car. Unfortunately, a realism, in some cases exaggerated, of four-wheeled vehicles, does not always correspond to a realism of the physics of collisions and damages. The game thrives on the extremes of the consequences of collisions: it tolerates, indeed encourages support when cornering to overtake, but if you put two wheels on dirt or grass in some cases it becomes impossible to get the car back on track. There is no actual damage to the car. On the one hand, as we will explain later, everything was focused on the driver's vision deficit, with the rear window cracking, with the car's continuous jolts and jolts and with the color changing to gray after impacts of a certain importance. The large splashes of paint on walls and guard rails, as well as making the car often lose little speed, do not imply a coherent destruction with the impact of the vehicle. After several suicide attempts, only the loss of the bonnet and front and rear dents (the side parts of the car seem immune to damage) were witnessed, while in terms of mechanical damage, apart from a progressive but never uncontrollable heeling of the car, we have not noted malus. No decrease in speed, acceleration or braking power. In short, it seems that in Shift they wanted to look for a certain realism, focusing only on the driving model of the cars, however looking for a more arcade, and therefore more immediately fun, approach to the conduct of the race. Ultimately, however, this strange balance holds: if the developers are cursed for the forced search for the best trajectory, however, they are thanked for the tolerance placed in the bumps and in the doors. What matters most, however, is that the experience, the driving feeling is at the highest levels, there is never frustration and thanks to the technical peculiarities of the game, the identification is if possible superior to the soon-to-be-released rivals. A game therefore with a transversal approach to the two stylistic canons of the genre, therefore a title that instead of mediating between simulation and arcade takes a bit of one and a bit of the other, without watering down the characteristics of both. The hard and pure might not like it, but objectively everything works and, more importantly, it's fun. Speaking of artificial intelligence, one cannot fail to praise the good work done by the developers. As the difficulty level increases, the malice of the opponents rises decisively, who fortunately make mistakes in a credible way, especially if put under pressure and luckily for us they never suffer from the notorious little train effect, and indeed they battle each other by exploiting the overtaking points differently every time. A decisive applause must be given to the one-on-one races, in which there is a decisive boost in the ability of the opposing driver and those in which the strongest driver in the group is signaled. In these cases the challenge gains in adrenaline. A few numbers and a splash of multiplayer The simulation nature of Shift is all concentrated in the driving options menu where it is possible to choose the degree of realism applied to the gameplay. In fact, as soon as it starts, the title subjects the player to a test drive and tries to automatically set these settings according to how it was driven. However, it will always be possible to modify the parameters by selecting a generic level of difficulty (easy, medium, difficult or pro) or by going into detail on values such as traction control, ABS or the realism of the damage. The fleet of Need for Speed: Shift settles on 60 cars that can be purchased through the dealership, plus another dozen additional cars that are unlocked as the driver levels up and can be used in multiplayer challenges. The car manufacturers taken into consideration range from the classic Audi, BMW (the M3 GT2, among other things, is the cover car of the game), Honda, Ford, Nissan to cars with a more exotic and performing flavor such as the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, the Lamborghini Murcilago, the Maserati MC12 GT1, the Mercedes SLR McLaren 722 Edition but unfortunately no Ferrari. In short, there is something for all tastes but in purely numerical terms the value is a bit low for a driving title that should aim for the simulation throne of the year. Among other things, the numerical question goesto add up to a basic problem of Shift's car fleet: the fact that for each category of cars there are a couple decidedly above all the others and at least as many completely unusable due to a driving model that is sometimes too extreme in recreate traction and excessive power drain. This translates into a fairly standardized process: as soon as the tier of cars is unlocked, one tends to buy an average vehicle, upgrades it up to about half of its characteristics, then sells it to buy the best car in the tier and proceeds with its tuning. Remaining anchored to the pure numerical description, Shift offers 37 different tracks: some really existing and others created by the developers. For the former it can be said that the fidelity in the reconstruction is practically total with the exception of some small variations in the arrangement of the curbs or trackside obstacles that Slightly Mad Studios has slightly tweaked to make driving more fun. As for the fictitious tracks, however, the work done to make them absolutely credible and very pleasant is excellent, especially in the long 1-on-1 challenges. In general, the variety in the settings is really very high: you go from mountain circuits to urban tracks, to get up to the ovals typical of Nascar competitions. As for the multiplayer Need for Speed: Shift does not shine for variety and content. In addition to the ubiquitous rankings with which we can compare our times with players from all over the world or maybe just friends, we basically find two modes. A simple versus classified or not, where you can play a race, a time attack or a drifting competition for up to a maximum of eight players using the cars in our garage or a small selection of standard cars. And an equally simple but more in-depth Driver Duel. In this case it is a competition in steps where we will face three rounds of preparation, the quarterfinals, the semifinals and the final. Each time we will face another driver of our same level driving the same car chosen at random by the computer and on a track that is also randomly selected. Playstation 3 trophies The game rewards the player with 30 trophies, 12 bronze, 12 silver, 5 gold and one platinum. The medals are all related to the progress in the game, consequently they are obtained by progressing in level and by unlocking the various game tiers up to the achievement of the world champion. The difficult part comes for the achievement of the partial and then total quota of the master medals, which will commit us several times to repeat the competitions to obtain all the necessary requisites for the unlock. Technology takes to the track Where Need for Speed: Shift runs smoothly and smoothly and cannot garner any criticism is from a graphical point of view. The backbone of the technical aspect of the game is its peculiar camera placed on the pilot's head and which helps to offer that sense of realism in the view from inside the cockpit. In fact, in accordance with physics, our avatar's point of view fluctuates and jumps, registering and respecting every application of gravitational forces. All combined with a skilful use of blur effects and vision dimming, help to offer a sense of identification rarely experienced in other driving titles. Seeing the mirrors or the odometer blur as we gain speed, or suffering the effects of a slight side impact or a head-on collision resulting in blindness and a jerk is something quite difficult to describe in words. The visuals from the outside or from the bonnet lose part of this simulation wonder, which also owes a lot to the faithful reconstruction of the dashboards with attention to many maniacal details, but at the same time they allow you to admire the graphic detail of Shift as a whole. In terms of effects, this Need for Speed respects the canonical standards to which we are accustomed, especially in terms of driving titles: HDR with annexed textbook lens flare, especially in mixed circuits full of ups and downs, a good particle that jumps out all sudden during the most extreme clashes and more generally a graphic detail that pours into excellent textures and qualitatively impeccable landscapes. The frame rate is nailed to 30 frames per second on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 (there were sporadic drops in frame rate in the classic post-departure chaos) while on PC 60 FPS and beyond are very easily reached, even on our computer testing where the game was run at 1920x1200 with anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering at", "date": "2009-09-11", "grade": "9.0"}
