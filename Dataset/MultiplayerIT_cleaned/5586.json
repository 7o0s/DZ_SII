We are talking about one of the largest companies in the world, which nevertheless faced such a delicate operation in an at least naive way, without first carrying out a decisive restructuring of a Windows Store that is still unpresentable today, without adopting sensible pricing policies (PC games cost less and less than the console counterparts, except in this case) and, above all, without solving some very important technical flaws that afflict UWP applications. It is quite clear that sharing the x86 architecture did not automatically allow developers to create perfect porting, an issue that in the case of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition has taken on grotesque connotations, making us wonder if the game had been minimally tested on AMD GPUs before of the launch. Not to mention the completely unjustified graphic ~weight~, if we consider what the title moves on the screen and an engine, the Unreal Engine 3, which has always guaranteed excellent performance in a Windows environment. Thanks to the statements released by Remedy only a few weeks ago, the PC version of Quantum Break has therefore taken on an avalanche of expectations, placing itself as the product that could finally confirm the promises made or witness a further loss of credibility by by Microsoft. The PC version of Quantum Break is a product of two souls: the game is good, the conversion bad Fight for freedom The technical analysis of Quantum Break for PC is full of fascinating aspects. Wanting to make a recent comparison, we could say that the impact of the Remedy title on CPU and GPU is similar to that of Rise of the Tomb Raider, although the two games use resources very differently: Crystal Dynamics' adventure relies on particularly large scenarios, whereas the new product by the authors of Alan Wake uses much smaller locations, however trying to enhance them through the use of sophisticated effects. The price to pay on Xbox One for this type of approach was a resolution that starts natively at 720p and then undergoes an upscaling to 1080p, and in fact the exact same thing happens on PC: the filters try to mask the expedient, which in most of the sequences it is not noticed, but the reality is this. Thanks to the excellent results obtained on consoles, there are very few differences between the Xbox One and Windows 10 versions of Quantum Break, other than the quality of the shadows and the lighting system. Unfortunately, however, the question of the frame rate requires a separate discussion, with many problems due precisely to the use of the Universal Windows Platform. In fact, this architecture integrates a vertical synchrony system which at the moment cannot be deactivated (we will have to wait for May for a fix) and which ends up systematically choking the performance of the games. How? Limiting them on the one hand due to the impact of V-sync on performance, on the other by preventing the frame rate from reaching the refresh value of the screen used. In a nutshell, this means that even a PC equipped with top hardware cannot achieve 60 frames per second, unless you are using a monitor with a 120Hz refresh rate. Considering that we are talking about a product that renders at 720p upscaled to 1080p, that's a ridiculous result. The funny thing is that this phenomenon particularly affects high-end configurations, resulting in inconsistent performance that affects the enjoyment of the experience. There is also a problem with NVIDIA cards, since with a GTX 970 you don't reach 40 frames per second, whereas using equivalent AMD GPUs you get 30% better results. Bizarre, given that with Gears of War: Ultimate Edition it was the opposite. Win them all and come back to us In the face of the numerous analyzes carried out by international sites that have the necessary tools to carry them out, we have approached the PC version of Quantum Break ready for the worst. The video options screen includes various items, but does not allow fine tuning for certain features: the antialiasing filter is activated or deactivated, without allowing you to select its type, while for the shadows and the related filter, you only switch between the presets ~ medium~ and ~high~. There is the possibilityty to lock the frame rate to 30 frames per second, but this setting works very badly and the fluidity suffers: better to leave everything unlocked, whatever the performance. In our specific case, on a PC equipped with a 4 GHz overclocked AMD FX 8320 processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Jetstream video card, 8 GB of RAM and Samsung EVO 840 SSD, we obtained an at least consistent experience, with 35-40 constant frames per second in almost all situations, using 'high' quality textures instead of 'ultra', 1080p resolution, 'medium' shadows and all other effects maxed out. The frame rate drops that we feared so much, and which in some cases afflict products like Rise of the Tomb Raider on the same configuration, did not occur and we were able to complete the game without problems, with only some extra uncertainty during the last levels, it is not clear to us why. Of course, it must be admitted that we played practically as on Xbox One, at the same resolution and frame rate, with only slight improvements in shadow quality and effects, but using much more powerful hardware. Thanks to some details, such as the lack of the ~quit~ key in the main screen (you have to use the mouse to close the window, just like in a Windows application), our feeling is that the developers have simply taken the original version of game, to then insert it into a compiler that ~translated~ it to PC, as was done some time ago with Forza Motorsport 5 to test the versatility of DirectX 12. A hasty job without the necessary optimizations, therefore, that we could have accepted willingly in the case of a pure cross-buy, i.e. with the possibility of buying the game once and using it freely on Windows 10 or Xbox One (which was only possible in the digital pre-order phase), but certainly not paying 69.99 euros for the PC edition only on the Windows Store. Challenge time The technical question is central to the PC version of Quantum Break, given what has been said so far in relation to the conversion work carried out. However, behind the graphics there is a great game, as expressed in the original review, a title whose value is only partially affected by the failure to exploit the hardware on the Windows platform. An exclusive, we recall, which could very well have remained confined to Xbox One, and which instead was also granted to PC users, albeit with the connotations of a lacking and probably hasty porting. When the focus passes from frames per second to gameplay, the latest Remedy production proves that it has a lot to give, with an action shooter experience that closely resembles the mechanics of Alan Wake, still to be perfected in terms of direction (some passages direction are hasty, where they would have needed a few more seconds to express themselves at their best) but able to clear the dear old bullet time thanks to the powers of the protagonist of the adventure, Jack Joyce, who finds himself unwillingly involved in the experimentation of a time machine and becomes capable of shaping reality, creating stasis fields and making quick dash while his enemies move at normal speed. Features that the developers have used to the advantage of spectacularity and action, with exciting firefights in which you often have to avoid standing still behind cover and instead go on the attack, circling your opponents and hitting any weak points. Then there is the narrative element, which for the first time uses a mix of video games and live action to link the first four acts of the campaign and explore a series of supporting characters. An experiment that reveals itself in its own right, but which goes hand in hand with four crossroads in which we will take on the role of nemesis, Paul Serene, and we will have to make decisions that will result in the life or death of certain characters, although unfortunately this will not change the events of history, if not marginally. In our opinion, tying the theme of replayability to that of temporal manipulation is a brilliant intuition, and it is a pity that Remedy has not explored it in depth with the creation of alternative missions and endings. Also because the duration of the game is what it is: it will hardly take you more than ten hours to complete it, live episodes included. As further proof of the 1:1 conversion from Xbox One to PC, also in this edition there are unfortunately some sensational blunders regarding the audio mix, with sighs and rumblings fired at triple the volume of the dialogues, stupidly affecting an otherwise inept acting performancepibile: nobody asks to give up the audio dynamics by resorting to the normalization of the recordings, but also visually a recording made at triple the volume should be recognizable.", "date": "2016-04-10", "grade": "7.5"}
