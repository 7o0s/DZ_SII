{"name": "Blood Omen 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blood-omen-2_b.html", "text": "Would you like to play a vampire? This Blood Omen 2 is a full-fledged third-person action game. The shot (variable with the right analog stick) follows our protagonist in a more or less appropriate way except in some moments when it appears too close to Kain. The performable actions initially boil down to the usual run, jump and a few small three-hit combos. It is also possible to ~borrow~ some weapons from enemies, who will gradually lose their lives by your will, in order to exploit their destructive power (such as sticks, swords, spiked clubs, etc.). The main activity within the game is represented by the extermination of human and vampire enemies alternating with the resolution of some very simple puzzles, which are reduced to the usual ~pull the lever and open the gate~ of the Raiderian Tomb ... The learning curve of the available commands is quite short, thanks above all to our ~adventure companion~ Umah (a really beautiful vampire) who will guide and enlighten us, at least initially, in the use of the available keys. The response to the commands given to the black joypad is quite shrewd, even if it happens to press a key without the CPU detecting any stimulation. This seems strange but explainable. In fact, it certainly represents a small bug overlooked in the beta-testing phase. Our Kain, as well as the old (but, paradoxically, younger) Raziel from ~Soul Reaver 2~, can glide in the air by continuously pressing the X key. This comes in handy when it is necessary to make long leaps to access in particular areas of the scenario. The possibility of literally ~taking~ the blood from the victims in order to regenerate the vital energy of our (V)virtual alter-ego (where ~V~ stands for vampire) is very galvanizing. Other positive notes are found in some moments of the game, for example when receiving particular Dark Gifts (dark powers) that allow Kain to draw on various powers. To list a few, I could mention the Myst (i.e. the power to transform into fog like Alucard from Castlevania: Symphony of the night) with which to make oneself invisible to the eyes of enemies and hit them from behind. Cowardly but it works. But when dealing with demons every tactic is allowed and there is no loyalty that holds. The gameplay of ~BO2~ is compromised not so much in the control system (however basic and simple) as in the poverty of available attacks that lead to an exaggerated linearity of the levels which, to be solved, require very little effort, so as to make them almost useless the mystical powers they possess. Yes, at first it is gratifying to see how an enemy is beheaded without their knowledge by the lethal arm of Kain, but over time this is left in the background. The old ~Soul Reaver 2~ on PS2 was much deeper from this point of view, both for the difficulty in the fights (here too simple) and for the AI of the enemies, and for the faculty given to Raziel to cross at will the threshold of the ghostly world. This possibility enriched and deepened the general enjoyment and feeling of the old product. It's not that this episode is bad from a gameplay point of view, quite the contrary. The only problem lies only in the excessive linearity caused by the aforementioned factors. Which is certainly no small thing if we also consider a certain lack of frenzy during the clashes (that of ~Devil May Cry~, to be clear). Splattering blood! On a technical level, the Eidos Interactive product does not excel at all. The polygonal models certainly do not represent the maximum in terms of attention to detail, even if they reach sufficient quality levels. The video update also suffers a lot in too many moments of the game. Even small rotations of the shot make the polygonal engine sweat leading to frequent slowdowns that greatly affect playability. Really annoying. I really don't think that all this is the fault of the Sony hardware... In spite of these carelessness, we must underline the excellent design of the architecture of the buildings that contribute to giving the game that gothic atmosphere that goes well with its script. Another positive detail is represented by the definition of the backdrops (all anti-aliased!). Unfortunately the same speech does not apply to the care placed in the character design, rather crude. To try to improve a situation that is not exactly good, some quite nice light effects and shadow plays intervene, but nothing that makes you cry for a miracle. Due to the technical defects just reported, the title developedCreated by Crystal Dynamics it does not exalt from a cosmetic point of view. Trying it, in fact, it seems to be faced with a game that came out a long time ago. The previous chapter, starring Raziel, still makes the shoes for this new production to justify the fact that the programmers have not created too many headaches in its realization. For this they have not been able to offer the public something innovative or, at least, comparable to what they had managed to come up with a few months ago. Blame the rush? The fact is that the owners of the black monolith, now ~spoiled~ by technically almost perfect titles, demand more; and this is more than justified. Dealing with the sound sector of the game, it must be said that the background music manages to embrace the general atmosphere, resulting in it being quite nice and enjoyable. The sound effects, however, appear dated and a little out of place. Especially those that accompany the blows inflicted in battle. While the dubbing deserves a little praise both in the lip synchronization and in the professionalism of the voice actors (Kain's screams or the voice of the sensual Umah are galvanizing). Kain thirsty for fans more than blood? As already explained, the main flaw of ~Blood Omen 2~ lies in its exaggerated linearity. In fact, proceeding through the levels (which all seem to have the same mechanics) and assassinating enemies is more of a pastime than a real action game. The puzzles, for their part, touch the bottom of simplicity as they can be solved even by five-year-olds (I'm not kidding!). But even the HP (vital energy) regeneration system does not try to solve the situation. Think that every enemy (human or otherwise) offers enough blood to recharge half an energy bar. Small gimmicks such as the ~Fury~ attack (available when the sword in the upper left of the screen fills with plasma) and the aforementioned Dark Gifts fail to deepen the longevity of the product much. The problem is that, playing it, you realize that everything runs too smoothly, without a hitch, and without anything particularly stimulating ever happening. Let's understand each other. ~BO2~ can be played quite well and in a pleasant way. But all this, as the hours go by becomes somewhat repetitive and boring. Maybe you'll play it, you'll have fun (but not too much, trust me), you'll finish it, but without it leaving a mark on you. Which, on the other hand, happens with thicker titles (such as the prequel). In conclusion, the Eidos product is nice, but nothing more and a little less. One of those painless games, like mosquito bites, suitable only for those people who, being fans of the entire saga, let themselves be dazzled by the vision of an entertainment that, in reality, is very limited. A mediocre game, an excellent commercial operation. Pros: Fun at first. Kain's powers are interesting. Cons: Overly linear. Painless. Frequent slowdowns. A jump into the past. This ~Blood Omen 2~ represents the fourth episode belonging to the vampire ~Legacy of Kain series~. It must be said, however, that since its first playful incarnation the series has radically changed its structure. In fact we started with ~Blood Omen~ (Pc and Psone) which was the result of a balanced combination of adventure and RPG elements. While already starting from the second chapter, ~Legacy of Kain~ (always PC and Psone), we have moved on to a real action game that has managed to attract hordes of gamers thirsty for virtual blood. History repeated itself a few months ago on Playstation 2 with the beautiful ~Soul Reaver 2~, very well received by critics. This ~BO2~ follows exactly the structure of the latter even if with some differences regarding other elements. First of all, the last episode takes a step (even a long one) into the past, narrating the events that took place many centuries before the evil Kain reigned over Nosgoth and about two hundred years after he turned into a vampire. These, after being defeated by the lord of the Seraphan and after being deprived of the legendary reaper of souls (or soul reaver) always by the same, has one desire: revenge! In this chapter, therefore, we will be called to impersonate the ferocious Kain and to guide him in his rise to power up to the inevitable clash with the bad guy on duty. More linear than that.", "date": "2002-05-14", "grade": null}
