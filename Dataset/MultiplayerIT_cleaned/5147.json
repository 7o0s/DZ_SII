This time the British software house returns to dealing with two-dimensional platformers, but always with the curious attitude that characterizes most of its productions: therefore, here is the Hop Swap here borrowing a progression system similar to that of Silly Sausage in Meat Land and exploits it within a playful structure that combines the usual simplicity with a design that enjoys turning things upside down... Hop Swap is yet another excellent Nitrome title: simple, fun and cared for in every respect Gialloblu I like you The protagonist of Hop Swap is a ~thing~ (difficult to define otherwise) that for no apparent reason is sucked into another dimension where the upper part of the world is all painted yellow while the lower one is completely blue. A situation undoubtedly congenial to the players of Verona, but which beyond this has a precise role within the playful economy. Basically, Hop Swap behaves like many other mobile platformers that have preceded it: the on-screen character advances automatically, and it is possible to swipe left or right to make him reverse direction and upwards to make him jump. The main aim is to get as far as possible, and as mentioned at the beginning the formula in this case follows that of Silly Sausage in Meat Land as regards the checkpoints that appear at regular intervals: from time to time the user must decide whether spend a part of the gems collected to activate one or continue aiming for the next, saving in precious but risking having to redo a good piece of road in case of death. An eventuality that can occur both because of the little enemy monsters that roam along the scenario, and because of the obstacles scattered along the path, considering that a minimum contact with these elements is enough for the protagonist to end up KO. Nothing particularly new so far, indeed one could say that these are factors common to the vast majority of platforms available on the App Store. However, the trump card of Hop Swap consists of a specific mechanic that completely shuffles the cards and paves the way for a tantalizing and decidedly inspired level design. In certain parts of the single large level that makes up the game, it is therefore possible to swipe down to overturn the character and make him continue in the opposite half of the scenario. Right from the start, Hop Swap lets you understand all the potential of this simple trick, forcing the user to often change faces to collect all the gems or overcome certain dangers: and as you continue, things get even more interesting, thanks above all to a level design that exploits every drop of this playful solution to its advantage. So here we find ourselves soon to change size after a jump to take advantage of the accumulated momentum and thus make otherwise impossible leaps to the other side, or to get the better of particularly tough enemies by executing the transition at the right time and so on. in a succession of small new discoveries that keep the continuation of the journey interesting. Despite this, after a few games a minimum of repetitiveness emerges on the surface, but it is a venial sin considering also how Hop Swap (like all Nitrome titles) best manages the practice of free to play, monetizing with extremely tolerable advertisements and limiting in-app purchases to the minimum wage. Finally, it should be noted that the English developer's proverbial attention to detail is also manifested in a technically unspectacular product such as Hop Swap, revealing itself in small but very pleasant nuances such as the background music that changes slightly based on the dimension in which the protagonist is located .", "date": "2016-12-01", "grade": "8.5"}
