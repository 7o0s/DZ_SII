It being understood that we Europeans have to thank even if only for having seen the previous episodes on our shelves, given that in America they dreamed of them, we see this Inazuma Eleven 3 located three years after the original Japanese publication, well after the conclusion of the animated series of reference also in our country. As if that weren't enough, Inazuma Eleven 3 was originally released on Nintendo DS in three versions, to then be integrated into a compilation including the first two episodes and published for Nintendo 3DS (titled Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3). We are offered only the third episode in the Nintendo 3DS version (practically identical to the original counterpart, except for a superficial stereoscopic effect added later) and in only two of the three original versions, renamed Lightning Bolt and Fire Explosive. The Ogre version is therefore missing, but it is the least of our thoughts, we assure you. Inazuma Eleven 3 is a nice football-themed jRPG that is all too similar to its predecessors Down to earth... The differences between the two versions of Inazuma Eleven 3, Lightning Bolt and Explosive Fire, are almost minimal: each delves into the character and history of some characters rather than others, proposing some different football teams as opponents depending on the version. We were pleasantly surprised - and lucky, perhaps - to discover that the version we played, Lampo Folgorante, focuses precisely on Paolo Bianchi, a new Italian character whose stories will intertwine with those of Mark Evans and the other Raimon players. Apart from that, the story flows and evolves in the same way, and if you have never had to deal with Inazuma Eleven, then get ready to enter a somewhat bizarre universe in which football is considered a sport around which it revolves literally everything: the characters talk about it as if the fate of the world depended on that ball and some dialogues elicit more than a smile, making us roll our eyes in the face of the most incredible situations. It must be said that this time Level-5 has taken a step back, however, compared to the previous episode: this time Mark and the others will have to deal with a much more ~down to earth~ challenge, represented by a championship on world called Football Frontier International. At the beginning, therefore, we fought--- um, he will play to determine the members of the team that will represent Japan, and then slowly all the various teams in the world will face each other. Don't worry, though, because Inazuma Eleven 3 does not betray its bizarre origins, and game after game a decidedly abstruse and amusing story will unfold in which shady figures determined to conquer the world with football (sic!) and even otherworldly forces will mix at war with each other. The plot is told through the canonical dialogues between the characters and frequent cartoon sequences of excellent quality: the texts are completely in Italian, and even the dubbing, which mostly uses the same Italian voices of the animated series, complete with a completely sung in our language. An excellent job of localization, in short, which once again manages to convincingly propose the world and the characters of the series. The 3D effect Practically not received: the stereoscopic effect is almost absent, also because it is played mostly on the lower screen. Depth is therefore applied - uselessly - to the map of the areas being explored and very weakly to the polygonal sequences that show the characters' special actions and techniques. ... and head in the clouds The problem, in fact, is the sense of static that is felt from the moment you start playing until the end of the adventure. Inazuma Eleven 3 adopts the same, identical structure of its predecessors, dividing itself between the exploration of the various settings, full of characters to interact with and chests to open almost as if they were dungeons of a fantasy jRPG, and the ~battles~ played on the field from soccer. The main difference compared to the past consists in the addition of a couple of new mechanics that allow you to literally dominate the field by involving multiple team players at the same time, in order to enhance our shots or control and disable opposing players. That's all: apart from this, Inazuma Eleven 3 is absolutely identical to the second chapter, and the gameplay remains the same - still excellent - from the beginning to the end of the adventure. For new players it could still be a breath of fresh air; theAfter all, there is no other video game that mixes our national sport so well with the strategy, decisions and parameters to watch of a Japanese-style RPG. Paradoxically, however, for longtime fans of the franchise everything has already been seen, from the recruitment of the characters (fortunately much less than in Inazuma Eleven 2, and therefore much easier to appreciate and manage) to the painstaking composition of the team that must be put in place adapted to face the most difficult matches, choosing the right players based on their ~equipment~ and their athletic abilities. There is practically nothing new that can intrigue those who have spent hours on the previous chapter, apart from of course the plot which, moreover, concludes the narrative cycle with Mark Evans as the protagonist. Even the graphics sector on Nintendo 3DS shows its side on several occasions: it is obviously a title for the previous Nintendo portable, dating back to three years ago, and therefore characterized by a decidedly awkward mix of sprites that move in polygonal environments in an isometric view, to move on to the polygonal sequences during matches which up until a couple of years ago could have appeared spectacular, but which today stand out more for the poverty of details than for the tornadoes or fiery tigers that accompany the goals of these young soccer field heroes.", "date": "2013-10-01", "grade": "7.0"}
