{"name": "Rebel Cops", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rebel-cops-la-recensione.html", "text": "The strategic in its various forms has already proven to work well on mobile platforms, especially on tablets, so it is with some interest that we approach this review of Rebel Cops on iOS, tested in particular on the iPad. It is a spin-off of This is the Police, which stages new stories about crime and corrupt law enforcement in a different form, as a real turn-based strategy that can be defined in the style of ~XCOM~, just saying. The story moves to the town of Ripton in the mid-1990s, when the mysterious Russian underworld boss, Viktor Zuev, has now taken complete control of the city, including the police, except for a small handful of hotheads who reject corruption and they want to keep fighting crime. This premise allows the story to slightly change the point of view compared to the classic detective story, introducing a rebellious and clandestine note as the title of the game rather explicitly suggests, even if the good starting point still fails to raise a story and a setting that otherwise indulges in the clichs of the genre. In Rebel Cops we must therefore guide the small group of rebel guerrillas within various missions, first trying to undermine the power system established by Zuev in Ripton and then to directly hit the underworld boss, in a rather linear succession of missions on difficulty progressive. The path is quite marked and does not allow for many digressions, there are secondary objectives but in general we go on without particular openings, following the path marked by the simple story to the end. In this sense, even the comparison with XCOM holds up to a certain point: Rebel Cops is based entirely on the action in the battlefield, with the missions providing the main substrate of the gameplay and a rather simplified structure regarding the management of the personages. In short, there is no managerial element linked to the care of the base, the development of weapons and tools to face the missions and a profound progression of the characters, who all appear rather the same since there are no specializations or classes foreseen. Not that this necessarily represents a problem, but as a strategy it is certainly more simplified and flat compared to other more complex solutions, also due to the lack of digressions on the story and of alternatives in the development of the group of characters, which largely undermines the its replayability. However, in the heat of the action its mechanism works very well, as long as the campaign lasts. Hard and pure cops Despite the harshness of the setting, underlined by a graphic style played a lot on sharp contrasts, in a comic style, the game aims to avoid excessive bloodshed, rewarding a ~cleaner~ approach to the missions. In this sense, the best profile is the one that avoids the use of firearms as much as possible and encourages knocking out enemies in a non-lethal way, leading to their arrest rather than elimination. This is reflected not only in the score assigned at the end of the level, but also in the execution of this: the silent approach, the stunning and the arrest make the action more effective, while the firefight and the scattering of corpses around the the area determine complications that make it more difficult for the triumphal conclusion of the action. In short, the stealth element emerges as a feature of the entire strategic experience. The mechanics are typical of turn-based strategy, with an isometric shot from above and an interface that adapts optimally to the touch screen, through radial menus that open near the selected characters, even if the icons or Screen elements can sometimes be a little too small to touch accurately. Each round provides a certain amount of movement boxes and actions that can be performed by the protagonists, who can interact with the enemies through various weapons or equipment (fire weapons, stun guns, handcuffs and more), with the hostages or with the elements of the scenario. The squad usually comprises up to 6 characters, with a supporting sharpshooter who can provide indications of the presence of enemies or hold particularly hard-to-reach enemies at gunpoint. The actions may depend on the context but usually the game mechanic requires you to advance while remaining covered behind the elements of the scenario, moving as discreetly as possible and finding paths out of sight of the enemies, perhaps exploring the surrounding scenario also to obtain evidence and documents that allow you to reveala little more about the narrative context. The engagement and the clash with the enemies can be more or less lethal, but as we said the game rewards the arrest and the least bloody solution possible, which guarantees a greater number of Rebel Points that can be used to unlock momentary bonuses on actions of the team and increases the reputation of the rebels among the population. Team action is key, perhaps using one character to hold enemies at gunpoint with hands up and another to make an arrest, or when one teammate warns the other that he has entered enemies' cone of vision, which it requires a certain tactic even when moving, because it is advisable to distribute the units at least in close pairs in order to take advantage of this mutual support. In addition to this feature, among the peculiar elements that distinguish Rebel Cops from other games belonging to the same genre, there is the need to keep the reputation of the group under control among the inhabitants of Ripton, thus trying to complete the secondary missions required by some of these and maintaining an attitude that is not too violent, and the fact of having to manage the team in clandestine conditions. This forces us to face a chronic scarcity of resources by doing some economy, buying weapons, ammunition and protection with great prudence on the black market.", "date": "2020-04-30", "grade": "7.0"}
