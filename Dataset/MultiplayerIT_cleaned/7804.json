Born in 2001 on Game Boy Advance, the original Gyakuten Saiban was made by a small group of five people only and only for the Japanese public, which should speak volumes about the expectations that Capcom placed on the project at the time. The intuition of the historic handyman director Shu Takumi was to combine an atypical theme such as that of legal processes, made up of witnesses, judges and prosecutors, with a distinctly Japanese style, not only in the illustrations of the characters and in the type of dialogues, but also in the chosen genre, a close relative of visual novels and their rivers of text to read. Imagine if the western public would have appreciated such an oddity. Yet, almost ten years after its European debut, Ace Attorney has become one of the most popular Capcom series, between cameos in other games, a cross-over with Level-5 and a brand new fifth chapter, going far beyond the first trilogy originally planned by Takumi. The attempt to recycle the first episodes on iOS actually dates back to 2009, but in the last few days the long-awaited Ace Attorney: Phoenix Wright Trilogy HD has finally appeared on the App Store. Lawyer or detective? The title of Phoenix Wright Trilogy HD is enough to understand what we are talking about: what has just arrived on the iPhone and iPad is nothing more than a collection of the first three games in the series (Ace Attorney, Justice For All, Trials and Tribulations), reproposed all together and with backdrops, illustrations and menus redesigned in high definition. The distribution model used is the one already tested by Capcom for Ghost Trick: the first two cases of Ace Attorney are playable for free, but to access the entire trilogy it is possible to choose whether to purchase the three games individually or in a single package. In terms of content, Trilogy HD offers more or less the same and identical adventure of the episodes for Nintendo DS. Putting you in the shoes of the lawyer Phoenix Wright, each case alternates an investigative part, during which you visit the crime scene, collect clues and interrogate the characters involved, with the showdown in court, where by analyzing the testimonies and the collected materials you have to put the real culprit cornered until he is unmasked in front of the judge. Those who don't like walls of text put their soul in peace and look elsewhere, because Takumi's passion for writing and reading detective stories translates into long dialogues, mental lucubrations and information to be read carefully to find every minimum detail. Fortunately, among the strengths of Ace Attorney, the quality of the script and the characterization of the characters stand out, with the dialogues that are constantly lightened by a marked comic line. However, if the game structure has remained immaculate despite the past years, the fluctuating restyling work done by Capcom does not fully do justice to the trilogy. Some backgrounds and a part of the main characters have certainly benefited from it, but in many other cases we are faced with bad transition effects, illustrations with dull strokes and ugly colors, all defects that are especially noticeable on the large iPad screen. The superficiality of the adaptation is also evident in the way in which the resolutions of the iPad and iPhone 5 are (not) supported, with a black frame in the first case and ugly vertical bands in the second. But above all, the absence of the Italian localization seemed absolutely inexplicable to us, present not only in the Nintendo DS version but also in the first iPhone port released in 2010. Those who do not speak English can only hope that Italian is added in one of the first updates, although on the timing Capcom has barricaded itself behind a simple ~Stay tuned~. The possibility of playing both holding the device in portrait and landscape position is a welcome addition: in the first case, in particular, the screen is split in two thus simulating the same interface of the original Nintendo DS, although the image becomes a little too small. However, it is sad to see how, with a year of development available, Capcom has not managed to enrich this trilogy with a series of extra contents capable of making the purchase sensible even for longtime fans: a series of menus that are not very fluid and bad design allow you to access a screen where you can send your friends an ~Objection!~ personalized, an idea that is closer to spam than fanservice. Ace Attorney Trilogy HD fails to properly celebrate one of the franchisesise most popular on Nintendo DS.", "date": "2013-06-04", "grade": "7.5"}
