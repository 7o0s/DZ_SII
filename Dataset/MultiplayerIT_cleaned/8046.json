It is therefore an anomalous situation that of NBA 2K13, which is practically in a monopoly regime in the field of basketball simulations and yet is refined year after year, a clear sign that the developers of Visual Concepts are animated by a true passion for this sporting discipline and they are keen to deliver to the fans a title worthy of their expectations. A speech that is even more true for the Wii U version of the game, which arrives late compared to the sports simulations of Electronic Arts (in stores from day one) but, unlike the latter, is not based on previous editions and therefore guarantees an experience globally equal to that available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In what sense ~globally~? Well, on the one hand the technical sector, the structure and the gameplay are absolutely equivalent to those seen on the Microsoft and Sony consoles, thanks also to the release of the first patch which seems to have solved some problems with the frame rate (not encountered during our test, having installed the update right away). Secondly, the addition of the useful Biometric Scan function allows us to use the GamePad to immediately get the pulse of the situation in terms of residual energy for the players on the pitch: just lift the controller as if we wanted to photograph the screen, thus activating a Predator-style ~thermal~ view. However, this interesting novelty is counterbalanced by a graphical interface that already seemed cumbersome and not very intuitive from the start, and which has not undergone any modifications to better adapt to the display on the GamePad, with the result that some tiny menus are decidedly difficult to select, even with the stylus, while in other cases the ~touch~ and ~traditional~ buttons even overlap, creating quite a bit of confusion. One point in favor, one point against and the rest identical: a version globally equal to those for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, in fact. True realism The detailed NBA 2K13 review published in October dissects the offer of this 2K Sports production both in numerical and qualitative terms, therefore here we will try to focus on the details, with particular attention to the exclusivity elements of the Wii U version. start screen allows you to immediately try your hand at a quick game, immediately becoming familiar with the mechanics and philosophy behind the game; however, a tour of the extensive tutorial section is a must, because the maneuvers at our disposal are truly numerous and it would be a shame to limit our experience to two or three actions, also because in this way it is difficult to obtain important victories. One of the novelties on the control front is the involvement of the right analog stick, which can be used not only to make the defensive phase more meaningful (literally reaching out in various directions to prevent an opponent from advancing or passing the ball), but also to perform shots normally assigned to the main buttons of the GamePad, as well as free throws. The only problem: the ~raised~ position of the right stick on the GamePad (as well as on the Pro Controller) with respect to the buttons makes it difficult to use these functions during the most agitated phases, even more so if you have been used to controllers for years in which this stick is placed in Bass. The simulation vocation of NBA 2K13 is immediately clear, so forget about being able to steal the ball by ~slapping~ the player in charge (one press too many of the button and the foul is called) and instead get used to observing his movements, trying to figure out in which direction is about to move or towards whoever wants to make a pass. Tackling operations are of fundamental importance and make the difference under the basket, leading the opponent to make a mistake and allowing us to effectively conclude a rebound and then go on the attack. It goes without saying that this aspect of the game goes hand in hand with the quality of the animations, which are truly excellent, which lacks only a few tricks in the connections between one movement and another to aspire to virtual perfection. Lots of stuff If in terms of gameplay NBA 2K13 does not miss anything, in the same way the game developers have taken care of the structure and outline, the latter embellished with ~spots~ and deadlifts entrusted to the experience of Jay Z, which is no coincidence appears in the credits as executive producer. The television atmosphere, in shortbut, it's all there and basketball fans, the real ones, will only be able to enjoy subtleties such as those present in the ~My Player~ mode, in which in the role of a promising rookie we will often and willingly have to deal with talent scouts of important teams, with the coach and the press to express our opinions and then appreciate the consequences on the pitch as well as in team management. The offer in terms of modes is really rich and includes ~divertissements~ such as ~NBA Blacktop~, or the ~urban~ interpretation of matches from 1 vs. 1 to 5 vs. 5, supported by the confirmation of solid options such as ~L 'Association~ (also online), ~NBA: The Creation of a Legend~ and the inevitable ~Season~ and ~Playoffs~, the latter for those who want to try their hand at a small tournament. But let's go back to the peculiarities of the Wii U version, which as mentioned at the beginning boasts some features related to the use of the GamePad. The controller can be used to play with the TV off, without any input lag problems, but as already mentioned, the menu interface had to be reorganized to adapt it to the size and characteristics of the touch screen. Once this obstacle has been overcome, one can only appreciate the possibility of quickly selecting the changes, even if more could have been done in this sense, especially in the career mode, perhaps by inserting some touch commands to order the companions to move in a certain way.", "date": "2013-01-22", "grade": "9.4"}
