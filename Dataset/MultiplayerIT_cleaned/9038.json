{"name": "Strategia in prima persona", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94001-nuclear-dawn-strategia-in-prima-persona.html", "text": "Tested version: PC The FPS is undoubtedly the most popular genre in today's gaming market and now the competition is very tough. Even a superficial observation of the most successful titles highlights the need for classes, packs and perks to differentiate themselves from other titles and those who don't try are usually destined to be forgotten. On the other hand, the first person has its limits and the first is to deprive the player of a body. It is no coincidence that Gears of War, focusing on classic modes, has chosen to show the body and give it a particular physicality. Nor is it a coincidence that Halo, Modern Warfare and Battlefield have followed the path of perks, sets and classes. Even Nuclear Dawn, available for PC and Mac and also planned for Xbox 360, has chosen this path and has done so even more decisively. Two factions, one goal Nuclear Dawn combines strategy, levels and perks to acquire and teamwork in one package. The title focuses on the unique Warfare mode which has the objective of destroying the opposing base and is designed to enhance the 4 classes and the coordinated game between the 16 players of each faction. The use of a headset is therefore strongly recommended even if the game interface includes on-screen indicators and sampled phrases that inform players of enemy attacks, objectives and tasks to be performed. As we said, the differentiation between classes is important and to make it even more marked, the developers have balanced the game so that one type of character can neutralize another but is at the same time very vulnerable to a third class. Stealths, for example, weak but capable of becoming invisible, can outflank the enemy to conquer positions that generate resources, while Attackers, thanks to a visor, can neutralize them. The resources are entrusted to a commander, a real fifth class that can be played by any player thanks to the democratic vote of the members of his team. The commander is obviously a key figure who, through a strategic interface, can use the resources collected to create defensive systems and buildings. And the structures are essential for protecting the base, conquering key points on the map and expanding the players' arsenal which is enriched with ever more powerful kits as the game progresses. Alongside these classes we then find the support or the mixed class that can become an engineer or a doctor depending on the equipment. This character can therefore, according to the need of the moment, repair, saving the structures, or launch poisonous bombs, blocking the enemies, or heal his companions, allowing his team to triumph in stalemate situations. The last class instead involves the use of heavy weapons that in the hands of the resistant Exo can create a wall of bullets, quickly knock down an enemy base or defend a narrow space that makes it difficult for the Stealth, who are their nemesis, to get around them to launch deadly attacks. In addition to the classes, the two factions, i.e. the Consortium and the Empire, are also differentiated, not in the type of soldiers available but in terms of the evolution of the bases which in one case become bulwarks filled with turrets and in the other see the birth of real laser mandala. Unfortunately, the vehicles, announced some time ago but left out of the final version, are still missing. They will probably be introduced later with an update. Balance first Aesthetically Nuclear Dawn, which was developed using Valve's Source Engine, is certainly not a big deal but the maps are large and in some situations they are filled with explosions, turrets and characters. Furthermore, the animated backgrounds are a rather successful attempt to give us the idea of a large and lively world that welcomes the distinctly multiplayer formula, characterizing it with profoundly different forces that facilitate identification with one or the other faction. On the other hand, the design of some weapons is less successful and that of the soldiers is rather neutral, but the general picture, for a multiplayer FPS for less than 20 euros, is more than acceptable and does not miss a valid soundtrack, even if certainly not brilliant. Of a very different quality is the balance which appears really effective when both teams move in a coordinated way and can lead to truly satisfying battles with face reversals, extremis rescues and exciting stalls. But when you have the misfortune of falling into the middle of a messy team it is really difficult to make a difference by focusing only on personal skill and the risk of frustration in these cases is quite high. To balance we still find the fact that even if you lose you accumulate pointsexperience which, leading us to level up, will allow us to acquire various perks. Among other things, the talents, and this is a very important detail, are rather balanced and hardly give excessive advantages. A clear example is the regeneration, obtainable at the fiftieth and maximum level, which is activated only out of combat and after 3 seconds of waiting. So it is not at all easy to exploit it and in the middle of a shooting the most powerful perk of the title becomes completely useless.", "date": "2011-10-05", "grade": "7.0"}
