Unlike other historical series of the 80s and 90s, the strength of Dragon Ball also seems to be its ability to renew and expand without losing too much of its original spirit, and a confirmation of this feature can be found in the success of the new series Dragon Ball Super. Perhaps this too has contributed significantly to the flashback for Toriyama's fighters also in the videogame field, paid among other things for a title of considerable value such as Dragon Ball FighterZ. In this good trend, making due proportions, we can also place Dragon Ball Legends, which could easily represent the best mobile video game inspired by the series and perhaps one of the best anime-based titles seen on these platforms lately. We note a certain commitment on the part of Bandai Namco in exploiting a license of capital importance in a way, trying to build around it a video game specially designed for use on the move, rather than a sort of botched reduction to a small size of console experiences. For the occasion, Toriyama himself (or someone for him) has developed a new character: Shallot, a mysterious saiyan whose story is yet to be discovered. Awakened from another era on Earth, the hero must reconstruct his past and prepare for the many threats that await him, all with the burst of space-time passages that always provide a good opportunity to throw companions on the trail. historical battle and villain of the series, regardless of the official timelines. The main story proceeds divided into chapters and its progress requires the energy consumption typical of free-to-play titles: the game seems to be quite fair on this front, allowing for rather long sessions without necessarily having to resort to micro-transactions. Further aspects of the story and the characters can also be explored through various missions that mainly recall topical events from the classic series. Cards, gachas and entertainment When dealing with phones and touchscreens it's clear that a fighting game needs to diverge from the typical fighting game structure in order to work. In this case, the clashes take place through a system of taps and swipes on the screen that mixes some characteristics of the typical action of the series (the shot behind the shoulders and the 3D setting of the Xenoverse, for example) with the tapping typical of certain mobile productions , but not only. There is also a card system and the inevitable gacha drift which is natural in a title focused on a large number of characters like this one. The combat model provides for clashes between teams of three characters, each characterized by specifics, special abilities and a dominant element, which comes into play in a relationship of forces on the ~rock-paper-scissors~ style in direct confrontation with the others. Short finger flicks move the character in 3D space and dodge, short press performs a basic attack, and long press performs a heavy attack that consumes ki, as basic instructions. On these is grafted a particular system of cards that are randomly extracted from a deck, each corresponding to a move and divided into ranged attacks, close combat, alterations and special attacks, which consume a different amount of ki (recoverable through a long press on the touch screen). It's a simple system but one that requires a minimum of tactics to face the most demanding fights and in PvP: in fact, it is a question of dosing the combos based on the expenditure of ki, evaluating the balance of forces between the dominant elements of the fighters (interchangeable between three present in the team with the press of a button) and choose the right approach on the enemy to face. During the fight, dragon balls also appear randomly, which when they reach the fateful amount of seven allow you to launch a powerful and spectacular combined attack of the entire team on the field, capable of distorting the progress of the match. Finally, in a game that makes the roster of fighters a strong point, a character management and collection system could not be missing. These can be evoked through a system that falls within the gacha canon, i.e. with the investment of crystals (which obviously opens the door to possible micro-transactions): there is the possibility of obtaining duplicates, which entailsto an element of risk in the operation, but in this case the system provides at least an evolution of the character already owned, making the expense not entirely in vain. The enhancement of the parameters of the fighters can instead be carried out through the use of the other in-game currency, which allows you to evolve your group and becomes essential for facing more advanced battles, for which in some cases it is also required a some grinding.", "date": "2018-05-28", "grade": "7.2"}
