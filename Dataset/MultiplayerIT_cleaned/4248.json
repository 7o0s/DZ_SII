In fact, these are ex-BioWare developers, who among other things contributed to building Star Wars: The Old Republic and their familiarity with the imposing narrative substrates and complex lore is also evident in this game, despite the fact that both the genre and the the setting. While we await the arrival of the third chapter, let's go back to talking about the progenitor of the series for its launch in the Switch version, which as it was easy to expect represents an ideal landing place for the particular strategic-RPG with management elements of Stoic. As for the evaluation of the game itself, we remain precisely in line with what was said about the original PC version in its Review, given that the conversion is faithful in every component, but with an extra gear given by the portable size it had already particularly convinced in its iPad version. The Banner Saga has already passed on practically all the platforms on the market, therefore the adaptation for Switch borrows the convincing interface from the other console versions but introducing the double control system through Joy-Con or touchscreen and presenting as a peculiar feature the possibility of carry around the gaming experience, further compacted by the use on the small LCD screen which enhances the graphic characterization. A story from the cold north In a world clearly inspired by the Scandinavian lands and condemned to a sort of eternal vigil by the immobilization of the sun in the sky, a clear sign of impending cataclysms, the people of Humans and that of the Varls (large beings similar to men but endowed with horns and powerful fighting skills) find themselves forced to forge an alliance to face together the ancient threat of the Destroyers. From a narrative point of view, The Banner Saga immediately demonstrates what it is made of by throwing us into the midst of the complex socio-political situation that has characterized the game world since its opening act. In a few minutes we are bombarded with information on names, races, historical and political characteristics of that particular world, with an in medias res approach which obviously serves to immediately create the right atmosphere and let us penetrate the complex plot prepared by the developers without much delay. A plot, moreover, that the player is called upon to actively compose, because one of the main characteristics of this game is precisely the possibility of influencing the unfolding of events by making choices that turn out to be full of consequences. These vary greatly in terms of importance and gravity, ranging from the simple opportunity to obtain immediate rewards or not to the possibility of making some characters survive or die, which obviously determines the incisive bifurcations in the development of the story. Beyond the general characteristics with which the races of Humans and Varls are built, forced into a complicated alliance by the urgency of danger, the characters are outlined with considerable maturity, while falling within certain stereotypes that are typical of the genre. In short, as in classic RPGs, The Banner Saga does everything to kidnap us into its world through an impressive narrative, supported by excellent dialogues that have also been well translated into Italian (as regards the text). Although the boundaries between PC and console have now blurred a lot, it is still a type of game that does not have many equals in particular on Nintendo Switch, and also for this reason it assumes further importance on this platform, still rather immature in terms of strategy and classic RPG. Strategy and management The complex story, albeit rather traditional, perfectly supports and penetrates the structure of the game, which for its part can count on a well-thought-out strategic combat system and some managerial elements in the constant care of the caravan. The turn-based battle takes place on a typical chessboard and focuses on the use of will points, with which to perform various actions such as movements, attacks, use of special skills or defensive maneuvers, with the particular introduction of the double assigned armor score and strength, which affects the performance of the characters and which requires different attacks on one area or the other to have different effects. In essence, the hit points are joined by those of the armor, and this is a parfundamental parameter in the most demanding fights in particular against the Destroyers, which are always covered by a heavy armour. The result is a very multifaceted and interesting system, to which the good diversity in the classes of fighters is linked which determines differentiated tactics and approaches, in a chess game where the specific skills of each individual pawn become fundamental. The narrative and combat phases therefore alternate with long moments of party management, which here takes on much broader contours having to do with an entire caravan. The evolution of the characters takes place in a very similar way to that characteristic of role-playing games, with skills that develop based on the level of experience and the specialization undertaken in a system that is somewhat reminiscent of Fire Emblem, to remain in the Nintendo environment, even if this aspect is somewhat limited by the predefinition of the characters on certain roles. The management dynamics concerning the caravan is also grafted onto all this: the story of the two protagonists takes place along two opposing journeys and in both cases the control of resources is essential to ensure the survival of the caravan. The movements require adequate reserves of food and the particularly long and demanding passages affect the morale of the group, up to extreme consequences such as the loss of characters when the supplies run out, therefore it is important to dedicate time to gathering resources and calculate adequately commute and rest times. Total immersion It is an observation that is redundant for fans of the genre, but since there are not many similar titles in the catalog on Switch, we specify that it is not exactly an intuitive and immediate game, so it is advisable to spend some time practice the combat and character management system. The dynamics of the caravan underlines this need by proposing breaks in which to explore various technical aspects of the game and also train in combat, all things not to be overlooked. The first hours can be particularly difficult, but the charm of which the game is imbued, the tight narration and the non-trivial dialogues help to immerse yourself completely in its meanders. The possibilities of choice that actively influence the unfolding of events represent a further stimulus to keep the attention high and make us more involved than ever in the developments of the story. The graphic style drawn in 2D, halfway between a graphic novel and a cartoon, is a perfect choice for this kind of game and everything is also perfectly transposed on Switch, where indeed the line is particularly enhanced on the small LCD, using the console in portable version. The artistic direction demonstrates great maturity and coherence in The Banner Saga and is also reflected in a thick soundtrack, able to underline the Nordic atmospheres and the epic and dramatic moments between travel, fights and various events, in a constant manner.", "date": "2018-05-22", "grade": "8.9"}
