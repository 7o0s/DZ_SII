{"name": "Una marcia in pi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/164763-need-for-speed-una-marcia-in-piu.html", "text": "Launched last November 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the twenty-second chapter of the famous EA racing saga, the best-selling ever in the genre to which it belongs, managed to convince critics and the public only in part, obtaining mostly positive opinions but in some very contrasting cases. Promoted with a more than decent 7.8 on our pages, the title of the Swedish Ghost Games represents a sort of reboot after the sabbatical year following the launch of Rivals (2013), a real relaunch work which, in the intentions of the developers, it should have offered the best ingredients of the most loved chapters such as Most Wanted and above all Underground, with a return to in-depth tuning and clandestine night racing. Despite the defects underlined in our analysis, Need for Speed has generally managed to hit the target, offering the right atmosphere, a very remarkable technical sector, an all in all pleasant story and a solid arcade gameplay, improved with subsequent updates that have made it less intrusive the notorious ~rubber band effect~ of artificial intelligence. About four months after the market debut, the circle closes with the launch of the PC version, which brings some very interesting innovations, as well as an improved technical baggage. For more intimate details on the playful modalities and infrastructure of the title, we refer you to the above review; here we will deepen the specifications of the new iteration, which we put to the whip with our driving position. Sixty frames per second, manual transmission and steering wheel support: that's Need for Speed for PC Like in the arcade One of the most awaited novelties of Need for Speed for PC is the steering wheel support, offering compatibility with some of the most popular and widespread peripherals signed by Logitech, Fanatec and Thrustmaster. After thoroughly testing it with our TX Ferrari 458 Italia Edition, we can only reward the choice of Ghost Games, which has embellished its creature with the flavor of a solid and enthralling 90s arcade cabinet. Although Need for Speed natively supports the 900 of rotation of the TX, even if only partially exploiting them, the first suggestion we feel like giving is to set the peripheral to 270, a much smaller angle but absolutely congenial to the gritty driving model of the Swedish title. In fact, this setting not only helps to brush the fast curves, but guarantees controlled drifts with maximum effectiveness. After all, the experience aims at adrenaline and not at realism. The solidity and refinement of the force feedback are not those of Assetto Corsa, but they still offer greater involvement than the simple pad, also returning a certain difference between the ~Drift~ and ~Grip~ settings and between some car categories. Unfortunately there is no menu for the advanced settings of the peripheral and you have to rely on the manufacturer's application, furthermore compatibility is not 100%, given that the keys on the interface are indicated with the Xbox ones, generating a bit of confusion in the player who must practice with the multiple commands. The other big change in this version is the manual gearbox, introduced at the specific request of the community. The management of the gears with the aluminum fins of the TX is perfect and further increases the involvement, however the need to continuously answer the phone and above all to drift with the handbrake complicates the situation a little, especially during drifting competitions and in the hottest chases with the police. The manual gearbox would seem to favor the player in the initial stages, nevertheless once they reach the central part of the story the competitions become increasingly demanding and stimulating, also in light of the reduction of the aforementioned elastic effect. Magic Nights Beyond the support for the steering wheels and the manual gearbox, which will soon be introduced on consoles as well, the gameplay of the PC version of Need for Speed is enhanced above all by the sixty frames per second, which amplify the sense of speed and the precision of the guide. With our test configuration and at maximum detail, the fluidity is practically granite, except for some drops around the fifty-five frames per second experienced in specific areas of the map, such as the Los Sol district. Bearing in mind that due to some problems with Windows 10 we have not yet tested the Nvidia 364.47 drivers, linked to the launch of Need for Speed and The Division, we can certainly underline the good optimization work done by the guys at Ghost Games. The charm of Ventura Bay,a fictitious metropolis inspired by Los Angeles, increases considerably thanks to the renewed fluidity and the technical improvements implemented, where it is above all the refinement of details and effects that enhance the spectacular nocturnal views. The view of the city from the Crescent Mountains offers a truly breathtaking panorama, just as it is impressive to whiz from the Cross Roads neighborhood to Shoreline Front in the Royal Park area. The night lighting is simply sublime, and it is enough to dwell on the reflections of the neon lights that stand out on the puddles in the Beckenholl district to perceive the excellent work done by the Swedish graphic designers. The volumetric effects of the fumes and the rendering of the rain are also splendid, which delicately caresses the soft light emitted by the street lamps and the realistic liveries of the cars. With the right equipment, it is also possible to enjoy this show in 4K resolution, for an even more realistic and satisfying result. Among the graphic settings that you can put your hand, beyond the inevitable V-sync, we find the quality of the textures, the motion blur, the quality of the shadows, the details of the effects, the geometric details, the antialiasing filter (FXAA and TAA ) and ambient occlusion, with the dual solution HBAO and SSAO. Overall good scalability. We close our technical analysis with a mention of the audio quality, sumptuous to say the least if enjoyed with a dedicated card: with our Xonar DX the samples in fact offer a delicious timbre and three-dimensionality, enhancing the incisiveness of the engines. Since the servers are currently populated only by journalists and developers, we cannot comment on the solidity of the netcode, however during our online tests we have not experienced any critical issues.", "date": "2016-03-09", "grade": "8.0"}
