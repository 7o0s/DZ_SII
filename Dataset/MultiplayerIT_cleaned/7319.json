Unlike Octodad, where the fun is generated by the player's actions, in Jazzpunk we are nothing more than moving switches: we click an interactive dot and we watch a gag. And there are interactive points everywhere, so the whole adventure is nothing more than a long comic journey in search of the next joke, with mini-games in the middle that unfortunately become more and more frequent, until the laughter is almost exhausted. But we will come back to this later. The merit of Jazzpunk is certainly having exploited the unique characteristics of the video game to stage withering gags that would not work elsewhere, not in this form. As for the kind of comedy you'll find in its levels, just think of the opening scene. A human shaped suitcase arrives at the airport of an imaginary 1950s Tokyo. Inside is Polyblank, the protagonist of the game. After being greeted by a secretary, in an office full of robot porn magazines scattered here and there, we are introduced to the director. A guy who finds it funny to ask us to sit on a cushion where he has placed a balloon that simulates a fart. It is he who informs us that we have to carry out spy missions in a kind of Cold War. Just swallow one of the pills contained in the bottle on his desk and we will go on a mission. If we need him, he tells us, we find him down in the wine cellar, and he disappears down behind the desk. Intrigued, we take a look, and find him drunk and asleep under his desk, anything but a wine cellar. We just have to swallow the first pill and wait for the countdown. Five, four, three, two, one... Jazzpunk is a crazy container of comedy: you just have to look around and look for the next gag On a mission The first assignment is a box of surprises that leaves a satisfied grin on his face. We find ourselves in front of a huge building that we have to infiltrate, surrounded by a park which in turn is enclosed by a busy road. We could run inside the main door and carry out the mission: this is always possible, in all levels, but it would be as if we hadn't even played, because Jazzpunk only works if we agree to scour the levels looking for jokes and mini-games. And from this point of view the first mission is too rich and fun to last. In fact, everything is reduced already from the second assignment. But let's stay focused on the initial part. Around there is a frog trying to connect to the Wi-Fi network of a coffee shop. If we decide to help her we find ourselves in a minigame that mentions the historic Frogs. Immediately after the amphibian gives us glasses with which we have to scan the area around us and recover flying pieces of code. Only that we do it with its retractable tongue, which we can obviously use on everything around us and thus activate hilarious gags. But there is also a laboratory, inside the central building, which contains two large microscopes. If we peek inside one of the two, a kind of Space Invaders is activated where bacteria are the enemies, while if we peek into the lenses of the second we witness the mating of two primordial beings. There are gags that mention old and new video games and other more serious jokes, like getting a photocopy of the butt. Sexual jokes, demented gags and profusion of slapstick keep us company in the first hour of the game, above all. Another example. In the second level we collect a scoop with which we need to catch spiders. However, nothing prevents us from using it even against passers-by. Thus we find that some reveal their identity as a bug man and fly away, while a woman dressed as a geisha in the ladies' room simply replies that she doesn't like ~that kind of practice~. Telling jokes as always is never fun; you have to let yourself be surprised to appreciate them, because they almost always arrive without warning and, between puns and piping hot cakes, the missions run fast one after the other. But what's left in the end? No laughter recorded At the beginning we are under the illusion that we are following some plot, or in any case that there is a game system that goes beyond looking around in search of the next joke, but it is precisely an illusion. For heaven's sake, there wouldn't be anything wrong if Jazzpunk always lived up to the initial promises, but unfortunately the comic vein is watered down and, if in the first two levels almost all the gags hit the mark, later the jokes are increasingly rare , and someone repeats itself. There are scattered fragments of great value, such as when we discover a queue of silhouettes of people queuing in front of a cinemabut. On the back of the last one it says ~push me~. Just one tap and people in line fall like dominoes. At which we enter the cinema, and find ourselves seated with a cigar in our mouth and popcorn in our hands. While the images scroll on the big screen, we can enjoy annoying other spectators with cigar smoke and food throwing. A surreal humour, which works, because the transition from the main game phase to these worlds within the world happens very naturally, but always in an unpredictable way. The sort of thing happens in Jazzpunk that we imagine David Lynch would dream of on good nights. However, as we said before, the momentum is lost, and the mini-games become more and more insistent. There's the one where as a cat we have to scratch furniture within a time limit to do as much damage as possible, and the one where we challenge the car in the Street Fighter II bonus level. All nice ideas, but they become insistent, until minigolf arrives and even a little boredom. And yet, although in the end the desire to move on to something else outweighs that of playing all over again in search of some gag lost along the way, the pleasure of having had a lot of healthy laughs remains. From this point of view Jazzpunk succeeds where so many film comedies have failed. And throws a challenge to the other developers: do you dare to make people laugh?", "date": "2014-02-13", "grade": "7.8"}
