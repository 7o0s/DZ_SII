{"name": "Sonic Chronicles: La Fratellanza Oscura - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-chronicles-la-fratellanza-oscura-recensione.html", "text": "Masonic Effect The company that took on the burden of creating the first Sonic RPG is the famous and talented Bioware, author of acclaimed works such as Mass Effect and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic in recent years. However, this project in collaboration with SEGA represented a new challenge, because, although less sophisticated than usual, it required a more humorous approach to video games: the reference in this field is certainly the Mario rpg series, carried out by three different software houses but mainly exalted by Intelligent Systems, responsible for Paper Mario, a title that has established itself for originality, game design and aesthetic maturity. The atypical Nintendo j-rpg represents a paradigm for coherence and awareness, it is at the same time criticism and apology of the genre through all the factors that compose it, from the playful to the visual one, which give rise to a holistic relationship: the Intelligent Systems have written an essay on the Japanese role-playing game taking charge of the Mariesca stylistic code and using it to their advantage. Bioware was inspired by this work in many respects, however it was unable to grasp its essence, making more mistakes in the conception of Sonic Chronicles than in its actual creation; symbol and avant-garde of the western RPG, he welcomed the porcupine into his immense home, while he probably would have done better to build him a small tailor-made castle. Brushed The best aspect of the whole work is certainly the visual one: Bioware has managed to overturn years of ineffective syncretisms, unscrupulously abandoning the aesthetics of the latest Sonics, thus renouncing any foothold with reality, filtering the whole universe of porcupine with rare good taste. It is the two-dimensional scenario that makes the appearance pleasant, much more than the polygonal characters, which on the contrary do not differ much from the versions recently seen in other episodes of the series. On a playful level, Bioware was not equally far-sighted: Sonic Chronicles does not have a marked personality, it constantly hovers between the humorous re-reading and the mannerist interpretation of the genre, without decisively following either path. The result is a fairly predictable product, a simplified RPG, devoid of the fundamental nuances that substantiate the mechanics of more complex projects; at the same time there are veiled references to Sonic's history and to the lightning-fast interaction that has always distinguished him, but they are never in-depth hints, unable to affect. The world that hosts the events is divided into six areas: the passage from one area to another consists of a simple film, the individual sections are rather small and unable to communicate the idea of a large or vital parallel universe. Sonic Chronicles hovers constantly between humorous reinterpretation and mannerist interpretation of the genre There are few characters to interact with, even fewer, almost non-existent, those not delegated to provide a mission or a quest: this severely limits research, but above all the credibility of the world, to which Bioware had paradoxically provided a fairly well-finished background. The relationship with the scenario is totally bound by the will of the developers, a certain action can only be performed when, approaching an element, the icon appears to interact: unfortunately they often appear in an arbitrary way, so much so that certain obstacles, of equal size and dangers, can only be overcome with the ~permission~ of the game designers. Consequently, when the player is unable to continue, rather than looking for a hidden room or a crevice between the rocks, he finds himself scrupulously feeling the various elements of the game map in the hope that the icon will appear; one often advances without any logic, proceeding by blind and unsatisfying attempts. To make these phases more interesting, Bioware has inserted puzzles along the way, puzzles which, however, never manage to strike for brilliance or intelligence, being frequently limited to the activation of one or more switches. On the map there is usually only one member of the team, to be chosen at will, also in relation to the problems to be faced: only Rogue, for example, is capable of gliding from one building to another. The control is entrusted entirely to the stylus and, although the speed changes are poorly modulated, this choice proves to be appropriate for the characteristics of Sonic Chronicles. Exploration is ultimately not very stimulating both in the research phase, which is fundamental in role-playing games, and in the actual action, which is important for a title with a platform derivation. Fights The clashes are consistent with the rest, because,while never falling below the level of sufficiency, they never happen in an attempt to differentiate themselves from similar productions, or to deepen them: once again Sonic Chronicles remains suffering between these two poles, equally pulled towards opposite directions. The meetings are turn-based, the party is made up of four fighters, there are the usual hit points, magic points (with different denominations, as far as it can count) and objects can be used; each special shot must also be completed by performing acrobatic - more or less - Elite Beat Agents style combinations. As anticipated, however, both phases are predictable: tactics are limited to the use of one attack before another, while the interactive accompaniment of the moves turns out to be repetitive after a few clashes. The fights are not random, the enemies are visible on the map, however they behave in an uninteresting way, they don't even try to run away when they meet a party much stronger than them - a feature that, for example, was already included in 1995 in Earthbound. Even the equipment of the characters is structured in a classic way, there are objects to protect the various parts of the body, elements to enhance the attack, there are even some Chao to develop and grow together with the protagonists: like many Sonic Chronicles components, however they are listless iterations of archetypes already widely known to fans of the genre, and far too complicated to attract casual players (to whom the title seems to want to address at times). The dialogues are pleasant, but not elaborate enough to separate the characters from their masks: multiple answers don't actually reflect on the story, they have no consequences, and everything suggests that it probably would have been more appropriate to focus on humor rather than on humanization of hedgehogs and anteaters. Comment Sonic's first RPG leaves us quite dumbfounded: an expert company like Bioware hasn't managed to adapt to this project, which is atypical compared to those usually developed. The result is not poor, but unable to rise from the mass, the result of a poorly decided planning: a ship without a helmsman, if not in a great storm, at least lost in the sea of doubt. Pros Visually valuable Main Quest of about twenty hours Pleasant dialogues. .. Cons ... but without tangible consequences Too simplified for experts, too complex for novices Minimal interaction with characters and environment", "date": "2008-11-06", "grade": null}
