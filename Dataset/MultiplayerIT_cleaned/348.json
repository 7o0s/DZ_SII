Yet the next Olympics will be held precisely this summer, more precisely from 22 July 2021 to the following 8 August: it was simply decided to keep last year's indication, almost to pretend that the pandemic never happened and didn't keep the pandemic in check for more than a year whole planet. It is not yet clear with what access methods, but the Tokyo Olympics, therefore, will take place: and the themed video game arrives on the shelves even a month in advance, precisely from today 22 June 2021. We had some time available to try it thoroughly, and finally we have clear who might be interested in it and what audience the SEGA developers have thought of. Gameplay: sports in an arcade style In a very intelligent way, on the gameplay side, it was immediately decided to completely abandon any ambitions for simulation and photorealism: Olympic Game Tokyo 2020 offers the classic sports that will be the subject of competition at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (the same competitions also for the previous editions, in fund), in a package suitable for the whole family, with both single player and multiplayer modes. To obtain this result, the chosen formula was the arcade one. Olympic Game Tokyo 2020 doesn't expect you to be an expert in the disciplines in question, and it doesn't even want you to train in front of the TV all day to bring home the Olympic medals: its goal is simply to have fun. Here then are very light-hearted atmospheres and situations, which in the first few minutes of the game ask you to create the avatar of your alter ego from scratch, and then later see him as the protagonist of any Olympic discipline. Olympic Game Tokyo 2020 and basketball Since it is also possible to modify the physique of the character in solutions that ignore the middle ground, we enjoyed seeing a nice fat boy win the 100 meters and boxing matches without problems, as well as real skinny men able to triumph in shot put. The arcade nature does not only concern situations and customizations, but the entire structure of the SEGA title: the play offer is limited to proposing a total of 18 mini-games, which can be played in any order and at any difficulty level, each of which allows you to earn Spend points on customizations. And that's it, after all. Contents: 18 minigames Olympic Game Tokyo 2020, yes there is football too Having clarified the arcade formula of Olympic Game Tokyo 2020, from the point of view of content, the game contains 18 different mini-games inspired by a selection of Olympic disciplines. Each minigame corresponds to a specific sport, which presents its equally precise game modes: initially all this may seem confusing, but in reality the developers have wisely indicated the necessary commands in very few summary screens, and the latter have been designed in such a way really intuitive and minimalistic. Anyone can approach Olympic Game Tokyo 2020 and have fun: children, adults and the elderly; this is certainly good. Regardless of whether you are interested in the Tokyo Olympic Games or not, by purchasing the title you will find in your hands, on consoles and PC, a decent package of different mini-games. On Nintendo Switch there is certainly better, given that any Mario Party is clearly superior in terms of fun; but on machines like PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Xbox One this kind of offer is in short supply. You can therefore enjoy the 100-metre relay, obstacle courses, football and the 200-metre individual medley (we are talking about swimming, of course). Olympic Game Tokyo 2020 will also satisfy climbing lovers You will also find boxing, beach volleyball, table tennis (the latter is really fun, and the echoes of Wii Sports Resort are evident), actual tennis, the 100m freestyle; rarer to remember in videogame sauce, then, hammer throwing, sport climbing, judo, long jump. Finally we still mention rugby sevens, baseball, basketball and BMX. To get an idea of the game controls, know that you won't find anything really complex: they are usually limited to two or three keys to be pressed in sequence, or alternately. For example, swimming is entirely controlled by the left and right analog sticks, which are swung repeatedly; and on PlayStation 4 L1 allows you to sprint. In some cases you don't even need other teasasti in addition to the sticks, such as for speed climbing, where it is ~only~ necessary to tilt the corresponding trigger to the right or left. Playstation 4 trophies Winning the gold medals of Olympic Game Tokyo 2020 is certainly rewarding, but the Platinum Trophy also has its reason. You will therefore have to engage in every single discipline, and avoid neglecting the local and online multiplayer modes. With a little time available and above all with a good dose of commitment, all the trophies will be yours. The difficulty is not insurmountable. Multiplayer mode A positive aspect to evaluate when buying Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 - The Official Video Game is the following: the entire title lacks any plot (after all, what plot could you expect from the Olympic Games?), but it can be enjoyed in multiplayer mode, locally or online. In the first of the two cases, it's even silly to mention that you will need other controllers; the maximum number of participants depends on the individual disciplines. Especially online, it is sometimes difficult to agree on the chosen sport, because a functional screen has not been designed for the purpose. The online mode instead provides for the launch of a public or private lobby to welcome your friends or strangers from all over the world, even with the possibility of using voice chat; vice versa you can join existing groups. The arcade soul of the production actually goes very well with the possibility of enjoying the entire package in the company, even from a distance.", "date": "2021-06-22", "grade": "7.2"}
