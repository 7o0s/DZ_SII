There is no doubt that Animal Crossing, My Time at Portia, as well as Minecraft and Terraria have influenced the design of this game, but the solutions adopted, starting from the particular micro-world in which we find ourselves living, manage to make it a very peculiar and endowed with a certain identity. Deiland knows how to be relaxing, thanks to the tranquil nature that covers the surface of the little planet and which leads us to live at its pace, but also engaging due to the amount of things to do, able to capture us immediately in its mechanism and not let go at least for a certain amount of hours of play, before running into an inevitable drop in pace and interest in the long run. However, once we got to that point we would still have made a largely satisfying journey, between tending our microcosm and discovering secrets and other planets. A Little Prince on a small planet Deiland is a real mini-planet that we have to take control of Arco, the protagonist of this story, mysteriously awakens on the surface of a peaceful micro-planet called Deiland, which quickly becomes his comfortable home. The world is small but still has its own ecosystem that allows the collection of different resources: the representation of the tiny planet recalls that of the mythical King Kaio of Dragon Ball, but even more the romantic asteroid B-612 of the Little Prince of de Saint- Exupry, especially when seen together with the particular figure of Arco, who gradually turns out to be a prince with a destiny to pursue. The peculiar feature of Deiland is that it takes place largely on this small surface, with the planet that can be completely covered on foot in a few seconds and also seen in its entirety simply by enlarging the shot. Although it may seem limiting, such a setting is designed to the millimeter to keep everything close at hand and make sure that you can switch from one action to another in seconds, between cultivating fields, collecting resources , interacting with NPCs and fighting monsters. The main activities to be carried out on Deiland mainly concern the cultivation of vegetables, between the fertile fields and the control of wild crops, the management of the farm and the collection of minerals starting from the simple hammering of the rock conformations up to a real mining activity complete with mines, once the appropriate structures have been unlocked. Among the continuous primary activities of this type, there is also space for the inevitable crafting, which leads to a progressive expansion of the buildable structures and of the activities that can be carried out on the planet and beyond, once interplanetary travel is unlocked. The life of Arco is marked by these actions to be carried out, from cultivation to harvesting to the creation of dishes and objects and the processing of metals, also triggering trade with space visitors, in a sort of planetary mini-management system on which also different events, although always cadenced on a rather regular basis, among which there are also fights with various monsters that periodically appear on the planet. A busy schedule Cultivation of small fields is one of the main activities in Deiland The weather is marked by a day/night cycle capable of influencing crops and the behavior of flora and fauna on Deiland, together with various meteorological events and the alternation of the seasons, which follow each other at a rapid pace in order to allow for variations fast and rhythmic to the possible crops for each phase. The crops must be sown and cared for in the respective seasons, which imposes a minimum of mandatory agricultural rotation and forces us to better manage the seeds and the production of materials and foods that derive from plants. In all this, the attacks of the monsters to be kept at bay with a rudimentary combat system and with the creation of defenses for the farm must be inserted, and a small group of more or less friendly visitors who periodically pass by the planet to ask quests, make advance the story and especially trade. Soon you begin to understand what to focus on to obtain the maximum profit in the trades, but given the limited arable area it is still necessary to dose the spdo your best also to guarantee the raw materials for the production of semi-finished products: the creation of objects, structures and tools expands more and more with the progress of the technology tree, requiring an ever greater quantity and variety of primary resources, also if the whole system remains at a rather simplified level. Among these typical characteristics of adventure sandboxes, Deiland also focuses on a sense of progression strengthened by a certain continuous evolution of Arco, which in fact grows and strengthens itself also through the enhancement of RPG-style base stats, even if this aspect remains barely sketched in terms of how it actually reflects on the gameplay. Fishing is one of the alternative activities that we can carry out on the planet The growth of Arco is somehow linked to the evolution of its own planet, to which it turns out to be closely linked by mysterious issues. This feature determines a grafting of narrative elements that enrich the game and give it a bit of a specific identity, given that among the innumerable micro-commitments generated by the management of the planet we also find fragments of the story of the protagonist, capable of reinforcing the sense of general progression, albeit at a slow and composed pace. Between agriculture, space travel and magic As you progress through the game, it becomes possible to visit other planets It is clear how the developers wanted to build a different game from a simple survival sandbox and there is, in fact, a particular spirit that emerges among the thousand commitments required to carry on the planet in all its various production aspects. The magical and fairy-tale atmosphere intersects with the spatial elements in a fascinating way, but the story always remains in the background without ever being able to emerge much, a little suffocated by the mechanical progress of the gameplay, punctuated by its rhythmic micro-commitments . However, this romantic spirit permeates the entire gaming experience and characterizes it, helping to distinguish it from that of other similar titles, and leaves a trail of memories even once we have moved away from Deiland. The simple graphics betray the small size of the production, but it is perfectly functional to underline the dreamy spirit of the game, also thanks to a characterization a bit halfway between manga and children's book illustration. Too bad that this particular care is lost a bit in the settings outside Deiland, which are rather flat and uninteresting. The fighting in Deiland is pretty rudimentary and feels a bit forced in This is also a consequence of having lost sight of the cohesion of the game experience, which after a very well-paced and irresistible start tends to lose its shots and in the long run. Beyond farming and resource gathering, combat seems like a superfluous and unfunny addition, just as Arco's growth seems to make little sense in the overall gameplay mechanics. Trying to put too many facets together eventually loses the thread of the main game, which loses substance and rhythm in the long run.", "date": "2021-04-15", "grade": "7.5"}
