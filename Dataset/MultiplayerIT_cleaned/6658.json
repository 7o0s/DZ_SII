In the style of a children's storybook, the game tells the story of Monroe, an orphaned boy, who one night notices the painting of the ~unfinished swan~, the only memory of his mother, come to life and escape through a mysterious door. Instinctively grabbing the brush next to the painting, Monroe decides to follow the swan and finds himself projected into a mysterious world, devoid of colors other than white, so much so that it is impossible to perceive the contours of objects. In this bizarre scenario, which soon turns out to be an abandoned kingdom due to the strange ideas of its ruler, the protagonist will have to try to find his swan and find out what brought him there. The Magic Brush Beyond the narration, enhanced by a good dubbing in Italian in the local version, the strengths of The Unfinished Swan lie in its ability to shuffle the cards from chapter to chapter, offering us an experience that changes several times during the campaign , alternating between different puzzles. We start, as mentioned, with the absolute white of the first levels, to which we need to give a shape by shaking the brush full of black ink. After an unexpected dip, the situation changes in the second stage, with the brush spraying simple water, thus causing only a temporary enhancement of the contours. Immediately afterwards, however, everything takes on a new meaning, when you come across magical vines that grow excessively when watered, allowing us to climb walls and reach areas that we thought were inaccessible. Between devices to activate, doors to open, balloons to collect (useful for buying some upgrades) and the inevitable platforms to jump on, all strictly in first person, the game then moves on to more dynamic puzzles, in which you have to move following sources of light to avoid being left in the dark, at the mercy of mysterious creatures of the night. However, the climax is reached in the final stages, when Monroe becomes capable of building three-dimensional geometric shapes to navigate between one obstacle and another, until he reaches the final destination of his journey and discovers the truth about his mother and the unfinished swan. The Unfinished Swan is an inspired, touching, fairytale-like adventure that is short but meaningful Playstation 4 trophies There are ten Trophies in The Unfinished Swan. Some of them are obtained simply by completing the chapters of the campaign, while others require the execution of particular maneuvers, such as throwing boxes at a certain distance, identifying all the pages of the book and so on. A due act Among the most brilliant indie productions for PlayStation 3, The Unfinished Swan lands on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita as a due act, to introduce even new users to the incredible story of Monroe and her swan. The game supports cross-buy, which means that those who already owned the original version will be able to download it for free on other Sony platforms, or buy it now for 12.99. The differences from the first edition are not only aesthetic, but also practical. Firstly, on PlayStation 4 the graphics run at 1080p and sixty frames per second, clearly without ever an uncertainty, thus giving us an even more suggestive and detailed experience; although in the end the numbers count for little compared to the artistic figure of the production, capable of offering truly splendid panoramas and glimpses of great visual originality. Secondly, the controls are this time delegated to the DualShock 4 only, whereas on the PlayStation 3 it was also possible to use the Move controller: a choice that favors precision and eliminates the uncertainties that were sometimes incurred by resorting to motion detection devices. Finally, some game sequences have been optimized in terms of gameplay, in particular the mechanics that characterize the second chapter, but also the ~climbing~ phases on the vines.", "date": "2014-12-24", "grade": "8.0"}
