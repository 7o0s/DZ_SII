{"name": "Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-warzone-20-recensione.html", "text": "When we talk about online video games, we continually tend to perceive them as secondary products compared to the great single player adventures that hoard prizes and awards at each edition of the Game Awards. Just thinking about it, no one would ever think of placing names like The Last of Us Part II and Doom Eternal alongside Warzone in the game of the year race. Yet, this kind of experience often has an incalculable weight in people's social dynamics, much greater than any single-player adventure: for example, during the lockdown, Activision's battle royale assumed the role of real social glue for millions of people stuck at home, especially helping younger generations to counteract the psychological effects of pandemic isolation. It is precisely for these reasons that Warzone, in its first edition, is remembered today with an affection and nostalgia that only the best masterpieces of the medium are able to arouse. This wave of love, as all subsequent versions have easily demonstrated, has the unfortunate consequence of making it damn difficult to emulate the genuineness of the original Warzone, a challenge that after the Caldera Caporetto returned to the hands of Infinity Ward. The Californian studio was the most quoted to succeed in the enterprise and, fresh from the enormous commercial success of Modern Warfare II, has finally presented to the world its new interpretation of the battle royale genre, Warzone 2.0, available for free for everyone on PC, PlayStation and Xbox since November 16th. As can be guessed from the name chosen by the developers, the new experience aims to represent a direct evolution of the previous one, and has every intention of equaling its legacy thanks to revolutions aimed at improving its critical points. Eager to test the aspirations of the title, we took a plane ticket and spent the last few days in the very hot Al Mazrah, putting together the pieces of the Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 review piece by piece. Will Activision's new battle royale have managed to make us forget Verdansk? Let's see it together. Christmas in Al Mazrah This is what Al Mazrah, the new Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 map, looks like Let's immediately clear the field of any misunderstandings and go straight to the point, Warzone 2.0 follows the same instruction manual as a classic battle royale, so the aim remains to jump from the plane, land with your companions, get loot, weapons, complete missions and be the last squad standing as the gas closes on Al Mazrah, the largest map ever in the history of the Call of Duty brand. The setting is not significantly larger than in the past, which is why the lobbies can currently accommodate a maximum of 150 players, a number we believe will increase in the near future. From the first launch, it is possible to perceive some echoes of Verdansk between the streets and structures of the new map, but except for these rarefied similarities, the new setting is light years away from the previous ones, above all for a matter of color palette. Al Mazrah develops in the middle of a large desert area, and although it is crossed by a disproportionate amount of rivers, it almost always offers the same sepia-toned panorama which, we must admit, makes us somewhat regret the great variety offered by Verdansk. However, what the map excels in, and which is unmatched by any other battle royale on the square, is the complexity of its level design, so elaborate and complex as to make every game situation different from the previous ones. The Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 map takes place in a real desert When you explore the 18 points of interest that run through Al Mazrah, it seems every time you are in a battle royale in its own right, and this is somehow certified by the fact that the community, several days after the launch, she still finds herself largely divided over the meta of the game. The multiplicity of gameplay situations was one of the strengths of the original Warzone, but here the feeling of being the protagonists of an explosive action film different from the previous one is even more accentuated, since fighting in the belly of the skyscrapers of Al Mazrah City taking advantage of its heated verticality always offers a completely different experience from the one you feel in the underwater firefights of Hydroelectric, or in the high-altitude shootouts at Observatory. Many of the points of interest have the same complexity as a multiplayer map, and in some cases are exact reproductions of them: some are taken from the arenas of the original Modern Warfare 2, so be prepared for avery powerful nostalgia effect. It will probably take months to thoroughly study the gameplay balance of Al Mazrah, but if we have to think of a flaw in the new setting, the only one that comes to mind is related to the fact that Infinity Ward has voluntarily sacrificed 'altar of balance a fair amount of charisma and charm. While on the one hand the very homogeneous configuration of the spaces on the map sets the right counterweights to the game dynamics, on the other hand there are no real reference points capable of being immediately recognizable to the players. A case in point is that of the Warzone Stadium, it didn't have any gameplay logic at the time, but as soon as you glimpsed it on the horizon, you immediately knew you were in Verdansk. The battle royale revolution is served The new Strongholds of Call fo Duty: Modern Warfare 2 represent the most interesting novelty of the game The basic mechanics of Warzone 2.0 remain the same as always, but a few games are enough to absorb all the substantial differences that make it totally different from the previous one. What we think is the revolution that more than all the others distorts the gameplay formula is linked to the new loot system, much more complex and stratified than the previous ones, capable of profoundly influencing the pace of a game by itself. Each player now has to manage a real inventory, and when he interfaces with the containers scattered around the setting he is dealing with a dedicated interface that summarizes the contents of the chest and his backpack. At first we found ourselves slightly mystified by this intricate process, and were on the verge of labeling it as a sizable waste pass of Warzone 2.0. However, as the games went by, we found ourselves more and more comfortable with the new system, to the point of now considering it a winning choice across the board. Opening a container is always a process that takes more than a few seconds, which is why now the pace of gameplay proves much more staid than ever. This is accentuated by the fact that in Warzone 2.0 the accumulation of loot is crucial to aspire to the final victory, due to the important changes made to custom loadouts. At first Infinity Ward had announced that he wanted to eliminate them permanently, and even if some time later he retracted the statement, they are present in Activision's new battle royale in a clearly weakened version, given that the ways to obtain them have in fact been reduced to the bone and you will always be forced to fight to conquer them. As is now customary, there will be many missions available to us in Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 In the new shops, each with a different catalog from the others, there are on offer series of kills and various bonuses, but also the individual weapons of the player's loadouts, however without the Specialties combined with them. If you want to have access to crucial survival perks such as Ghost and Cold Blood, you will have to wait for the final part of a game, almost a quarter of an hour, to see the crates with the personalized equipment so dear to Warzone players fall from the sky. However, there is a small problem: the plane that flies over the map launches a very small number of specimens, less than five, and once a team claims a box it disappears. That's why trying to conquer one will always get you in a lot of trouble. There is actually another way to get a custom loadout, and it represents perhaps the freshest and most interesting novelty of Warzone 2.0. In the early stages of a match, when the first ring closes around players, three Strongholds appear on the map  buildings filled with AI-ruled bots that are overflowing with loot. It may be difficult to clean one in total tranquility since the whole lobby knows its importance, but once you reach the goal you are rewarded with your own personalized loadout, including Specialties. In fact, if you're among the first to complete a Stronghold, you'll also receive a key to a Black Site, a maximum security compound guarded by a Juggernaut, and filled with the best equipment around. We don't hide it, we don't hide it, launching the conquest of Strongholds and black sites, it is simply exhilarating and represents by far the most fun activity of Warzone 2.0, in spite of the doubts about the AI bots that we had expressed in our preview. Many new features: Gulag, vehicles and voice chat Vehicles in Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 are not as important as we would have imagined When we first told you about Warzone 2.0, we stressed the importance vehicles would have in the game given how central they were to the game.in the Infinity Ward communication. If on the one hand the new driving model is a jewel and the introduction of damage and fuel management positively distorts the mechanics, on the other we must see how they are generally superfluous, in the test of facts. The level design of Al Mazrah, as anticipated, is absolutely homogeneous and does not include large open spaces, which is why the custom is to move on foot, building after building, instead of inside a vehicle. As if that weren't enough, the new gas mechanic, which now delimits three sub-zones instead of one in the mid-game, makes the players' room for maneuver even more cramped. Also widely sponsored before launch is the new Gulag, perhaps the least successful element of Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0. In the past, a fight in the Gulag was configured as a fight to the death as violent as it was surgical, where whoever had the ferocity and precision necessary to return to Verdansk prevailed. With the introduction of fights between teams of two players, it is now somehow entrusted to a complete stranger, and the arrival of the jailer a few seconds after the start of hostilities represents only an intrusive distraction, which suddenly dirty the progress of the meeting. Infinity Ward's intent was naturally to push the prisoners to team up with each other to earn their freedom by defeating the colossal Juggernaut who invades the arena, but the studio had never calculated that no one ever, in a Call of Duty, trusts the enemy. The Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 Gulag, in its current configuration, does not completely convince us In our opinion, the team Gulag is an idea born following the rethinking of communications between players, who can now converse during the game thanks to the new proximity voice chat. The community is already flooding the network with videos showing the most hilarious interactions between opposing teams, and although some might think of disabling the chat to avoid being revealed by nearby enemies, it is undeniable that the novelty has been received exceptionally positive from the user. DMZ, from disaster announced to great protagonist Enter the game risking everything, here is the logic behind the new DMZ mode of Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 Launched as an indiscretion for months by all sorts of self-styled insiders, the DMZ mode of Warzone 2.0, an absolute novelty for the Call of Duty series, had managed to get everyone to agree that it would be an assured disaster. Other multiplayer shooters had proposed extraction modes trying to emulate the success of Escape from Tarkov, failing spectacularly one after another. The news according to which the new mode would be released in beta, then, contributed to the climate of skepticism that surrounded it. Spent several hours in his company, our opinion is that DMZ instead represents an absolute value of Warzone 2.0, a fresh and fun experience that can offer a real alternative to battle royale playlists, if the developers support it properly. is it after all DMZ? Included in the Warzone 2.0 package and therefore also totally free, DMZ is a extraction mode in which teams of three players explore Al Mazrah to complete different objectives, putting every ounce of their equipment into play during the mission. In fact, in order not to lose everything, it is necessary to reach one of the exits on the map and get to safety via a helicopter within the time limit of the game, otherwise everything that has accumulated in the inventory will be lost, including the weapons with which took to the field. The stakes are therefore very high, however DMZ is characterized by a much more relaxed pace of gameplay than in any other typical Call of Duty activity, due to the small number of human players participating in the lobby. The map here is almost totally controlled by soldiers managed by artificial intelligence, which however represent a good challenge, since they are far more lethal versions of those seen in the battle royale and in Special Operations. The choice to insert bots had triggered our perplexity, but it is surprising how similar they are to human players, reacting instinctively to our presence and moving unpredictably around the setting. Cooperation, perhaps even more so than in Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0, is really key in DMZ After several games, it's easy to understand the reasons that led Infinity Ward to launch the mode in beta. While it's supported by an overall decent battery of content, DMZ isn't even close to taking advantage of everything.", "date": "2022-11-20", "grade": "8.7"}
