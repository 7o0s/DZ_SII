In light of the great successes obtained with first Hitman GO and then Lara Croft GO, it was difficult to imagine that the studio would abandon such a lucrative path so easily, and in fact here comes Deus Ex GO, which sees Adam Jensen engaged in a puzzle structure very similar to that of the aforementioned products. Let's find out if it's yet another coup or if the recipe starts to get boring at the third course. Even with an already known formula, Deus EX GO confirms Square Enix's feeling with the mobile market The triangle yes Following the example of the excellent Lara Croft GO, the Deus Ex GO here also succeeds in the (far from obvious) feat of weaving a narrative background that unites the puzzle matrix levels faced in the main mode: you don't obviously this is good material for a novel, but the story that sees Adam Jensen engaged in the search for a missing scientist does its duty very well, acting as a glue for the over 50 internships that make up the adventure. There is even room for frequent textual dialogues and rapid interlude sequences created with the game's graphics engine, which also manages to perfectly recreate the ultra-glossy and hi-tech style that distinguishes the series: despite the isometric view it does not leave much room for spectacularity, Deus Ex GO is decidedly beautiful to look at, thanks to an excellent use of colors, quality light effects and meticulous attention to detail that involves both the characters on the screen and the surrounding elements. To complete the picture, a whole series of distinctive elements of the franchise, from the preponderance of triangular shapes to the minimalism of the interface, also arriving at an instantly recognizable electronic soundtrack for anyone who had already accompanied Jensen on one of his previous adventures. But let's talk about the gameplay, which fortunately represents the spearhead of the Square Enix Montral production: once again it is a question of moving the protagonist by swiping his finger on the touch screen, making him advance on the grids that make up the stages with the aim of reaching the finish line. If in Hitman GO the emphasis was all on stealth and in Lara Croft GO on solving environmental puzzles, it can be said that Deus Ex GO has taken the best of both, offering a play structure that rests firmly on both factors. Therefore, the enemies who advance by one square for each movement of the player make their return, and who must be eliminated from behind or even completely circumvented, but there is no lack of new features that draw from the imaginary of the series: we therefore find terminals to be violated that allow you to activate platforms and mechanisms, security turrets that shoot on sight, patrol robots, soldiers capable of activating a shield that makes them invulnerable and even power-ups that allow you to become invisible for two turns or activate remote computers. All these elements, combined with the usual, excellent, level design of Square Enix Montral, make Deus Ex GO an always fun and stimulating puzzle, which unlike Lara Croft GO has also been able to adjust better with the size of the levels, all small enough to don't be too boring to start over if you fail. A challenge rate characterized by a fair difficulty curve makes the main adventure rather demanding and long-lasting (especially if you aim to obtain the maximum rating in all stages), but there is no shortage of extra content: the developers promise full-bodied updates, with weekly challenge sets and even a level editor that should arrive in the months immediately after launch. It should also be noted that, by connecting the application to your Square Enix Members account, it is possible to unlock objectives that allow you to earn Praxis kits to be redeemed in the upcoming Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. The only real flaw of Deus Ex GO - apart from obviously not being suitable for those who do not feel interested in the genre - lies in the voracious battery consumption by the application, which currently makes the product difficult to recommend for long sessions .", "date": "2016-08-18", "grade": "8.8"}
