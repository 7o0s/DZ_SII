Even without ever having even remotely reached the saturation point, the market has always welcomed more or less worthy representatives of this trend with fair constancy, a sign that the hard core of fans continues to appreciate the formula that has brought so much luck to Samus and to the Belmont family. The last in chronological order to have attempted this approach are the Texan boys of Renegade Kid, a team with great experience in the portable field that has made itself known above all for the Dementium series and for Moon on Nintendo DS and for that Mutant Mudds that is landed instead on different platforms. Their latest effort responds to the name of Xeodrifter, and is precisely a metroidvania in all respects for eShop Nintendo 3DS and Steam (and also arriving on Wii U). Xeodrifter is a small, limited and sometimes naive Metroidvania, but with a beating heart Only in space From our point of view, the price of a product should also give a certain perspective of how correct it is to expect from it: Xeodrifter is sold for less than 10, a very modest figure which therefore makes clear the aspirations and possibly also the limits of the title of Renegade Kid. Comparing it directly with products with enormously higher budgets would therefore make little sense. Having said this, we can therefore talk about the background of the game, which puts the user in the role of a space explorer forced due to damage to his ship to remain confined within an area in which four different, freely explorable planets are enclosed in any order. An initially unsettling faculty, above all for the hostility of the aliens and for the very modest abilities of the protagonist, able only to jump and shoot with the standard weapon. This situation is destined in the first minutes of the game to lead to frequent deaths: understanding which way to go to channel the progression is in fact an operation that passes through the most obvious of trial and error, with a certain frustration that hovers over the player in the initial bars. A choice, that of Renegade Kid, which if on the one hand gives a minimum of originality to the product, on the other it risks annoying or even alienating the less patient right away. However, it would be a pity, because it is enough to overcome this initial obstacle to get involved in the progression of Xeodrifter. In fact, the growth of the character passes not only through the expansion of the energy bar, but also through the collection of new abilities and weapons that make the fight against the aliens less and less unequal. In this sense, the Texan team has been particularly good at guaranteeing the player constant reasons for satisfaction, such as to make the Xeodrifter experience particularly engaging and pleasant. Among other things, some intriguing aspects can be found in the list of skills and in the management of weapons. As far as the first is concerned, it is above all the ability to teleport the protagonist to a second game plane that allows the development of the most interesting mechanics: in practice, by pressing a button, in specific and recognizable sections of the levels, it is possible to immediately pass background. This is obviously an ability that you need to exploit in order to continue in the levels, reaching areas that were unexplorable until a moment before. The weapon upgrades that you collect gradually are instead assignable to a whole series of attributes of your gun, exactly as if they were points to be distributed to the various characteristics of a character in an RPG. In this case it is therefore possible to choose whether to increase the rate of fire or the power of the single projectile, or to give it a wave trajectory rather than a radius one. The interesting thing is that the points can be assigned at will, giving life to a flood of possible combinations to then possibly save in 3 separate configurations, so as to be able to easily recall via the touch screen the most suitable one for the enemies you are facing. The 3D effect Pleasant in giving depth and detaching the parallax planes, the three-dimensional effect of Nintendo 3DS also finds application by emphasizing one of the main skills of one's character, capable of teleporting to the various game planes. In short, leaving the lever raised may be worth it. The other side of the coin Where Xeodrifter begins to show some ingenuity, or more properly some limitations, however, is in the level design that appearsyes competent and pleasant, but never brilliant. The progression is undoubtedly satisfying, mind you, but a little too linear to actually leave a mark. The choice to place the check points in an extremely rarefied manner within the levels is also questionable, forcing often and willingly to repeat large sections in the event of death; then the need to always return to the shuttle once the possibilities for exploration within a planet have been exhausted emphasizes the already heavy backtracking that the user is forced to deal with, an element so closely linked to the metroidvania genre itself, but which here becomes a bit boring and forced. It is also regrettable that the element of the bosses has been so little studied, evidently due to sacrifices made on the altar of budget limits: the fact is that in practice, throughout the entire adventure, one is forced to face a scant ten times the same boss, with only chromatic variations and some attack patterns to distinguish one from the other. On the other hand, the technical component contributes to putting the balance on the side of the pros, which, although relying on the much abused 8-bit pixel art, can count on a well-chosen and undoubtedly pleasant artistic style. Modest longevity, since for most players it won't take more than 3 hours to get to the end, and 5 to get 100% completion.", "date": "2015-07-16", "grade": "7.5"}
