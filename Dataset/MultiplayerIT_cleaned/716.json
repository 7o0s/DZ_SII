{"name": "Shrek SuperSlam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shrek-superslam.html", "text": "Shrek Bros. Melee Someone might think that the ogre Shrek is a perfect character for a video game: he is green, big and thick, he beats like a blacksmith and is prodigal of farts. His best friends are a daredevil donkey and a swordsman cat, ~pleasure~ and pimp. Before the license of the film passed into the hands of Activision, TDK Mediactive had ventured into the development of a title based on the Shrek film, however, achieving modest results. Shrek can be an apt character for a video game: he's green, big and heavy, pounding like a blacksmith and prodigal of farts. Shrek Bros. Melee The distributor changes, the developers change and the type of game also changes; abandoned the action-adventure, Shrek SuperSlam pits everyone against everyone, opting for a solution that is halfway between Smash Bros. Mele and the beautiful Power Stone of SEGA. That said, it would seem to be dealing with something interesting, unfortunately in the end the similarity with the aforementioned titles is only superficial and the game soon shows all its limits. A fighting game therefore, which rests on complex 3D arenas, structured with stairs, mezzanines, walls, and other elements that can be exploited during the clashes to vary the attack and defense strategies. Game Boy Advance The Shrek fighting game is also available for the more popular GameBoy Advance, but unfortunately we have to note that the situation is no better than the one described in the review. The title necessarily loses its three-dimensional structure in favor of a more tested 2D, very colorful but rather confusing in some situations. The story mode follows exactly that of the two-screen laptop (the cartoons are the same), while unlike the DS version, the fights feature four characters on the screen at the same time even in the one-player mode, which makes it a little the development of the encounters is less predictable. The control system, orphaned of two keys compared to the DS counterpart, proves to be a bit cumbersome, especially as regards the jump (here it is done by pressing up the directional cross), which in the most frenetic moments can give some problems. The absence of the second screen, neglected on the DS, is not noticed that much and does not affect the poor gaming experience. For the rest, the title closely resembles the Nintendo DS edition, with all the merits (few) and defects (many) that we have extensively explored. VOTE: 5 But let's go in order. Shrek SuperSlam provides the player with a dozen characters ready to give them a thrashing using the most disparate and individually characterized attacks; if Donkey can kick his opponent with his hind legs, Puss in Boots has a bewitching and hypnotic gaze on his side, while Shrek can take advantage of the consequences of a... um, troubled digestion. The game provides the player with an ad hoc tutorial to get hands on with the rudiments of combat and with the more complex moves. The simple attacks are typical of most fighting games: one key for weak but fast shots, one for powerful but slower ones, one key for jumping and the backbone R for parrying. In addition to this there are the combos, usually achievable with a combination of keys in sequence. The game arenas, about fifteen in all, naturally take up the environments seen in the film: Shrek's swamp, Fiona's castle, the Cat's home, Gingerbread's house, etc. Scattered here and there in the arena During the game, objects and bonuses of all kinds will appear to be collected and used during combat. It is allowed to collect up to a maximum of three objects at a time, which are listed in the touch-screen menu and selected from time to time with a simple touch of the thumb. However, in general the second screen plays a completely marginal role. COMMENT Shrek SuperSlam can count on a decent technical realization, but fails in the main mechanics of the game, thus proving to be unbalanced and all too simple. Even considering the target of children to whom the title is clearly aimed, one cannot help but highlight the excessive repetitiveness that afflicts it and the inevitable boredom that soon ensues. The short stories in cartoons that have the twelve characters as protagonists do not amuse and fail in the least to capture the player's attention and push him to continue. Pros: Shrek license Lots of characters and different arenas Lots of extras to unlock Cons: Repetitive and boring Too easy No singlepak multiplayer Now that we have described the basic features of Shrek SuperSlam, let's go deeper with itanalysis of game mechanics and understand why, as anticipated, the discrete premises do not translate into a convincing title. The heart of the game is the Slam attacks! (Mazzate! in the Italian localization) that can be performed only after having inflicted a sufficient amount of damage to the opponent. The match is won by whoever, at the end of the time, has scored the highest number of Slam! attacks. It soon becomes clear that all the combos and the ambaradan of objects available to the player are practically superfluous, given that continuously hitting the opponent on duty with only the Y key (fast hit) proves to be the most effective and safest attack. and unfortunately it is enough by itself to solve most of the challenges in one's favor. Alternatively, you can opt for the flying attack with the double jump to earn a couple of Slam! attacks in a short time. The main limitation of the game is undoubtedly the deficient AI in many respects The game system therefore denounces major limitations in terms of balance, but the major limitation of the game is undoubtedly the deficient AI in many respects. For example, if you earn a couple of Slam! and we therefore go to 2-0, all we need to do is stop motionless in parade somewhere in the stage and wait for the gong, since our opponent is stubborn to hit us in a completely harmless way, although it would be enough for him to collect a few special object to get out of the impasse. The story mode, the one that provides for the completion of about ten stages in sequence for each of the characters, therefore loses interest instantly, and is only useful for unlocking the numerous extras that Shrek SuperSlam carries in his womb (nothing exceptional even here: a ~memory~ style card game, a surrogate for space invaders, and other mini-games all rigorously contextualized in the world of Shrek). In more players, the situation certainly improves but, considering the fact that singlepak multiplayer is not foreseen, we certainly don't feel like recommending the purchase of four copies of a game that would have little to say even to the most avid fan of the ogre green. The young history of video games is full of productions born to exploit the notoriety of adventures, worlds and characters brought to success by a medium, cinema, second only to television in terms of its ability to reach the so-called ~general public~ with relative immediacy. The big family blockbusters are usually followed (or preceded) by licensed merchandising operations which include toys, sticker albums, assorted promotional activities. When cinema meets videogames, we speak of ~tie-in~, a genre that has had mixed fortunes over the years, managing to leave its mark only occasionally. Activision tries by bringing Dreamworks' entertaining Shrek to Nintendo laptops, playing potentially valid cards, that is, a cast of charismatic characters capable of appealing to the younger audience.", "date": "2005-12-06", "grade": null}
