An interesting operation by Square Enix, certainly also aimed at exploiting the successes of the series, which has established itself as one of the best modern narrative adventures of recent years, but above all at filling some holes and curiosities that the first season necessarily left things (and time limits) discovered. The prequel was thought of as a shorter product, an appetizer of Life Is Strange 2 currently already in development at Dotnod, and with Il Mondo nuovo we are already halfway through the story: a story which, although overall of an excellent narrative quality, it grants many highs but in this case also some lows. In our review we have tried in every way to avoid spoilers and annoying advances on the new episode: however, we are still within a plot developed in several chapters, and the references to Wake up are necessarily necessary. Therefore, if you have not played the first chapter, we advise you not to continue reading, and to come back when you have caught up; for now, go downstairs and play football. A world of ashes Brave New World picks up the story of Chloe and her new and unlikely friend Rachel where we left off, or grappling with a ~hot~ issue, in every sense. As if that weren't enough, soon one problem will lead to another and the world will collapse on the shoulders of the fragile protagonist, crushing her. From its ashes it will be necessary to orient oneself precisely in what is a completely renewed context. As poetic as it is fitting title, Chloe's ~new world~ presents multiple but all equally tormented aspects: it is that of a school that without too many problems throws her in the middle of the street, also because she belongs to a disadvantaged family context; that of a family that, due to the cumbersome presence of the mother's new companion, no longer feels its own; is that of an Arcadia Bay that hides dirty secrets in the guise of a charming and peaceful town, linked above all to the world of drugs and underage drug dealing, the real central theme of the episode, like loneliness was that of the previous one. The new world is unstable, relationships between people are becoming more and more complicated, and according to the metaphor of the fire (which returns several times) it seems to be covered in ashes, with no safe footholds for the girls. Girls, in the plural: because Rachel Amber's world is also ~new~, because of the secret she is forced to bear about her father, in which Chloe will also be involved. The bond between the two protagonists will become stronger and stronger, with the possibility of evolution between friendship and a deeper affection, depending on the shrewd and astute choices made available by the developers during the episode. It must be said that while Awake represented a pleasant breath of fresh air in Life Is Strange, because you changed your point of view and above all you met a fundamental character like Rachel live for the first time, Brave New World is not without frequent moments of tiredness. In some of them we will be forced, for example, to find objects scattered in certain environments, for completely futile purposes such as decorating the carcass of a car, completely superficial situations that dampen the tension and slow down the pace excessively. It should be added that the key moments, however convincing, are just a handful and all placed close to the finale, thus generating an unbalanced balance right from the start. The episode, narratively speaking, is therefore a consolidation operation focused on the bond of the girls, and we have the impression that it will collide with a tense, rapid, and intense last episode. Insult contests: second round The new mechanic introduced ad hoc in Before The Storm as Chloe's main weapon returns in the second episode: the insolence contest. The mechanism, based on insults and aggressive phrases, in certain contexts allows us to achieve the goal by literally ~taking words~ to the unfortunate person on duty (note: in this second round, destroying that know-it-all Victoria was a pleasure). The interlocutors may also be our friends, but the world of Arcadia Bay is cruel and if Chloe wants to get something there is no place for feelings: so off we go, after the opponent's opening joke, we have a handful of seconds to choose one of the three answers that appeared on the screen, only two of which will play in our favor. Too bad that a translation that is not always accurate makes it too often difficult to understand if we are about to make Chloe pronounce something winehundred or less: sometimes the indicated text resolves itself into a joke in which the girl says something else, forcing you to reload the last save to win the match, which is quite frustrating. One of the most pressing doubts concerns the decisions already taken and those still to be taken: apart from some secondary choices, which actually influenced the attitude of the supporting actors, far more important decisions than the first episode remain suspended for the moment. And if Brave New World continues to put our moral integrity to the test, with a couple of ~crossroads~ where one is truly taken aback, it is impossible to pronounce until Chloe and Rachel's adventures reach their climax: perhaps everything will be resolved with a fake decision-making power on the part of the player, as in the first Life Is Strange, leaving him with a bad taste in his mouth. Beyond the few uncertainties that govern the narrative system, it is also necessary to remember the many little gems that make Before The Storm, like its predecessor, an overall really well-finished title. These are secondary skits, sagacious jokes, references to the world of cinema, music and role-playing games, which show great attention to the context. They range from the toy robot who whines after Chloe takes the light bulb from him to apply it to the dump truck, to the girl who mumbles about the high school ~snub birds~ flying away when she approaches to observe them. And how can we not appreciate the wink to role-playing games, when the protagonist, after being expelled from school, always writes to a friend ~I made 1 against Principal Wells.
