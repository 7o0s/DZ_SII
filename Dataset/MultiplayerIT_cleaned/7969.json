The main problem, when choosing this setting, is to make a title quite pleasant and full of details despite the visual limitation. But precisely for this reason we have seen the birth of real design pearls, with extremely accurate animations and cinematic atmospheres capable of breaking every perceptive question. From an aesthetic point of view, The Showdown Effect undoubtedly belongs to the family of the aforementioned pearls, with meticulous aesthetic devices, Oscar-worthy explosions and mesmerizing light effects, obtained by mixing the excellent War of the Roses engine with cartoon-style assets. All seasoned with very pleasant animations, weapons of all kinds, convincing blood sprays, particle effects, bizarre costumes, acceptable rock soundtrack and parodies of the 80s action heroes, to which the title pays the right tribute. The 2D mechanics are inevitably limited, at least in terms of exploration, but The Showdown Effect's gameplay, which allows 8 players to shred and fill themselves with lead, enjoys all the gimmicks that have exalted modern platforming such as the ability to jump on walls, to slip on the ground, to attack opponents in hand-to-hand combat, to throw objects, to overturn tons of lead and to slash with axes, hatchets, shields, pipes and so on. Faced with a menu so full of possibilities, it's really a shame that it's only possible to play in multiplayer mode, given that this type of setting has recently given us calibers such as Shadow Complex, Mark of the Ninja and Deadlight. In any case, resorting to a two-dimensional setting also has its advantages in a multiplayer environment, allowing you to precisely balance the game mechanics. And this is precisely the strength of the title, which recalls those platform arenas full of competitive spirit but which appeared in the arcade just when it was about to set. Fortunately, today, this formula can count on the internet and on a more attentive audience that has finally approached apparently niche titles. The summa of the platformer As we anticipated, The Showdown Effect is not a simple action platform but the sum of the features that have changed the genre in recent years. By throwing yourself against a wall, after having taken a few vertical steps thanks to the inertia of the jump, it is possible, before gravity has the upper hand, to use the surface to head in the opposite direction. It is also allowed to leap through the vents, fight in close combat, lunge by combining two keys, make sudden sprints and even heal. The characters are extremely responsive and the gameplay quite intuitive, but the numerous possibilities require you to play seriously a few games before being fully mastered. Also it is important to know the maps full of elevators, passages, trapdoors and holes that allow players to go around the enemy or to hide. Despite the platform nature, in fact, the title takes into consideration the view and the opponents who are not in the line of sight of the character are invisible. This setting also allows you to use melee weapons and moves effectively although the balance is still not perfect. Thrown weapons, for example, seem to cause much more damage than firearms and lightsabers and shotguns allow you to carry out real massacres in enclosed spaces. Conversely, the machine gun causes less damage and is only fully effective over distance, becoming almost useless when the enemy charges head-on or suddenly emerges from a trap door. Furthermore, firearms require you to keep your aim centered on the enemy and given the high movement speed, and the numerous escape routes, this is not always easy. But for those who don't want to go too far, the missile launcher is also available which causes much more damage than the machine gun while being inevitably slower and potentially self-destructive when used at short range. Each player can equip two weapons by drawing from a long list and melee weapons are also scattered throughout the maps, available to players at any time. However, it seems superfluous to talk about the balance in detail. Special powers are relative in effectiveness and most of the time, once the full arsenal is unlocked, players have an equal chance of slaying enemies. Also, beingthe multiplayer title and probably developed to conquer one of the numerous slices of the audience looking for their eSport, numerous rebalancing is likely in the future. The content problem The touch of the Magicka authors can be seen both in the aesthetic style, and in the mix of medieval weapons and machine guns, and in the passion for bizarre costumes and extremely chaotic gameplay. From a technological point of view, The Showdown Effect puts a powerful engine like that of War of the Roses at the service of a platformer, and this returns remarkable light effects as well as guaranteeing respectable physics. Unfortunately this is linked almost exclusively to the characters only and the interaction with the surrounding environment is limited to a few elements. Fortunately, each level is enriched by valuable animations, such as the New Tokyo subway, and the explosions that season the endgames make everything much more alive. But a greater destructibility of the environment would have further enhanced each shooting and each fight by magnifying the soul, in a positive sense, of the title. Furthermore, there are only four maps, two medieval and two urban, and initially the choice in terms of costumes is very limited. Fortunately, but it is a minimal consolation, the latter can be unlocked, like weapons, by accumulating and spending experience points which also guarantee a rank to show to other players. Presumably also used to match players in matchmaking. Competitive play is also supported by a video streaming system, functional to the competitive aims of the title, and by the possibility of freely creating public or private servers that allow you to change some parameters. Game modes include team elimination, with a respawn timer, and last man, as well as of course the deathmatch that crowns the winner whoever kills the most opponents. All modes, competitive and fast, are quite classic but are characterized by some secondary rules that give the loser the chance to recover the situation. In team elimination, for example, it is necessary for all opponents to be dead simultaneously to conclude the game and this makes the ability to escape invaluable. While the deathmatch provides a final round where whoever is killed is excluded from the match until only one fighter is left alive.", "date": "2013-03-08", "grade": "8.0"}
