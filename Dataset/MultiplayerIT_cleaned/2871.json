Expectations to be met and grievances to be countered potentially lurk around every corner. What if this Crash game doesn't live up to expectations? What if the review was just singing its praises because, one way or another, you have to be persuaded to buy it? Fortunately, sometimes the reality is so evident that it does not require additional demonstrations or tests. So we will explain why Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time for PS4 is the best Crash Bandicoot game ever developed since the 90s, and why it will officially enter the ~sacred canon~, occupying a very respectable place. And here's what you will do, starting from the day it arrives on the market: you will play it and praise it, even more than us. Then you'll play it again, and again, and again, until you've unraveled its every little secret. Let's start. Plot Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time restarts, with its plot, exactly where Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped ended, immediately making it clear that between one Crash adventure and another the same years actually passed in the real world . For more than a decade, therefore, Doctor Neo Cortex, Uka Uka and Nefarious Tropy have been prisoners on a remote planet, with no possibility of returning to Earth... until Uka Uka, the evil mask, pushes her powers to the maximum by opening a time gap. The rift between dimensions allows the bad guys to escape and regroup, to face Crash Bandicoot again and get their revenge... but not only. While Dr. Cortex doesn't seem particularly enthusiastic about starting his war against the Bandicoots all over again, Tropy senses that Uka Uka has awakened something very powerful between dimensions: the Quantum Masks. Their magic could allow the antagonists, this time, not only to defeat their rivals, but even to become the rulers of space-time. Thus begins the adventure of Crash and Coco, who in the meantime were spending their days in peace on the usual island. Aku Aku, of course, is in turn a magical tribal mask: therefore he senses the distortion in reality and warns his friends. The journey begins to recover all the other Quantum Masks and stop the bold band of villains, one at a time. After the dozen hours of gameplay of the main campaign, an average that must take into account both those who prefer to run at breakneck speed and those who instead adopt a ~completer~ approach, follows the collection of all game collectibles and the possibility of repeating the individual levels in various different modes. We'll talk about this later: in the meantime, know that by looking for everything, seeing everything, facing everything and collecting everything, at least 25 hours will fly away. The worlds One of the many aspects that Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time affects in a positive way is the management of the worlds. The adventure of Crash and Coco (both characters can be used to tackle any level, freely) proceeds in a linear but never trivial way, within a board that houses the various worlds gradually unlocked by the player. Each of these platforms never allows you to know the next one in advance, in such a way as to preserve the sense of discovery for all time. The first game world is of course the Bandicoot island, which then gives way to the deserted lands controlled by N. Gin, then again to the pirate bay, and so on. The thematic succession seems random: Toys for Bob has tried to vary the environments as much as possible, and this is good, because immediately Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time presents itself as a kaleidoscope of different colors, situations and enemies. However there is always one main problem to face in every world: now a particular enemy to take down, now a Quantum Mask to recover. Backtracking is probably a fundamental value of the production: if each level could be tackled only once, Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time would end up in a meager experience. However, it is impossible to establish in advance how many times you will have to replay each world and each level, because there are rewards and news hidden everywhere. Maybe you will complete the Crash island level right away, even with the inevitable timed challenges or by collecting hidden gems, thinking ~okay, now I'm done here~. Not even for a dream: later, by beating a certain boss, you will find out what the previous levels are nowapproachable in other ways. For example, the distorted color N. Verted, obtained after defeating N. Brio. There are always rewards: they represent the main incentive to replay levels already seen in other ways or with other characters. All unlockable costumes can be viewed from the dimensional map (i.e. game hub) and equipped before the level begins; just as you can decide whether to face that particular level with Crash or Coco. However, it is not possible to change aesthetic parameters if you are already playing. Playstation 4 trophies Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time brings the Platinum Trophy to PlayStation 4, but getting it will be quite a challenge. In addition to completing the game several times you will also have to get all the relics, all the collectibles, all the ribbons, all the skins... in short, every little possibility offered by the title must be known to you. Game mode In addition to special variations of individual levels (such as N Verted), Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time can be played in two main game modes: Modern and Retro. This simple introduction, all in all trivial, makes the whole title enjoyable and enjoyable for every type of player: from the hardened old school and obsessed with the absurdly high level of difficulty to the poor, shy newcomer who can't jump on two crates in a row without crashing. The Modern mode offers some Checkpoints (Cases C) within the levels: just jump over them, and the game saves the progress up to that specific moment. All the player's deaths are still counted, and if they exceed three units, however, the level skin linked to skill will not be unlocked. But that's not all: if Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time realizes that the player is still dying too many times along the way, it adds a new checkpoint previously absent. There are obviously limits: at a certain point, you will still have to learn to overcome a certain difficulty on your own without help. Retro Mode is well, it's retro. Here the game philosophy returns to being that of the first three Crash Bandicoots: the checkpoints are fixed again and if you die more than three times it's game over; picking the wumpa fruits then becomes crucial to gaining extra lives. With the last death you will have to start the whole level all over again: everything. However, preferring one mode to another does not bring penalties or incredible advantages of any kind: therefore choose the one that allows you to make the most of the title. This was the main interest of the developers. The Quantum Masks Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is a title that swings to the bitter end between past and present, but never before have we seen one capable of capturing all that was good in the ~good old days~ to further enhance it. It was believed that Crash had already given everything with Warped, and instead here are new game possibilities related to the Quantum Masks. On the gameplay side, the Quantum Masks allow you to rethink the functioning of the levels from scratch. There are four in all: Lani-Loli, the first to be unlocked, who controls reality and the appearance / disappearance of objects in the game world; 'Akano, pure power, powered by dark matter: it guarantees an unstoppable spin, also useful for covering enormous distances in flight; Kapuna-Wa, the old granny who knows the past, present and future, and allows you to slow down time; finally Ika-Ika, with a double positive and negative personality, with which Crash can reverse gravity to walk on the ceiling. In the course of our previous insights we had expressed a concern: that these masks appeared only in some completely negligible moments, leaving Crash Bandicoot the game we had always known. This is not the case: their presence is constant, and enriches the gameplay with an unexpected depth. They are granted by the developers only when necessary to advance, and in fact it is not possible to do it except with the help of the Quantum Masks. They are usually accompanied by the new original ideas of what we would dare to call ~pure gameplay~: unpublished possibilities linked only to the forces of Crash Bandicoot. That is: swinging between suspended ropes to advance, sliding at breakneck speed on lianas or metal cables, racing on side walls. Defects? Does Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time have any flaws? Surely: after all, who doesn't have any? But for the sake of honesty, we would like to warn you that we have found very few. So few as to appear almost pretext, in the review. Toys for Bob have once again shown themselves to be masters in their work: they will probably be able toOnly get better, over the next few years (and hopefully they'll get Spyro 4 as well at this point). Among the aspects that convinced us the least is certainly the management of secondary characters. Apart from Crash and Coco, it is possible to play some levels with Dingodile, Tawna Bandicoot and Neo Cortex: these are worlds specially tailored to these characters, in which the style of play changes drastically. And they're really fun, as well as being a great variation; the problem is that there aren't many. Probably from the developers' point of view, their total number seemed right (after all, they are not the protagonists) however - in hindsight - a greater number would have helped Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time to be the perfect game, at the interior of its kind. Besides the fact that these different timelines yes, that they are specious: there's really no reason to get to see what these unlikely heroes were up to, during Crash's journey. If not, precisely, to ~change~ the offer a little. A few notes also on the technical sector: we played Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on PlayStation 4 Pro, in 1080p and 30fps. The cleaning on the screen is remarkable, as is the graphic detail: the difference with the N-Sane Trilogy is evident. Yet the transition films seemed a little ~dirtier~ to us than the actual gameplay sessions; it might just be an impression, though.", "date": "2020-10-01", "grade": "9.0"}
