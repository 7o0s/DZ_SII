The step from the stimulus to doing better and frustration is in fact short and cannot fail to take into account a certain subjectivity. However, when a developer tries to artificially increase this factor, the balance needle inevitably begins to lean decisively towards an imbalance in the negative sense. We Are the Dwarves, a title with an interesting and admittedly difficult concept, probably falls into this case and, between one death and another, it almost never manages to spur the player to try again with conviction after a game over. Let's try together to understand why. We Are the Dwarves is a title with a lot of problems, but at least there are aliens and space dwarfs! Hunting for stars in the deep sea Belonging to a glorious race that has always been associated with underground life, the dwarves of We Are the Dwarves represent a further step forward in this direction and so, in the imagination of the Whale Rock Games guys, the entire dwarf universe is now enclosed in the underground. In this context, stars are not considered the celestial bodies we are used to, but luminescent stones with special powers and capable of giving life and prosperity to the various kingdoms. Like all sources of energy, however, even these stars are not inexhaustible. For this reason, the three main kingdoms of the dwarfs decide to send their emissaries on an interstellar mission in search of a new star in the only unexplored corner of the universe: the depths of the ocean. Despite the interesting premise, involving nothing less than dwarf astronauts and aliens living in caves in the sea abyss, within real independent ecosystems, the story is only a draft and is just mentioned in the introductory video, to end soon relegated to the role of a silent frame. In this sense, then, neither the pages that are progressively added to the in-game diary, always very synthetic, nor the information reported on the game's official website, which at the moment is nothing but a nice empty shell awaiting text, help. Even the personalities of the three protagonists are barely sketched and their dialogues end up being nothing more than short introductory interludes for the mission at hand. Learn and die If the narrative part is little more than a pretext, even mouse and keyboard in hand We Are the Dwarves often leaves us dumbfounded. First of all, however, it should be noted that the title is presented as a real-time strategy game which, by pressing the space bar, allows you to slow down time to calmly think about the next move in the most agitated situations. You start by controlling a single dwarf at a time, in order to become familiar with the skills of each, and then you get to bring the team together to be able to launch more elaborate combined attacks. Thus it begins with Forcer, the leader of the expedition, equipped with a powerful firearm and support skills. Playing as him requires a lot of attention, especially for the recoil of the weapon, which could make the poor dwarf fall off a cliff. However, this feature can also be used to facilitate exploration and interaction with the scenarios: for example when you have to reach an object located on a lower floor, taking advantage of the opportunity to take the enemy who is patrolling the main road from behind ; or to move in the void when you come across an area affected by spatial distortions. The other two members of the team, Smashfist and Shadow, are instead more inclined to melee and sneak attacks respectively. The latter is also probably the most fun to maneuver thanks to its ability to move quickly in the shadows, but it is not so obvious that it will come to use it. In the midst of so many good ideas, the work of the Ukrainian team lacks practical implementation. The characters' abilities are introduced in an all too synthetic way and, even after numerous attempts, it remains difficult to be able to correctly use the available options. The same goes for the role-playing component, limited to a small number of upgrades that have no real impact until the second half of the adventure is reached. The continuous search for a strategic approach finally collides with an often unpredictable artificial intelligence, which is not only capable of organizing itself with neighboring units, but also does so with an almost commendable inconsistency. The logic of trial and error, useful for the player to learn from the previous errorsentities and develop a winning strategy - which, incidentally, is practically always only one - is thus replaced by an absolutely frustrating randomness, especially when you find yourself dying after a perfect path only because the system has not registered for the umpteenth time one of the mouse clicks. Half dwarfs The difference between the success and failure of a mission is thus almost always marked by the influence of luck, which works at the hands of the unresponsive control system and the whims of artificial intelligence. Perhaps due to a lack of funds due to the cancellation of the Kickstarter campaign, We Are the Dwarves then appears as an unfinished work also in all other aspects related to the technical realization. And we're not referring to the graphics, always pleasant despite the perhaps too low brightness of the settings, nor to the optimization problems of a title that requires far too many resources to offer adequate fluidity. The technical problems rather concern the frequent crashes of the application, display errors with dual monitors and a general lack of settings for customization. For example, you cannot change the mapping of the commands, by default not exactly very comfortable, nor can you act on the graphic settings, reduced to the choice of resolution and one of the three predefined options. Then there is no support for the controllers, while the localization in Italian, promised for menus and subtitles, is inadequate like that of most of the European languages proposed.", "date": "2016-02-29", "grade": "5.0"}
