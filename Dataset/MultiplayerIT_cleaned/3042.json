A long-forgotten category after the glories experienced between the end of the 90s and the beginning of the following decade, leading in the same period to the creation of titles similar to Commandos in the wake of the latter's success. One of these was Desperados, launched in 2001 by Spellbound Entertainment to the delight of all Old West lovers. real-time tactician was firing his last rounds. With a leap of about ten years from John Cooper's last adventure we arrive precisely at Mimimi Games, a German development team intending with Desperados III to confirm the trust gained by players who appreciated the previous raid in Japan. As we have already seen with the test of the beta a few months ago, the elements to do well are all there: we just have to go and see if the good premises have been maintained. The plot: before Desperados Although the game is called Desperados III, the story told in it is in all respects a prequel to the already existing trilogy. All in all, a wise choice, considering that the first chapter dates back to almost twenty years ago and it is therefore more than likely that the youngest of today's gamers have not had the opportunity to see John Cooper at work previously. Those who have known Desperados since its origins will immediately find the protagonist of the series, even as a little boy in the very early stages of the game which also act as a tutorial. The latter consists of a first level in which John is shown to us in the company of his father to learn the ABCs of the tactical gunslinger: nothing complicated, indeed exactly enough to put us at ease before tackling what is the first mission real of the game. After being catapulted into the decade that begins with the 1870s we find the protagonist now grown up, engaged in a train journey to get to Flagstaff. Of course, the quiet will last very little, before finding himself forced to deal with the inevitable troubles that will lead John Cooper to face the men of the DeVitt Company, a company with very few scruples. John's personal stories will intertwine more and more with those of the companions he will meet gradually, uniting the protagonist's past and present until the final showdown is reached. Without going any further in talking about the plot, we can say that the sixteen levels that make up the story of Desperados III flow away quite pleasantly from a narrative point of view, also offering some well-placed twists before the inevitable epilogue. Wanting to find fault, on a couple of occasions the impression we had was that we were dealing with a filler intended to lengthen the broth with respect to the main plot. Overall, however, the experience developed by Mimimi Games undoubtedly deserves to be experienced not only by those who love the western genre. The applause goes both to the setting, which is rather varied as we will see, and to the work employed in the characterization of the characters that accompany John, each of which is introduced and subsequently represented with due attention. The same goes for the main antagonist, whose appearances are few but almost always effective. We therefore confirm the good impressions we had previously. The characters: Collaboration is everything A quintet like that of Desperados III has an obligation to be described properly, also because the gameplay dynamics of the game are based on the abilities of the individual characters. Let's start with the protagonist, John Cooper, who corresponds to the figure of the classic gunslinger, skilled in the use of his two mouths of fire and the knife. John is also able to sneak onto surfaces inaccessible to other less agile characters, and can distract enemies for a few moments by flipping a coin. In order of appearance, the second we find is Doc McCoy, another old acquaintance of Desperados fans. In addition to healing himself and his friends, Doc is above all a skilled sniper and is able to use his knowledge of alchemy to stun enemies individually or in groups. gang. He is in fact a somewhat crude thug to whom a large part of the comic vein (to put it in Boris's words) of Desperados III is linked. Olthree to keep us entertained, Hector also knows how to make himself useful thanks to an ax that allows him to cut down a certain type of enemy in a single blow. He is also an expert in traps, and can position his trap named Bianca so that it is not seen by the sentries. Like the others, Hector can also use firearms: in fact, he has a rifle capable of doing damage to even more enemies, placed within a certain radius in front of him. Continuing in order of appearance we find Kate O'Hara, another recurring name in Desperados. Its main ability is to disguise itself to pass undisturbed among enemies, using its charm to distract and possibly stun them if necessary. She also owns a mini-pistol, which she can use making little noise unlike the others' weapons. The latest addition to the group is Isabelle Moreau, an expert in voodoo art in possession of the most original skills among those sported by the quintet. In addition to being able to take control of the minds of enemies, forcing them to perform the actions she imposes on them, Isabelle can also link two characters together, binding them to the same destiny. For example, by attacking one of the two with a knife or with another weapon, the other will repeat the same animation by falling to the ground without being touched. However, we must be careful, because it is still possible that a guard witnesses the scene and ends up suspicious. Isabelle also owns a cat, which she can command to distract an enemy without having to do it herself. Like Cooper, he is also able to climb where the others cannot. As you will have understood, it is a well-matched group, which however you will see acting for most of the time separated with only some of its members. It is therefore necessary to keep in mind the skills of each one, to successfully face the missions that are proposed to us in Desperados III. How? Let's see it in the next paragraph. The gameplay: a challenge for everyone Desperados III remains quite faithful to the tactical genre to which it belongs, without wanting to force the hand in an attempt to modernize it. In terms of difficulty, Mimimi Games' effort closely resembles that of its predecessors, resulting in the advanced stages being quite challenging even at a normal level. For this reason, in addition to being divided into some predefined levels, the difficulty can also be customized through some parameters, thus allowing all players to feel at ease once the game has started. In addition to the combined use of the controlled characters' abilities, the key to success in Desperados III lies in the careful observation of the behaviors of the enemies. Haste is never a good advisor and planning the group's actions properly means avoiding having to reload the same save over and over again. To help us we find the mode called showdown, thanks to which we can block time to issue orders to the members of the group who will then carry them out simultaneously. For example, you can ask Doc to shoot a guard who is looking in the direction in which Cooper has to pass, making the latter at the same time distract another with his coin before moving. Or we can send Kate to seduce an enemy, turning them to the opposite side to which another of our characters is sent to stun them. All five members of the group are able to transport bodies, but here too you need to plan well the actions and who does them to avoid being discovered. Kate, for example, is slower and cannot render enemies harmless indefinitely, while Hector, thanks to his size, is the only one who can also run while carrying someone on his shoulder. When approaching Desperados III one must necessarily be ready for the idea that failing and trying again often is part of the game, with the awareness of being faced with a title that, despite being quite difficult at times (the developers recommend starting from the easy level if you are not are experts in the genre) allows the player to immediately recognize the rash move that made him exposed. Once alerted by our entry into their visual cone (visible by pressing the right mouse button), the enemies flock en masse to the place of sighting to patrol it properly: successfully escaping dangerous situations is always possible, but also don't expect to have an easy life here. The duration of the main story is around twenty-five hours, with a variable total depending on one's ability with the genre to which Desperados III belongs. To these hours must be added any additional time to devote to some objectsspecific skills for each mission (including a series of speedruns), plus what passed in the challenges. At a certain point, in fact, some additional missions are unlocked, external to those of the main line, within which we are presented with alternative situations to those of the levels already seen in the story mode. Graphics and sound With its missions, Desperados III allows us to take a tour of the old West, through settings that have entered the collective imagination. In fact, from the mountains of Colorado we end up in the middle of Louisiana, including its characteristic bayou and the city of New Orleans, and then move to New Mexico to witness the final lines. The movements of the protagonists therefore give us the opportunity to face missions that are very different from each other both in terms of visuals and gameplay situations. If we are near the river, for example, it is easier to go unnoticed by swimming or hiding in the vegetation, while in a built-up area it may also be possible to pass undisturbed in front of the numerous guards unwilling to cause panic in a crowded place. The variety of actions that we are called to perform therefore benefits from it, even if in general the objectives of the missions are often and willingly attributable to the need to recover an object or a character before going to a final point on the map. However, some expedients such as the use of lanterns at night help to vary the dynamics between one mission and another, keeping the player's interest alive. In purely graphic terms, Desperados III must be evaluated bearing in mind the engine's limits Unity with which it was created. So don't expect who knows what level of detail especially at higher zoom levels, even if the developers have resorted to motion capture to try to improve the animations of the characters. However, good direction manages to at least partially fill the aforementioned limits, playing with the shots at the right moment. The levels are for the most part very airy, offering various movement alternatives within them to achieve a certain objective. In missions with larger maps, not being able to zoom out beyond a certain limit caused us some confusion in trying to find the best route, forcing us to move the view several times to define our strategy. The enemies are present in a good number and variety, also presenting some differences related to their type: women are, for example, immune to Kate's charm, just as dogs are able to smell her even under her disguise. On the physical aspect, however, a little more could have been done, given that some opponents are decidedly similar to each other: if on the one hand this allows the player to immediately identify the type of enemy in front of him, on the other the impression at times is to deal with an army of clones. The sound has a very good level of dubbing in English, accompanied by subtitles in Italian. The soundtrack does its duty more than well, especially with its main theme destined with its variations to make its way into your ears as it did with ours. Finally, we point out the presence of a very nice replay mode, thanks to which you can retrace each mission to review the entire path taken and the actions carried out by the various characters in an accelerated time.", "date": "2020-06-12", "grade": "8.7"}
