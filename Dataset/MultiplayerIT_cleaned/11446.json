{"name": "Midnight Bowling 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-bowling-2.html", "text": "Gameloft's ~Midnight~ series, which also includes billiards and darts titles, aims to cover that less famous part of the sports games sector. The protagonist disciplines of these products are much less popular than football, to mention the national sport, and it is perhaps also for this reason that the developers have done their utmost to build a story around it that goes beyond mere competitive practice. The first episode of the Midnight Bowling series proposed just that: not just one game mode, but different ways of doing more or less the same thing, namely throwing a ball in an attempt to knock all the pins down. As we will be able to see, this sequel takes up its structure and enriches it, also refining its gameplay. From the start screen you can start a quick game (with random values) or try your hand at Career, Battle or Challenge modes. Let's say right away that these last two modes are also present in the career, in the form of tests that must be faced to pass each stage, and give us the possibility of organizing small tournaments with friends (up to four players) or against the CPU, or to try the various challenges, in which you play alternative bowling, made up of skill tests (you have to knock down the pins all together, with a certain number of attempts, with an always different arrangement). Career mode is the most substantial part, as well as the means we have to unlock all the characters available: at the beginning we will only be able to select two, but the list will expand as we defeat the opponents in their locations. Each stage shows a different scenario, as well as an ever-increasing level of difficulty, and is basically divided into three phases: a first part in which solo launches are made, with the aim of achieving a minimum score; a second part represented by the challenge with the local champion (who will then become a selectable character); a third and final part in which particular skill challenges must be faced. The control system designed for the game proves to be really good right from the start, adapting to any device (even the one equipped with the worst joystick in the world): the shots must first be made by choosing a starting position, pressing the joystick left or right to place the character; after which a power indicator starts, which must be blocked in the area we want to obtain more or less power; finally, we will have to block the direction of the throw according to our will, with the arrow moving more or less rapidly in proportion to the force of the shot. Once the ball has been thrown, we will still have the option to make it change its trajectory by pressing left or right to generate a corresponding effect. This means that even seemingly failed attempts can be recovered in extremis. The making of the game is great. The graphic elements already present in the first Midnight Bowling have been taken up, refined and enriched with new things. The characters derive from digitized photographs, therefore we cannot speak of a more or less successful design, but the scenarios are really very beautiful, characterized by different shades as well as a very successful mix of bitmap and polygonal graphics. The end result is really excellent, with lots of nice touches of class (see, for example, the screens on the back of the grille). The sound compartment consists of some well-made, catchy MIDI music, whose volume unfortunately cannot be adjusted independently. PRO Technically excellent Lots of modes, lots of different characters Outstanding control system... AGAINST ...maybe even too much Difficulty leveled down Audio not adjustable independently", "date": "2008-05-02", "grade": "S.V."}
