{"name": "Def Jam Rapstar", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83617-def-jam-rapstar-il-rap-di-konami.html", "text": "The world of videogame productions is now full of karaoke-style games or games based on the singing concept, just think of the successes of titles such as SingStar or Michael Jackson: The Experience. Perhaps with the variant, in this last case, sometimes of dancing or the sound of an instrument in addition to the singing part, but in principle always based on singing and group fun. However, a vein that is perhaps not 100% exploited in the sector is that relating to rap and hip hop music, a ~difficult~ genre, which has seen only a few of his songs included in the above compilations, but in principle for more commercial and in limited numbers. Konami thus tries to fill this gap with Def Jam Rapstar, a title created in collaboration with the record company Def Jam recordings, a company founded by Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin which boasts or has boasted among its artists, also through the sub-labels produced, artists of the caliber of LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Curren$y, Kanye West and TLC, and for this reason considered almost the flag of rap in the world. Proposing a very different track list from those we are used to using to sing in front of the television and which you can view in the appropriate box on this same page, Def Jam Rapster definitely focuses on a style of play that starts from the simple ~sing along the indications on the screen~, to then ~evolve~ into something more sophisticated, so to speak, thanks to the considerable complexity in managing the rhythmic parts compared to the melodic ones typical of certain songs. Game mode The product revolves around three game modes: they are called respectively Free, Career and Freestyle. The first two, options and objectives aside, are quite similar since in both the user is actually asked to rap the microphone in his hand, respecting the rhythm of the phrases that flow on the video and following the melody, accumulating the highest possible score during the exhibition to then be evaluated by a counting system that ~verifies~ the performance. Going into the specifics, obviously the Free mode is perfect for playing mainly with friends, perhaps in two in the classic Duet options, that is, collaborating with a partner to get the best possible score, or Challenge, battling with them to the last note. And also to practice. While the Career mode is certainly designed to enhance the single player game: in this session the user must overcome a series of challenges in succession to obtain not only good ratings from the software but also some prizes, such as access to songs that base are blocked, just to give an example. As for the Freestyle session, as the term itself suggests in English, gamers are given the opportunity to sing freely on any song they want, even improvising the text without worrying too much about points, various evaluations and how many 'other. Said of the modes available in the product, let's take a closer look at the actual game phases. Each song has its own difficulty levels like any genre title, but compared to them in Def Jam Rapster the level of challenge is also determined by the words that will be sung. And here the voice recognition system that Konami has developed for this project comes into play. The soundtrack Def Jam Rapstar offers gamers over 50 music tracks related to the best known names in the industry such as 50 Cent, Kanye West, Ice Cube, Public Enemy, Snoop Dogg and many others. The choice is quite wide and a series of songs that practically cover twenty years or so of rap and hip hop stand out. Here are some songs and their author in detail: Beastie Boys - ~Brass Monkey~, Diddy feat. The Notorious B.I.G., Lil' Kim & The Lox - ~It's All About The Benjamins~ (Remix), Dr. Dre feat. Snoop Dogg - ~Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang~, Kanye West feat. Jamie Foxx - ~Gold Digger~, Lil' Kim - ~Crush On You~, Outkast - ~So Fresh, So Clean~, Salt-N-Pepa - ~Push It~, Snoop Dogg - ~Gin and Juice~. Playstation 3 trophies Def Jam Rapstar offers 52 trophies, of which 1 of Platinum, 3 of Gold, 5 of Silver and the others in Bronze. To unlock them it will take quite some time since in addition to mastering the various songs and typical rhythms of rap well, the game requires you to accumulate a multitude of points and microphones in the various modes, to complete the difficult Career session and win many fights vowels one on one. Several trophies also assume a certain number of consecutive victories in the various modes and the overcoming of some challenges at the Hard level. Sharing This system is quite sophisticated and very careful, aperhaps too much, to the precision with which the sentences, the words are spelled out in time, and sometimes even to how they are pronounced, so you have to pay close attention to what you do even at the simplest game levels. To understand better: in titles such as the often mentioned SingStar, sometimes it is enough to hum the tune of the song in which you are trying your hand at being able to obtain good results. You pick up the microphone and in less than no time maybe you can vocally perform a song like Dancing Queen by ABBA or Toxic by Britney Spears. In Def Jam Rapster, however, not because an imperfect pronunciation or a wrong point of the song is immediately reported as an error. However, returning to the intrinsic difficulties of performances, things can obviously improve with experience and help, but provided you dedicate the right amount of time to learning the best singing technique to perform each single song and have a lot of patience. In short, before being able to sing decently and maybe get a decent score, it will be necessary to play and play many times. For this reason we feel like defining the title more of a hardcore game than a simple casual musical game. Another interesting element of this product is related to editing personal videos and sharing them online. In practice, if you have an ad hoc camera available for the console in your possession, you can record personal or friends' performances and then edit them in a movie of a maximum duration of thirty seconds. Through a special tool present among the options, it is then possible to add filters, animations and other effects and upload the finished work on the internet to the game's community site, allowing other users to view and vote for them. As far as the graphics and audio of the product are concerned, it must be said that in the first case Def Jam Rapster presents screens and menus that are not visually excellent but which are still pleasing to the eye: and then in the end they serve as a background for the artists' videos present in the game. Their style, which represents a schematized night city, is not bad, with an interface that is quite comfortable. In the second case, censorship of some texts aside, we have a playlist of 50 and more tracks ranging, as mentioned in the box, from 2Pac with ~I Get Around~ to 50 Cent with ~I Get Money~, passing through the Beastie Boys and their 'Brass Monkey' and Run-D.M.C.'s 'Run's House' Others can still be purchased in the store.", "date": "2011-01-18", "grade": "7.3"}
