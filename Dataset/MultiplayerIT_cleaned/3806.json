{"name": "Sunless Skies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sunless-skies-recensione.html", "text": "After the success of Sunless Sea, the guys from Failbetter have finally managed to publish the third chapter of the Fallen London saga. Sunless Skies had been announced since 2016 and launched in Early Access on Steam twelve months later. At the dawn of last year the financial problems of the British software house seemed to have put an end to the project, but with a backlash Paul Arendt, after losing the screenwriter Alexis Kennedy in the meantime hired by BioWare for the new chapter of Dragon Age , he succeeded in the enterprise. After all, with the name they gave themselves, they certainly could not end in disgrace. It is not easy to describe Sunless Skies: if we wanted to liquidate it in a few lines we could say that it is a sort of exploratory shoot 'em up mixed with a textual role-playing game structure (as in fact the progenitor Fallen London is), set in a futuristic London victorian. In short, the perfect mix to serve in the best English tearooms. However, all this would be simplistic and would not do justice to the chisel work carried out by the developers, both in the artistic field, with desolate scenarios (Gothic, the guys from Failbetter would define them), at times scary, in which our train of desires will get lost for hours, as in that of the screenplay, thanks to the undisputed ability to tell dozens and dozens of stories, simply sketching a situation, putting the right word, visualizing a curious image. Little orphans We leave, in fact, on board the Orphean train, now reduced to shreds. The current captain is about to die and the first officer (the player) will take his place once he arrives at New Winchester Station, the closest spaceport. From here the profile (literally) of the hero is created, first choosing his profession from a menu that is anything but obvious and made up of eight stereotypes. There is the ministerial inspector, skilled in investigation and deductions; the priest, able to hearten the crew; the sailor, expert in battles. The skills are divided into four items: heart, veil, iron and mirror; since they cannot be translated into ~physical~ modifications of the avatar, they are limited to opening dialogue choices and quests. In the second step, the background of the commander and his affiliation with one of the guilds of the game world is determined; finally you have to decide even the final goal of your game. In Sunless Skies you can play for gold, fame or even for the discovery of the truth, which would then also be the ~real~ main quest designed by the developers who, however, suggest tackling it only after having been successful in one of the previous ones. After registering our darling, we can finally explore New Winchester. Everything happens in the form of dialogues and stories: there are no characters to move or places to visit, but only lines of text to browse and choose. We will immediately find an insolent inspector who will pay to be enrolled; with the money earned we could then hire a navigator who will improve the Orphean's statistics. Not everything will be clear from the start; on the contrary, it will be difficult to understand the context in which you are moving (having played one of the two previous titles in this case can help) and therefore all that remains is to weigh anchor and set sail into the unknown. Navigation So let's examine the more ~interactive~ part of Sunless Skies. The engine moves exactly like a spaceship using the WASD keys; E and Q instead serve to translate sideways, a movement of vital importance when crossing other ships. Some of these will tend to ignore us, others will hunt to the other end of the world. The fights are by no means trivial: it is very difficult to avoid enemy blows, especially due to the inertia-free physics. Missiles, which are fired with the left mouse button, fill a heat gauge and so do strafe maneuvers. These are gimmicks that make the action more tactical and that work discreetly as long as there is only one opponent nearby; in multiple clashes they risk quickly turning into a source of frustration. In any case, the steps forward compared to the predecessor are tangible, even if we can safely say that it is not the most successful aspect of the Failbetter production. When you're not shooting, you spend most of your time exploring the map. The rhythms are extremely dilated and, although perfectly aligned with the reflective gameplay, they risk tiring in the long run. This happens above all at the beginning, when the morphology of the four world maps is not yet well in mind. However, there are a couple variables to keep in mindutmost consideration, while wandering in search of the next port, which make navigation anything but relaxed. These are fuel and food, essential raw materials to be able to continue. They can be recovered from the carcasses of destroyed ships, buying them in city bazaars or still investigating some points of attention that can be revealed on the map by performing a research activity which has the contraindication of consuming several rations. Difficult start It goes without saying that this subtle balancing act is particularly important in the early hours of the game, when upgrades and experience are at a minimum. These are also the phases of greatest frustration because Sunless Skies is very unpermissive: you have to adopt the ~right~ strategy to grow your crew and even the smallest uncertainty can lead to game over. Death is a really crucial point because, at least in the initial attempts, it will be practically impossible to end the adventure with the captain you originally chose. A firefight too close, the fuel that ends kilometers from the next station, the money that is not enough to fill the stocks of the hold causing cannibalism in the members of the crew are among the most common causes of death. Not to mention the terror that decreases the crew's self-control as you explore the unknown or when you meet scary creatures: in short, any excuse is good to make a trip to the Elysian fields and this means having to start over. Some choices made by the previous captain will be permanent, other decisions can be retraced and modified. Part of the experience is passed on to the new commander, so as not to be faced with a blank sheet of paper from time to time, but permadeath, as Anglo-Saxon players call it, is one of the most contradictory elements of the title. Whoever believes that it is part of the philosophy of the game corresponds to a part of users who would gladly do without it: luckily the programmers have well thought of a mode in which there is a save from which to restart in case things take a bad turn fold. Take me to the clouds above Like the previous Sunless Sea, this Sunless Skies also betrays its textual role-playing origins, and it is no coincidence that it gives its best in the dialogue sector which, as in the previous one, is numerous. And just as many are the secondary characters, all well characterized, each with its own story to be developed just like in the best BioWare titles. The skill of Failbetter lies in the ability not to use movies or animations to create involvement and empathy. It is equally admirable how certain choices can unleash their effects both immediately and after hours of play, so each answer must be carefully considered. The biggest obstacle is represented, paradoxically, precisely by the quality level of the writing which is certainly above the average literary production of video games. Which means that a good level of knowledge of English may not be enough to fully appreciate the monumental work of British screenwriters. From a graphic point of view, the work is commendable: the tables on which the locomotive moves are well made and respect the gothic/steampunk cut that is now a trademark of the developers, while we would have preferred a slightly more intuitive and streamlined interface ( for example we would have liked to see, especially in the higher resolutions, all the dialogue options contained in a single screen, without the need to scroll it down), but these are problems that can easily be overlooked. The work on the soundtrack is a bit disappointing, not so much for the quality, which is very high like the rest of the production, but because it is a sort of remix of that of Sunless Sea.", "date": "2019-02-18", "grade": "8.2"}
