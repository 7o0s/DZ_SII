{"name": "Guilty Gear XX - The Midnight Carnival", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guilty-gear-xx-the-midnight-carnival.html", "text": "Midnight Carnival An interesting feature of the series is a solid and rich storyline, which is the backdrop for a seemingly ordinary fighting game. Gears are sentient genetically engineered war machines, free to roam the Earth and deal damage left and right. In the distant future, there are also assassins who hunt down the Gears, secret organizations who plot for their possession, demonic cults intent on exploiting them for shady purposes. Guilty Gear XX does not have a real plot, rather it continues the individual plots of the characters presented since the first Guilty Gear, starting from the end of episode X, when the various ~heroes~ met in one way or another the most disturbing existence: a girl possessed by an angel and a demon named Dizzy, on which weighs an exorbitant bounty. Each of them has made choices, and now a new tournament is on the horizon, and it is likely that these choices will affect the course of events, the results of the tournament, the fate of the Gears and, why not... the fate of the world. These events are narrated in the Story Mode available for single-play. You got it right, finally after an edition practically devoid of modes for solitary players, a complex and compelling Story Mode returns, which through an ingenious system of ~crossroads~ allows you to view up to three different endings for each character, for a total of nearly sixty endings. As if that weren't enough, in addition to the canonical Survival Mode, Sammy also added the M.O.M. Mode (Medal of Millionaire), a sort of score-based Survival; as well as the Mission Mode, which mimicking Namco's Soul Edge and Soul Calibur offers fifty challenges of variable difficulty that force the player to adopt different strategies to beat opponents usually with a clear advantage. Obviously, there is also the two-player mode ... and they are terrible blows. Heaven or Hell Guilty Gear XX offers, as in the case of its predecessors, a gameplay focused mainly on the spectacularity and chaotic frenzy of the fights. The few keys corresponding to the basic attacks allow an immense number of chains of attacks, which translates into a frightening amount of combos, limited only by the player's imagination. Obviously, there are the classic special moves that differ from wrestler to wrestler, as well as the so-called Tension Attacks, or the classic super moves. This last type of attack is just one of the many techniques that take advantage of the Tension Gauge placed at the bottom of the screen, as well as the Roman Cancel (which allows you to physically cancel the recovery frames following the execution of a special move, to increase length of a combo), the Faultless Defense (which allows you to parry attacks without receiving the slightest damage), the Dust Attacks (useful to launch the enemy in the air to continue a combo in flight) and the Dead Angle Attack (basically, the counterattack). Some variations of these techniques are new to GGXX, such as the False Roman Cancel or the Stagger Attack. Totally new to the series however is the Burst Gauge, a bar placed under the energy that allows the execution of a technique called, precisely, Burst, which allows you to block or counterattack for a single instant any attack, difficult to use as extremely useful . And mind you, this list is only the smallest part of the even more extensive one that characterizes the gameplay variety of Guilty Gear XX, a game that seems to entrust the victory to total randomness but which in reality forces the player to learn every possibility of action and to activate it with precision, in order to win the most difficult battles. And this preamble was necessary to present two even more particular features of the GG combat system. The first concerns the unpredictable special moves of the characters themselves, which go from the absurd to the completely insane without too many problems, in perfect harmony with their visionary characterization (yoyos that transform into stuffed bears, anchor-boomerangs and hair and animated shadows are on the agenda) without neglecting an obvious complexity and strategic depth. The second feature is the attack called Instant Kill: present since the first Guilty Gear, this powerful special move has been further refined and balanced in this new chapter, and essentially it is an attack capable of eliminating the total opponent's remaining energy. However, to activate it you must first enter a particular action status, and if the attack misses, it comesparried, counterattacked or simply not carried out within a time limit, the player who attempted its execution will find himself without the Tension Gauge (and all the techniques based on it) for the rest of the round. Risky but lethal, it is a clear example of how strategy dominates the fights of really expert players, who will still be forced to find time to attack the enemy between one planning and another, given that there is a lurking always the Negative Penalty: stay still or in defense for too long (the famous ~turtle technique~, in short) and the Tension will begin to discharge, your attack power will drop and the like. There are no breaks in Guilty Gear XX. Let's Rock If you believed that nothing could be visually better than Guilty Gear X, you were wrong. Of course, Guilty Gear XX adds nothing striking to the already rich graphic show proposed by its predecessor, but it enriches it with truly entrancing touches of class. Let's start with the settings: even more inspired and characteristic, this time they are characterized by the night hours (The Midnight Carnival, on the other hand) and by the presence of consequent scenographic effects. On the bridge of the Buddhist temple (background of Chipp, Anji and Baiken) a procession of translucent ghosts takes place, vanishing with a spectacular distortion effect to the far right, while a rain of cherry petals brushes past the duelists. And again, the plane of the pirates Johnny and May (whom Dizzy joined) whizzes through the clouds, while the starry sky is dimly lit by a pale moon. These are just two examples, but they give an idea. Too bad that there are very few internships that can be selected, given the care and detail with which they were made. Going from the stages to the sprites fighting, the overall situation does not change: pure wonder. The overall design and originality that characterizes these fighters are therefore excellent: more or less classic warriors (if we leave out the incendiary or electrifying swords), semi-demons, gigantic cyborgs and so on and so forth. In particular, the four new, charismatic wrestlers deserve an honorable mention: Slayer, a vampire from Transylvania; I-No, a demonic rocker; Bridget, a shifty yoyo-wielding kid; Zappa, a little man possessed by a powerful kudaku demon who uses him as a puppet. The animations are excellent (in particular, Bridget's stance-pose is applauded, superlative to say the least), fluid and well-finished; pity that from time to time we notice a total lack of frames during the relaxation animations following the performance of a particular attack, however intended to ~speed up~ the action. Finally, the overall visual rendering is enhanced by a frightening amount of lighting effects, explosions, transparencies and much more. In short, believe it or not, even more than before, playing Guilty Gear is like watching a Japanese cartoon created in a real asylum. To complete the excellent technical picture, the sound sector also takes care of it, excellent in every respect. Once again, Arc System offers us rock and heavy metal songs of excellent workmanship, well orchestrated, evocative and engaging, very suitable for the action and atmosphere of the fights. However, a certain drop in ~tension~ in the music should be noted, slightly more ~soft~ than the violent and explosive ones of the prequel, although they are still the remixes. Combine all this goodness with a dubbing with counter-flakes, and you will have a real programming jewel. Comment Guilty Gear XX is a show. Point. This statement would be enough to embrace the quantity of qualities that characterize it, but a serious and precise comment is needed, therefore we can speak of the incredible technical quality (in case it wasn't clear, there is no need for polygons to program a good game) or the fast-paced, addictive and extremely varied gameplay, or maybe we could talk about the many game modes or the multiple hidden extras to unlock (such as the EX and Gold versions of each character, equipped with different or additional special moves, or the three characters secrets Kliff, Justice and Robo-Ky)... the fact remains that the result would not change, because Guilty Gear XX would always and in any case remain a playful and visual spectacle. However, a couple of observations must be made. First, while improved, Guilty Gear XX is far too similar to its predecessor. But this pass. The problem is that Guilty Gear XX is not able to please everyone, by its very nature. It's a fighting game that makes confusion and chaos its strengthsza, and this feature is certainly not appreciated by more experienced and thoughtful players, who will certainly prefer products such as Capcom Vs. SNK 2. The recent production, however, offers games that are not entirely different in terms of rhythm, and which Guilty Gear XX grinds without a doubt... I'm obviously referring to Marvel Vs Capcom 2, and in that case the user could prefer the American superheroes or the classic Capcom heroes to the extravagant fighters of GGXX. As you will have therefore understood, GGXX is a title that bases its appreciation on personal tastes, not so much on the excellent quality of the production which, in any case, grants it at least the benefit of a pre-purchase test. At that point, it will be difficult to look at the competition with the same eyes as before... Pros: Excellent graphics (high resolution, learn Capcom!) Beautiful music Great variety of game modes Fast-paced and chaotic Cons: Maybe TOO fast-paced and chaotic Difficulty sometimes bordering on frustration Not too innovative When yet another two-dimensional fighting game for PSX appeared on Japanese shelves in 1997, no one would have ever expected it to become a true icon of the genre. Guilty Gear already stood out then for a series of characteristics that made it quite ~different~ from the bitter rivals offered at the rate of two a year (the Zero versions of Street Fighter and the various The King of Fighters above all): first of all, a cure incredible for the graphic aspect; then, a design of settings and above all characters that are nothing short of crazy, decidedly Japanese in the general style; again, a very high quality heavy metal soundtrack; finally, an atypical game system, simplistic at first glance but on the contrary very profound. However, the title was overshadowed by much better known products, both on consoles and in the coin-op version, and soon only a small circle of enthusiasts remembered the Sammy effort. Then, came Guilty Gear X. Initially distributed as a coin-op, Guilty Gear X took its place in the Dreamcast toy library, and shocked a market in the frantic search for ingenious gimmicks and tricks for rendering three-dimensional graphics: where even the classic Street Fighter became polygonal, Guilty Gear X went its own way, and presented for the first time a stunning and spectacular high-resolution visual rendering. It was this that made it so popular, and it was soon ported to the PlayStation2. But now we come to the present: Guilty Gear XX, first coin-op, now PlayStation2. Will Sammy have managed, once again, to amaze us without falling into the banality implicit in the sequelization of productions?", "date": "2003-01-29", "grade": null}
