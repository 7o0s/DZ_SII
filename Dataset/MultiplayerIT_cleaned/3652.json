It was perhaps the last real title capable of projecting Shinji Mikami higher than all, author of an epochal masterpiece. After so many editions and remasters, now it's the turn of Switch and its review, but let's start by telling you that Leon S. Kennedy's massive odyssey deserved a little more effort, a greater desire to strike the iron of the hybrid Tegra kyotense. More than anything else it is strange to note how modern Nintendo masterpieces run perfectly on this machine, while ports of games from 15 years ago have resolution and framerate problems. Let me be clear, Resident Evil 4 remains an experience so advanced for the period of publication that it is still essential today, net of some annoying woodworm in the controls. But let's go in order. Laziness? The port of Resident Evil 4 is based on the PS4 version in philosophy and workmanship: it shares the assets, the 60 frames per second target and the absence of pointing with the gyroscope, but not the resolution. We arrive at the first distinctive element, hand in hand with the most important feature of the Switch: the title runs at 900p in docked mode, with evident frame drops and the variable counter between 40 and 60 frames based on the scene and shot. Not much, considering the hardware in question and the now undoubted experience of porting Capcom's Resident Evil 4, a product that has touched practically every platform. The experience improves in portable mode: the resolution reaches 600p and the flow of frames is less uncertain, with a polygonal design that on a 6-inch screen manages at least to mask the absence of particular texture and model updates. If we combine the lines, a fairly immediate picture emerges: mobile gaming is the most suitable for this port but much more could - and should - have been done. Net of this, the title still remains enjoyable: Mikami's directorial genius comes to terms with a jump of three decades, yet after a few minutes you find yourself easily mastering Leon's movements thanks to a choice between three command schemes . Spanish lessons Strange how Mikami chose to start Resident Evil 4 from a Spanish village. Madness and horror are mixed from the beginning, but this time the journey starts more action than survival, and then becomes something else during its duration. Given a not exactly high age on your shoulders, it is likely that you will have played or at least tasted a bit of this title: thanks to the absence of pre-rendered backdrops and a full framerate, unfortunately Capcom has never managed to improve the offer pure visual, not even on other consoles or PC. This leads it to be the product among the three which, also thanks to an action vein from other times and animations still in the original work, has paradoxically aged worse than the other remasters available on Switch for a few days. However, this shouldn't dissuade the virgin readers of Resident Evil 4 from playing it and stripping it off: we're talking about a long, dense, beautifully orchestrated, varied and stylistically unique product, the son of a magical era where the Japanese guided the advancement of medium. Of course, some action and command mechanics today smell a lot of stale: exploiting QTA to take groups of enemies has an all too vintage taste, aiming without being able to move is alienating, not being able to move the view with the right analog makes an eyebrow raise . Everything else works perfectly and playing on the go with Mikami's latest great work has its everlasting charm, thanks to a large cast of characters, enemies and settings.", "date": "2019-05-26", "grade": "7.0"}
