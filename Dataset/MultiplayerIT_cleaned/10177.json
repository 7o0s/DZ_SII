{"name": "The Riftbreaker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-riftbreaker-recensione.html", "text": "You are Ashley Nowak, an explorer and scientist sent to study a still unknown planet, this Galatea 37. The peculiarity of the work, however, is the way of analyzing the soil and its properties, as well as the minerals and plants that cover it: you will be all 'inside a mech, Mr Riggs, with a highly sophisticated AI and even capable of cracking jokes and holding conversations. Your aim will be to be able to understand if colonization of the celestial body is possible by building bases, energy lines and space portals, juggling sandstorms, downpours and the sweet and cute local fauna. So caring that it will do anything to destroy more or less constantly everything you are trying to do, including yourself and your hunger for knowledge. In the approximately 15 hours that will keep you glued to the screen, you will find yourself facing a myriad of different situations, biomes of all types and needs of all kinds. The need for energy and raw materials will always be present and will lead you to explore Galatea 37 as much as possible, within the limits of your resources. We tell you right away that the satisfaction you feel in being able to enhance a certain structure or survive a large wave of alien monsters we have experienced in a few titles; above all this is the result of the difficulties in entering into the particular idea of the advancement and strengthening of the structures but also, no less, of the always cadenced rhythm of all the activities to be carried out in order to succeed in your mission. Let's find out all the qualities of EXOR Studios' game in The Riftbreaker review. Gameplay, one none and one hundred thousand A moment of relaxation, is always built in The Riftbreaker The feature that left us most blown away (in a positive sense) is the desire to include a large number of different genres. Initially, in fact, The Riftbreaker looks like a classic city builder, with strategic elements, to then become an isometric hack and slash (purists don't want it, not really isometric but leave us poetic license ed), a sort of twin stick shooter and finally a tower defense. Even at a certain point, once the various menus have been opened, you will find yourself in front of a very complicated role-playing game, full of things to do and absolutely, at least at first glance, confusing. Once you've established that you won't understand anything, you can start playing and, trust me, the bigger picture will slowly come out. What seemed like a jumble of genres makes The Riftbreaker a great little gem that manages to shine and entertain like few other titles. The main purpose will be to be able to obtain raw materials such as carbon, iridium and cobalt in order to give life to the structures with which to study the terrain and send reports to the Earth. Yes, you can collect them ~by hand~ by finding the various deposits and pressing the appropriate button, but the best way, above all so as not to take time away from other activities, is to build an extractor on them. Of course any piece of machinery without energy is bound to become a rusty home for moss and slugs, but how are you going to energize the structures? Simple, once the operational base has been built in a point you deem strategic, you will have to connect each single building with energy cores and cables to allow it to operate independently. The only ones that don't need energy to ~survive~ are the defensive ones, such as walls and doors, which can only be built using raw materials. The amount of selectable structures is really very large and travels more or less on the same line of thought as any other city builder, with warehouses, laboratories and armories that will be some of the main buildings also and above all to enhance both the headquarters and the mech. In fact, it is precisely in this area that you will waste most of your time, having to juggle skill trees and various equipment. The Riftbreaker - Spectacular fights and high-level technical sector Each arm of Mr. Riggs can be equipped with two weapons, ranging from a minigun to the evergreen flamethrower, from a ray gun to a shotgun. Each of them can in turn be upgraded and improved with equipment dropped by defeated enemies. Returning to the upgrades of the structures, in the appropriate menu you can carefully choose which ones to unlock or upgrade, trying to find the right combination to be able to advance in the plot and to be able to survive the various enemy waves. The enemies themselves are another fundamental factor for the dynamics of the EXOR Studios game. The local fauna of Galatea 37 is not exactly peaceful, on the contrary, every timeif you try to approach them they will react with combined group attacks, which you will sometimes not be able to deal with given the very high number of creatures. They range from very small creatures similar to lizards to gigantic aliens with organic / crustacean shapes that will put constant pressure on you during your wandering in search of materials and energy. Fortunately, you will be able to place teleporters with which you can keep the entire network of buildings created under control, thus being able to adequately defend your raw material extractors, perhaps with 2 or 3 rows of upgraded walls. Technical side The Riftbreaker - Equipment with available upgrades We can safely say without fear of denials, graphics and sound of The Riftbreakers are at very high levels. Particles, textures, color palettes, models, ambient sounds and the cries of alien monsters: all truly executed in a workmanlike manner, powerful and beautiful. The only flaw are the sporadic drops in frame rate and some rare freezes basically due to two main causes: the autosaves and the impressive amount of creatures and buildings on the screen. Towards the end of the game there will be literally hundreds of creatures attacking structures at the same time which will in turn explode putting a strain on the graphics engine. The animations of our mech are fluid, even in the most excited moments and with any weapon. The dubbing is well made even if in fact there is not so much to evaluate apart from the dialogues between Ashley and Mr. Riggs, however funny at times. The only flaw we can find in the lack of Italian adaptation, inexplicable in a title with many languages available. Last note we want to dedicate it to the procedural maps: both in the main and in the survival mode, these make the title highly replayable.", "date": "2021-10-31", "grade": "8.5"}
