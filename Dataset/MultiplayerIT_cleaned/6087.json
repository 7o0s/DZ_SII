It carries a heavy burden on its shoulders: it risks creating expectations and, therefore, disappointing them, therefore it cannot be used inappropriately. The word ~masterpiece~ is one of those words that should be used wisely, sipped sparingly. Here, Gunstar Heroes is a bloody masterpiece, without ifs and buts. Playing it today, twenty-two years after that first release of 1993, for the SEGA Mega Drive, it seems that not a single day has passed: the bosses still screw us over, even if we have since defeated hundreds of them in all the size; enemies still manage to hit us, even if we know each stage by heart; and each new approach, perhaps discovered by chance, still takes us by surprise, because level design was futuristic at the time and still very modern today. And if you weren't born yet in 1993, you've never downloaded the ROM for any emulator or you've never had a Mega Drive, the guys at M2 have made a truly unmissable conversion. Even after 22 years, Gunstar Heroes remains one of the best action games ever The colors of war Gunstar Heroes was the first title from Treasure, the software house that would later become even more famous with Alien Soldier, Guardian Heroes and Sin & Punishment, not to mention Ikaruga and Radiant Silvergun, among others. In short, everything starts from there: a horizontal scrolling action game (and not only!) that pushed the capabilities of the Mega Drive to the limit, showing off graphic solutions on the TV screen that no one was convinced that the SEGA-branded console was capable of, and which instead left even the most ardent detractors of Sonic's house speechless. Although the template recalls that of previous games such as Contra, to hold up the levels there are a character design and a story that are so reminiscent of those of a Japanese animated series, starring the twins Red and Blue, committed to defending the Earth from the threat of a evil despot who brainwashed their brother Green and kidnapped their sister Yellow: in an attempt to prevent the rebirth of an even worse evil, the two heroes will have to face guns blazing a series of colorful levels full of enemies and of gigantic bosses. Between the Japanese version and the western one, the story changed a little, and just to understand the quality of this conversion, it is enough to say that M2 has indicated the differences in the digital manual of the game: this 3D Classics is, in short, a port made truly with the heart , which hit us right from the main menu, allowing us to configure the experience in various ways. Beyond the possibility of displaying the game on the upper screen as if it were a curved and grainy cathode - terrible, but the more elderly will simply get sick - 3D Gunstar Heroes obviously proposes itself in its original nature: old fans will find every pixel in its place and, in all likelihood, they will curse over and over again, today as then, due to the difficulty of each stage and fight, albeit high but never frustrating. The 3D effect Simply outstanding, the stereoscopic effect can be selected to increase the depth of the scene or highlight moving sprites. Either way, it's a beautifully done retrofit, if perhaps a little too intense: turn it on, but adjust it well! The Last Gunslinger Gunstar Heroes has two inherent gameplay features that set it apart from the action games of the time. The first concerns the possibility of limited melee combat: Red and Blue can in fact hit their enemies with a slide - which also acts as an evasive stunt - or with a powerful multiple flying kick. Furthermore, just press the attack key near an enemy to throw him at other opponents: this technique, combined with the possibility of hanging from handholds and platforms, elevates the spectacularity and frenzy of the stages, especially in the most agitated moments, when is literally surrounded by dozens of enemies who shoot at us, attack us and chase us. The second paradigmatic feature of the Treasure title, on the other hand, concerns firearms: not only are the bursts of Red and Blue slightly different, thus offering more variety and choice, but our heroes can also collect power-ups that change the effect of their weapons. One, for example, turns the gun into a real flamethrower, while another allows you to fire homing shots. So far there would be nothing special, except that the player can collect up to two power-ups at the same time, combining their effectso that, for example, the aforementioned flamethrower emits jets of fire... homing. The many combinations allowed by the four types of power-ups guarantee strategic depth and great replayability, allowing you to tackle the stages differently in each game. The conversion for Nintendo 3DS also boasts two very interesting extra options. The Mega Life mode doubles the energy - the blows we can sustain before dying, in short - and therefore simplifies life a little for less experienced players: as we said, Gunstar Heroes is a really tough action game, and who doesn't have never played in the beginning may suffer a bit. The Gunslinger mode, on the other hand, is even more interesting, because it frees the player from looking for power-ups during the level, unlocking all four of them perpetually from the beginning. Just press the back buttons to change the effect of the weapon and create every possible combination, which on the one hand further simplifies each stage and, on the other hand, allows you to approach each challenge more serenely, experimenting with combinations that maybe we never had before. thought. The Gunslinger mode also allows you to change the type of shot by pressing the X button, in order to switch between the fixed and the moving one at any time, instead of limiting the choice at the beginning of the game.", "date": "2015-08-28", "grade": "9.0"}
