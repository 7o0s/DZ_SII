On the other hand, those games that the Japanese call ~simulation RPG~, with a rather bizarre choice of terms, are not exactly receiving the attention they were used to in the past and in the absence of a title with a big appeal there is a bit from struggling with what is around to get a dose of strategy in the classic Japanese style. We should perhaps dwell on the reasons for this decline with a specific in-depth study, but it is a fact that the big names of this genre seem to have stopped several years ago, with Ogre, Vandal Hearts, Valkyrie Profile, Front Mission and Shining Force now lost in the mists of time, Final Fantasy Tactics which has no longer received sequels after the Advance 2 of 10 years ago and Fire Emblem remained one of the few to carry on the old traditions, even if belonging to a slightly different declination (and in any case now relegated to portable consoles too). In all this, the baton has passed to different and more niche productions, carried out by Japanese labels such as Nippon Ichi (Disgaea and derivatives) or by numerous indie initiatives that have led to even remarkable results in recent years. Those looking for the old Japanese spirit must mostly look to the past, but can also enjoy some glory reflected in less original and very mannerist games, but for this very reason extremely faithful to the line, such as this Mercenaries Saga. A bag of strategy Strategy RPGs could work great on Switch, as the success of Disgaea 5 Complete also demonstrated, despite the delay with which it returned to the scene on the Nintendo platform. The problem is that, in fact, there are no other choices at the moment other than the aforementioned title by Nippon Ichi and Circle Entertainment was smart to fill this void with Mercenaries Saga Chronicles, offering three strategic games collected together in one fell swoop. The first chapter, Mercenaries Saga: Will Of The White Lions, was born as a title for mobile platforms, with the series that was later also moved to Nintendo 3DS in the following two chapters, namely Mercenaries Saga 2: Order Of The Silver Eagle and Mercenaries Saga 3: Gray Wolves Of War. Adherence to the canons of the classic strategy is commendable, but the rather small size of the productions clearly emerges on the technical front, which does not find particular evolutions even in this re-edition for Switch, limiting itself to repackaging the three games by adapting the display to the screen in 16: 9 and increasing the resolution to make it more visible on the Nintendo console. But beyond these basic initiatives, all three games remain essentially the same as previously seen. Being titles developed first for mobile platforms and then for Nintendo 3DS, one obviously cannot expect an aesthetic rendering in step with the standards of a current home console, which is further accentuated by a characterization that does not really aim to bring out the series for elements stylistic, limiting itself to remaining perfectly adherent to the classic canon of the genre without wanting to surprise in any way. Among the adjustments for this Switch version we also find other fringe additions such as the Free Battle mode and different settings for the difficulty. All chapters are excellently translated into English but there is no Italian language option. True to the line If the aesthetic element is easily negligible, having never been a pivot of the strategic of this type, the general flatness of the narration and of the story is heavier, which is based on rather standard plots for Japanese fantasy and in general fails to staging memorable characters or particularly poignant moments. It is true that these too are secondary features in a game of this type, but an effective glue like a good story to line up the numerous fights to be faced over the three chapters collected would certainly have been a plus. During the three chapters in the collection, however, there is the strange sensation of being faced with the same game every time, repeated in different variants but substantially similar due to the sharing of the entire graphic and structural sector. The differences are obviously found in the stories, but remaining on a rather superficial level they fail to characterizethoroughly every single chapter and then we find ourselves treating this collection as a sort of long series of strategic battles to be completed, almost without a break between one and another and between one chapter and another. This is in fact also the merit of Mercenaries Saga Chronicles, which proves to be a sort of huge cornucopia of challenges to be faced according to the most classic rules of Japanese strategic combat, which fans of the genre will surely appreciate. And it is in fact precisely in the clash on the battlefield that this title finds its full realization: freed from the field of ~frills~ - although some of these, as we have seen, are of no less than secondary importance - the games of Circle Entertainment they just administer a good dose of tactics and strategy, and that's no small feat. The feeling of constant repetition is also accentuated by the need to often resort to grinding to overcome the frequent peaks of difficulty found in the stories, which leads us to carry out the secondary battles several times which take place on already known settings and with developments already notice. Isometry take me away If what you want is above all to dedicate yourself to applied strategy, then Mercenaries Saga Chronicles is bread for your teeth, putting together a total of over 80 chapters with as many battles to be completed within its three episodes and thus representing one of the solutions of greater thickness for fans of the genre, from the point of view of content. It's the combat system that keeps the whole experience going and that's no small thing, given that a good 90% of the time is actually spent on the battlefield. The strategic mechanics is the classic one, particularly pertaining to the canon of Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, with the usual isometric grid to mark the possibilities of movement and the different attack and defense skills that depend on the classes of the characters deployed on the field. Also in this case some particularly appreciated features return such as the possibility of choosing the orientation of the fighters at the end of the movement in the turn (the possibility of suffering damage varies according to the side on which one is hit), as well as the possibility of choosing between standard attack or special technique, defensive stance or use of items. Some features also manage to get out of the more classic schemes a bit: the fact that magical energy rises as the rounds go by requires a careful use of special techniques of this type, which can come into action especially once the battle has started, while a further strategic planning layer is given by the possibility of collecting rich treasures scattered within the various maps, the achievement of which is to be calculated precisely in order to better manage the shifts and not leave the companions uncovered. The Hatred indicator is another particular mechanic of Mercenaries Saga that has been extended here to all three chapters to further amplify the complexity of the battles, but it is a rather hidden statistic (it keeps track of the actions performed by the various characters, consequently attracting attacks on each individual fighter) which does not emerge that much clearly in the development of the fights. Even the management of the characters fits perfectly in the classic style of the genre, with the growth of skills as the experience level progresses and the possibility of unlocking new classes upon reaching certain more advanced levels.", "date": "2018-02-18", "grade": "7.2"}
