{"name": "Caccia grossa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/147824-thehunter-primal-caccia-grossa.html", "text": "With the imminent release of Jurassic World in theaters all over the world and the increasingly less stringent ~hold~ of zombies on the public, after having literally saturated the market, for years, with mostly shoddy and commercial products, it is easy to imagine that dinosaurs they will return to take the place snatched from the undead, or that of nemesis par excellence in the videogame field together with monsters and aliens. During this long period of quiescence, only the independent panorama has tried to keep up the honor of the lizards, through productions which, however, in the vast majority of cases have not lived up to the expectations of the fans. Those who bet a little more were the Swedish Avalanche Studios, a software house known for the famous Just Cause series which, thanks to its Expansive Worlds offshoot focused on online games, decided to export part of the (winning) recipe of theHunter in an imaginative prehistoric universe. Thus was born theHunter: Primal, a hunting game with survival elements that landed on Steam through the usual Early Access and has just been released in its complete form, after three intense months of testing and a series of in-depth updates. We have followed it consistently since its debut accumulating over one hundred hours of gameplay, and these are our definitive impressions. Expansive Worlds rewrites theHunter's recipe and goes hunting for dinosaurs He left us alone Primal Eden is a very distant planet, difficult to access but completely similar to the Earth, with the only difference that here, the hands of time seem to have stopped between 65 and 145 million years ago, or in the middle of the Cretaceous, third period of the Mesozoic era dominated by colossal reptiles. Man, as in the most classic of science fiction films, has unconsciously exhausted the resources of the terrestrial globe, and must necessarily colonize new worlds to continue to survive. Primal Eden is a viable target, but it is tremendously hostile, and someone has the daunting task of creating a beachhead to start the invasion. The pioneers involved aren't exactly brave volunteers, but subjects with a few too many skeletons in the closet, launched in reconnaissance on the planet (with a probe) in order to atone for their sins and make themselves useful to humanity. This, broadly speaking, is the incipit of the plot that supports theHunter: Primal, although it is a simple narrative pretext to project the player into this ruthless world, where the only signs of a fleeting story can be traced on abandoned datapads, while strong emotions are delegated to survival, exploration and the noise of weapons. The twenty-four square kilometers that make up the map offer a credible glimpse of what the Earth could have been like in the Cretaceous period, an environment in which it is possible to enter alone or, even better, in company, to hunt dinosaurs and even other groups. of pioneers, if the PvP mode was set, a detail that substantially changes the cards on the table and the approach to the game. In theHunter: Primal there are no specific objectives, the only aim is therefore to survive, trying to reveal all the points of interest on the map and at the same time take down the tough beasts, which provide trophies and experience points, useful for raising the level up your character. The main tool for orienting yourself in the game world is the Settlermate, a portable detector that indicates animal tracks on the map - exactly like in theHunter - supporting them with various information, as well as abandoned settlements, very precious crates and any backpacks of deceased pioneers . The recovery of weapons, ammunition and various furnishings must be done directly in the field, since when you first start and when you die, if you don't have enough money and experience to make purchases in the virtual shop, you can only rely on a makeshift machete. This weapon, especially useful against the small Velociraptors (in Jurassic Park they had this name but the tonnage was that of the bigger Deinonychus), was introduced only with one of the latest updates, given that in previous builds the first offensive tool it was a recurve bow with ten arrows, not very versatile for defending and attacking animals. At the very first start and after being killed, the map is completely darkened, and it unfolds little by little by exploring it or collecting the precious chips to be inserted in the Settlermate; they indicate the so-called points of interest, special areas where the best equipment and structures for protection are generally found. Among the objects that can be collected, beyond quNatural ellis such as stones, useful for creating diversions, mushrooms for healing (beware of poisonous ones!) and dinosaur eggs, which restore energy but attract unwanted guests, in the boxes scattered throughout the environment we can find medical sprays of various effectiveness, binoculars, clothing that improve camouflage, calls for animals but above all weapons, ammunition and sights. The arsenal is not vast and does not include automatic weapons: there is only one pistol, inspired by the 44 Magnum, and single-shot rifles of various power, which integrate well with the spirit of a game fundamentally linked to hunting. The .308 is a rather versatile sniper rifle, especially when equipped with a scope, while the 12GA shotgun with double type of buckshot is lethal especially over short distances; the .700 is the most powerful weapon in the game, a shotgun very difficult to find as well as its bullets, and even rarer is the 50 caliber sniper, introduced with one of the most recent updates. Unfortunately you can't carry everything you find and want in your backpack, since the inventory has a predefined number of slots and you can't exceed a certain weight, however, once you have equipped a gun (with sufficient ammunition) it is possible to change one's perspective, from prey to predator. Clever girl One of the main defects of theHunter: Primal is the number of animal species with which it is currently possible to interact, i.e. only five, of which one is practically a ~duplicate~ in a reduced version and another, introduced with the launch update , has significantly undermined the balance of the title - unleashing the wrath of the players on the Steam forum - until the release of a sudden correction. Let's proceed in order. Utahraptors are basically the Velociraptors of Jurassic Park: medium-sized bipedal predators, these fearsome dromeosaurids usually hunt in packs, calling their own kind with specific cries and encircling the player with rapid maneuvers. They are the most common dinosaurs in theHunter: Primal and pose a serious threat when unarmed, while they can be easily dealt with with a shotgun. Although their artificial intelligence has significantly improved compared to the first builds, they still have some problems with the elements of the scenario, especially when the player climbs on large rocks and logs to defend themselves. The recently introduced Velociraptors are nothing more than a miniature version of the Utahraptors: they hunt in larger packs and despite having peculiar attacks, such as jumping using the claw of the second toe (a technique questioned by paleontologists ), are not much of a danger, and can be easily eliminated with any available weapon, including bow and arrows (sometimes effective even with Utahraptors) and machetes. Triceratops are the only herbivores in theHunter: Primal, and their behavior has been overhauled several times by the developers. In the latest build they are generally fearful animals, which run away as soon as they sense our presence, however, by getting too close or injuring them, they can become furious and charge with their fearsome horns. The Tyrannosaurus needs no introduction, it is the theropod dinosaur par excellence and a real nemesis within the game: extremely difficult to kill even when in a group, this large and menacing reptile (the sound of its footsteps is frightening) is been updated several times, especially from the point of view of geographical distribution. Being able to kill with a single, powerful bite, it must be approached with extreme caution, and it is preferable to attack it with nearby hollow trees where you can protect yourself, while if you simply want to evade it, crawling in tall grass is the only viable option. Its artificial intelligence, unfortunately, despite having improved, still has several critical issues; for example, it can remain motionless above us for whole minutes while we are lying down, or it can get stuck in some element of the scenario. The species that has generated the most problems, fortunately rectified, is the Quetzalcoatlus, a pterosaur (flying reptile) introduced with the launch update which, due to its attack method and sometimes inaccurate hitbox - a defect that also involves other species - has literally affected the balance of the game. This animal flies in circles, and when it spots the player it does nothing but try to swoop down to snatch it, lift it into the sky with its mighty paws, and finally make it fall to the ground from impressive heights. Before the solving patch there were too many, and since they were pressing and difficult to break down, they brought the lilevel of challenge (already high) beyond frustration, also because sometimes they made the backpack with the equipment unrecoverable. With the latest patch they have been ~confined~ to the area around the volcano, and moreover they no longer interpenetrate with the trees and the ground as they used to do, making their presence much more satisfying and balanced. Despite the ~stupidity~ of dinosaurs and the various bugs concerning them, which hopefully will continue to be filed, hunting in theHunter: Primal always requires a patient and reasoned approach, and is able to give great satisfaction and hours of fun, above all when playing together. Prehistoric paradise The solidity of the netcode, which caused several crashes in the old builds, has been significantly improved with the latest updates, and if up until a month ago there were even problems creating visible sessions, due to the router ports to be opened (a practice not always working) and fluctuating pings, now the matches are decidedly more stable and lag-free, even when playing in sixteen divided by teams. Unfortunately, dedicated servers are missing, but there are many private ones where you can access. The game map, as specified, is huge, but above all it is wonderful to see and experience, thanks to the rendering of the vegetation and the splendid light effects that enhance the most suggestive views, perhaps at sunset with the ocean silhouetted in the background . To further enhance the visual impact and realism of the prehistoric setting, dominated by ferns and large conifers, there are also the dynamic weather and the day-night cycle, which enhance the drama of the exploratory phases. Apart from insects and some small and rare animals, unfortunately the map is practically ~desert~, and the absence of a more varied and coherent fauna is felt, even in purely ecological terms. In fact, the few dinosaurs present do not interact with each other, and there are also many ~iconic~ species missing that enthusiasts would have liked to see in such a production. Stegosaurs, brachiosaurs, hadrosaurs and apatosaurs, just to name a few, are all species which, in one way or another, although not all from the Cretaceous, would have made the scenario much more fascinating, as well as increasing the number of prey available. It is hoped that new animals will be introduced in the future and for free, but given the experience with theHunter it is difficult to be optimistic, even though microtransactions are not currently contemplated. The polygonal models of the dinosaurs are splendid, refined over time with new textures and colors and shaped according to the most recent paleontological theories: even the animations are generally valid, however there are also polygonal interpenetrations, improbable behavior in the presence of rocks and slopes and some deburring in the finishes. On the other hand, the sound effects are excellent, both for the stamp of the weapons and for the sounds of the animals, well diversified between the various species and contextual to the situation, with calls that indicate an imminent attack or search. The soundtrack, beyond the song that accompanies the main menu of the game, is practically non-existent, and the whole atmosphere is supported by effective ambient sounds such as the chirping of crickets, the wind and other natural phenomena.", "date": "2015-04-06", "grade": "6.8"}
