{"name": "Jam Sessions - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jam-sessions-recensione.html", "text": "In the video game market it is now difficult for something completely original to be introduced, because everything has already been said and done. Wii is a striking example of the hunger for novelty that grips both savvy and casual players: millions of pieces have been sold only thanks to an unconventional input system; denying, moreover, the historical maxim that wants the software to sell a console. And for the Nintendo DS it is similar, as the combination of touch screen, additional screen and microphone often results in the production of fresh and engaging games. The guitar in the pocket What does Jam Sessions have to do with all this talk? Well, the new Ubisoft title belongs precisely to a type of innovative software, ready to debut on Nintendo DS thanks to the characteristics of this portable console. Let me be clear, the idea of a guitar simulator is by no means new in the PC environment, where there are hundreds of programs of this kind and a bit for all instruments, but the type of implementation (with the stylus acting as a plectrum on the ~string~ displayed on the touch screen) is very interesting and opens up new possibilities to the musical partygame genre, where you usually rely on the rhythm and listen to the music instead of creating it. If we have defined Jam Sessions an innovative software and not an innovative game, the reason is obvious: it is not a game, and it becomes clear from the first minutes. Indeed, right from the starting screen, which allows us to access an obvious tutorial, adjust the settings or play the songs included in the package. The repertoire of Jam Sessions Let's immediately rattle off the numbers of this production, in this case seventeen songs of international scope, divided between classic and modern: ~Jack-Ass~ (Beck), ~Like a rolling stone~ (Bob Dylan), ~No woman no cry~ (Bob Marley), ~Yellow~ (Coldplay), ~I will follow you into the dark~ (Death Cab for Cutie), ~Over my head~ (The Fray), ~The man who sold the world~ (Nirvana), ~I 'm with you~ (Avril Lavigne), ~Life is a highway~ (Rascal Flatts), ~No rain~ (Blind Melon), ~How sweet it is (to be loved by you)~ (James Taylor), ~I forgot more than you'll ever know~ (Johnny Cash), ~Me and Bobby McGee~ (Janis Joplin), ~Never can say goodbye~ (Jackson 5), ~Surrender~ (Cheap Trick), ~What's going on~ ( Marvin Gaye) and ~You know I'm no good~ (Amy Winehouse). Once one of these songs has been selected, we will find ourselves in front of an essential score, only with lyrics and chords, and the software will take care of highlighting the latter when we play them with the stylus, proceeding until the end of the song. Let's say that, in a certain sense, the player is left to himself: there is no MIDI of the songs to follow, only possibly a metronome that can help us keep the rhythm between one chord and another. From this point of view, to obtain results it is essential to know the songs you decide to play, otherwise the system recognizes the progression of the chords, but what will come out of the speakers of the DS (or of the stereo to which we can connect it) will not even remember the original song in the slightest. It will be the player who judges his own performance, there is no goal to pursue other than ~learning to play~ with a portable console. Ok, but how does it work? The idea behind Jam Sessions is simple: you use the stylus like a plectrum on the touch screen, where a ~string~ appears that vibrates with each strum. The system recognizes the downward and upward picking (it is possible to change the direction set by default depending on how it is more comfortable), as well as the stopped chord, which ~plays~ when we do not press any of the directions of the fret. -pad. It is precisely the latter that determines what we play: a chord is assigned to each of the eight directions, so for example we just need to press down and give a strum with the stylus to play a G (G, in the international nomenclature, reproduced here). The position of the chords is not fixed but changes according to the song we want to play, to make things easier (usually there aren't eight different chords in a song...), but in free mode you can freely decide which chords assign to which directions of the d-pad, adding the possibility of having eight more by holding down the left back button. The reproduced sound is very faithful to that of a real guitar, moreover the developers have introduced the concept of ~velocity~ to make a stronger or weaker pick sound differently. Clearly it is the sound sector that takes the lion's share in Jam Sessions, thanks to a good sound emulation. Everything else is reduced to the essentials, starting with the graphics, which can be customized to the fullestare through the themes present. Go with the distortion! Jam Sessions manages to reproduce the sound of a guitar in a really good way, but it doesn't stop there and allows you to set a certain number of effects, which can be activated while playing. These are distortion, delay, chorus, flanger, tremolo, and high-pass and low-pass filters. Each effect can be activated in pairs with another, to obtain a different result, and has an analog adjustment control that is very similar to real effects pedals. There are six slots available for saving your own presets. The results are discrete (it is clear that obtaining a probable distortion goes beyond the sonic capabilities of the DS), but more than anything else it is an addition with big limitations since it can only be played for chords and not for single notes. Comment Jam Sessions isn't a video game, it's a guitar simulator. There are no objectives to be achieved other than achieving good coordination between picking and d-pad, and to be honest, inserting songs is something purely accessory, given that the substance of this product lies in the free mode. Guitarists will find the possibility of playing only by chords extremely limiting, the Nintendo DS d-pad has never shone for its precision in the diagonals and the possibility of recording one's own session certainly does not include the capture of the voice, resulting then too much brief. It is clear, therefore, that the Ubisoft title is aimed at an audience of curious and music uninitiated people, for whom it will certainly be fun to be able to play a guitar without ever having shouldered it. Hoping that then, driven by curiosity, they really buy an instrument and a good manual to learn how to play it... Pros Good sound emulation An innovative idea, to be developed A guitar in your pocket, literally Cons There is no test to pass Very good recorder limited Not suitable for those who already play", "date": "2007-10-26", "grade": null}
