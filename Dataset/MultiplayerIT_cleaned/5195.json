{"name": "Il mio amico Titan", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/175865-titanfall-2-il-mio-amico-titan.html", "text": "Third wheel in a confrontation that has seen the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises opposed for years, after the multiplayer-only debut, the intellectual property of the former Infinity Ward takes an important step, introducing a single player campaign that aims to make it more complete the thrilling mech-based shooter experience. Of course, the timing is not the best and Electronic Arts could have thought of a different launch window for Titanfall 2, it is no coincidence that the first sales figures in the United Kingdom are disheartening; and unfair, in our opinion, considering the quality of the package, which after the convincing test on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One we find ourselves reviewing in the PC version. The technically more relevant one, even capable of aiming for 4K and 60 frames per second where you have very high-end components, but in any case a harbinger of respectable performance even on less expensive configurations. Titanfall 2 is a great value shooter, with an amazing campaign and solid multiplayer The strange couple The protagonist of the Titanfall 2 story mode is the rifleman Jack Cooper, who in the early stages of the adventure we find engaged in training with a simulation to one day become a Pilot, a member of the elite militia, warriors capable of fighting in any situation thanks to state-of-the-art equipment and the ability to interface with Titans, six-metre-tall robots with devastating war potential. That day will come soon, Captain Lastimosa, his mentor, promises him. However, the situation quickly falls apart, Lastimosa dies in battle and orders his Titan, BT-7274, to welcome Cooper as the new Pilot. Cleverly gradual in its mechanics, the campaign developed by Respawn Entertainment is a bit short, given that it is completed within five hours, but manages to be intense, spectacular and unexpectedly original in some of its solutions. Forget the sequences in which we are accompanied by the hand by a superior, moving from one firefight to another, which sadly characterize many of the latest episodes of Call of Duty and Battlefield: in Titanfall 2 we will be alone with our mech, busy exploring hostile environments looking for devices and switches, as well as determined to save their skins and face the threat posed by a superweapon that, in enemy hands, could change the tide of war forever. In the narrative sector there are many references to the movie ~Navigator~ (but also ~Guardians of the Galaxy~, ~Star Wars: The Force Awakens~ and ~Big Hero 6~) for what is the relationship between Jack and BT-7274, which develops gradually and sees the birth of a surprising friendship between man and artificial intelligence. The story is very well told, also thanks to a high quality Italian dubbing and cinematic music, but it is the gameplay that amazes: the ability of the Pilots to run on walls is used at a certain point for solving environmental puzzles, as well as the use of a particular device that brings to mind situations seen in Super Mario Galaxy and Portal. In short, you never get bored, the ~bad guys~ are convincing and the only negative note of the single player sector, in addition to the aforementioned brevity, lies in the bosses: the ~special~ Titans have a nice design and peculiar skills, but often the clash is resolved in a short time and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Clash of the Titans The strength of the offer of Titanfall 2, beyond the successful single player campaign, remains the competitive multiplayer. The feeling of the experience has remained intact compared to the first episode: the games are fast and frenetic, you have to move continuously and we have tried to limit the areas in which to lurk and ~camp~, although some maps maintain that type of vocation by way the presence of high central structures on which to climb. However, there are some substantial differences: in addition to the new objects that are part of the Pilots' equipment (see the grappling hook, the teleportation kit and the renewed camouflage system), six different Titans with specific characteristics have been introduced in this second chapter , with main and secondary weapons predetermined and non-editable as in the original episode. We have the Ion, the balanced model, armed with a machine gun and a high-powered laser shot; the heavy and tough Scorch, which uses a thermite cannon and can generate a wall of fire; the fast but relatively flimsy Northstar, equipped with a Plasma Railgun and swarm of missiles; the Ronin, armed with rifle and sword, ideal in close combat; the Tone, who uses a powerful single-shot rifle and missilei to search; and finally the Legion, which roams the maps with a heavy Gatling gun but can also deliver a single devastating blow. Each Titan can be customized in perks and access new abilities as you level up, in terms of a very rich, multifaceted and well-implemented progression: elements that the former Infinity Wards have once again shown to know well. Post-launch support will see the release of several free packs with new weapons, but the extra Titans could be paid, unless a less brilliant launch than expected convinces Electronic Arts to rethink the matter: we'll see. Who doesn't play together... Unlike the review of the console version, we were able to try Titanfall 2 multiplayer on PC with open servers and therefore experience the quality of matchmaking, any latency issues and so on. The organization of the rooms by community can actually lead to some slowdown in the game setting operations, but it is possible to play in a matter of seconds and online users do not seem to be missing at all, net of some modes that are less popular than others. Of course, the speed of the connection also plays a fundamental role in this case in terms of the chances of success: seeing American players aboard the Titan who manage to hit our Pilot on the fly with a single shot is demoralizing, and the fact that die a little faster than in the first episode only emphasizes the distance that separates our connections from those of the rest of the world. However the situation is far from desperate: with a little practice and buttocks you can distinguish yourself even in the most complex and multifaceted matches, for example those in which you have to eliminate your opponents and deposit the collected bounties each round to make grow your team's nest egg. Nine maps are available, capable of offering a certain degree of variety and of alternating areas designed for firefights from a distance with others in which the promptness of reflexes in close confrontation makes the difference. Eight methods, ranging from the aforementioned ~Bounty Hunt~ to the territorial ~PCA~, in which control points must be conquered and maintained; from the well-known ~Titan Survival~, in which you immediately fight aboard mechs with the aim of destroying all those of the opposing team, to the classic ~All against all~; from the traditional team deathmatch mode, 'Attrition', to the frantic 'Capture the Flag'; finally passing through the clash ~Pilots against Pilots~ and the one-on-one combat ~Colosseum~, as you can imagine quite limited in its prerogatives. It is also possible to access two different playlists, ~Variety~ and ~Variety 8v8~, as well as organize private matches by selecting the map, modalities and rules of our taste. In the end there is nothing transcendental or extraordinarily innovative in the multiplayer offer of Titanfall 2, but the system works damn well and the characterization of the Titans, together with the customization of the Pilots and the progressive system of unlocking skills and equipment, combine to create a varied environment, which on the one hand welcomes with enthusiasm the users who had tried the first chapter, on the other it does not pose barriers for those who try this experience for the first time. The PC version Among the strengths of the Titanfall series there is undoubtedly the constraint of 60 frames per second, which the developers have managed to implement in an extremely stable way on consoles using the expedient of dynamic resolution. On PC there was no need to resort to the same solution, given the excellent performance of the new Source, especially if combined with adequate hardware: on the test configuration, playing at 1080p with all effects at their maximum, we were unable to move the 60-frame game without even trying, proving the solidity of the Valve graphics engine even in conjunction with the changes made by Respawn Entertainment. Although the faces of the characters are not in fact unforgettable, indeed they betray a somewhat dated connotation, the interweaving of the technologies used goes perfectly with the design of the Titans and the various settings that can be explored during the single player and of competitive multiplayer. The rendering of the lights has improved substantially, capable of giving more personality to the locations, and in the same way the textures show excellent definition without weighing on the fluidity as happened in the original Titanfall at the debut. Let it be meritual of the GTX 1070 or not, the fact remains that the many adjustments available make the experience scalable even on lower hardware: in addition to the resolution, it is possible to act on the field of vision with a comfortable slider, activate or deactivate vertical synchrony (we have triple buffered to eliminate even the slightest chance of tearing from the start), set the texture quality up to the ~ultra~ value, and the anisotropic filtering up to 16x, then adjust the shadow detail quality under three different categories, the occlusion, the details of polygonal models, effects, impact marks and ragdolls. Solutions very similar to those of the first Titanfall, in short, and equally appreciable. The Xbox 360 controller is perfectly supported, although in some cases we note a small bug affecting the movement of the right analog stick (which occurred with two different devices, one of which is brand new), which tends to turn slightly to the left: we hope be fixed as soon as possible with an update. Obviously on PC the use of the mouse is crucial for the speed of aiming, and in multiplayer games this is very noticeable, especially in conjunction with a fast connection.", "date": "2016-11-01", "grade": "9.0"}
