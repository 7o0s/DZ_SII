First of all, the means available, coming from non-existent car manufacturers, are reduced to the kind of vehicles that allow a man to stand up and unload lead at three hundred and sixty degrees. So we find vans, large family cars and large-engined convertibles but, obviously there is a but, family cars and heavy vehicles are immediately too heavy and not very fun to drive. On board a sports car, on the other hand, the title proceeds at a satisfactory speed and we are given the possibility of skidding easily by shooting at enemy vehicles, even if the absence of at least credible physics takes away part of the fun from the action. As we said, the vast majority of the 45 missions involve the destruction of the opposing machines using weapons and bullets collected during a race, and we find them in such quantities that we don't have to pay too much attention to the lead reserve in our possession. During the races, which take place in small tracks created inside anonymous towns or just outside them, it therefore becomes essential to appropriate weapons such as the rocket launcher with which to quickly knock down the most difficult enemies and it is advisable to pay close attention to the health boxes. that is, bonuses capable of regenerating the health of the gunner and the vehicle. Among the 20 weapons available, the biggest differences are between automatic weapons, heavy single-shot weapons and explosives, and the weapon-to-weapon effects of the same group are so small that it is sufficient to pay attention to the genre to which they belong to carry out the case choice. Another fundamental element for reaching and knocking down annoying opponents is represented by the everlasting turbo, which in 187 Ride or Die is made available by performing spectacular skids. Using the turbo it is possible not only to reach the vehicles in front of us but also to push them against explosive bins or to avoid particularly powerful or concentrated attacks against our racing car. In particular The missions are largely related to the destruction of the opponents but make use of a fair number of variants and alternate with some stages where escape is more important than combat. As pursuers we often find the police, determined to put a stop to our rampant criminal career, while in certain cases we find ourselves with the burden of carrying the so-called hot potato with too many eyes pointed in our direction. During these missions the track is not closed as in the case of races between gangs, but the real shortcuts are few and the portions of the map are too small and not very varied to take advantage of the newfound ~freedom~ of movement. Races between gangs, on the other hand, have special rules such as the elimination, at each lap, of the last competitor who crosses the finish line. More fun, even if for a while, is the mode that transforms all weapons into mines and where the turbo acquires particular importance, allowing us to splash past the opponents and drop explosives in quantities at extreme speeds. During deathmatches, however, a minor but significant difference occurs. There are only two weapons available, namely a sort of extremely powerful shotgun and a heavy machine gun. During this mode, the opposing vehicles have only two sensitive points on which to fire, namely the vehicle itself and the gunner who stands out above the canopies and seats holding cannons of all sorts and, of course, heavy weapons they are more suitable if the objective is the half-opponent. The missions make use of a fair number of variants and alternate with some stages where escape is more important than combat In particular The game system is quite simple, with one stick we control the movement of the vehicle while with the other we direct the firepower at 360 degrees; to further facilitate things it is possible to choose a different control setting but which provides for auto-aim and leaves us the simple task of choosing the direction in which to shoot. Artificial intelligence unfortunately contributes, together with other elements already mentioned, to flatten the title. In any case, the opposing vehicles manage to remain glued to our car whatever evasive maneuver is performed by the player and limit themselves to hindering us and shooting at us without paying particular attention to the peculiarities, however small, of the track. In addition to multiplayer, both local and via Xbox Live, 187 Ride or Die allows you to play cooperatively in the manner of the first games it was inspired by, that is, while a playerone driver drives the vehicle, the other deals exclusively with the armament. Only in this case, thanks to the human component, the linearity of the tracks and the banality of the fight fade into the background at least for a few hours of play. Lots of smoke... At first glance, 187 Ride or Die appears a detailed title full of graphic effects, and indeed blur, explosions and light effects populate almost every moment of the game, but under the colorful and chaotic patina the gunners and various elements on the screen appear plasticized. Looking even more closely, some barely sketched civilian vehicles, hexagonal wheels and above all the lack of inspiration in the design of both city and suburban tracks begin to catch the eye, devoid of both details and level textures. In any case, between vehicles, explosions, blurring during turbo mode and slow motion after a vehicle is destroyed, the engine manages a good number of elements without difficulty and it is difficult to condemn it completely. The audio, beyond the excessively caricatured dialogues, does not present too obvious flaws in the use of sound samples and brings into play an original soundtrack by the rap/reggae group Guerrilla Black, which does not present itself at the best of its compositional possibilities at this juncture. In any case, between vehicles, explosions, blurring during turbo mode and slow motion after a vehicle is destroyed, the engine manages a good number of elements without difficulty Comment Like many games of this genre, 187 Ride or Die doesn't offer anything new, but it also fails to make its own space due to too many overlooked elements. The cooperative mode and the game variants fail to make up for the shortcomings of a too meager gameplay that takes place in short and repetitive circuits. Ultimately, it is a title recommended only if multiplayer and shooters are your passion and if you are willing to put your wallet in hand even for a few hours of fun. Pros: offers a good variety of game modes allows you to play cooperatively Cons: track design below the sufficiency many elements of the game neglected or poorly finished trivial and not at all innovative gameplay Throughout the video game's history, the vehicular shooter has been part of the lineup of every car, and it has done so with incredible consistency for a genre that has rarely hit the box office. Starting from the first arcade simulations of tanks we arrived in San Francisco Rush, Chase HQ, we passed from the arcade and returned to the home living rooms with Twisted Metal, Cel Damage and other more or less known recent titles. But, despite the fact that it is a thriving trend, since those early days no one has managed to expand or innovate the gameplay of the shooter on wheels. Ubisoft decides to try the feat and enters the track with 187 Ride or Die. The story comes to life in the variegated world of ~gangsta~ gangs who fight the eternal struggle for domination of the ghetto, we find ourselves in the role of the young Buck engaged in satisfying one Dupree, the neighborhood rooster who entrusts us with the onerous task of wiping out the opposing gang. Unfortunately, the negative notes are felt immediately. The lyrics are a veritable jumble of randomly placed slang terms that sound more like a joke than the language of a real tough guy and the vocal interpretation doesn't improve the situation. The plot, despite the fact that after each mission we are given a decently made movie, does not take off, does not offer any particular ideas or interesting twists and turns and is content to fill in the spaces between one mission and another.", "date": "2005-09-13", "grade": null}
