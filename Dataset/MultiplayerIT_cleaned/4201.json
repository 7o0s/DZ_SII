{"name": "Crash Heads", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-heads-recensione.html", "text": "There is no doubt that the first step towards making a successful video game is the awareness of what has been done before, what are the best experiences belonging to the genre we want to try and, in general, the solutions found by others developers to solve certain problems. Well, the Playgendary guys have perhaps gone a little further, borrowing (let's say so) the structure and some elements of the Clash Royale interface, with its upgradeable cards and its four slots for the opening of prize chests, mixing them with a shooter system very similar to what we have seen recently in Gun & Dungeons, with its peculiar ~stop and shoot~ approach. The end result is an inevitably derivative title in some of its aspects, which perhaps starts a little slowly but then manages to express itself well and glue us to the smartphone screen. Why? We explain it to you in the Crash Heads review. Gameplay: stop or mom shoot Crash Heads, our team grappling with some enemies Set in a fantasy world, Crash Heads puts us at the helm of a group of characters who have to make their way through arenas placed in increasingly complex sequences, eliminating all the enemies present from time to time and proceeding towards the 'exit. All the units at our disposal are ranged, i.e. they strike from a distance, but they are divided into about twenty different classes, to be gradually unlocked for the composition of a sort of deck made up of six fighters. There are therefore the archers, the warriors armed with spears, knights with their war hammers, amazons with knives, bomb-throwing bombers and so on: each class boasts different characteristics in terms of damage per second, rate of fire, range of fire and so on. At the beginning of each expedition we will have to choose a group of units and use them to pass the first phase, after which at each completed stage we will be able to add another team and therefore form a large and tremendously effective party. We were talking about gameplay similar to the one we described in the Gun & Dungeons review, therefore an arena shooter that should draw on the mechanics of twin stick shooters, but which instead adopts an approach that could be defined as ~stop and shoot~, with our characters who attack as soon as we stop moving them around the scenario: a choice that soon turns out to be in line with the balance of difficulty. At first the long Crash Heads campaign seems quite trivial, but then things get more challenging, when the enemies begin to become many and their attacks, where not avoided, inflict great damage, thinning the ranks of our team and therefore decreasing the general effectiveness of the blows we throw. At that point, an indicator could save us that fills up by fighting and which allows you to choose between some instant bonuses, for example fireballs that crash into opponents. Structure: Clash Royale cards but not only Crash Heads, our group is surrounded The Playgendary game structure acquires substance only after having unlocked the first two areas, therefore the experience starts slowly and then grows, although the risk is sometimes perceived of a formula destined to become a bit repetitive, or vulnerable to mechanisms freemium that at some point, inevitably, will begin to make themselves felt, pushing us towards grinding or microtransactions. Well, the Crash Heads structure provides some help in this sense, thanks to the event system with their prizes, but above all to the achievements and the rewards that can be obtained by completing the various chapters, with the prize boxes to be opened and the ~duplicate~ cards which, in combination with a certain amount of coins, allow us to upgrade the units in our possession and increase their effectiveness in the field . Technical realization Crash Heads, one of the bigger enemies heralds his attack From a graphic point of view, the game defends itself very well, although it does not reach the cleanliness and artistic maturity of the aforementioned Clash Royale. The characters of Crash Heads are nice and very well differentiated, both in the colors and in the animations, while the scenarios pay a little duty due to the fact that the setting is changed only every ten missions and therefore it happens to feel always in the same arena, if no attention is paid to details. The audio sector accompanies the action in a pleasant way, with music with a ~heroic~ cut that is well suited to what is represented on the screen, while the sound effects leave something to be desired on the field of battle, because ofan excessive simplicity that translates, even in the various unpackings, into a general lack of bite.", "date": "2023-01-04", "grade": "7.5"}
