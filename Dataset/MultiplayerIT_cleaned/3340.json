The review of the Critique Gaming game can only start like this, given the precise part of the investigator's work taken as a reference to build the dynamics of this debut effort by the Romanian team. A part that is certainly not the most eventful, so before approaching this title it is good to forget any detective sorties in the field or daring adventures experienced in other games. As the title suggests, in Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived the the only way to find out the truth is to study properly who is in front of us, with the aim of being able to make him yield through interrogation. Particularly sensitive themes from an ethical point of view and non-trivial dynamics form the foundations for the debut in the field of the Bucharest-based studio, which through Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived has tickled our curiosity, winking in some cases even at the highly appreciated Papers, Please. It is therefore worth analyzing this interesting video game properly without wasting any more time on presentations. The plot: from murder to conspiracy Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived puts us in the shoes of a city detective, busy investigating what initially appears as a ~simple~ case of theft gone wrong, with two people arrested following a murder. It is about the thief, as well as presumed murderer, and the victim's husband, from whose interrogations the truth about what happened to his poor wife will first come out, and then let us discover something very dangerous at stake in the city. call Liberation Front is in fact ready to pose a serious terrorist threat on the inhabitants, to the point of pushing the police forces to form a special task force within the department to thwart possible attacks by this organization. Naturally, it will be up to us to dismantle the Front, bringing its leaders to justice after having unmasked them. Considering the presence at the interrogation table of terrorists placed higher and higher in the hierarchy, what initially seems sharply divided as black and white begins to appear with all its shades, leading the player to try to influence the subject of the turn to however, in some cases also end up a victim of the same attempted manipulation by the other person. The Gameplay: Good Cop or Bad Cop? The only means that Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived puts at our disposal is, as already mentioned, the interrogation. To progress in the investigation we therefore only have the possibility of asking a series of questions to the suspect on duty, sometimes with the pressure of a timer beyond which it is not possible to go (for example in the case in which one is trying to locate and defuse a bomb), other times with the presence of other subjects to be interrogated at the same time to cross-reference the testimonies and thus frame the real culprit. The problem is that not everyone reacts the same way to our words, and it is therefore necessary to carefully study the dossier proposed to us before starting to ask questions. Of each person questioned it is possible to detect the degree of openness towards us, through the level of dilation of the pupil, and that of his fear, through the heartbeat. When the questions are not enough, it is possible to stop the recorder to try more ~convincing~ methods such as the taser or other types of violence. As the story progresses, you can also choose whether to specialize your virtual alter-ego in the interrogation according to the rules or make him a kind of outlaw, eventually also dealing with his stress level. To better manage the situation, Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived also offers some intermission phases in which you can assign your team members to some tasks such as looking for details from informants or simply relaxing after a day of stress. Even if the situation on what to do does not always appear clear, we have had the opportunity to appreciate some phases in which the information provided through these activities have been useful during the subsequent interrogation. For those who do not want to deal with too hard bones, the guys from Critique Gaming have made available a basic level of difficulty, in which the narrative experience is more linear, with fewer challenges and confessions easier to obtain. For those who want to try the maximum effort instead we find the so-called Interrogation Challenge, that is a more difficult type of game, with the necIn some cases, it is even necessary to rewind part of the previous interrogations in order to be able to move forward successfully. Graphics and sound: low cost, maximum performance Being a game that makes extensive use of texts and dialogues, Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived can allow itself the luxury of using very few elements from a graphic point of view, limiting itself to offering us a dark room ninety percent of the time where we find the inevitable table and the suspect to be questioned. The dark tone given to the whole thing undoubtedly does its job well, accompanied by atmospheric music that the developers recommend (rightly) to listen directly through headphones. In the phases in which we are not busy interrogating, the game however, it carries out through a series of dialogues held with the various side characters, among which we find the members of our task force, criminology experts and journalists interested in learning more about the investigations. Beware of any language barrier: given the presence of numerous texts not translated into Italian, a good knowledge of English is required to better appreciate what is said in Interrogation: You Will Be Deceived.", "date": "2019-12-05", "grade": "7.5"}
