So let's go see if it's worth diving back into the pixelated dungeons of Devious Dungeon 2... Iron classes As mentioned at the beginning, Ravenous Games has wisely decided to keep the foundations on which the success of the prequel was built substantially unchanged: therefore we find ourselves again in front of an action rpg with pixel art graphics that focuses a lot on immediacy, starting with a simple but high-performance control system. Four virtual on-screen keys allow you to move left and right, jump and attack, with just a couple of combinations completing a very good control scheme. Using these inputs, the user must try to reach the top of a mysterious castle starting from the dungeons and crossing five different environments, each divided into a series of levels all distinguished by the same basic structure. In fact, all the stages, in addition to being full of enemies, obstacles and objects to collect, hide a key necessary to open the portal that leads to the next scheme: the specter of repetitiveness is fortunately immediately removed by the random generation of the scenarios, a very clever expedient that doesn't weigh too much on the player with the idea of doing basically the same things over and over again. On the other hand, grinding is an integral part of the playful experience offered by Devious Dungeon 2, mainly for what concerns the accumulation of coins useful for buying new pieces of equipment from the special itinerant shop that meets at periodic intervals between stages and the other: it is no coincidence that the only in-app purchases contemplated by the software concern virtual currency, even if it is fair to underline how it is very possible to play without ever having to use a credit card. A few small innovations are enough to make Devious Dungeon 2 a worthy sequel As happened with the first chapter, Devious Dungeon 2 flows away like a pleasure, thanks to fun fights (especially thanks to an excellent variety of enemies), challenging platform phases, secrets to find and side quests to complete, all wrapped up in a challenging but rarely frustrating level of challenge. Ravenous Games is confirmed as a software house very attentive to detail, and every gear of Devious Dungeon 2 works properly, even those that regulate the light but very pleasant rpg nuances of the title. Those who have played the prequel will notice several small improvements scattered here and there, but without a doubt the distinctive feature of this second episode lies in the possibility offered to the player to choose his alter-ego among three classes distinguished by different abilities: there is the warrior equipped with better stats in terms of attack and life points, the wizard who can strike from a distance and hover for short distances and the thief capable of double jumping and using both short and long range weapons. Although the choice of one or the other class does not radically change the gaming experience, it is still a pleasant addition that gives further variety to a title that in this respect would have something to teach many mobile products. It's just a pity that Ravenous Games hasn't pushed the innovation accelerator a little more, especially as regards the technical sector of Devious Dungeon 2: the pixel art graphics and the retro-style music do their duty, but there is no doubt that this is precisely the area in which the feeling of dj vu becomes a little more oppressive.", "date": "2015-04-16", "grade": "8.5"}
