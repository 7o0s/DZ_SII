{"name": "Enemy Territory: Quake Wars - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/enemy-territory-quake-wars-recensione_a.html", "text": " and Online The same type of game is proposed again in the online multiplayer field, the classic game modes such as deathmatch give way to a first person shooter dedicated to collaboration between teams of players. In fact, Quake Wars is not the usual fps, based entirely on one's ability to aim and shoot at the right time, the ~lone hunter~ will go very little online, in fact the game mechanics often reward organization and collaboration within the team. As mentioned earlier, there are different character classes in QW. The classes are divided into Assault, Special Forces, Engineers, Doctors and Scouts, there is also the possibility of further customization of the primary weapons and items supplied at the start of the mission. In the team economy, you will find yourself creating a team equipped with key elements such as the Doctors who are essential to have and protect against enemy attacks. At the same time, the sappers appear to be just as important, given that they are the only characters capable of building or conquering machinery or installations, which must systematically be protected by adequate firepower. It goes without saying that a close-knit and well-balanced team between the various elements will have an edge over randomly formed teams. Online, between one respawn and another, it is also possible to change the class of the character even during the game, thus making it possible to remedy any deficiencies in the team. Interesting toys.. One of the most interesting aspects of the game mechanics is represented by the possibility of using vehicles, very useful for crossing some areas more or less unscathed. The vehicles, like the weapons, are different from faction to faction, and vary from the classic tanks, up to Jetpacks for individual soldiers or even ~Mech~ exoskeletons that will transform the simple Strogg soldier into a lethal weapon in heavy combat . It must be specified that in the Xbox 360 version, vehicle control is expressly limited to the third-person view, excluding that from inside the vehicles themselves. As for the design and implementation of the individual maps, one cannot fail to compliment the developers. The level design of the bases and key points of each location is undoubtedly the result of painstaking work and very thorough testing. In almost all the missions there is much more than one possible solution to the achievement of the various objectives, a fact that leads each team to frequent communications to be able to protect, or carry out the assaults in a coordinated and therefore effective manner. From a technical point of view, Quake Wars does not excel in any sector, the graphics engine moves few polygons and few noteworthy effects, with the exception of some good textures, the result certainly does not do justice to the Nextgen console hardware. The lighting effects are one of the most deficient points, especially when compared to other productions among the shooters available. Furthermore it must also be emphasized that the frame rate is unfortunately not always constant. Also as regards the animations and the implementation of physics, QW does not have significant strengths, indeed their realization appears to be subdued. Unfortunately, the long gestation of the PC edition title did not allow the new title made in ID software to stand out as a technical reference point, like its much more famous predecessors. The sound falls within the average of shooters, with a decent implementation of in-game sound effects, unfortunately we note the lack of a soundtrack up to the ID Software reputation. A ~Live~ world Id Software and Nerve, the team responsible for developing the console version, had to adapt to the target focus of console users, very different from hard core users on PCs, making the game interface leaner and easier to understand. Among the changes made to the game mechanics there is also the auto locking for aim assist , which turns out to be almost too effective, while disabling it results in a completely unbalanced effect on the other side. The maximum number of players managed in the multiplayer modes, for the console versions has been limited to sixteen users. Moving on to testing the game in the field, it must be emphasized that the lag problems are extremely linked to the quality of the host, the network code does not yet seem optimized to the maximum and the connection quality of the users affects much more than in other game-oriented titles multiplayer. The title fully supports the development and management of clans as well as the excellent system of statistics andplayer performance tracking during matches. The ranking of a soldier at the end of the session does not depend only on how many enemies he has eliminated, but all his behavior in the context of the objectives achieved or not during the match. The ranking defined by these statistics is essential for unlocking new equipment, climbing the score on the online leaderboards and related achievements within the game. Comment The two watchwords regarding a game of Quake Wars turn out to be ~Tactics and Strategy~, only thanks to a battle plan and a rational organization will it be possible to obtain victories after victories online. The time for adrenaline-pumping deathmatches to be concluded at the last frag is now over. Unfortunately, the lack of a substantial offline section, and the unfortunate implementation of the graphics engine, penalize Quake Wars a lot compared to the rest of the direct competition on consoles and the PC version. The result is an extremely niche title, aimed at a category of players devoted to multiplayer mechanics based on clans and teams of fierce and organized fraggers. Pros Team combat a go go Well implemented classes Clan and multiplayer Cons Technical sector not up to par Offline not very relevant Maps not very numerous Xbox 360  Achievements In Quake Wars 50 different unlockable objectives have been implemented, of which only a small part is linked to the offline mode and the related single player campaign. Unfortunately it should be specified that ending the game at a higher difficulty level does not automatically lead to the unlocking of the other objectives related to the lower ones. The various objectives unlock from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 50 points. To be able to unlock them all it will take several hours spent in multiplayer modes.", "date": "2008-06-13", "grade": null}
