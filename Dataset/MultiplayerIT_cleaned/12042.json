{"name": "Shrek Terzo - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shrek-terzo-recensione.html", "text": "Once upon three times After a series of tie-ins that slavishly followed the fate of the already released films, Activision with this third chapter decides to entrust the task of creating the Ds version of Shrek the Third to the Vicarious Visions, their thoroughbred, and it is here that the talented developers stop the hands of the story to create a kind of adventure parallel to the film. Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots go in search of the young King Arthur, descendant to the throne of Far Far Away. Once found, during the return journey the quartet runs into Merlin who, tragically mistaking his magic, transforms himself into a kind of vase, forcing the most heterogeneous group in history to explore four settings in search of the golden fairies, the only objects in able to restore human form to the old wizard. This in short is the story with which Shrek the Third is presented, a story told by Donkey and illustrated on the laptop like a storybook (complete with Brain Training-style visualization). The game is configured as a classic platform game, with three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Puss in Boots and the young Arthur) and two-dimensional horizontal scrolling movements. The macro-settings present in the game are of four types: the classic enchanted forest, the castle, the pirate bay and the caves, which reproduce quite faithfully (albeit not going into too much detail) what are the Shrekian-inspired areas. Each setting is subsequently divided into 4 others in which the player's aim is to recover a certain number of golden fairies and coins. The power of three The three characters are the keystone of the game, avoiding dull and stale formulas, Vicarious Visions has preferred to give this Shrek the Third a bit of a puzzle and cooperative platform touch. The trio runs through the level simultaneously and independently, the choice of which character to use and at what moment is up to the player or simply to link several characters together (symbolically, this means, thanks to a sort of frame that connects the avatars of the characters in the bottom of the touch screen) so that they all advance together. The special moves -as such- are unique and reflect the logic with which obstacles follow one another: Shrek has the power to break through walls and floors, Arthur the one to use his shield against the weapons that rain down from the sky and to hurl his object of defense in order to activate particular switches in the shape of a heraldic symbol, and finally Puss in Boots closes the trio with his athletic skills (he is the only one who is able to jump) and swordsman. External to the trio is Donkey, who in addition to being the narrator of the story has the task (by pressing one of the two backbones) of giving a touch of magic to the adventure, using Merlin's wand. The purpose of each level is to overcome the various obstacles and enemies always ready to block our way, arriving safely at the end-of-level portal. The game structure focuses almost exclusively on the touch screen: thanks to simple movements of the stylus, the special abilities of each character are controlled, enemies are attacked and particular movements are performed. The setting given to the game is such that the whole adventure can be played even without holding the DS, simply placing it on a table and using the directional cross to move to support the stylus. As in any good self-respecting story, all that glitters is not gold, and although the work of Vicarious Visions has been very respectable, strong doubts remain about the consistency of the game: first of all, the game is visibly designed for a decidedly young audience , but the bizarre control system combined with a poor touch screen calibration affect the experience making it frustrating for more experienced players and certainly complex for novices. While representing an excellent 3D experiment, visually the game is far below the productions of the developer of Activision, and despite everything in some phases of the game the action has serious problems of frame rate collapses. To close the circle, unfortunately, the excessive simplicity of the game should be highlighted (an element that weighs doubly on the poor longevity), with ~phoned~ obstacles that are easy to overcome, and the sporadic presence of enemies equipped with very low AI. A point absolutely in favor of the game is represented by the dubbing which, although not aligning itself with the goodness expressed by that of the film, is however made in the best possible way, underlining once again the care that Vicarious Visions places in aspects too often ignored by distinguished colleagues.The moral of the story? Shrek 3 is a good student but doesn't commit. The game fulfills its task to achieve sufficiency but fails to go further due to a series of problems and defects that undermine the experience. However, the desire of Vicarious Visions to detach itself -once again- from those that are only clichd productions that are often encountered in the tie-in field remains evident. Above all the sound sector and the game structure on the powers of the trio, definitely a breath of fresh (enchanted) air. Pros: Original game structure Definitely well done dubbing The story interludes are the perfect fusion between Ds and a book of fairy tales Cons: Inaccurate control system Definitely not long-lived Poor level of challenge Once upon a time there was an Orc who just wanted to be left alone in the foulest swamp in all of the fairy realm. One day, however, Dreamworks (Mr. Steven Spielberg's production house) decided that the days of rest were over for the antisocial green beast and started a series of comical / catastrophic events that led the ogre to get married, to have a puss in boots and a talkative donkey as best friends and above all to become King! If everything could accept willingly, the decision to make him King of the kingdom of Far Far Away shook the soul of the good Shrek with shivers, making him embark towards an unknown land in search of the second presumed aspirant to the throne: a thirteen-year-old misfit.", "date": "2007-08-29", "grade": null}
