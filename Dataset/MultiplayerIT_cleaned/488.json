{"name": "New Super Mario Bros", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-super-mario-bros_a.html", "text": "New It only takes a few moments to fall in love with New Super Mario Bros., a few moments to remember the good times you've had. A striking characteristic of this game immediately emerges, namely that of having been inspired, to create something new, by all the old episodes, both 2d and 3d. The base is that of the first Mario, there are elements taken from the three and from the World, but above all there are the moves and the interaction that only a polygonal engine can offer. The management of the physics was also inspired by the first platformers of the Italian plumber, in which there was an excessive slippage of the protagonist compared to what would have happened in reality. The moves available to the plumber are taken from the classic repertoire, none excluded, plus some unexpected additions extrapolated from Super Mario 64 and Yoshi's Island. Obviously there's the normal jump, but there's also the triple jump, fun to perform as usual, and the wall-to-wall jump, a useful and very often necessary move to continue the levels. Both the slips and the 'sculata' inherited from Yoshi are back, the latter applied in a new and intelligent way. From the top of its twenty years of experience with this genre, Nintendo still demonstrates today, after a long time, that it has not lost its talent New It's incredible how Nintendo manages to amaze once again by mixing cards already known to perfection. However, even this Mario brings with him some new power ups: a tiny mushroom, an obese one and a blue shell, as well as the star and the flower. The uses of these last two are known by almost every player in the world, but for the forgetful few it is right to remember that the star makes Mario invulnerable for a few seconds, with a relative historical tune to accompany the moments of invincibility, while picking up the flower the The plumber gains the ability to shoot at enemies. The small mushroom reduces Mario's size even further when he is at his most vulnerable, allowing him to enter otherwise inaccessible areas, while the large one makes him a giant capable of crushing everything and everyone. The blue shell-koopa instead transforms Mario into a sort of hybrid between human and turtle, with all the consequences of the case: it increases his defense when he takes refuge inside his shell, makes him heavier and consequently faster in water, but above all allows him to transform into a sort of crazed shell capable of stunning and knocking down anyone, with a relative loss of precision in movements. A plumber on the throne All these undoubtedly interesting elements, capable by themselves of exalting the soul of any Mario fan, however, would not be sufficient to decree the validity of the game if they were not applied correctly. From the top of his twenty years of experience with this genre, Nintendo still demonstrates today, after a long time, that he has not lost his talent. The level design of New Super Mario Bros. is its greatest value, it is the aspect that raises it from the crowd and elevates it to the king of the genre, now as yesterday, in relation to the games of other companies but also to those of Nintendo itself , such as Princess Peach or Kirby Convas Curse. There is an underlying harmony that cannot be appreciated, each brick is placed in a specific position for a specific purpose, nothing is left to chance. Objects, enemies and platforms are masterfully arranged, the game flows smoothly and is fun at all times, without ever becoming banal or frustrating. Fortunately, all this is accompanied by a precise, simple and intuitive control system, which however does not make extensive use of the Touch Screen. The lower screen is managed to report Mario's position in relation to the length of the level, to show data, i.e. the number of coins collected and the score, and the spare item, which can be made to appear in the game at will with a simple touch. The most convincing levels of all are those made up of mushroom-shaped platforms, thanks to the new abilities, shapes and movements attributed to them. They are an apotheosis of colors and jumps, obviously without taking anything away from the other stages that do their duty in the best way. The castles, the ghost houses, the underwater levels, those with pipes, those covered with snow and those in the sky are back, there is essentially the whole Mariesco repertoire with some nice and unexpected additions. In each stage there are three large gold coins to collect, which are not mandatory but which are sometimes necessary to progress in the game, and provide incentives, if needed, to revisit the levels already completed. In New Super Mario Bros. there are many new enemies and elements that are added to the classic ones,but they all fit perfectly and blend imperceptibly, without the player noticing, with the traditional ones. Asuke, Tezuka and Miyamoto This is the first two-dimensional Super Mario to have not had an important involvement of Shigeru Miyamoto during development, limited to the simple supervision of the project. Tezuka (in the photo above), the other person who has shaped the Italian plumber series since its origins, directing the most acclaimed episodes (Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World), has instead played the role of General Producer, which is also quite marginal. On the other hand, Koizumi and Usui, the creators of Sunshine, who have now moved to the EAD division in Tokyo, who are working on the new Super Mario Galaxy, did not participate in the processing of New SMB. To give life to the latter platform of the series, in chronological order, was the unprecedented couple formed by Kimura (producer) and Asuke (director). As a debut really not bad. Mario here, Mario there, but how long will it last me? The game is divided into eight worlds, each with a different setting and with more than ten stages within it. Each level is represented by a circle on the map, the latter divided into zones, one for each world, which are not communicating with each other. The game is not very difficult, especially the fights with the various bosses are disarmingly easy. You can choose to savor it, and then go one level after another by taking each coin, or decide to finish it in the shortest possible time and use the many shortcuts, obviously well hidden, that take you from one world to another. There are some levels and mushroom houses (settings where there are bonuses) that can only be reached by finding secondary exits within the stages, always hidden with intelligence and logic. Also from the point of view of longevity, therefore, New Super Mario Bros. is an excellent title, capable of guaranteeing about twenty hours of healthy entertainment even for the most experienced player. Where perhaps it has a slight downturn is in the challenge factor, which is quite low. In Super Mario Bros. 3 the difficulties were dodgeable, as it was full of warps, but the expert player still found a hard time playing all the stages one after the other. In Super Mario World, much easier than its predecessor, the challenge instead lay in finding the many secrets scattered around the world. New Super Mario Bros has a strong identity that markedly distinguishes it from its predecessors Mario here, Mario there, but how long will it last me? New Super Mario Bros. is a middle ground between the two, more challenging than World as standard difficulty but much easier than Three (also because you are continually stuffed with bonus lives), more exploratory than the latter but much less than World . Of course, this comparison is made for pure convention, to best explain the structure of this new Nintendo platformer, because treating New Super Mario Bros. as something in between would be disrespectful to its strong identity, which markedly distinguishes it from its predecessors. . The duration of the latest creation by the men of Kyoto is also increased by the mini-games, all those already offered in Super Mario 64x4 plus some unpublished ones, which use only the Touch Screen. Absolute novelty then is the multiplayer, which sees two players engaged in a fratricidal challenge to collect some stars, scattered randomly, in levels designed specifically for this mode. It is also possible to compete in various mini-games, and in this case the competition is open to four participants. Definitely an excellent addition capable of prolonging the experience of an already rewarding single-player game even further. No to three dimensions, yes to polygons In addition to the many opportunities arising from the use of polygons at a playful level, the same graphic cosmetics has inevitably benefited from the choice of Nintendo programmers to abandon the sprites. The game is very colorful and boasts a unique style, as well as featuring beautifully crafted animations. Overall NSMB looks more than valid, among the best appeared on Nintendo DS. The sound is no different, despite the absence of the historic composer Kondo. The SFX are as usual very entertaining, to underline the monstrous cries of the fish, while the music consists of an interesting mix of classic and new pieces. Those of recent creation do not disfigure in the slightest when compared to the traditional ones, the latter probably less used than one might have imagined. The reason that occurs most frequently in the game rightfully enters the best pieces of the series, as well as the one that accompanies the deserted stagesThere. New Super Mario Bros. does not disappoint, and this is the most important thing. It is a platformer with a sublime, first-class design that rewards Nintendo experience and talent, which has remained intact over time. Obviously after so many years, however beautiful and fun, such a title cannot have the same weight as Super Mario World had at the time of Super Nintendo; however, this does not mean that it cannot match the quality level. Undoubtedly New Super Mario Bros. lives up to its predecessors, in every respect, and has well-defined characteristics that give it a strong identity, an identity capable of making it unique and independent from past titles. It is not the purpose of this review to say whether it is better or worse than the others, this will only be decided by time, if it ever decides to do so. The fact that this possibility can be taken into consideration, however, is indicative of the quality of the latest Nintendo creation. Essential for every DS owner, but above all a valid incentive to purchase the console for every video game enthusiast. Pro Level Sublime design Harmonious combination between 2d and polygons Simple and perfect controls Fun minigames Cons Not high challenge for the more experienced Bosses too easy Fifteen years have passed, so long years separate us from the last two-dimensional Mario episode; and when we talk about Mario, of course, we're talking about the main saga, the one that wrote the history of video games. A game of this series probably no longer has the weight today, in relation to the rest of the market, that it had many years ago. Yet to have waited patiently there are many, many video game enthusiasts. Well, New Super Mario Bros. is here, awaiting trial, hoping to offload the enormous burden it had to carry during these months of work.", "date": "2006-05-29", "grade": null}
