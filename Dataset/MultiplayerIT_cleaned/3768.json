{"name": "OddBallers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/oddballers-recensione.html", "text": "Spending an afternoon together on the sofa, while yelling in front of a screen, is a ritual that, once in a while, is always nice. Of course, finding a video game that allows everyone to have fun, regardless of being inveterate or totally inept controller players, is not always an easy task. The ritual of the party game is something very delicate: balancing, constant challenge and leveling of skills are needed. Everyone must be able to ~make shoes~ for others, but this is easier said than done: some are more gifted for puzzles, some for general knowledge and some for hand-eye coordination . Consequently, as often happens, the evening does not satisfy everyone in the same way, creating considerable frustration in those who have failed to adapt to the rules. However, there are cases in which, even if one is not really able to obtain a result that is one, the final experience is still jovial, balanced despite the imbalances. It doesn't often happen that we find a video game with such characteristics but, sometimes, the industry graces us with a title like the one developed by Gameswing and Ubisoft Mumbai, not too original, not too complex, but still somehow damned fun. Let's see better its strengths and weaknesses in this review of OddBallers. Fun without obligation OddBallers: an unconventional dodgeball OddBallers is a multi-event multiplayer video game broadly based on dodgeball. Broadly speaking because, in the end, the aim is to throw everything that is provided at you during the short thematic matches that make up a game. The title has taken full advantage of the great successes of recent years, from the most recent Mario Party, to the various Fall Guys and company, up to the golden age of Windjammers (with all the necessary reinterpretations). Already from the menu you can understands that Oddballers is fully immersed in the contemporary iconographic fabric of our industry. In fact, we find welcoming us a visual structure that closely resembles that of the battle royale that have invaded the collective imagination in recent years, complete with a double currency, a shop with timed cosmetic elements and a progress line with various rewards. In short, the first impact you have is that of being faced with any battle royale, but the music changes immediately. OddBallers: Up to six people can play simultaneously on Nintendo Switch Regardless of whether you play online or locally (on Nintendo Switch up to six people using a single Joy-Con each), the structure is the same: choose one of the three available maps, decide whether to play in four or in six (if you are not enough, you will be matched with bots, for which you can also set the difficulty), select the duration of the match between short, medium and long (respectively, the match point is reached when someone reaches four, seven or eleven points) and complete randomly selected challenges (but there is also a custom game option). The rest is up to the players, who will be left in a freely explorable lobby complete with all the necessities to prepare for the game, from the shop where you can buy new clothes, to the wardrobe, to some hobbies, so you don't have to leave the room created every time to change individual parameters. Depending on the length of the match, players must compete in different dodgeball-themed challenges, either as a team or individually. Each round has its own characteristics and rules, adequately explained before each mini-game (in full Mario Party style), so as to allow even those who have never played the game to quickly understand the objective and commands and compete on equal terms of the others. We have the classic ~free-for-all~, where the last man standing wins, but also reinterpretations of modes that we have come to know in other multiplayer contexts, such as capturing the opponent's ~flag~ or stealing the bounty from other players and trying to to survive as long as possible. In any case, the constant is the same: take advantage of the objects of the scenario to eliminate those who stand in your way to glory. Whether they are balls, coconuts or chickens it doesn't matter: as long as they knock your opponents out. Each round awards three points to the winner and one to runners-up (if any). Whoever reaches the predetermined score at the start of the game wins the coveted OddBallers cup. The Renaissance of the Rabbids OddBallers: No mercy for your opponents in these versions of the dodgeball On a graphic level, OddBallers defends itself well, not so much for the style or for the complexity of the models,as for the underlying coherence that binds everything. Together with the caricatured characters (which are certainly capable of starting heated debates about their quality) we find, surprisingly, the Rabbids. After all, in a Ubisoft party game, where you have to make educational ignorance your sharpest weapon, the most irreverent rabbits in the world of video games cannot fail to be present. In what seems to all intents and purposes a real rebirth after a fairly dark period, these mascots are finally returning to sail the seas of liquid crystals, reverberating the glories of the past with small productions like this or with larger projects, such as the Mario+Rabbids. Apart from this small personal satisfaction, OddBallers runs quite well, even if it is not free from some bugs and substantial frame drops, which mainly occur during loading or scenario changes, so that whoever loses during the game real can not blame the fluidity (we refer to the only version that we have had the opportunity to test, or the one for Nintendo Switch).", "date": "2023-02-01", "grade": "7.5"}
