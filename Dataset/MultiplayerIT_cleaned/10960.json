{"name": "Lips - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lips-recensione.html", "text": "After the price cut, the sequels of two ~important~ games such as Gears of War and Fable and after the advent of the new dashboard with the possibility of renting movies via Market Place, the third part of Microsoft's Christmas strategy, to expand the user base is made up of games for casual gamers. Among the most publicized titles in this perspective there is undoubtedly Lips, which is part of the genre of music games, with a clear reference to that Singstar which has done so much over the years for the popularity of PlayStation in living rooms all over the world. The interface and the type of atmosphere that one breathes are quite similar, the real novelties consist of two wireless microphones (wireless), equipped with a motion sensor and which light up following the vocalizations of the player on duty, and the possibility to add to the songs available all those present on portable mp3 players and other sources connected to the console. That Lips is a particular project can already be seen from the team entrusted with the development, or the guys who made Elite Beat Agents, a musical game with excellent critical success released on Nintendo DS some time ago. The legacy of the team can be seen in the more ~playful~ modes that accompany the simple execution of the 40 available songs. In fact, in addition to the simple Karaoke mode, which allows you to try your hand at the songs by following the video text, you can clash with a friend with a simple system that assigns a score to who sings better during some phases of the songs; you can replace the official video of the song with one generated by Xbox 360, whose shots react to the movements made by the microphone; one can take the part of one of two lovers meeting when singing correctly and embracing with the coordinated movement of the two microphones; or finally, you can play trying not to detonate a bomb, extinguishing the fuse with the water that accumulates in two glasses, while singing. The central part of the game, however, is the one that gives you the opportunity to sing, alone or with a friend, over the songs with a system that detects the stability of the voice, the correctness of the intonation and, for the first time in a title of its kind, the vibrato applied to the longest notes. The motion sensor inserted in the microphones also comes into play which allows you to play with virtual percussion, shaking them, in the moments of pause between one verse and another. The problem is that there is an annoying delay between when you shake the microphone and when the sound of the instrument is emitted, which effectively prevents you from keeping time, making you soon give up on the enterprise. If you are not one of the two lucky singers, two other players can hold as many pads and produce a series of sounds that accompany, this time in time, the vocals. Lips, at the end of the performance, awards a score, the higher the more you have been in tune, and many medals depending on how skilled you have been with all the aspects described above, starting from the intonation, up to the rhythm and the number of percussions played with both pads and mics. There's no wrong notes being hit and there's no actual game, there's just a rating that grows song after song, but no other kind of single player mode other than a status progression that goes up with the number of songs performed. Note that, among the options, there is also the possibility of synchronizing the scrolling of the text with the audio of the songs, anticipating or postponing the moment in which the words appear on the video (this is to keep account of the lag that afflicts LCD TVs). However, there are two problems: the program does not remember the modification for all the songs, forcing you to adjust it each time for each song; there is no guide or indication, so a novice user will have difficulty making the adjustment). We, on the Samsung 40~ A656 LCD, have found the optimal setting, setting the delay to - 0.058 hundredths of a second. Thousands of songs There are 40 tracks available, and there are also Italian representatives, from Nek to Sonhora, up to Subsonica. Each song is accompanied by the original video, apart from the cases of the older songs, and there are already several additions on the Marketplace to download for 160 Microsoft Points. During the various sector fairs, much had been focused on the possibility of adding to the Lips library all the mp3s present on portable players such as the Zune or the Ipod. This feature also works with a PC connected to the network, without the need to transfer data to keys or media of any kind, but simply by streaming the songs (be careful not to add a branot that it has the same name as one bought on the Marketplace, because the program cannot distinguish between the two files and seems to give precedence to the one on the external source - pc or ipod - rather than the one purchased). Lips, in these cases, seems to recognize the intonation of the players and attribute a score that reflects the values on the pitch, in a more or less plausible way. There are no words to sing to, but with songs by Italian singers, it can be fun all the same, remaining in the perspective of what has all the trappings of a more sophisticated version of a Karaoke, rather than that of a game that allows, perhaps, the creation of video or audio content, unlike the competition. To give some substance to the ~playful~ component there is the possibility of challenging your friends list contacts online, but this is a half-baked implementation, given that the game does not take place with a real challenge in goal: you send the challenge, you wait for the opponent's score, which will then be compared with your own. The rest is all entrusted to the pleasure of singing, to the possible desire to unlock the objectives and to the Christmas parties with related support alcohol (or Fanta and Coca for the little ones listening ed) Comment Lips is a product that makes simplicity its strong point, combined with a refinement that also manifests itself in the workmanship of the microphones which, from the very first moment, rest in the hands of the singer with a different solidity from those of other games of this type on the market. On the other hand, however, Lips ends up being little more than a Karaoke full of style and with a good repertoire of songs, which will owe much of its success to the desire to sing with friends at home, given that the musical game has barely the surface and that there is no real single player mode. There are good ideas, which we hope will be perfected with updates via Xbox Live, and some uncertainties that we hope will be smoothed out with a patch. For now, with some Christmas bubbly and the right friends, fun is guaranteed.
