{"name": "All-Star Fruit Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/all-star-fruit-racing-recensione.html", "text": "There are already many arcade racing games, and each of the newcomers at the time of their debut must inevitably confront the sacred monster of the genre: Mario Kart. Not a small comparison, and not even one from which it is easy to emerge unscathed: Mario Kart 8, the latest iteration of the franchise, has now set standards that he will probably have difficulty surpassing himself in the future. However, this does not mean that there is no room for the peaceful coexistence of competitors, especially if they have something original and personal to offer: this is the case of All-Star Fruit Racing, produced by an independent Italian team, 3DClouds.it. We tried the early access version for PC at the time, and now we return for the final verdict on the PS4 version, given that the developers have also managed to take care of a more than discreet port for the main consoles out there. While reading the review, try to sip a fruit juice, you will soon understand why. Arcade and original gameplay: fruit is free Have you all seen the 2012 Disney film Wreck-It Ralph directed by Rich Moore? You should, if only for the fact that it's set in the world of video games. In any case, some of you will remember that the protagonist's friend, Vanellope, lives in a video game called Sugar Rush, a racing game based on karts, colorful girls and environments completely dominated by sweets. We like to think that All-Star Fruit Racing is inspired at least a little by Vanellope's world, because it really reminds her of it: the main difference is that the main theme is not represented by sweets but by fruit. Every single girl in the race is inspired by a particular fruit and shows off not only clothing dedicated to it, but the vehicle itself perfectly recalls its main characteristics in terms of dimensions, details and colors. Thanks to the good variety of fruit existing in the world, we therefore find ourselves with a roaster made up of 22 characters, ten of which are immediately available to take to the track and the last twelve who will be unlocked by completing competitions and certain missions. But if you think that the fruit invasion at the base of All-Star Fruit Racing is limited to its protagonists, you are very wrong: the five islands that host the circuits (for a total of 21 tracks) and the same game mechanics. And it is here that the main differences emerge between All-Star Fruit Racing and any other arcade racing game, including Mario Kart: to begin with, there are no power-ups in the proper sense of the term, that is, you will not be able to pick up a crate or block from the ground that guarantees you a certain tool with which to hinder your opponents. Players must earn their own power ups by collecting the many fruit scattered around the track, you will notice it immediately because it floats inside colored bubbles: by collecting it it is possible to load your own tanks, indicated in the lower right corner of the screen, each of which is when a special power is activated. By recovering many kiwis, for example, it is possible to perform a short sprint at speed with which to distance the opponents, while other types of fruit generate shields, throw snowballs, release a sticky substance that forces opponents to slow down, and so on. There are many basic weapons that can be activated, but the possibility of combining them by mixing the collected fruit is even more interesting: having four tanks available, it is possible to choose to exclude some and mix the others, thus obtaining different combinations of fruits and powers; loading all the available slots to the maximum, however, the special and definitive move of the character used at that moment is activated, and varies according to each of them. And it is here that the accounts begin to not add up perfectly, because the final special moves are not balanced at all: the search missile of Anny's Pineazooka ability (a pineapple missile!) will always be more useful and efficient than Cora's Cocostrike , a sort of giant coconut made into a bowling ball. Playstation 4 trophies The All-Star Fruit Racing Platinum Trophy is quite simple to obtain, but it will take at least 20 hours of gameplay due to a specific trophy that requires you to spend this exact amount of hours on the track. The remaining trophies are unlocked by completing the career mode, playing a few games with friends and winning (a few) online races: nothing too complex, just a little patience. Lots of style, but not a few problems All-Star Fruit racing is a fun and fast game, visually also quite pretty and without particularly evident smudges, as well as vdry from a technical point of view: the fact remains that it also has obvious problems. And the fact that these flaws come out right where it should excel, not only in the balancing of its original game weapons, but in the same use of fruit-related bonuses: even the basic moves are anything but simple to remember or intuitive to use, and things don't get better when it comes to combining them during a ride. The difficulty points decisively upwards from the start, and it's not very practical to remember how much fruit of which type we have collected, as well as its possible combinations with the other available to us in the tanks. The fact of having wanted to limit the use of drifts, which basically guarantee a discreet boost in speed, is also questionable, but abuse overheats tires and engines and ends up penalizing the player: the mechanics do not bring who knows what benefits to a gameplay that would like to be technical, but which turns out to be simplistic in many cases. Even the artistic direction is not all rosy: good for the many customizations of the karts, good also for the thematic variety of the circuits, but the protagonists remain, despite their ~fruitful style~, all in all anonymous if not decidedly forgettable, in some cases even not very pretty. On the verses and cries that launch during the competitions we spread a pitiful veil directly.", "date": "2018-07-19", "grade": "7.0"}
