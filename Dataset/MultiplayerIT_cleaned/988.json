{"name": "Suikoden IV", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/suikoden-iv-2.html", "text": "Taste of sea The first feature that catches the eye of Suikoden IV, already from the introductory film (an assembly of cutscene fragments, which unfortunately makes one regret the wonderful animated introduction of the prequel), is that this time the adventure takes place on the sea, among the Island Nations, a sort of archipelago formed by a multitude of island-states, 100 years before the events that will take place in the first Suikoden. In one of these islands, Gaien, a small army of knights is being trained hard, and needless to say the protagonist of Suikoden IV is one of these soldiers: an orphan, raised by the noble Vingerhut family with whom he made friends with the young heir Snowe , our alter-ego prepares for the ceremony that will formalize his entry, and that of his comrades in arms, into Gaien's army. Suikoden IV begins at sea, during the last training of the new knights of Gaien, which introduces the joyful atmosphere of a long-awaited party and the light-heartedness of a group of young soldiers whose missions are of the peace that reigns between the Island Nations. A peace that, clearly, is destined to be abruptly interrupted: it is precisely during a mission, boycotted by the assault of a handful of pirates, that the legendary Rune of Punishment manifests itself, which is said to give its owner immense destructive powers in exchange but at a terrible price. But who will be, and why above all, the new bearer of the Cursed Rune? What will be his fate, and that of the 108 Stars of Destiny who are said to come together in times of crisis to protect the world from the darkest threats? Konami tells us a new fairy tale with the usual mastery, which although seasoned by the now inevitable clichs of the RPG genre (and the Suikoden saga) offers poetic moments of extreme drama or epicness, and some of the most characterized characters of all time, such as the Snowe Vingerhut himself, a fearful and self-centered young man who will be able to show his lionheart and mature as in the most chivalrous of tales. The undertow of changes As was said at the beginning, Suikoden IV takes a step back, not only from a narrative point of view, but also from a playful point of view. Playing Suikoden IV at times feels like playing an ~old school~ RPG, with no complicated menus to navigate, absurd stats to track, or complex combat maneuvers. The changes compared to the third episode particularly affect the combat system: still random clashes (unfortunately too frequent), but this time managed in a less abstruse but also less original way. No longer six heroes divided into three rows to which to assign the various commands, but a party of four characters to which to give orders individually, in the most classic way possible, between normal blows, runic spells (which fortunately no longer affect an area with risk of damaging our units) and the inevitable combined attacks involving several protagonists in spectacular animations with devastating (or almost) results. The classic and frequent ~party against enemies~ combat system is once again joined by the rarer Duels, which involve one of the protagonists and the bad guy in an epic head-to-head match, and the brand new naval battles, which replace the pitched battles which made the saga famous. If in the first two Suikoden we had to deal with real wars between dozens of units with a system that recalled the Chinese morra, if in the third episode the mass battles became a sort of chess game, in a chapter set for the seas Konami has implemented real battles between galleons reminiscent of those admired in Skies of Arcadia (Dreamcast, GameCube): simple and intuitive, but also spectacular, the monumental clashes between the ship of our heroes and the opposing fleets are one of the most expected during the adventure, as they are extremely fun and strategic. Of course, there is also the possibility of recruiting the Stars of Destiny to build a mini-army that will enlarge and modify the protagonists' base of operations by making available new mini-games, shops and various options to expand the players' possibilities between one fight and another . On paper Suikoden IV therefore presents itself as an extremely varied and engaging title, but the discussion to be made is a little more complex. It is true that in recent years we have seen an exaggerated proliferation of the RPG genre to say the least, and it is also true that the last few titles with which we spent whole nights presented increasingly complex and at times exaggerated mechanics, but the path to take now should be the creation of an RPG that can entertain with a simple and original game system, and if it canwe can ensure the sometimes unsettling simplicity of Suikoden IV, on the other hand we cannot speak of originality given that for this fourth chapter Konami has done nothing but fish with both hands in the two 32-bit prequels, of which numerous elements are re-proposed playful and narrative. Having abandoned the original Trinity Sight System in favor of an undoubtedly compelling but banal story in the narrative, embracing choices from the past that made the difference years ago but which certainly don't surprise now, Konami therefore presents an episode that is a bit ' a mix of the first three Suikoden, but which lacks that magic and novelty that characterized even the controversial PlayStation 2 prequel. The wind also blows in the right direction On a technical level, we don't even need to consider the two prequels, which we remember were two-dimensional, but compared to Suikoden III, we have an exceptional metamorphosis. The third episode, released in the Japanese version four years ago, surprised positively for the aesthetic quality of the locations, but at the same time it cannot be said that the rough and rough modeling of characters and monsters, with woody and unnatural animations, delighted the eye and with dull and sometimes monochromatic textures. In Suikoden IV fortunately the quality of the settings has remained unchanged, gratifying the player with incredibly detailed landscapes of rare beauty, and at the same time the characters and creatures, hostile and otherwise, have been made with realistic proportions (in the prequel they were super-deformed) and with a decidedly high level of detail, while following the Japanese character design, perhaps less refined than the prequels but decidedly pleasant, despite the questionable proportions adopted in some cases. The same animations, disappointing in Suikoden III, are in chapter IV natural, fluid, realistic. Obviously there is no shortage of the usual particularly choreographic special effects that accompany spells and special attacks, here even more defined and spectacular than in the prequel, where they were the strength of the fights. Again, a new element for which Konami seems to approach modern RPGs is the direction of the cutscenes which, practically absent in the prequel, explode in this episode in a series of non-interactive sequences that spectacularize the salient moments of the plot. All this is accompanied by a fine soundtrack, well composed, good accompaniment for battles, exploration and multiple cutscenes, but not particularly inspired, as well as the dubbing: very good, especially as regards the main characters, but not excellent. Truly paradoxical how the new RPG Konami has approached today's technical standards, while still anchoring itself in a playful past that is now too remote. Criticizing Suikoden IV is difficult, unfair. It would be like criticizing the best RPGs have offered us in recent years, it would be like blaming and belittling a simple but effective and engaging game system, a compelling storyline and a more than good technical sector. Still, Suikoden IV proves to be disappointing at times. The recent Metal Gear Solid 3 from Konami itself questions the rules of sequelization: a ~3~ in the title for a game set before its predecessors and which is played in a completely new (or almost) new way. Suikoden IV is in the same situation: the fourth episode of a saga, set before the ~prequels~, yet there is nothing innovative (navigation is not enough) to entice RPG enthusiasts into its use. Everything seems to have already been seen. And it's a shame, because Suikoden IV has a lot to offer to those who want to venture among the Island Nations for the forty hours necessary to complete the adventure without engaging in ancillary mini-quests. Fans of the saga will love it (how could they not, with all the familiar faces that appear during the adventure?), but fans of the genre will be seized by continuous deja-vue while casual gamers may find it too old-fashioned for their more modern tastes. What to say, then? Suikoden is Suikoden, it is a fairy tale that offers splendid moments, but it is also a video game and as such we can only hope that the inevitable sequel (or prequel?) can enjoy the inventiveness that Konami has lacked this time. Pros It's Suikoden Compelling plot Simple and enjoyable... Cons ... but seen and seen Not all characters are well characterized Monotonous and too frequent random fights The release of the third chapter of the Suikoden saga, Konami's flagship RPG, went almost silently, also due to the lack of marketing on European territory. Also, but not only. Suikoden III, one of the best RPGs that PlayStation 2 hosts in its toy library, is also one of the hardest games to judge, iin which a less than mediocre technical sector clashes with an incredibly remarkable playful depth. But fans of the saga are used to this challenge between technique and gameplay, after all even the first two episodes, for PSOne, fought with the three-dimensional graphics of titles such as Final Fantasy and its spectacular Full Motion Videos. The strong point of Suikoden (literally ~The Legend of the Scarlet Moon~) has always been a compelling storyline, narrated in an impeccable way and intertwined with an extremely satisfying game system. It is no coincidence that Suikoden III is the most complex episode also from a narrative point of view, thanks to the gimmick of the Trinity Sight System and its three protagonists, whose position and role in the complex plot allow it to be enjoyed from different perspectives. And in a videogame era in which spectacular images and sounds are favored, the depth of Suikoden III both in America and in Japan has almost taken a back seat. It was therefore pleasant to discover last year that Konami was about to come up with a new episode of the saga, more up to date from a technical point of view, and set a hundred years before the events of the first, legendary Suikoden, a idea certainly not very original (it seems that Konami are focusing on fake sequels / prequels, just think of Metal Gear Solid 3) but not without charm. And so now we find ourselves in front of Suikoden IV, where the roles are reversed: technically remarkable, playfully retro. How is it possible?", "date": "2005-03-29", "grade": null}
