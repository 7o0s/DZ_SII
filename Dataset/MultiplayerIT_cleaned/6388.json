{"name": "Illusioni mortali", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/148781-the-evil-within-the-consequence-illusioni-mortali.html", "text": "Collected acclaim from critics and the public with the first DLC of The Evil Within, Bethesda Softworks and Tango Gameworks are back to the public with the second and final chapter of the story of Juli Kidman. As we have written on previous occasions, through these additional downloadable contents Mikami and her group wanted to expand the original game a little by offering, thanks to the figure of the beautiful detective Kidman, the vision of some of the key events of the main adventure from a different perspective. The Consequence in this sense continues the story of The Assignment, with poor Juli still trying to survive the horrors of STEM, while finding herself discovering new details about Marcelo Jimenez, Ruvik and the Mobius organization, as well as crossing paths with another character important than the original title. And here we stop to avoid annoying spoilers. With The Consequence ends the journey of the players in the waking nightmare of poor Juli Kidman Playstation 4 trophies The Consequence offers 10 Trophies including secret ones, of which seven are bronze and three are silver. To obtain them, for example, you must complete the two chapters that make up the adventure also in KURAYAMI mode, recover all personal files or collectibles, save the life of an important character or avoid killing enemies while passing a specific area. The art of survival Following the style of the main adventure, The Consequence maintains all the disturbing and threatening atmosphere created by Shinji Mikami, while in terms of playability it takes up the mechanics of the previous episode, thus pushing the gamer to a reasoned and stealth approach in most of the situations, thus avoiding direct confrontation with enemies except in extreme cases. However at a certain point in the final chapter there is a more eventful phase where the use of a firearm is foreseen. As a result, Kidman has to resort to cunning again to try to overcome obstacles, sneaking around in the dark, sneaking behind improvised shelters, such as huge overturned desks, or slipping into air ducts hoping not to be surprised by some well-hidden enemy at the exit on the opposite side. In this sense it is important, as seen in the previous episode, to carefully evaluate one's own movements but also those of the creatures that infest an area, paying attention to their behavioral routines and the sounds they emit, in such a way as to try to spot them their presence in advance, to then avoid them or lure them into a trap to block or kill them. In the latter case, the ideal, at least for most of the enemies, is to be able to take them individually from behind, preventing others from noticing Juli's presence, on pain of often instantaneous death. Despite what has just been described, there is no shortage of circumstances in which one dies ~because it has to go like this~ at that moment, but these are only a couple of ~trial and error~ situations that can be easily overcome after a few attempts and having understood what to do to go after you. As usual, a valuable contribution to making the atmosphere of the game full of terror and anxiety is given by the graphics and audio sectors, both of excellent workmanship, although for the first we have detected some sporadic delayed loading of the textures during some cutscenes. The excellent modeling of the main characters, the apt design of the disturbing figure with women's legs and the ~face~ represented by a lighthouse, introduced in the previous DLC, are added a good use of particle effects and the play of light and shadow in the areas indoors. This is combined with the beautiful representation of the daytime spaces in the open air, with the remains of the destroyed city in the background, the buildings collapsed on themselves or side by side, wedged in the belly of other larger buildings. However, it must be emphasized that this time we have practically a more marked recycling of the environments already seen in The Evil Within: it is true that Juli must move along a certain path based on the story of the original game which intersects with the plot told in The Consequence, however, in our opinion, we could try to use different passages or points, albeit in similar scenarios. As for the audio, the speech in Italian is good again and the sound effects are excellent, with a whole series of grunts, moans and noises to accompany users along their path, putting the right anxiety on them. The soundtrack works in the same way, capable of adequately underlining every moment of the story, especially those of greater narrative tension or scary. Ultimately, as you will have understood by reading the review, aWe also liked The Consequence. The story continues what started in the previous The Assignment, also reserving a final twist; by collecting the various audiologs it is possible to discover new details on some characters and situations relating to The Evil Within, and as if this were not enough, the gameplay offers a good level of challenge and the technical sector is excellent. The campaign is not particularly long, but as always a lot depends on how you decide to tackle it, that is, if you always go forward without ever looking back or vice versa, pausing, when possible, in search of collectibles, files and so on. We completed it in about three and a half hours, not only because we played calmly and carefully explored the locations, but also because of the boss of the first chapter (third counting it as a continuation of those of The Assignment) who made us waste a little more time. Once completed, the title still allows you to relive the experience in a different way, proposing new game modes such as the new game plus or another in which Juli is armed only with the flashlight for the whole adventure, and all the areas they are shrouded in darkness.", "date": "2015-04-23", "grade": null}
