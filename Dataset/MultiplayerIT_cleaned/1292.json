{"name": "Stellaris: Nemesis la recensione dell'ultimo DLC di questa space opera", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stellaris-nemesis-recensione.html", "text": "The original Stellaris was published by Paradox in May 2016. In these 5 years the game, similar to the space epic it wants to try to tell, has expanded, evolved and perfected. Paradox Development Studio has progressively modified all aspects of the game, from the economy to the management of planets, passing through the management of space fleets and even revising the expansion system in the universe. Sure, there's still room for improvement, but in this review of Stellaris: Nemesis we'll try to tell you how the Swedish studio has also tried to expand the endgame, perhaps one of the less well-finished aspects of the game. As per tradition, an update of this kind arrives together with an important free update (Stellaris 3.0 'Dick') which adds new options and possibilities for everyone, which however are only able to blossom thanks to all the expansions. The modular structure typical of Paradox may not be to everyone's liking, but it allows for a few euros a year to have a game that is always new and interesting and constantly evolving. Of course, every time an update of this type comes out, you have to abandon the old saves and relearn the game to absorb all the new features, but it is a sacrifice that you are probably willing to make in order to play one of the best 4X ever. Being the Crisis Being the Crisis or the one who fights it? The main novelty of Stellaris: Nemesis allows you to receive new, exceptional powers at the end of the game thanks to which you can give a completely different flavor to the last portion of each game. Until now, in fact, the game revolved around the concept of Crisis. Randomly, once the whole universe has been colonized, an extremely powerful army appeared from some corner of known space with the sole purpose of destroying all the civilizations present in the game. When this happened you had to roll up your sleeves, organize your armies and hope not to be overwhelmed by some world-eater or awakened empire. With Nemesis, as it is easy to guess, Paradox has decided to give players the opportunity to become the Final Crisis. To do this on the one hand, it made becoming bad more structured, through the accumulation of a new 'currency', the Menace. This can be achieved by destroying planets, fighting wars or even breaking space community law, enslaving peoples or hunting protected species. Once sufficient Threat has been obtained, it will be possible to spend the points acquired to obtain ships, technologies and tools thanks to which you can think not only of consuming the known universe, but also of resisting the coordinated efforts of other peoples to stop you. The new ships and new technologies all have a very menacing look to them, which also makes it visually rewarding to progress from one galaxy to another leaving nothing but ash behind. Once sufficient material has been obtained from the core of the destroyed planets, it will be possible to build an Ethorophasic Engine to erase any form of life from the universe. If only there was a visual feedback on the map generating our devastation, it would have been perfect. Guardians of the Galaxy In case you don't want to bring the universe to collapse, you may decide to follow the opposite path: that is, to become the guardians of the galaxy. In fact, when one of these crises emerges, it will be possible to use one's influence in the Galactic Senate to try to obtain special powers from other civilizations capable of making the defense against such powerful opponents more effective. As if becoming a huge federation, the Keeper will be able to control a powerful army funded by all the worlds to oppose the Crisis. As the conflict progresses, you can decide, in full Palpatine style, to obtain more and more powers, to the point of creating a real unified Galactic Empire. A huge and sprawling entity, whose sole purpose is to survive itself, quelling revolts and controlling the outlying kingdoms. Dick Dick Stellaris' new First Contact: Nemesis As we said this new update is related to the new update 3.0, called Dick. Thanks to this update Paradox has changed the first contact system (now similar to that of archaeological remains) giving it a little more variety and depth. The other main change goes to modify the diplomacy system. With the presence of the emissaries, in fact, we will be able to decide whether to use these specialized figures to improve diplomatic relations, ruin them or create a spy network. The latter option allows you to find out the intentions of the opponents, to anticipate their moves or to try to put the sticks trat the wheels of their civilization, destroying the economy or sparking rebellions. All these innovations are not yet as thorough and ~game changer~ as we would have hoped, but they add further possibilities to the very complex space opera of Paradox Development Studio", "date": "2021-05-02", "grade": "9.0"}
