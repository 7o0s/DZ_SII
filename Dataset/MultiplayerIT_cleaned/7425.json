Thanks to a certain shortage of releases and its being among the progenitors of the first wave of free to play to land on the new console, the arrival of the Digital Extremes product on PlayStation 4 was greeted with renewed interest and is now found among the most hot spots of the PlayStation Network showcase, also driven by the fact that it is not necessary to have a Plus account to be able to play it. So let's find out if the title really deserves to be downloaded or if its momentary popularity depends only on favorable contingent factors... I'm coming too! No, Tenno Just to understand what we're talking about, Warframe is a third-person action game focused on cooperative multiplayer in which users take on the role of the so-called Tenno, a sort of space ninja called to resolve a conflict involving different alien races. A setting that turns out to be little more than an excuse to justify a vast series of levels in which you are called to kill everything that comes your way, collecting credits, objects and components and completing simple quests. A certainly not innovative structure which has already been successfully explored by numerous products, and which Digital Extremes has nevertheless not managed to convey with the necessary expertise. In fact, there are many aspects of Warframe that leave you more than perplexed, starting with an incomprehensible choice regarding the tutorials. In the very first stages, the game does its utmost - even in an excessively verbose and redundant way - to explain the basics of the control system to the user, only to then ~forget~ to illustrate all those aspects that would have really deserved a description: therefore, it is necessary discover for yourself some of your Tenno's fundamental abilities, such as running vertically up a wall to reach higher platforms, and worse still there is no support for anything that revolves around mere playful action. Starting with a particularly obscure matchmaking system, which does not allow you to understand who you are playing with, or to evaluate their ping, and which decides in an absolutely arbitrary way whether to let the player enter a session that has already started or a new one. Free is nice, but Warframe has several problems that make it a rather lackluster action game And this is nothing compared to the pitch darkness that hovers around the full-bodied section dedicated to enhancing your character: here you find yourself faced with a really badly designed interface (which doesn't even allow you to view the credits and the components at your disposal , or to compare new pieces of equipment with those in use) through which you literally have to go by trial and error, since the software does not waste even one line of explanation. It's not aerospace engineering, of course, but such a lack of clarity weighs down one of the key components of Warframe's offer. An importance that is not only playful, given that it is from here that the economic transactions that theoretically should bring profit to Digital Extremes pass: the purchases of new objects are in fact regulated by one's own availability of platinum, a currency that can be exchanged for real money through special packages available on the store. However, it is possible to get around this task, provided you submit to a slow grinding process to be implemented by repeating the same levels several times in the hope of running into projects and components useful for forging the desired items in the appropriate forge. Fortunately, the loot that is released from various enemies and chests is shared among all the players participating in the session, clearing the field of any ~Fantozzian~ races to grab the most coveted objects. Robot ninja wizard If Warframe's structure demonstrates more than a few uncertainties, the gameplay is no different, alternating good intuitions with a sometimes really incomplete execution. Putting aside the RPG nuances concerning the collection of objects and the growth of the character, the game can be considered a pure action, whose focus is mainly focused on killing enemies using two distinct firearms, a katana and four special abilities to be activated by swiping your finger on the Dual Shock 4 touchpad. As long as you shoot, things go quite well - even if you have to overlook very limited types of enemies and an artificial intelligence that is sometimes embarrassing - but melee simply does not it works, due to an incompetent camerace to follow the blows and a very approximate detection of collisions. The relative enjoyment of the experience is then put to the test by a banal and uninspired stage design, with repetitions to the bitter end of settings and structures that are practically indistinguishable from each other. A certain lack of variety should actually be a false problem for a title like Warframe, which would be allowed (as happens for many similar titles) to sacrifice the freshness of the action itself in the name of the mechanics linked to the accumulation of objects and experience: a pity that also in this respect the Digital Extremes product does not prove to be particularly knowledgeable, debasing another of its potential strengths. Too slight - when not even imperceptible - are in fact the differences that can be found with the increase of the level of one's own Tenno or with the use of equipment of a higher caliber than the previous one, to the point that you can continue the adventure quite calmly using the basic setup which is provided at the beginning of the game. There are so many ingenuities ringed by Warframe that one almost gets the impression of being faced with a product much older than the seven months that it carries on the back: a technical realization also contributes to fomenting this sensation that everything can be defined as less than next -gen, with barely pleasant graphics accompanied by a dated and not very functional interface and menu design.", "date": "2013-12-06", "grade": "6.0"}
