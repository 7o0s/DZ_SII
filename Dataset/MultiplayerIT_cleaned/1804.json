{"name": "Red Faction II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-faction-ii.html", "text": "You gotta fight, for your right In Red Faction 2, as indeed happened in its predecessor, we will have to free the people from the oppression of a ruthless tyrant, responding to the name of Victor Sopot. As you may have already guessed - after all it is well known that diplomatic practice doesn't marry the buttons and levers of our pad - the best way to subvert the system, in the company of a small group of good terrorists all specialized in the art of war (and here we are again at the title: Red Faction) is the classic rain of fire. This time, however, the action takes place on terrestrial soil, with the mines of the red planet which are now only a memory. Then accompanied by 5 other members of the organization we will be the protagonists of a dozen memorable missions (mind you, the term is understood in the etymological sense) more for the spectacular nature of the firefights than for strategic combat research. The abundant number of weapons and shots available are immediately an indication of the nature of Red Faction II: it will not be necessary to be infallible snipers to complete the game. The control system, moreover, does not seem to have been designed for those who live on bread and First Person Shooters: sadly, flaws in the semi-automatic aiming system are still to be mentioned. However, it should be noted that these are certainly not due to an inadequate assignment of the commands to the various keys: R1 and L1 are respectively entrusted with the primary and secondary fire function (which is particularly congenial to the double Uzi), furthermore it is possible to skip by pressing the dorsal R2, while with L2 you kneel, to go through the tunnels. R3 (i.e. single press of the right analog stick) is responsible for grenades; X is the classic action, while with circle and square you change the weapon, and with the triangle you reload it. The D-pad is assigned various other functions, including night vision. Finally, movement and camera are assigned as usual to the right and left analog sticks, which prove to be inaccurate in fulfilling these functions, so much so that one often opts for real bursts of bullets, so it is difficult to aim. This is a historical defect of the Ps2 FPS, whose famous Dual Shock 2, which is so well suited to fighting games and racing games, would seem inadequate for this category. Volition demonstrates an understanding of these problems, and attempts to come up with two solutions, which provide an acceptable compromise. First of all, Red Faction II reveals itself to be very generous with the player: practically every enemy eliminated, in fact, drops some gifts (from ammunition to the inevitable medical kit); it is easy to understand that remaining without equipment will therefore be quite a difficult undertaking, despite the abundance of ammunition to be used for the defects mentioned. Furthermore, the possibility of using the mouse has been implemented, which however is vaguely slow in responding to commands. The enemies do not stand out for their artificial intelligence refinement, although they will not hesitate to take cover from your attacks behind walls or vehicles present in the scene. This does not mean that the game is too easy: some enemies will only need 3 hits to eliminate us completely and lead us to game over. Speed and promptness are therefore the two main qualities required of the player to complete the single player mode, governed by a solid and engaging plot (although the dialogues have not been translated). What made Red Faction special were mainly two features: the Geo Mod and the ability to use vehicles (later re-presented in a certain Halo); well, these have been promoted and re-proposed in the second chapter. For those who have never heard of the first chapter, it is necessary to explain the nature of the Geo Mod: it is the possibility of having direct feedback of one's fire activity on some static elements of the levels. In simple terms it is possible, by shooting, to ~make holes~ or destroy some walls. This allows both to actively modify the battlefield, at least partially encouraging the strategic component, and to create a passage to be able to change the playing area. The Geo Mod is certainly not enough to make Red Faction II an exploratory FPS, but it certainly constitutes a good diversion to break the linearity of this category of games at least apparently. The presence of the Geo Mod in this second chapter continues up to the last levels, while in the prequel, about halfway through the initials mode, it had mysteriously disappeared. The vehicles also return, but they are not always fully controllable by the player, who often only has to perform a sort of target practice on a mobile platform. The absolute novelty is invece the multiplayer mode, which takes advantage of the loved / hated split screen mode, which allows, with a multitap socket, 4 players to challenge each other simultaneously in classic game modes such as deathmatch or capture the flag, but also some completely new and original. The longevity of the title would be poor if only the story mode were present, but with the possibility of playing in multiplayer this is to be considered on good levels. Even the eye wants its part The Volition title is certainly not one that makes you cry out for its cosmetics, which is presented on sufficient levels by virtue of discrete polygonal models, as well as for the light effects, while the textures sometimes leave something to be desired , without however reaching the (negative) excesses of the aforementioned First Generation titles. On the other hand there is a frame rate which, although it ~only~ settles on 30 frames per second, practically never presents uncertainties, so much so that the game always maintains good speed levels, such as to practically not regret the 60 fps , usually indispensable in first-person shooters. Furthermore, the possibility of ~destroying~ the walls is undoubtedly satisfied also from a purely visual point of view. The design (both of the characters and of the levels) is evidently inspired by the ~classics~ of the genre (the links and references, more or less desired, to Unreal and Unreal Tournament are quite evident). The sound is well made (explosions are excellent), although the Italian dubbing of the dialogues and the support in the digital audio cut scenes are missing. Comment Red Faction II is, as already pointed out, a fairly linear evolution of the good ideas and premises expressed in the prequel. The implementation of the multiplayer mode and the refinement of the Geo Mod make a formula already worthy of praise more complete. Perhaps it will not be very suitable for purists, but Red Faction II is still a much more than discreet Fps, frenetic and spectacular. Too bad for the imprecise analog sticks (of which, however, Red Faction II is not the only exponent to suffer) and the vaguely anonymous graphics sector. Pro +Geo Mod +Multiplayer Mode +Engaging Storyline (~Vive la revolution~) Cons - Subdued technical sector - Non-infinite story mode - Inaccurate aim In the unfortunate (at least according to the common opinion) ranks of the first generation Ps2, Red Faction had left us a good memory, a first-person shooter certainly not without defects, but which, thanks to an innovative game mechanic, stood up to listed opponents such as Quake III, Unreal Tournament and Timesplitters itself, devoted mainly to multiplayer and consequently ~opposite~ to Volition's work. And now, after about a year and a half, Red Faction returns and reveals itself as an ideal evolution of its predecessor: it's time to fight the oppressor again.", "date": "2003-01-16", "grade": null}
