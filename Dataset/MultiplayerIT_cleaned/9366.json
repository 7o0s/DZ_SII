As if that weren't enough, from up there he meets his girlfriend Jennifer Parker, who however is no longer the same as before her: dyed hair, metalhead clothing and, above all, single. Tired of boring Marty McFly, she decided to leave him. This is only the first of the unpleasant surprises that await Marty in his new present. The Hill Valley of 1986 to which he returned in fact, has become an Orwellian fortress city, full of cameras, rules and discipline. All at the behest of the mysterious Citizen Brown, an evil version of good old Doc, who got married to Edna Strickland for the occasion. Many other things still are out of place in this alternate present, and it will obviously be up to us to put them right. Back to the Future Episode 3: Citizen Brown is the central episode of the series, and does a good job of picking up on what has happened so far, creating a scenario that fuels the fire for the two final chapters. Christopher Lloyd is at his best acting and, except for a few supporting characters, all others are voiced as always excellent. Among many well-known faces, who are starting to lose some of their energy, the only new one is Jennifer Parker, the real star of this episode. But director and introductory notes aside, Citizen Brown is the worst episode released so far. At least if we want to consider it as a video game, which is not easy, because its reason for existing is the relationship with the Back to the Future films and the desire to look like an animated short. Let's see anyway why it depressed us so much. Press a key to continue The city, however different in appearance, always offers the same, few locations. The final part of the game is an exception, when we enter Citizen Brown's mansion. As we have said, the supporting actors all make their return to the scene, but for some it has even taken a step backwards. The prime example is Biff, now reduced to a Citizen Brown-fearing nice guy. If Jennifer blows a wind of novelty, everything else is just boredom and dj vu. The game mechanics have obviously not changed one iota: very few puzzles and trivial, as if they were the interface of a DVD player. We click the mouse and the film proceeds. It is no coincidence that there are still endless lines of dialogue, talkative explanations and constant encounters between Marty and the other characters. On the other hand, the plot must continue, enrich itself and lay the foundations for parallel stories in view of the grand finale; it doesn't matter if the player is reduced to a mere spectator most of the time. Of course, if you are an avid fan of Back to the Future you will appreciate Citizen Brown as an authentic and heartfelt homage to the original films. But if for a moment you stop to think of yourself as a simple gamer, you can't help but wonder what's going through the Telltales' heads. We are also waiting for the final episodes, but for superstition we keep to ourselves any confident word on the immediate future of this series. In Italy we call it ~Back to the Future~!
