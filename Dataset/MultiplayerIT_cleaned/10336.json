He does not kill his own victims himself but induces them to take their own lives or in any case not to survive the diabolical traps that he has previously devised. Usually these are people who have lost everything, but above all they no longer have the will to live: Jigsaw, terminally ill and close to death, knows this well. The complicated plot, the puzzles and the dark and gruesome settings could not fail to inspire a horror video game worthy of such a famous and successful series: let's enter the Riddler's trap in SAW! I want to play a game with you.. To take care of the digital transposition of the film is the American software house Zombie, even if the game is published and distributed directly by Konami (which understands horror). The Seattle-based studio's backgroud boasts numerous war titles on PC and a few home console visits with minor titles and Saw is by far their flagship title. The starting point that the various films offer is an excellent point on which to rely and be inspired: the countless fans of the series want tension, a clautrophobic atmosphere and terrifying puzzles. Somehow, we can immediately say that the main task has been accomplished: these three elements are all well present in the video game too, even if it is the realization that leaves the biggest doubts. We take on the role of detective Tapp, on the trail of Jigsaw, and firsthand we have to face countless traps and riddles scattered by the dying old madman. As in the movies, the pitfalls are very diversified, there is to rummage in the midst of heaps of syringes, dissecting corpses, defusing bombs, fighting against other participants in the ~game~ of Jigsaw. The plot allows for any kind of cynical fantasy. Some puzzles are well thought out and their solution gives a lot of satisfaction, while others are perplexing in terms of modality and realization. This is the case of one of the very first ones, where by reading a series of numbers on the mirror, the wrong digit to insert in the padlock is displayed: we went ahead only after countless random attempts. The fights aren't very satisfying either, as there's no physics whatsoever, collisions with objects or the room, not to mention the variety in the moves. The plot is linear, thanks also to a level design that leaves no room for surprises but ~guides~ the player from one room to another, through endless and apparently all very similar corridors, so much so that in the end it is difficult to get lost in the darkness of Saw . The game has tones that rapidly turn towards clear and decisive light and often you can only go on by light of a lighter, holding it in your left hand and walking through the rooms inch by inch. The feeling of tension and fear is amplified by an excellent audio that often manages to intimidate and frighten, and the fabulous acting of the protagonists is not second to the cinematic film (too bad, or fortunately, it's all in English with Italian subtitles). In Jigsaw's trap Where horror video games have decidedly jumped on purely shooter (Resident Evil) or science fiction (Dead Space) structures, here is Saw back on the tracks of ~classic~ fear, the one to which Silent Hill or Project Zero have always accustomed us. Tracing the structure of a splatter-torture film, Saw puts a great atmosphere on the game board with a setting designed to impress on the players' minds a psychological pressure not common in video games: all the clichs of the case are present, which despite being well known they always have their effect with dark rooms, candles, sudden noises, mannequins, streaks of blood everywhere, doors that suddenly close. All the right ingredients to keep your breath in suspense for a while. The game's puzzles are a sort of ~Greatest Hits~ from the movies but unfortunately, all the chapters released fail to offer enough action to not make the game repetitive after a few hours. The room-trap-room structure becomes mechanical right away with little else to do, in Saw. The developers, obviously aware of this flaw, have tried to give the players some more ~worry~ since our body holds a key that can save the lives of some of the people locked up in the structure where you are, and often and we gladly have to deal with it by fighting against it. As already mentioned, it is precisely in this section that the game expires, due to unresponsive commands and zero interaction. In addition to the fights, we have to every now and thenperform small ~quick time events~, pressing a series of buttons in the right sequence and with the correct timing, on pain of instant death. Playstation 3 trophies Saw offers the player 47 trophies. The progression with which they are unlocked is linear and constant: they will all be obtained by finishing the game. Most of them, in fact, do not require particularly demanding actions but the unfolding of events will allow us to obtain them automatically. 11 of them are secret, and are related to the rescue of various hostages held incommunicado by the evil Jigsaw. Live or die? There are two types of puzzles, and they must be solved with completely different game mechanics. The former start a sort of ~mini-game~ in which, through the use of the keys and the analog, we have to perform a specific action (for example, recover an object inside a corpse). The latter, on the other hand, are of an environmental type, because they presuppose the study of the surrounding space and the activation (often deactivation) of specific devices. The realization of the mini-games is quite approximate from a gameplay point of view, they are very simple and automatic. The latter are better, because they are able to stimulate the neurons more and consequently provide greater satisfaction once solved. The technical realization is questionable, saving, as already mentioned, the general atmosphere (excellent), and with the darkness that conveniently comes to cover the technical flaws of textures and shaders a bit rough, despite the use of the Unreal Engine .", "date": "2009-12-04", "grade": "6.2"}
