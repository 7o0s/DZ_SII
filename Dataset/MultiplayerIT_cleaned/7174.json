It is a roguelike title with a space setting that caused quite a stir not only for its remarkable qualities confirmed by our review, but also for the enormous success achieved by funding the project via Kickstarter: compared to the expected 10,000 dollars, the guys from Subset Games managed to bring home over 200,000 dollars, so as to be able to put into practice the idea they had in mind in the best way. A very good idea, evidently, because FTL has become a true little classic of the indie scene; simultaneously with the release of the free Advanced Edition expansion for computers, the eagerly awaited version for iPad was also published on the App Store, which includes the contents of the aforementioned add-on. All this for the more than fair price of 8.99. FTL on iPad has nothing to envy to the PC version Faster than light But why has FTL managed to attract all this attention to itself? In addition to the necessary coincidence of lucky factors, the main reason - and the one that interests us most - is that it is a really good video game. The setting, as already mentioned, is science fiction, in the most classic sense of the term: therefore intergalactic wars, space ships, planets, pirates, aliens, improbable creatures, laser beams and so on. And just one of these shuttles is the absolute protagonist of FTL, as well as one's travel companion with whom to share victories, successes, dramas and, very often, death. In fact, as the rigid dictates of the roguelike genre impose, also in this case the game over is a definitive, unrecoverable event, from which one can redeem oneself only by starting a new game from scratch; an element intended to add drama and pathos to the adventure during which every step, every jump into hyperspace could be the last. The concept is quite simple, as is the task assigned to the player: in short, it is a question of being able to reach the eighth sector to warn the Federation of the imminent attack by the Rebels. The journey is intended to be accomplished by passing from one node to another on the map which develops with a kind of tree diagram, therefore full of crossroads and choices regarding the ~road~ to take to reach the exit of each sector. Each node brings with it an event: only very rarely will we find ourselves in an empty area, in transit. Much more often there may be an enemy shuttle, or a request for help, or a planet to explore or whatever, thanks to a truly remarkable variety of situations. Virtually everything is described through short text screens, thus leaving the possibility of filling the events with images to the player's imagination; this is because FTL is instead totally focused in its gameplay on the purely management phase of its ship and the fights, thus reducing any digression to a minimum. And the minimalist approach is also confirmed by the graphic component, which certainly leaves no room for fireworks; indeed, on the screen the only omnipresent thing is precisely the shuttle, seen from above in section, so as to allow you to always keep under control and therefore manage the various rooms and the crew. A fundamental part of the experience is precisely that of maintaining all the systems present on the galactic medium in function, and of preserving the life of the men inside it. And the administration of resources is also very important, starting from those fundamental for the survival of the ship up to the use of funds - which are never enough - to improve some elements, add new ones, expand the offensive and defensive capabilities or simply repair the damaged hull. The contents of the Advanced Edition expansion, which can be activated at will from the initial menu, also bring a significant amount of elements that add further complexity to the experience, for the pleasure of veterans: new systems for the shuttle, weapons, an alien race, events from tackle on the map and so on. Finally, as regards the adaptation to the touch screen, the work done by Subset Games is truly commendable, making this edition for the iPad even preferable in some ways: in fact, the interface is perfectly manageable through touches and swipes, and the small changes made they have proved to be perfect for solving the (few) contingent problems.", "date": "2014-04-21", "grade": "8.0"}
