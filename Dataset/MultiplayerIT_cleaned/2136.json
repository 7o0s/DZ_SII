The Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning review was useful for bringing back to everyone's memory the intrinsic qualities of a damned unfortunate title. Released way back in 2012, the fantasy action RPG now also lands in its version for Nintendo Switch, complete with all the old additional content and ready to welcome a brand new expansion, expected by 2021. those who want to recover a pearl of the past, or simply can't do without your portable Faeland, this review of Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning for Switch is the one for you. The Hero's Journey Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning: the beauty of Faeland If your need is to deepen every single narrative and gameplay aspect, we would like to refer you to the review of the original, necessarily more complete and in-depth. However, wanting to give a collocation to the plot, what we can say is that we find ourselves in the role of a being who has returned from the dead, the first who has fully succeeded in this enterprise, and our goal will be to shed light on the events that have to do with the world of Faelandia and above all on our destiny, central to the whole narrative. Our inscrutable nature is such that not even the seers are able to read the future that awaits us and this translates in a playful way into the possibility of choosing a multitude of different paths from the point of view of specialization, some available immediately, others unlocked only with time. Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning: the strength of skills The initial editor, which allows us to choose race and aesthetic traits, is quite narrow, strongly clashing with the extreme depth of almost every other aspect. And it is precisely through the personalization and freedom to continue our journey that the hero's journey is outlined throughout and throughout. To be honest, it should unfortunately be pointed out that the failure of the development studio and the impossibility of working on the MMORPG which should have been the background to the whole story, represent the triggering causes of a series of important lacks of lore. At the same time the world of Kindoms of Amalur is so dense and full of details, writings and dialogues that there is really a lot of irons in the fire to satisfy for all palates. This aspect also brings negative sides: the most important of which is the swing in writing. Where the main quest is still enjoyable and interesting, albeit in its linearity, the same cannot be said of the secondary ones, probably daughters of that basic MMO setting that fills the world with hundreds of quests with almost no substance. The pride of the action rpg Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning: the combat system is superfine If the MMO soul just mentioned limits some narrative aspects of the single player experience, the same cannot be said of the combat system, still among the best of its kind today. Together with Dragon's Dogma it probably represents the best expression of western action rpg, with a quantity of fighting styles, types of weapons, combos and skills that could make anyone pale. The strongly action vein obviously distances it from the classic RPG as well as from the MMO itself, but it is capable of giving truly satisfying fights, as well as never getting bored thanks to the possibility of constantly changing the approach. Whether you use a sword, a stick, a hammer or even a bow from a distance, Kingdoms of Amalur will know how to repay you, even net of a difficulty that is unfortunately still too elementary today. Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning: The setting has its charm In this respect THQ has tried to take cover compared to the first outing which had almost everything wrong as regards the balance. Where the various dungeons fixed their level on the basis of that of the player at the time of the first access - effectively destroying the progression - now each area returns to level each time we access, allowing a more satisfying degree of challenge and even better loot. Pushing the bar even higher, the guys from THQ have also included a Very Difficult mode. This, however, to be honest, did not convince us much. It almost seems that the work has limited itself to raising the parameters of everything that moves on the screen a little, without thinking about the balance of the various situations. The world is still overwhelming today from the point of view of extension, even if it is less striking than at the time of its release. Despite this the variety in the environments, hereThe number of crazy dialogues and the different ways forward make it an experience capable of lasting dozens and dozens of hours, even reaching the three digits quite easily. Amalur on Nintendo Switch Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning: The fauna is colorful It took several months to port to the Nintendo Switch. We cannot deny that even today we are surprised to see this type of title run on a laptop, even net of the presence of the cloud which has cleared the mobile experience and a work that certainly does not cry out for a miracle from the technical aspect. It would be unfair if we said that the game runs at the same level as the PC version, but it is also true that in recent months we have been accustomed to Switch ports that border on the embarrassing. Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning instead defends itself, predictably sinning where the PC version also sinned. From a technical point of view, in fact, the game remains almost identical, significantly increasing the visual horizon, but touching almost zero textures and models. It is true that the style - very close to a World of Warcraft - still allows you to digest a certain technical backwardness. At the same time, as we already said months ago, an operation closer to the one done with the Destroy All Humans remake would certainly have been more appreciated. We realize that the latter overall represents a much more contained overall experience and this is probably the aspect that stopped THQ from thinking about making a real remake. From the point of view of fluidity, even if the game loses something in the docked version, remains more than enjoyable in the portable version, suffering however many in the exhausting, dearths. This last aspect is really frustrating, also and above all given the amount of deadlock situations, present at each change of area, but also only when entering any inn.", "date": "2021-03-15", "grade": "8.0"}
