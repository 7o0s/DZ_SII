{"name": "Sigil", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sigil-ultimo-livello-romero.html", "text": "Sigil is above all the image of a middle-aged man in front of his computer who, prey to nostalgia, decides to continue dreaming by getting back to doing what made him great. Texture after texture, his mind is filled with the echo of those days, made up of a group of brilliant and close-knit guys who are about to launch one of the most revolutionary video games ever; of the smell of french fries and hamburgers eaten during long days of play and work and the noise of the dice being used for their favorite paper RPGs. Lots of laughs, a few disagreements and then the hours spent in front of CRT monitors to put together a work that was both technological avant-garde and pure adolescent outburst, brutality and innocence, spontaneity and control, genius and anarchy. Replaying the original DOOM today has a strange effect: it seems like being in front of a naive picture, despite the fact that the violence of the contents is always very high (although dampened by technological obsolescence). It worked and still works, despite its immense anachronisms, because it is the result of an almost surrealist creative process, which seamlessly combines science fiction and fantasy in a vivid and dynamic fresco, with a peculiar composition and, moreover, a unique sense. After all, it's about fighting Satan on Mars, which already makes you smile on your own. I wonder if John Romero developing Sigil, essentially an apocryphal episode of the first DOOM made under the pressure of the fans, has ever developed the desire to call John Carmack, Tom Hall and Adrian Carmack to tell them that he is still that guy there, the one who invented the names of monsters inspired by their D&D sessions and who titled the game that ruined it after the most powerful weapon their characters had ever wielded. What is Sigil Sigil is not a real game, but a free mod for the first DOOM of 1993 by id Software, intended as the fifth apocryphal episode of the game made by the original author. In short, it is a pack of levels. To play it therefore, you need to have an original copy of DOOM from which to extract the DOOM.WAD file to be used to configure software such as GZDoom. Play it again, John Sigil exudes melancholy from every pixel. The main artwork itself seems to be from another era, filled as it is with billy goats, skulls and pentacles, composed in such a way as to recall the metal records of the late 80s. It seems as if it was developed in a place out of time, by someone who has stood staring into space for almost thirty years. Everything pretends to be as it was then: from the labyrinthine design of the levels, to the rooms full of enemies, to the gory decorations scattered here and there. Romero himself invited Sigil to play as if we were in 1993, i.e. without the mouselook and with the movement controls left mapped on the directional arrows. From this point of view it cannot be said that Sigil does not work, but honestly the impression is that of a black mass organized by a luxury hotel to entertain Japanese tourists. In short, overall Sigil offers excellent levels designed with great creativity, but in many ways it seems to be out of time to have something to say to a world of video games that has since profoundly changed (who knows if for the better or for the worse). However, it is probable that he does not really pretend to say anything. We are faced with the classic tree that falls in the forest on the turtle that was crossing the finish line before the rabbit that came out of the cave. After all, already dragging the icon of the .wad file onto the GZDoom executable for the first time, one thinks that after all, thousands of mods for DOOM have come out over the years, some decidedly more interesting than Sigil himself in their profound reshaping the stuff DOOM is made of, to make something else out of it. In short, as it is, Sigil is a pack of levels like many others, interesting only because it is signed by John Romero. Recommending it or not recommending it is indifferent, since it is completely free. It certainly won't change your life, but if you have continued to follow the DOOM scene to date it is undeniable that it could interest you. Sigil is exactly what it seems and no longer wants to be. It is Romero imitating Romero for his inconsolable fans. Giving him a vote wouldn't make much sense, since we're basically talking about a mod... and basically it would be like re-evaluating DOOM with modern eyes, since the game elements remain the same, a very childish and conceptually wrong operation. Honestly it is also difficult to say if Sigil can be a relaunch for the good John, or if it is just the umpteenth plaque to celebrate an era that will never return, despitebe regretted by many. In any case, we are curious to see if it will be successful or not, to understand how big the nostalgia market actually is.", "date": "2019-05-31", "grade": null}
