{"name": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/return-to-castle-wolfenstein-enemy-territory.html", "text": "Enemy Territory, that is, ~pumped~ RTCW. Kevin Cloud of id software, in a recent interview, defined that Enemy Territory is ~basically~ a new game. Mind you, it's always RTCW, but its ~evolutionary transmutation~, denoted by the enhancement of the classes - now with real experience skills - and by the game interface finally suited to a title of this kind, has revitalized the ~old man~ , making it mature towards another type of gameplay... more from ~team-working~, to understand. In ET is the much coveted 'battleship style' tactical map, with references to Excel. The classes have now become five, and they wink at the Commandos series. And just to do no one wrong, we also throw in a pinch of RTS, with a couple of buildings to set up in the field. Let's add two good war campaigns, of three missions each, a few more weapons and we have our ET as a result. But let's analyze it in depth... Forgive me or pass... Stand-alone, completely free, isn't there a flaw? Well, ET cannot be integrated with RTCW, and this means that all old maps remain the latter's prerogative. If you are going to play the ~old~ missions, then you must play the ~old~ rtcw. However the fans are working hard and after the release of the new map editor, they started the ~conversion~ period, which we assume will begin to bear fruit in a few months, just long enough to get used to the new map editor. editing. After the brief mention above of the character classes, let's see specifically what has changed, starting from what hasn't changed: the soldier has remained practically the usual ~rambo~ of the situation, the only one capable of carrying the heavier paraphernalia (flamethrower and Venom minigun) and the doctor has remained identical to the past (in my opinion he is the character who gets banged the most in games: he grinds km and km in the maps for players who call him for scratches and scrapes on his knee!) . The engineer now carries anti-personnel mines as well as dynamite. Once deposited, the unsuspecting and incautious player who should happen upon it and be lucky enough (?) to hear the classic ~click~ will have to stand still and call an engineer to defuse it: the slightest movement and ... booom! The chunks of meat would scatter all over the map! Furthermore, triggered anti-personnel mines are invisible to opponents, unless there is a ~scout~ (Covert Ops) to analyze the terrain through binoculars. Furthermore, the engineer remains the only one capable of building/repairing bridges, defense posts, command posts (*), etc... The lieutenant has changed his name to Field Ops and commands the classic Air-strikes through binoculars or smoke bomb. It is also the official ammunition supplier of the situation. Dulcis in fundo the covert ops, which seems taken verbatim from commandos: it can in fact steal a uniform from an enemy corpse and sneak into their lines undisturbed. Obviously the cover falls and he is ~caught~ as he holds his weapons and fires. It is the covert Ops that carries the Satchel charges: they are explosive backpacks that can be detonated remotely via a radio remote control with two colored lights: if the green light flashes it means that the backpack is within radio coverage and can be detonated, otherwise it flashes the red, which indicates the opposite case. (*) Command posts only serve to speed up the power bar regeneration speed of some player classes. For example that of regeneration of dynamite for engineers, medicine for doctors, air-strikes and ammunition for field ops, etc... Experience only accumulates over time. ET is one of the few FPS, if not the only one, to have so well added an automatic experience points system, in some ways perfect. I can't give you a complete list of the points accumulation procedure (for this aspect there is the excellent html manual included in the game folder) but suffice it to say that Splash Damage did a great job, even adding rank advancements (from private to general), a medal award system and comprehensive endgame statistics, which crown it all and elevate the FPS title to ET with the best ~integrated~ scoring system ever created. The two general skills, common to all classes are: Light Weapons (light weapons) and Battle Sense (sense of battle). The first is self-explanatory, considering that all classes are capable of using them, while the second skill is given by the player's ability to stay ~alive~ for as long as possible. Recall that each skill can have a maximumfour points and that those relating to the other classes are: Heavy Weapons (soldier), First Aid (Medic), Engineering (Engineer), Signals (Field Ops) Covert Operations (Covert Ops). I'm going to live in the country... with a rifle and hand grenades! The game's two default campaigns are set in Europe and North Africa. Let's start with the missions of our old continent: in Wurzburg Radar we have to, as Allies, steal the components of the two satellite dishes located in the middle of the enemy sector, and transport them in a truck adjacent to the entrance. The Krauts, of course, must prevent allies from grabbing material. The action takes place at night, with a light mist and pouring rain, including thunder and lightning! In the next mission, Fuel Dump, the allies must penetrate the enemy camp with the help of a tank (!), giving vent to their most extreme viuuulence, to demolish the pumping system of the fuel depot. Obviously, in order to hinder the tank, the Krauts must equip themselves with bazookas, mines and satchel charges, considering that light blows tickle the armor of the vehicle. The map is beautiful and long, with the cart passing over bridges (to be set up) and under a maze of underground tunnels, in order to get to the destination. In the third and final mission of the European campaign, Rail Gun, this time the Krauts take the active part: they must, with the help of two locomotives, transport two cases of ammunition to the mega galactic cannon placed on the rails, at the end of the station. Obviously the Allies must prevent the cannon from firing, detonating its ~control room~. The map is gorgeous and the machine-gun fire exchanged aboard the moving locomotives is a nice touch, with stray bullets hitting the ground, kicking up snow sprays! The first mission of the African campaign starts from Siegfried's legendary German mega-cannons, in defense of the north-western African part overlooking the Mediterranean. It starts with the landing of the allies on a strip of beach close to the bunkers. Of course, the Krauts must prevent their opponents from penetrating the base and blowing up the cannons. In some ways similar to the mythical ~beach invasion~ of RTCW. In the second mission, the allies must penetrate the southern area of the Siwa oasis and blow up the anti-tank guns located at the opposite end of the enemy base. There is a double path, one of which consists of a tunnel immersed in water: the allies must set up a pumping system that drains the water and makes the tunnel passable for the passage of troops. The workmanship of the base is beautiful, set in a typical fortified North African village. In the third and final mission the allies have to repair and steal a Kraut tank, with it go to the center of the city, make a hole in the bank door (with the cannon of the armored vehicle) and take the gold contained therein and deposit it in a truck in front of the entrance, to then make the return journey with the new vehicle and flee richer than before (hopefully). Obviously the Krauts aren't there to make nice figurines and will do anything to keep all the gold... for them! Therefore the allies will do well to expect bazookates, landmines, bags of explosives and various spits from balconies... To conclude the campaigns they can also be played in single missions (Objective Mode) and in other modes (Last Man Standing, StopWatch Mode) , but the only one that guarantees the growth of skills and the acquisition of medals remains the one in the complete campaign (campaign mode). In conclusion. ET could have been a great game in its complete version, which was planned at the time and unfortunately remained only on paper. The partial ET in multiplaying, released for free and generously by Activision, in any case, is the most suitable successor for the die-hard fans of RTCW: even if there are currently only six ~official~ maps, the most talented mappators are preparing them other. In a few months, the current number will more than triple, so in this respect there is nothing to worry about. Furthermore, ET is a little ~heavier~ to manage than its predecessor, thanks to the increase in detail of the characters and the ~large~ size of the maps. So a slight tweaking on the computer should only be done if RTCW was ~struggling~ even previously. What else to say, if not to download it as soon as possible and play it, completely immersing yourself in the excellent missions proposed, which make it close to an interactive action film! Playing ET, in fact, you can almost feel a feeling of ~fought~ war that few titles, with a similar plot, are able to express. The sense of immersion is absolute, aAlso thanks to the different roles that the players can interpret, who will have to assist their forces and complement each other: a soldier with a mortar is useless if he doesn't have a lieutenant to signal him the target to hit. An engineer, while repairing or building a bridge, needs someone to watch his back, just as a tank must be escorted along the way by a handful of soldiers ready for anything, to support it in the most frantic actions. The maps have a perfectly studied design for those who love tactics: the ~hit, take and run~ assaults will be combined with the choice of the different practicable routes, forcing the two factions to split into subgroups to better counter enemy incursions or ambushes on several fronts. Sometimes the matches will be so intriguing as to leave you breathless: the battlefield will soon be littered with wounded assisted by doctors, lieutenants who order and deploy forces, while using air support as cover, thus unleashing an apocalyptic hell, surrounded by the flames of the rifles to illuminate rainy nights... the muddy ground will be shaken by the deafening roar of the bombs, while, among the mangled remains of the corpses, you will find yourself zigzagging surrounded by the hiss of stray bullets, which will embroider towards the sky dense textures of tracer trails... the endless clashes will be counted in spades, while the war cries of the two factions will echo intoned by the deadly chant of the mighty machine guns! In conclusion. P.S.: This article marks my return to the ranks of reviewers, after a ~sentimental~ period that completely turned my life upside down... and still is even more! I dedicate this review to Anna ~Vodka/Eastwood~. Pros: Excellent graphics Intoxicating ~war~ atmosphere Team-working gameplay set to the highest levels Cons: Only two campaigns, with few maps No integrated voice chat More demanding hardware requirements than the predecessor Premise Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a title that has enjoyed considerable success, both in single and in multiplayer. In the latter category, his ~objectives~ style of play was undoubtedly his trump card, which combined with fluid and refined graphics, has benefited from solid gameplaying, to which is added the subdivision into class of players. Do you want to be an ER doctor, walking around with the syringe to stick on the buttocks of the wounded? In RTCW you can do it! Do you want to be a quastation engineer who carries two kilos of dynamite to blow up the door of the much hated school? In RTCW you do! Do you want to give vent to your thirst for a sadistic assassin, by ordering a carpet bombing, by simply aiming binoculars or launching a smoke bomb? As above, in RTCW all this ~yes is possible~. Of course, the flaws in the game were not lacking, because the tactical management/administrative side was far too limited, and orienting oneself and dictating orders to the ~newbies~, in those labyrinthine levels, where the objectives are many and scattered, was a real torment! The ~visual~ reference was missing, ergo a nice ~map~, where the objectives and the salient areas had to be properly marked. Then, after months of spasmodic requests from the fans, id Software paired with Splash Damage had finally given the ~sacred~ answer, enchanting all the players' wishes into a single and optimistic project: the preparation had begun by RTCW - Enemy Territory, which was supposed to promise the classic moon but limited itself to offering us, even if for free, a piece of sky, tinged with swastikas and Stars & Stripes flags. Yes, the game on paper was so promising technically, that the programmers realized, perhaps a little late, that the project was going over budget and that the AI of the bots, central to the title, was complicated beyond measure. Result? Activision stopped production and made what had been created up to then ~free~, releasing a ~complete~ title, worthy of being taken into consideration thanks to its ~innovative~ (so to speak) technical additions , which filled the gaps of the predecessor.", "date": "2003-09-09", "grade": null}
