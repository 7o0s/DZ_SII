Perhaps not as advertised as any Final Fantasy, the Atlus brand has built up a loyal group of fans over the years, above all thanks to the parallel series, now better known than the main one, subtitled Persona. Persona 3, in particular, was the turning point in a series that has always dealt with bizarre themes with decidedly unusual gameplay. There's a reason Persona 4, 2008, is considered one of the best jRPGs for PlayStation 2, if not the best. The decision to bring it back on PlayStation Vita, on the other hand, is not accidental: last year this iteration in particular was revitalized by the sequel Persona 4: Arena for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, a splendid fighting game unfortunately still unreleased in Europe, developed by Arc System Works of Blazblue and Guilty Gear, and from the faithful animated series of the same name in twenty-six episodes. Defining porting Persona 4: Golden, however, is absolutely reductive. Find out with us why. On the edge of reality The plot of Persona 4: Golden is decidedly complex, as it combines various narrative strands with great fluidity to form a general picture of surprising organicity. The protagonist (whom the game allows you to name at will, but who we will call Yu Narukami as decided by Atlus in the animated series and in the sequel Persona 4: Arena) moves for a year to Inaba, a quiet Japanese village, as a guest of his uncle, a busy widowed detective with a dependent child. Yu starts attending the local high school, makes friends with his classmates and learns about the infamous Midnight Channel, a television network that is said to show rather strange things. Soon, Yu and his friends discover that through the TV it is even possible to enter this parallel world, where nightmarish creatures roam that arise from the deepest doubts, fears and secrets of those who visit this dimension. Somehow, Yu and his friends will be able to tame their ~dark side~, acquiring the ability to materialize a sort of protective spirit called Persona (and whoever reads JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by mangaka Hiroiko Araki will already have quite clear ideas) . Does this seem absurd to you so far? You have seen nothing, because a few days later Inaba is shocked by a series of disturbing crimes, and Yu and his companions understand that the serial killer in question is using the Midnight Channel to carry out his crimes. The only ones able to explore and fight in the parallel world, our heroes decide to investigate the matter in an attempt to catch the culprit. In practice, we have only described the incipit: the story of Persona 4: Golden takes place over twelve months, day after day, following Yu's daily life: school lessons, meetings with friends, parties and moments of free time. From week to week, more and more characters and elements are added to the story: the quality of the script is excellent, and a myriad of red herrings make the plot more and more exciting and engaging. At some point you find yourself distrusting everything and everyone, until you reach a breathtaking triple epilogue, complete with a bonus ending for those who were skilled enough to lead the story, and improve the characters, as appropriate. Because between one crime and another, there are also other things to do... Daily life As we said at the beginning, Persona 3 and Persona 4 are particularly famous for their unusual structure. The game follows the protagonist's day-to-day life, leaving plenty of room for the player's decisions. After school, do I want to work a part-time job to earn some yen, or do I prefer to hang out with my classmate Yosuke? Am I practicing basketball with the school club next Tuesday, or am I going shopping downtown? I could go out with the beautiful Yukiko on Sunday, but what would Chie say? What if I stayed home to study instead? And tonight, instead of going straight to sleep, why don't I read a good book first? Every day offers a myriad of options of this kind, determined by the choices made by the player, by his friends or clubs, by his social statistics; and each activity increases in some way, for example, his diligence or his courage, further expanding the possibilities offered. Not surprisingly, once completed, Persona 4: Golden allows you to replay in New Game Plus mode to perhaps follow a completely different path. The interaction with the many supporting actors, then, plays a fundamental role: each of them corresponds to a so-called Social Link, a degree of confidelity essentially, which determines the power of the relative tarot arcanum and, therefore, of all the personas that belong to that category. Developing Social Links, therefore, enhances our Personas, unlocks new spells and abilities or further game options. Social Links are also real subplots, often very elaborate, which explore the history of the characters involved: in this way even the nice head of the basketball team or the best actress in the theater club take on a considerable thickness. This type of structure, mind you, translates into a considerable amount of non-interactive cutscenes in which we will have to read a lot of text (strictly in English, mind you) and occasionally select an option: this version for PlayStation Vita allows you to speed up or directly skip the narrative sequences; doing so would be a great pity, but it seems appropriate to point out this feature. Having said that, the ~social~ component of Persona 4: Golden is only part of the story: it is in the dungeons that the game gets really tough. Online! Persona 4: Golden exploits the online features of PlayStation Vita in an unfortunately very limited way. In reality, it only allows us to know what random players have done, or to send some sort of SOS to receive some bonus during the fights. Very little, but it was worth mentioning. Of men and Person Instead of hanging out with friends or behaving like a normal 16-year-old, Yu could decide to hang out in the various dungeons that unlock as the story progresses. Most must necessarily be completed by a certain date in order to continue the story, but they are still open to exploration on days when you prefer to wander around these mazes with a randomly generated floor plan rather than doing anything else. It is therefore necessary to study the calendar to plan the development of our heroes, balancing both activities. Fortunately, once you enter the dungeon you can stay as long as you want, or as long as you can restore health and magic points, opening the various chests in search of objects and defeating enemies to level up, upgrading characters and related Personas. The protagonist Yu, however, can ~equip~ different Personas, unlike his allies, and in the so-called Velvet Room it is possible to merge the Personas together, producing new and more powerful ones that inherit the statistics and magic of the original ones. The fights begin when our character comes into contact with the polygonal model of a Shadow: at that point the screen changes, proposing the typical jRPG structure, with the group of enemies and the player's party. The difficulty level of Persona 4: Golden (customizable at the start of the game) is over the top, and requires quite a bit of strategy. Each enemy is particularly vulnerable to a certain type of element: the character who manages to exploit this weakness gains a bonus turn while the enemy is stunned and if all opponents are on the ground at the same time it is also possible to launch a sort of coordinated super attack. Exploiting elemental weaknesses is essential because the enemies are very tough and have no qualms about doing the same, and you just need to lose Yu to see the Game Over screen. As the levels go by and the acquisition of new Personas, it is easy to get carried away with a combat system that is incredibly simple to assimilate, made up of elemental magic, physical attacks, enhancing and depowering skills, and so on and so forth. Soon, one understands which characters are the most appropriate to bring into a certain dungeon, with which Personas it is better to equip Yu and which of them must be leveled up and merged at the right time. What's more, this version for PlayStation Vita introduces a whole new set of specific combo attacks, interactions between party characters and useful abilities that make combat even more engaging and enjoyable. PSVita trophies Inevitable a large group of Trophies: forty Bronze, six Silver, three Gold and Platinum, for a total of fifty. You will unlock most of them by following the story, but many require you to experiment with Personas, fight under certain conditions, perform particular actions and, of course, upgrade all the various Social Links. The perfect edition The announcement of this portable version of Persona 4 had aroused many concerns, especially for those who had played the still excellent Persona 3 Portable for PSP and had been orphaned of a whole series of reduced contents compared to the PlayStation 2 version. Unlike Persona 3 Portable, however, Persona 4 is proposed again in the sua integrity: this time there are all the cartoon cutscenes, all the Social Links, all the dungeons, all the explorable areas, all the soundtracks. To tell the truth, there is even more: Atlus has taken the trouble to add a series of features and extra content which in some cases drastically alter the unfolding of events and combat strategies. For old fans, in short, this could be a sufficiently new experience. In addition to several new animated cutscenes, there are new dubbed texts, completely new areas and stories, even two completely new Social Links involving some mysterious characters. Atlus has also given a nice touch up to the actual gameplay, with a series of changes that make it even more enjoyable and balanced, especially as regards party and persona management. Between interchangeable bonus costumes, mini-games, brand new Personas, abilities and spells never seen before, as well as a new epilogue, as we said, defining Persona 4: Golden as a mere porting would be unfair, also because the technical sector has been given a good makeover. Don't be naive: we're talking about a four-year-old PlayStation 2 game, so don't expect next-gen graphics; yet, the amount of detail, the complexity of some polygonal models and the cleanliness of the image still remain a real pleasure for the eyes, increased by the splendid PlayStation Vita screen. Atlus has also improved some sequences graphically, adding animated backdrops where there were sparse static panoramas and increasing the definition of some textures. Shji Meguro's sparkling soundtrack is also expanded by some new music tracks: there is little to say about this, except that some songs, such as the fantastic ~Reach out to the truth~ during the fights, have become very famous among fans of the jRPG genre.
