With the transformation of the brand, however, we imagined that we would also find substantial innovations on iOS (and Android, a version that has already been available for several months), however negatively perceived on PC and consoles. Well, something has actually changed but not for the better: we talk about it in the eFootball 2022 Mobile review. Structure: we are always there eFootball 2022 Mobile, a chaotic action in the area Although the interface of eFootball 2022 Mobile has been significantly improved, although it still does not have the responsiveness that one would expect from such a product, very little has changed in terms of content compared to the previous edition. So there are the quick matches in online multiplayer, the events and the eFootball championship, which once again constitutes the core of the experience. Once we have selected a team and a coach, our task will be to use the credits earned with each victory (or obtained through the inevitable microtransactions) in order to sign new, talented players and strengthen the formation while we face games against other users, generally in asynchronous multiplayer, in an attempt to climb the divisions and therefore be able to confront thick opponents. Compared to the past, we appreciate the novelty of a system that mixes experience points and unlocked objectives to accelerate progression even substantially, in support of those who rightly found it boring to try their hand at dozens of extremely trivial matches from time to time, which end promptly with tennis scores, before getting a modicum of challenge. However, the offer remains extremely limited, completely devoid of the methods that over the years have made PES (sorry, eFootball) a point of reference for gamers who are passionate about football. We are of course talking about the Master League, but also about championships, cups and tournaments of various kinds, which special events are in no way able to worthily replace. Gameplay: Something has changed for the worse eFootball 2022 Mobile, a penalty on the edge of the area Unfortunately, the contents are not the only problem of eFootball 2022 Mobile, especially not the most serious at the moment. Resuming the game in hand, in fact, we had the clear sensation of a worsened gameplay, both with traditional touch controls and with gestural ones: slower, less reactive, consequently slippery, imprecise and often frustrating. make sense, on mobile making a player not immediately execute an input only gives the impression that the command was not understood. Compared to eFootball PES 2021 Mobile it seems that everything is slower and heavier, not as a deliberate choice but as some consequence of unresolved and inexplicable technical problems. Technical realization eFootball 2022, sequences from a celebration The positive note of the interface, which we mentioned above, is not supported by significant technical innovations. In fact, the graphics of eFootball 2022 Mobile always seem the same, the polygonal models of the players are a little too angular in close-up sequences and no clear improvements are perceived on the animation front. A similar argument can be made with regard to the audio sector, which on the one hand boasts a soundtrack that is less exciting than usual, with tones that are often dull and not very engaging; on the other, it features the usual commentary in Italian (to be downloaded separately) made up of repetitive and often generic observations.", "date": "2022-07-09", "grade": "6.0"}
