{"name": "Mass Effect - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mass-effect-recensione_a.html", "text": "Other little news The other macro difference with the console counterpart is represented by the combat system: while before it was necessary to pause the game in order to change weapons or powers, the PC version provides a series of hotkeys to easily select your equipment , issue orders to your team and activate any biotic powers and special abilities. This innovation turns Mass Effect into a much less tactical game than classic BioWare titles (did someone say Knights of the Old Republic?), giving you a welcome feeling more akin to the experience of Gears of War or a similar third-person shooter by increasing , in our opinion, the involvement of the player: the only drawback, which afflicts this component of the gameplay, is represented by the poor artificial intelligence of your opponents, who more than once will venture particularly stupid moves such as coming out of their shelter while being clearly outnumbered. Among other innovations, the version for our computers boasts a reinterpretation of the Mako's movement system, now supported by a dedicated control system, which makes it particularly easy to walk on this mighty reconnaissance vehicle and the introduction of a new mini- game, which replaces the sections of the evergreen hacking: you will have to move an arrow towards the center within a series of concentric circles, taking care to avoid rotating tiles, all within a limited number of seconds. Fortunately, the price of failure isn't that bad and with a few units of omni-gel you'll be able to unlock the lock anyway. The genesis There is talk of leaving one's mark on the times, of bringing something new into a genre strongly linked to narration, to the fictionalized evolution of events. Unfortunately, adapting a novel and a style to an open vision is complex, expensive and there is the concrete possibility that it will not have sufficient responses in terms of approval and market. BioWare's is therefore a mediation, but a mediation that allows itself to be daring precisely where the criticisms will arrive because it is really difficult to find any defect in its classic component, where it manages once again to mix adventure and role-playing without limiting itself to simple attribution of experience points and levels. At the same time we are faced with an overture, the opening of a universe, the incipit of a saga (which will last three chapters) and yet another crossroads in the BioWare path which has decided to raise the curtain on the notes of a symphony epic. We are witnessing a beginning that is already the sequel to other adventures that took place in a universe that began before us. Contrary to what happens elsewhere, Mass Effect puts us directly in the shoes of the hero, Commander Shepard, brave soldier, renegade, hero or villain. Lowered into the citadel we have to deal with the troubles of the terrestrial community, fresh from star travel, which seeks to integrate into an environment already overheated by past tensions, racial privileges and historical antecedents. A complex environment to which we must refer immediately taking into account the political situation when we make certain choices. Structure The structure is the classic one with the main character controlled directly and two companions in tow. The members of the active team can be chosen from five, which we have the possibility to add to our ranks during the course of the game. Presumably, at least according to a strategic logic, the choice of characters should take into account their individual abilities, but it's a good precaution to also check their possibilities of interacting with the universe around them. Also in this case it is an evolution of the gameplay to which BioWare has accustomed us since Baldur's Gate, where the characters of the group react to known places, facts and people. In this case, the presence or absence of certain characters makes changes to the main plot and in certain situations it also changes the possibilities of varying the approach to a given problem. This, as already written, transcends the characters' abilities such as burglarizing, electronics and so on and the credibility of the result, once again, derives enormous benefit from the amount of dialogues, situations and possibilities that BioWare has concentrated in a small story whose inner complexity goes beyond the merely spatial one. Furthermore, Mass Effect has lines of dialogue after lines of dialogue (entirely dubbed in Italian), so many that a large part of the speech can be linked directly to the class and background of the character and giving the story an extraordinarily engaging credibility. Despiteand the world of Mass Effect is concentrated within these social and narrative mechanisms, BioWare has gone to great lengths to implement a dynamic game engine that allows you to explore the planets aboard a vehicle and at the same time dismount at any time and march on the lower extremities. To tell the truth, exploration in Mass Effect is more of an enrichment than a necessity and the dynamic engine has a not too exciting aesthetic result on board the vehicle. But these defects succumb to the emotion of being able to get lost on the moon or to wander on a remote planet in search of an outpost. These small elements help to forget the limits of the videogame medium and keep the atmosphere of the game alive at all times and until the end of an experience that will not be easily forgotten. RPG Real Time Combat System Real-time combat. Here is the most evident and publicized novelty of Mass Effect. Unfortunately, the huge number of variables, the chaos generated by the powers and the presence of spaces designed more with RPG in mind than the shooter give rise to fights that are not exactly exciting or rather, to use a fashionable neologism, decidedly ~random~. Also in this case, fortunately, the matter improves on the final with a series of clashes that allow you to appreciate the Mass Effect battle system. On the contrary, the opponents' artificial intelligence does not improve, on the contrary, the more intelligent they are when they speak, the more incapable they are on the battlefield. We believe that the culprit, also in this case, is the immense complexity of the variables in the game applied for the first time to a real-time combat system, which however takes into account all those statistics that usually influence the turns of a canonical RPG . the chaos generated by the powers and the presence of spaces designed more thinking of the role-playing game than the shooter generate some not exactly exciting fights RPG Real Time Combat System The slightly sideways and behind-the-shoulder camera, sprinting and covering are clearly inspired by Gears of War. Unlike GOW, however, the ability and efficiency of weapons depend on the character's skills, and this is a typical element of role-playing games. Another, predictable, distinctive element of the genre is the variety of increasingly powerful and differentiated weapons that become available as the game progresses and Shepard's level grows. Not only weapons but also engineering items and armor grow with the character, and each item, including grenades, can be modified with a wide range of upgrades that make it more effective depending on the situation. There are four categories of weapons available, and Shepard can don one of each type by quickly selecting them from a quick menu that pauses the title. The machine gun and shotgun are definitely short range weapons and need a rather high skill to become functional. The pistol, a particular choice, is the weapon par excellence at medium range. The sniper rifle, initially unmanageable, is the weapon that gives the most satisfaction, allows virtuosity and keeps us out of the dangerous chaos generated by powers and explosives. Biotic powers, whose origin is an important piece in the historiography of Mass Effect, are selected with another quick menu and this too blocks the game, leaving us time to meditate. The classic powers of defense, block and various upgrades, not unlike those seen in Knights of the Old Republic, are joined by powers that make use of the game's physics engine and take advantage of real-time combat. Small black holes and force pushes actively act on enemies, crates and other objects even if the variety of the latter is rather thin. Powers and skills, up to the specialization of the class that occurs naturally during the game, increase the possibilities of interaction with other characters, with our surroundings and with technological objects, including weapons, unlocking particular abilities once a certain level is reached. certain level. It all happens naturally, developing your favorite skills, without branching trees or incomprehensible skills forcibly dragged from the paper universe to the digital one. Role playing game. Really. BioWare plays with identity, convincing us that our action is fundamental when it's little more than an eyebrow lift, and when we get something wrong, it's often too late. The illusion of choice in all its digital glory. After welcoming us, he puts us in the hero's shoes and, shortly after, confronts us with the impossible. Play with us making us feel infinitesimal even if in command of the starmost complex ship belonging to the most powerful fleet. Finally she makes us feel human. But humans, you'll discover, are fresh to the universe and the previous hosts aren't too happy about the intrusion. Considering Mass Effect from the point of view of the role-playing component, it is clear that the bulk of the work done by BioWare revolves around the dialogues which have 20,000 lines used impeccably. During social interactions, a list of expressible emotions appears: from two to six possible choices depending on the communication skills of the character or the situation. Once a voice is selected, it is translated by Shepard into full dialogue. Often two different choices lead Shepard to communicate the same information, but with two different tones of voice and two different facial expressions. The result is that sometimes it is the attitude rather than the information that changes the outcome of the discourse. Seemingly a small thing but one that without too much frills eliminates the need to invent slapstick or surreal answers that couldn't produce believable answers. All this forms the basis of a complex system of interactions which leads us, after a sum of actions and dialogues, to obtain differentiated reactions according to our behavior. Reactions, both from our companions and from recurring characters, that are not simply dictated by a value that determines how good, bad or neutral we have been previously. In practical terms it is as if each active character in the game has a personalized faction system that allows him to interact credibly with his companions in relation to their sympathy and reactions and, of course, with the player himself. The characters then react both in the short and in the long run, time of course, falling in love with Shepard, hating him or simply collaborating with him. An increase in complexity almost invisible, but able to raise the credibility of iterations with a playful AI far above what has ever happened before. Obviously everything is linked to what happens in the video game but it still represents one of the most complex goals achieved by digital role-playing games. The imperfect beauty Technically, despite some sadly obvious problems, Mass Effect is a little gem from many points of view. It shows us glimpses worthy of a still distant future yet rooted in the most classic science fiction imagery. Excellent textures, vivid colors, beautifully modeled environments. The models of the protagonists, without a doubt, stand at unprecedented levels, both from an anatomical point of view and in terms of eyes, expressive range and animations. It does not skimp on light effects, shadows, blurs, explosions as well as having a respectable physics engine, although many spaces are poor in objects that can be influenced by powers or detonations. Unfortunately, out of the thousands of possible running animations for a human skeleton, BioWare has chosen something that could be called relaxed jogging and it is probably the only decidedly wrong choice of the Mass Effect project. The exploratory section does not shine aesthetically, but it is a mere addition that is not very invasive and which improves significantly as the plot progresses with some planets that will leave you speechless. Obsessive care for audio. Even in Italian the labial seems perfect and all those details aimed at making the experience credible add up to this with a result that often leaves us amazed. The audio tracks move from the alienating rhythms of the 80s cyberpunk synth and then explode into symphonies aimed at underlining the epic moments. Among other things, these are excellent quality pieces that manage to create an atmosphere of expectation and then let it explode with a discreet power. Comment Mass Effect was, already on Xbox 360, a title of excellent workmanship, but some smudges brought it to its well-deserved 9.4. The PC version, for its part, is concerned with correcting some of the biggest problems of the original, first of all a slightly immature combat system and an exploration of vehicles at times difficult: the result is that an already excellent title has further evolved, benefiting from all these past 6 months and giving PC gamers a completely unique and unmissable title and experience. If you are undecided about where to play it, we can only recommend this PC version, always hardware permitting, of course...
