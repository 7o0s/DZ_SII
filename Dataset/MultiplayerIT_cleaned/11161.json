{"name": "Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-civilization-iv-colonization-recensione.html", "text": "A little nosy, a little dad Europe is there but you can't see it: you can access the screen that represents it by moving the ship along the edges of the map. Obviously trade with the motherland is of fundamental importance: here you can sell exotic products and import objects appreciated by the natives. It's up to the player to act as a real trade union between the two worlds while trying to attract as many emigrants as possible by also exploiting the infamous ideological and religious oppressions at the time. Building a church in which Europeans can freely practice their faith will be a litmus test of no small importance, because the same weapon can be exploited to ideologically convert the native populations. From time to time the founding fathers will make their appearance, enlightened figures who, in history, signed the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America and who in the virtual variant provide bonuses of various kinds comparable to those of the wonders of Civilization, which they have been removed here. Up to now there has been no talk of war, although there are military units: actually the first part of the game ~must~ be conducted with diplomacy, as entering into conflict with other nations would excessively slow down the development of the colony; equally it is preferable not to subjugate Native Americans by violence, rather trying to persuade them to join the ~just~ cause of civilization. Obviously everything must be led towards the only possible goal in Colonization, that of independence from the motherland. The desire for rebellion against the European monarchs grows with the increase of oppressive taxes to be paid, but it is only with the diffusion of the press and with the relative liberal propaganda that it will be possible to unleash a rebellion. At this point the game undergoes a vigorous turn towards military operations: real end-of-level clashes in which defeat takes on an even more bitter measure, as there is no possibility of appeal. Heated soup Technically we are faced with the umpteenth evolution of Civilization 4: the graphics engine used is once again the BryoEngine, suitably revised and corrected, but nevertheless it is too sparing of details, especially considering the computational power made available by modern systems. The advantage of a minimalist (or rather spartan) graphic allows not to create frills or other frills that can somehow interfere with the fluidity of the action; immediacy which, however, is held back by the screens relating to the cities, which seemed not very intuitive to us. All this is also due to the absence of a real tutorial campaign: the legendary Civilopedia and the inevitable on-screen advice are in fact not sufficient to immediately master the delicate game mechanics. The first hours of the game will therefore be confusing to most, especially to those who have not played the original title, and several attempts will be needed even if only to incite the population against the motherland (in fact, it must be considered that there is a ceiling of shifts not to be passed, under penalty of defeat). The lack of alternative victory conditions and the initial difficulty, combined with the small number of selectable nations represent the Achilles heels and in the multiplayer environment the level of difficulty rises further, with the concrete possibility of finding other colonizers with intentions that are not exactly collaborative. Comment Unusual nostalgia operation (it doesn't happen often to see complete conversions from the same developers who created the original title), Colonization is the modern transposition of a myth from the nineties. Of course, there are some new features, but the charm of the good old days can be felt strongly with each passing turn. It is a hard and raw game, with an unconventional structure for today's catchment area, wider and more varied than the old conquerors of the MS-DOS era. The level of difficulty is therefore high and mastering the game mechanics requires several games. Nonetheless Meier is a good teacher: he manages to get his ~pupils~ to study without making the failures frustrating. His lessons are always full of charm and magnetism and it is for this reason that Colonization is recommended to all lovers of strategic games.Pros Unmistakable charm Magnetic just like all Sid's games Cons One-way gameplay Lack of variety PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements CPU: Intel Pentium IV 1.2 GHz or equivalent Athlon RAM: 512 Mbyte Video Card: DirectX 9 compatible and pixel shader 1.1 with64 MB RAM Hard Disk Space: 900 MB 4X CD-ROM Drive (not required for network installation) Operating System: Windows 2000, XP or Vista Recommended Requirements CPU: Intel Pentium IV 1.8 GHz RAM: 1 GB Video Card: 128 MB RAM, compatible with pixel and vertex shaders Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9450 2.66 GHz RAM: 4 GB Video Card: ATI Radeon HD 4850 Colonists in pills Produced by Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds in 1994 for MicroProse, Colonization was one of the half-brothers born from the brilliant idea behind Civilization: in the same historical period we also remember Master of Orion and Master of Magic. Two sequels were released to the first, the last of which in 2003 made by Quicksilver under the Infogrames label and received very negatively; of the second, despite the resounding success that led it to become a milestone in the history of turn-based strategy, traces have been lost. At the time of the sale of Microprose to Hasbro (1997-1998) a sequel was in the works which was aborted; on the other hand, the original version is freely downloadable from this site.", "date": "2008-09-29", "grade": null}
