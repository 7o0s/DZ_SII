Critically and publicly acclaimed, Spider was a little gem that, as rarely happens on iPhone and iPad, managed to bring together fun gameplay, intuitive controls and, above all, an atmosphere so fascinating as to involve the player and not let him go until the end. end of the adventure. With Waking Mars, the small team scattered around the States completely changes the premise, moving from the dusty house full of insects and arachnids seen in Spider to a setting that is in some ways less atypical for a video game. As suggested by the title, the new game by Randy Smith and associates catapults the user into a mysterious journey on the red planet, yet it does so in a completely new way, drastically moving away from the action component that characterizes shooters set in space and placing the player in role of a sort of interplanetary gardener. There is no laughing matter If the idea of a Gardening Mama set in space could be enough to turn the page, in reality the new title of Tiger Style is much more interesting than it might seem, although it is introduced by a very traditional narrative premise. In fact, the protagonist is Liang, an astronaut chosen for an important research mission on the red planet, who has an easy task: to land on Mars, collect samples from the surface and return home. Obviously something goes wrong and after a few minutes into the adventure Liang and his equipment are swallowed up in the depths of the planet after the subsidence of an unstable surface. Thus begins a journey through the caves of Mars in an attempt to reach the collection point where the protagonist will be recovered and rescued, but to keep him company and give him support there are two non-player characters: on the one hand an artificial intelligence programmed to analyze and provide information on any life forms on the planet; on the other Amani, the young assistant who, from Earth, occasionally distracts the player with some radio communications. Perhaps it is precisely these dialogues that are out of tune like a scratched vinyl: in addition to the little emphasis due to the complete lack of dubbing, the illustrations of the characters that accompany the sentences often clash sensationally with the meaning of the text. In some cases, for example, worried exclamations or sensitive information are accompanied by Amani's big smiley face, which, needless to say, pulverizes any possibility of empathy. It's a real shame because instead the obsessive attention to sound design, from the musical accompaniment to the sound effects inside the caves, would allow to reach an incredible level of emotional involvement. Fortunately, however, Liang's two companions aren't the only living creatures the player has to deal with during the adventure. And this is where things get interesting. The astronaut with the green thumb The cavern in which Waking Mars is set consists of a series of rooms connected to each other, and each of these represents a sort of small puzzle. However, in order to access the next level it is necessary to reach a certain level of Biomass by recreating a small ecosystem inside the room: the player's main concern is therefore to find fertile areas of land and plant some seeds to grow strange plants aliens called Zoa. In this case the complexity lies precisely in looking for the combination of plants necessary to obtain a high level of Biomass, considering that different seeds and different plants have unique behaviors and characteristics: some heal the player, others launch explosive seeds, still others give life to creatures that can become food for some carnivorous plants. As the game progresses, the user becomes familiar with an increasingly complex and articulated alien food chain, made up of vegetables that interact with each other in different ways, reproducing themselves or creating interesting and unexpected chain effects. There are no enemies to face, at least not traditional ones: some rooms have acid pools to avoid, while some plants can be aggressive, although in the entire adventure we have never seen the Game Over screen. Similarly, the weight of backtracking varies according to the skill of the player, who in some cases may be forced to go back to collect new seeds to use in the more advanced rooms. Obviously if you can find a right equilhybrid between the plants that produce more seeds and those that give a greater increase in Biomass, the need to stop and return to previous levels is limited to a minimum. This very atypical game mechanic for a sci-fi adventure, in which the player is encouraged to think and not fight, is precisely what makes Waking Mars such an enjoyable and at times even relaxing experience. If there's one regret, it's that the idea behind the game feels like it hasn't been fully exploited: the combination of the Zoas and their reactions, although they become articulated as they grow in number, are not explored enough to give the player complete creative freedom, with the result that most of the time you are driven to repeat the same formula in all the rooms.", "date": "2012-04-20", "grade": "8.8"}
