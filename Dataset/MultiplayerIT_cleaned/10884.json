{"name": "Trash Racer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trash-racer.html", "text": "The city is overrun with trash! How could this have happened? Well, it's clear that whoever was in charge of controlling the situation had other things to think about. Yet now the streets are full of rubbish, there is a health emergency and local administrators don't know what to do; so much so that they appeared on TV to appeal to all garbage collectors in the area: the most skilled and efficient will be generously rewarded. In short, it is an opportunity that you cannot miss: on board your powerful garbage collection truck, you will have to go around the city and collect as much waste as possible and then pour it into the appropriate sorting centers. It will be a competition not only with yourself, but also with all the other garbage collectors who want to prove their worth and earn their reward. Trash Racer offers us a single game mode in which we will have to, as previously mentioned, drive around on board our garbage collection truck and patrol the streets looking for bins to empty. The missions follow one another and basically offer two variants: in the first case we will have to respect a time limit and collect a certain amount of garbage; in the second case, we will compete with another truck to see who will be able to do better. Losing one of the challenges will result in the classic game over, but with the option to continue indefinitely as well as save the game before exiting the game. The view used is the one from above, with the controls relating to the vehicle: we will have to act on the d-pad by pressing it left and right to steer in the respective directions, and act on key 5 to brake and reverse. The acceleration, fortunately, is automatic and allows us to focus on the trajectories and on the identification of the bins, which flash in the form of yellow dots inside a radar located at the top of the screen. As soon as our truck is full, we will have to go to a sorting center (represented by the purple dots on the radar) to empty it. The waste collection operation is very simple, and to carry it out just approach a dumpster and slow down: the vehicle will automatically start the collection, represented by a progress bar that fills up in a few seconds. There is only one city available for carrying out the missions, but it is a rather large and populated space, with primary and secondary roads, ~shortcuts~ and buildings which, unfortunately, we will not fail to bump into. The sound of the game consists exclusively of a far from original MIDI music and few effects during the action, so that one has the impression of playing with an almost silent video game. As far as graphics are concerned, in recent times we have seen many titles use the top view in a spectacular way, but this is not the case: the design of the city often does not give a good idea of perspective, and the use of colors is really basic. The characters are drawn in a quite successful manga-like style, but their images play a purely accessory role. The roads flow quite smoothly, but the collision detection is merciless and too often forces us to abrupt stops during the missions, with some annoying bugs that sometimes ~stuck~ the vehicle. PRO Original and fun basic idea Discreet vehicle inspection Very simple... AGAINST ...but just as limited and repetitive Problematic collision handling Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2009-02-10", "grade": "S.V."}
