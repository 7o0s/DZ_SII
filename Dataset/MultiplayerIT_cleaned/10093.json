The problem is the menu, in this case made up of people barricaded in an isolated, very isolated country house. Fortunately, among them there seems to be someone with telekinetic powers, and so the onslaught of the undead could also end in nothing. Zombie Smash! it's just the latest in a series of video games that exploit the ~zombie~ theme, this time in an ironic way; and moreover it belongs to a very popular genre on the iPhone, that of ~tower defense~ (in this case more tending to the classic action game, however). The situation is the one illustrated above: on the screen of our Apple device we see a beautiful little house located in an apparently desolate land, in the evening, and we have to defend it from the attack of hordes of zombies that become more and more cunning, resistant and dangerous. How can we act? Well, simply by dragging your fingers across the touch screen: our touch lifts the undead off the ground, spins them in the air and slams them down hard to end their pathetic existence. The same expedient used in the recent Gameloft's Castle Frenzy, enriched in this case by a different system for collecting points and boosting. The stars are many, millions of millions Each zombie that dies releases a star (to be collected with the usual ~tap~), and at the end of each of the thirty-one stages available (which reflect the calendar of a very eventful March) we can spend them to make the house more resistant and enhance the our extra weapons. The latter are automatically delivered to us as the levels pass, and allow us to solve rather intricate situations, such as for example when a large group of enemies has already reached the fragile wooden walls of our beautiful little house and is rapidly tearing them apart to enter. In the upper part of the screen there are two slots (the number of which is also subject to upgrade) for the storage of special weapons, which we can collect like stars and activate if necessary: showers of stones, huge concrete bricks , landmines or even wrecking balls come to our rescue and temporarily clear the screen of zombies. In some cases (see the ~strong~ zombies) they are the only effective weapons, so they must be used wisely. A variation is the pistol, which unlike other weapons does not produce a single attack but can be used a certain number of times, aiming manually. From one stage to another, the undead not only increase in number, but have different types: the ~female~ zombies are faster than their male colleagues and therefore must be eliminated quickly; the ~strong~ zombies, mentioned above, cannot be lifted into the air and must therefore be fought only with the extra weapons; the ~gunslinger~ zombies should not be brought close because they could open fire; and so on, even adding extra elements (see helmets) to otherwise low-ranking opponents. I zombie, you zombie he zombie Zombie Smash! integrates a system for sharing photos and results through various social networks (including obviously Facebook). We can ~snap~ the first ones at the end of each stage, when we have to eliminate the last zombie and we are given the opportunity to immortalize its bloody aerial evolutions as it moves in slow motion. The main game mode is the one we have referred to so far, which offers thirty-one stages that are also quite different from each other: the scenario remains the same, but variables are added that make the action varied and sometimes even unfairly tricky (see the level where we can only use the gun, for example). However, there are two alternative modes: the first is the classic ~survival~, or a virtually infinite game session in which we must try to resist as long as possible the onslaught of increasingly fierce zombie waves; the second is a sort of ~practice mode~ in which we can make experiments to eventually evaluate the effectiveness of certain weapons or maneuvers. The control system is completely based on the touch screen and is very precise, even when we perform multiple launches in rapid succession. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, a really excellent job has been done: the music and effects are perfectly functional to the action, while the graphics boast a truly effective and spectacular cartoon style, which is particularly striking for the use of colours.
