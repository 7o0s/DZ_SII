{"name": "Planet Riders 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/planet-riders-3d.html", "text": "As it is easy to guess even just from the packshot, Planet Riders 3D is inspired by a classic such as Wipeout, offering the user races with no holds barred aboard futuristic anti-gravity ships. However, the analogies with the aforementioned masterpiece stop here, seen and considered how the Fishlabs product is a racing game with a decidedly lower shot. The game develops within three modes (single race, quick race and championship) based on a series of tracks set on the different planets of the solar system: it is possible to tackle each race by choosing one of the seven stables present, each complete with a vehicle customized with variable speed, handling and shielding characteristics. Pure academy also as regards the mechanics of the races: power-ups are scattered within the tracks capable of providing a temporary armament to the ship, icons that allow a momentary boost and finally bonuses useful for regenerating one's shield level. In short, nothing exceptional, but an honest play structure which unfortunately is grossly wasted by a short-sighted technical-stylistic realization and by a totally unbalanced gameplay. To begin with, in Planet Riders 3D the use of weapons is completely counterproductive, given that the control system is so inaccurate as to almost always prevent you from reaching the target with missiles and so on: better bring your attention to the boost icons, to all intents and purposes the only method to gain ground on otherwise unreachable opponents. It goes without saying that a product with similar mechanics cannot be particularly fun, and so it is indeed: Planet Riders 3D goes on by inertia, without involving or stimulating the player in the slightest. To this must be added the macroscopic limits of the Fishlabs product on a technical level, starting from a framerate that is acceptable only on the most advanced devices and otherwise subject to continuous jerks and slowdowns on all the others. Literally nauseating then the design of the tracks, composed of continuous horizontal lines that make your head spin (and not in a good way) and a mix of curves and ups and downs punctually ~hidden~ by an omnipresent and very close bad clipping: in fact, it is frequent to see the spaceships that precede us darting in total emptiness... But that's not all, unfortunately. Planet Riders 3D is also guilty of some of the longest loading ever seen on a mobile title: between ten and thirty seconds, they take with such constancy as to force the user to wait even a couple of minutes in total to switch from the menu main to the actual race. A little too much for a product that should make ~hit and run~ gameplay its creed. The only unassailable aspect of Planet Riders lies in the sound: although devoid of effects, the Fishlabs title can count on a quite captivating and spot on techno soundtrack.
