It is a trend that over the years has become increasingly popular even within the videogame scene, especially in Japan, where our almond-eyed friends really seem to be addicted to everything that can be collected and exchanged. A few years ago Enix saw Pokmon, Monster Ranch and company and thought they were right and good, churning out Dragon Quest Monsters, a spin-off of its most important brand in which, but lo and behold, the player can capture and train traditional monsters from the Dragon Quest universe, including slimes. Spin-off after spin-off, here we are at the second Nintendo DS iteration of the most recent version of Dragon Quest Monsters: in all respects this is Square Enix's swan song on the Nintendo portable console and perhaps that is precisely why it would have been reasonable to expect something more... All are useful... Dragon Quest has never been a particularly famous series for plot or narration, relying mostly on a painstaking characterization of the world in which the various adventures took place, but in the case of Dragon Quest: Monsters Joker 2 we can truly say that the creative effort has been almost nil: leaving aside the fact that the monsters are not original at all since they derive, precisely, from the various chapters of the saga, but for this very reason incredibly captivating, as far as the protagonist is concerned, we are basically dealing with a clone of Gohan of Dragon Ball, which could also appear normal given that Akira Toriyama's characters now all look a bit alike but which in this case borders on the ridiculous, and at the beginning of the game you will discover that you are heading towards a great tournament when, damn , the airship on which you are traveling crashes on a mysterious and apparently uninhabited island which at first glance would seem to be that of Lost, but which then turns out to be populated by various creatures that you will have to capture and train to explore the region, find your missing travel companions and generally save your own skin. Unfortunately the narrative development is so bland that even the main storyline of the latest version of Pokmon beats it, after all the game does not want to be a real plot-driven JRPG and the story is just a pretext to intrigue the player and push him to capture as many monsters as possible. And it succeeds perfectly: the settings are really accurate and wide-ranging, albeit a little too empty, and the excellent polygonal engine naturally manages the models of each structure and creature. Everything is embellished by the cel-shading that has already characterized the most recent installments of Dragon Quest, also giving this version a captivating cartoon look that is expressed above all during the very fluid turn-based fights in which the monsters give their best thanks to high-class animations and special effects that complete the picture offered by the historic and very nice character-design signed by Toriyama-sensei's pencil. The only drawback from a technical point of view lies in the soundtrack, perhaps one of the least inspired composed by Koichi Sugiyama and made up of only a handful of songs that are constantly repeated throughout the adventure, absolutely nothing to do with that of the excellent Dragon Quest IX. ... and no one is indispensable So, here we are, on the Isle of Lost according to Toriyama, recruiting monsters with the usual Dragon Quest Monsters system, or trying to impress them during a fight to the point of convincing them to join you. It is at this point that Dragon Quest: Monsters Joker 2 takes a completely different turn compared to the highly copied Nintendo franchise: if in Pokmon the player is practically pushed to ~collect~ as many creatures as possible, evolving them and establishing a real emotional bond with them that is emphasized over and over again in the sugary dialogues with the NPCs, in Dragon Quest: Monsters Joker 2 our bond with the monsters goes completely into the background, to the point that it is possible to compare them quietly to objects or tools. It's a rather ambiguous model because the game also allows you to rename monsters but the heart of the gameplay lies in a ~fusion~ system that basically cancels the creatures used to generate a new one that inherits its peculiarities and magic. This feature becomes practically mandatoryory as the hours go by since the game is structured in such a way as to make the creatures already obtained practically ineffective, forcing us to capture new ones, perhaps equal but more powerful, or to merge them to obtain more competitive monsters. It is not a simplistic operation as it seems, on the contrary it presents a truly remarkable depth and complexity that make the whole system very intriguing, leading the player to study the best combinations of monsters and abilities in an attempt to generate the definitive creature, only to discover one new, more powerful, which cannot be missing from your collection. In this way Dragon Quest: Monsters Joker 2 manages to completely capture the player's attention despite the endless grinding sessions to which one is often forced to keep up with the increasing difficulty of the clashes. Unfortunately, as per tradition, this episode also has an extremely archaic and not very intuitive interface, which due to the general complexity of the title makes the various operations quite frustrating: not knowing in advance the function of the bizarre skills that we have to decide whether to learn or not it's extremely annoying, especially if you've invested time and resources into a particular creature whose effectiveness depends on a delicate balance of stats and abilities. The same paucity at the interface level also extends to the other options that are unclear and accessible, despite the wealth of features that allow for example to face another player's team in battle online or to download some creatures coming directly from the game into the game. worlds of Dragon Quest VI and Dragon Quest IX. In general, the programmers of TOSE seem to have treasured some criticisms received on the occasion of the first Dragon Quest: Monsters Joker while other problems not only persist, but are accentuated by the greater complexity of the game.", "date": "2011-11-07", "grade": "7.0"}
