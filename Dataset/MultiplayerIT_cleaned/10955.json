{"name": "Diablo 2: Resurrected", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diablo-ii-resurrected-recensione.html", "text": "The role of those who make remasters is usually quite simple: to make a product with a few years behind it attractive so as to involve a new audience and, perhaps, win back old fans by exploiting the nostalgia effect. It is a low-cost operation compared to the development of a new intellectual property, with relatively easy sales and players happy to be able to take back something they loved in their youth: in short, it is a solution that seems to make everyone happy. To achieve this goal, some development studios limit themselves to making rather brutal copy and paste, while others, such as Vicarious Vision, try to take several steps further, relying on the original works and faithfully reproducing the game mechanics, but also refreshing everything the technical sector in a painstaking way. It is more of a tribute than a simple copy. Wanting to look at these operations with more romance, we could say that what fans ardently desire is to be able to replay the most loved titles exactly as memory has preserved them all these years; a mental process that erased the woody animations, the low resolution and wrapped everything in a mystifying patina that made them almost perfect, despite the thousand flaws. With Diablo II: Resurrected, the Activision Blizzard studio has thus decided to wave the changes in the faces of the players in an abrupt way, to make it clear, if there really was a need, that in the end memory tends to be too benevolent , at the same time underlining the productive effort made to allow a title with more than twenty years of experience to be played in comfort in 2021. In the Diablo 2: Resurrected review we will find out if it is therefore worth returning to save Sanctuary once again. Diablo II is resurrected but without dying In Diablo 2: Resurrected all seven classes are available, to the delight of fans! The curious aspect of this remaster is that, first of all, it completely subverts the concept whereby a title is only revisited after many years, or when no one is playing it anymore. The original Diablo II, on the other hand, resurrects in this version without ever being dead: its community is still full of diehards who are constantly on the lookout for perfect builds. Diablo 2: Resurrected then wants to make itself available for those who, like us who write, have not played the second chapter so assiduously for all these years, perhaps abandoning it in favor of Diablo III. Going back today thus represents a nice dive into the past, a very successful nostalgia operation for those who really loved the title and who can only feel a leap in the heart when the old logos of a flaming Blizzard appear on the screen, sparks that ignite a passion dormant, but never completely erased. Diablo II: Resurrected welcomes you as if nothing had happened and, just like twenty years ago, everything is in its place. We venture through the lands of Sanctuary as if not even a day had passed since the last start, perfectly reminding us of the missions, the statistics of the objects, that cursed Rakanishu hidden among the mystical stones to protect the entrance to Tristram and the mighty Diablo waiting for our hero to give life to a legendary fight. The animations, the spells, the soundtrack, everything is tremendously perfect. Diablo 2: Resurrected inventory in all its beauty Except that with a simple combination of keys you can remove the veil of magic and return to the Legacy version, with its resolution unthinkable nowadays and those sprites with gigantic pixels that we just can't figure out how we could remember them so sinuous and intriguing. In short, memory has updated memories, as we said in the incipit and Vicarious was perfect in creating a new version capable of taking our memories and faithfully bringing them back to the screen. So spells leave blinding light trails and torches illuminate the dark dungeons to perfection, while we quickly return to the most modern resolutions to not affect too much the love for the original Diablo II. Diablo II: Resurrected is an Edgar dress, to make a cultured quote, capable of expertly masking the old visual flaws while respecting all the pillars of the gameplay that support it. Before getting to talking about the game, however, give us a few more moments to make you understand how positively the visual impact has impressed us, with sublime 3D models and with our druidic shapeshifter literally reinvented in his bear and werewolf versions. We wasted minutes just walkingre admiring the work on the fur, on the fluid movements, even looking at the reflections in the puddles as the claws dig into the mud. But all the seven classes present have received this treatment and if barbarian and amazon come out slightly more scaled down, the enchantress now makes the game shine thanks to her fiery hydras and her projectiles of ice. The lord of terror is here with us Still this very uncomfortable inventory, it's the only part we really hate about Diablo II We are talking about seven classes because, obviously, the Diablo II expansion - Lord of Destruction and all the related balancing patches are also included with Resurrected. You will therefore find the runes among the drops, the new recipes of the Horadrim cube, the enchantments to keep in your backpack and all the adjustments made over the years, without other adjustments, thus already knowing which objects to look for and which boss runs to face to equip yourself at the Better. In case you have never played Diablo II, but you were younger and you approached Diablo III as the initial chapter, know that here the tones take on much darker hues and that the race to the ever higher difficulty level is exchanged towards the painstaking refinement of the character, with the obviously possibility of exchanging equipment with other players and being badly beaten in PvP. There are some changes to the balance due to some new animations and wide screens, two elements that could change the balance on the field, to be evaluated later when the servers are full and the mechanics of the combat between players will be gutted properly. You can still throw yourself into the game even by disabling the new expansion to play the old Diablo with simplified drops, in case you want to retrace the past in all its former glory. In addition to the aesthetic ones, big changes have also been made to the kinematics, created from scratch, but, also in this case, still very faithful to the originals, including Italian dubbing. The graphical changes in Diablo II: Resurrected are notable The audio deserves a separate chapter since in addition to the wonderful soundtrack, Diablo II carries some of the most iconic effects of the hack 'n' slash genre such as the gurgling of potions and that of gold which opens a memory drawer. Staying on the subject of gold, many of the new tweaks have been directed towards a more practical rendering of the inventory, while leaving that damned very small backpack that has always made us damned. It is easier to compare objects, in the options menu it is possible to activate the automatic collection of gold both with the mouse-over (on PC) and simply by hovering over it (on console) and now we will have a chest with common slots for all our characters. This means that, if desired, we no longer need a mule to transfer items from one character to another. Also present is a convenient automatic reorganization of the inventory and the potions belt plus many other tweaks to make Resurrected much more than just a job done to bring home the salary. In short, we are dealing with a work that is extremely respectful of the original but updated to modern standards and we can only be completely happy with this.", "date": "2021-09-23", "grade": "8.0"}
