{"name": "Stuart Little 3: Big Photo Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stuart-little-3-big-photo-adventure.html", "text": "A little big game? The short tutorial that introduces us to the action of Stuart Little 3: Big Photo Adventure has the advantage of making us understand exactly what we have to do and how. At the command of the mouse, we will have the opportunity to freely explore rather large and content-rich locations, reaching ~hot spots~ from time to time. From them you can access the minigames that make up the structure of the game: to take a certain photo, we will necessarily have to pass a test. It could be about winning a car race, a game of mini golf, an archery competition, or solving a simple puzzle. When we have finished, we will be able to frame the subject of the photo and shoot... too bad that the procedure is automatic and the image is pre-established: allowing the player to control the photo would have been a bonus of some interest. In order to take the shot, it is absolutely necessary to collect a certain number of ~glitters~, which are scattered throughout the stages, until a special indicator is filled. We have already mentioned the size of the levels, and often it will be necessary to resort to alternative means of transport to move more quickly: you don't want to take forever just to cross the garden, do you? Put yourself in the shoes of a mouse, come on. At the command of the mouse, we will have the opportunity to freely explore rather large and content-rich locations. Pros and cons In one of the first ~missions~, Stuart Little has to beat his mouse friend at mini golf to get permission to take a picture of him. Thus begins a game which is held on different ~greens~ and which sees the two participants face off to the tune of points. At the end of the race, Stuart can position and sprint. This final procedure is repeated every time, but everything else changes: we are talking about dozens of ~trials~, with the little mouse who will dress differently depending on the case and will be able to drive a large number of vehicles. In terms of variety, this game is unassailable. As far as the technical realization is concerned, the story is different: the graphics of Big Photo Adventure are rather spartan in the models, sparse in the details and characterized by a barely sufficient frame rate. The sound sector is a little better, with nice music and a localization in Italian of a certain quality (for the record, there is also the voice actor of Milhouse, the very good Davide Lepore). Comment Although the first impact with the game is mixed, alternating excellent animated sequences with in-game graphics well below the PS2 standards, this Big Photo Adventure is strong in an extremely varied structure, which sees the protagonist engage in a large number of different challenges for the achievement of the goal, challenges that when tested do not present any defects whatsoever and can be played without problems. The merits of this product are probably amplified in the eyes of younger players, who represent its ideal target. Pros: Very varied Dubbed in Italian Cons: Graphically mediocre Aimed at young users Little reader friends, rejoice! Little Stuart Little and all his little friends are back, in a new game for your PlayStation 2 (preferably the small one). The little mouse in question, for a change, gets into trouble: he accidentally operates a small remote-controlled airplane and ends up inadvertently ruining little George's school research. Research that is anything but small, consisting of a series of photographs that Stuart now has to take again anyway. Guess what? Yeah, with a fucking small camera. To succeed in the enterprise, he will have to get help from Ball di Neve (the cat, small but certainly not as small as Stuart, stupid) to identify the best subjects to put in the renewed album. [C] Will we be able to piece together George's quest? And who knows. We also juggle in agility tests, every so often. It's the vault of archery... [/C]", "date": "2006-01-09", "grade": null}
