Tested version: Xbox 360Scarygirl is a comic by Australian Nathan Jurevicius that has enjoyed some success, also passing through a flash game that can be freely used on the dedicated site. Now the time has come for the big leap into digital delivery, with an episode curated by TikGames and distributed by Square Enix. It is a platform with a strong fighting game component and an aesthetic style that is very faithful to the original work, equipped with various features that enrich the formula, follow us in the review to discover them all. Once upon a time... The story tells of a small rag girl, with her mouth sewn and a retractable tentacle instead of an arm, abandoned by her parents on a dark and cold night and saved by a charitable pirate octopus, who takes care of her, renaming her , Scarygirl. The days go by happily for the little girl, who now lives in a nice house in a tree, at least until a visit from a rabbit guru informs her about a fantastic journey to a mysterious city. Thus the girl leaves through the menacing forest of owls, armed only with the hook given by her octopus friend. The adventure in numbers translates into 21 levels divided across 7 different stages, ranging from swamps, to dark caves to icy peaks. The maps are full of dangers of all kinds, from insidious traps to the numerous creatures that get in our way. Each level is divided by mutant weeds that must be eradicated in order to continue, the operation can only be performed by taking their core and destroying it, otherwise they will grow back after a short time. At this point the skills of the protagonist come into play, who is able to carry out a large number of offensive actions, all made possible by the prodigious tentacle in her arm. These moves range from the simple jab - a whip like the good old Castlevania - to a devastating uppercut that allows you to repeatedly hit the target, grab it and then throw it at enemies, up to deadly combos to be memorized. The actual game plays out like an old-school side-scrolling platformer, with a dynamic default camera setup, in the manner of titles like Klonoa or the old Pandemonium. This obviously allows for a rather spectacular representation of the scenarios, unfortunately often at the expense of the legibility of the action. Stronger, guys! The elaborate combat system implies a large number of clashes, which all in all do not steal much space from the platform sections, rather canonical and full of ideas already seen in a thousand other titles. Self-propelled floors, grips to be grasped with the liana-like tentacle, entirely underwater parts to be managed with a limited supply of oxygen and sections that require the double jump, already provided as a base for the character. The levels are full of jewels to collect, which represent the currency of the game functional to the purchase of various items, available from street vendors. These objects increase Scarygirl's capabilities and are essential for tackling passages that are not immediately accessible, thus facilitating replayability. Incidentally, we are not dealing with a Metroid of the case, since all the levels are self-contained and the operation remains limited to a mere scoring purpose. The programmers have made the formula rather unpredictable, inserting sections that require particular approaches. Like that of the caves, populated by very dangerous spiders, invulnerable and lethal, in which the protagonist must make their way using luminous mushrooms capable of making them escape. This leads to highly spectacular moments, which we omit to describe so as not to spoil the surprise. Of course, the final bosses are inevitable, also with a remarkable visual effect and with precise strategies to follow in order to be defeated. Xbox 360 goals Scarygirl features the classic 200 player points, divided into 12 goals. To get half of it, it is enough to complete the whole adventure. The others, such as buying all the items in the game, require the complete collection of gems, which can only be obtained with a second pass in the levels. Good luck! Black fairy tales Technically Scarygirl follows the psychedelic style of the comic. From the incipit it is easy to understand that it is a black fairy tale with a Tim Burton-like background humor and highly effective visual ideas reminiscent of children's illustration books. From the protagonist who alone is a whole program, to square owls and mechanical movements, anthropomorphic goats and so on. Not everything is quite appreciablele, to tell the truth, like certain characterizations that fail to fully convince, physics and graphic style also seem to refer excessively to the much better known Little Big Planet, starting from the caption signs that seem far beyond simple deference. Regardless of this, it is a technically well done title, if we exclude the aforementioned dynamism of the shots, which often make it difficult to understand what is happening and where we are landing. The playability is highly derivative but enjoyable, the combat system seems somewhat redundant with respect to the required tasks (in the end, almost everything is done with the normal hit), but the platform sections work smoothly. At least until the middle of the game, where the difficulty curve steepens excessively, representing the biggest flaw of Scarygirl . Perhaps out of fear of premature completion, the developers have made choices in level design that can lead to worrying levels of frustration. The music is annoying in the long run, being substantially environmental jingles repeated in a loop, they certainly help the unhealthy atmosphere, but after a few hours the desire to eliminate them becomes strong. The game supports up to two player co-op, although it is a complementary implementation. In this case the host takes control of the rabbit Bunniguru, who cannot cut weeds, but has a greater offensive capacity than Scarygirl. The maximum collaboration between the two characters is therefore necessary. Scarygirl is available for purchase on the Live Marketplace for 1200 Microsoft Points, or Playstation Network for 14.99.
