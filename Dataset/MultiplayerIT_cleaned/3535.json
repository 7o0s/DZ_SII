{"name": "Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/theatrhythm-final-bar-line-recensione.html", "text": "It's difficult to explain the charm of a rhythm game because, after all, it's just a question of pressing the keys in time with the music: it's not complicated, and you don't even need a good ear, just a little concentration and quick reflexes. Naturally, it is the soundtrack that does the bulk of the work, and it so happens that Square Enix's Theatrhythm can count on songs and musicians who have made the history of the whole video game. Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line arrives on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 - and therefore PlayStation 5 - almost ten years after the previous title, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call, which had already bewitched us on Nintendo 3DS in 2014. In the meantime, the small indieszero developer did not sit idly by and worked on Theatrhythm: Dragon Quest and the arcade Theatrhythm: All-Star Carnival, which however never arrived in the West. The last time we had in short, dealing with a similar Theatrhythm was towards the end of 2020, when we played the disappointing Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory. We were afraid that indieszero had lost the magic touch, but our review of Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line is right below to reassure you that it could hardly get better than this. Not just Final Fantasy Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line, the party faces Gilgamesh on the notes of Battle at the Big Bridge The name Final Fantasy has disappeared from the title for a simple reason: Final Bar Line embraces an even larger library, going to include the music of titles such as NieR, The World Ends with You or Octopath Traveler, and real historical icons such as Xenogears, Chrono Trigger and SaGa. In total, Final Bar Line includes 502 songs, of which 27 are available only with the purchase of the Digital Deluxe version - or the relative update, in case the smooth version has been purchased first - and another 90 that will be published in the coming months in three different season passes. It is an impressive sampling of music, also because the smooth game includes 385 of its own: in this sense, the fifteen Final Fantasy actually dominate, but there is also room for spin-offs, sequels and the Remake of Final Fantasy VII. As you can imagine, for a lover of the Square Enix series this compilation is pure gold, also because each song can simply be listened to in the Music Player, as if the software were some kind of jukebox. Obviously there are not all the songs of every single game, but a good selection that includes between ten and twenty, except for Final Fantasy XIV which even has about thirty tracks. Think of a particularly memorable song and it almost certainly exists. First, however, you have to unlock them, and you start by choosing one of the games in the series Missions mode. It is the starting point, the ~campaign~ of Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line which, however, for the avoidance of doubt, has no story to follow: through the selected songs, the salient moments of the chosen game are retraced, represented by iconic scenarios in which our party - made up of up to four characters - fights equally recognizable enemies. By overcoming a certain number of stages, you earn a key that allows you to unlock a new game in the series, with its characters to be added to the party and its music all to be played. Only in this way, it takes several hours to complete the series Missions mode, especially if you are looking for the real challenge on the Extreme and Supreme difficulty levels, which are the last two of the four available. The indieszero game, however, is suitable for everyone, and easily configurable thanks to the different selectable game styles and a screen full of options. Compared to the previous Theatrhythm games, which were also and above all played with the Nintendo 3DS touch screen, this Final Bar Line relies only on pressing the keys: initially it may seem unusual, especially if you are used to the previous episodes, but in a few minutes you get used to and also appreciate the fact that the game recognizes the pressure of any key as input. It is a particularly important solution because the final stages, especially at high difficulty levels, require intricate and different combinations from the usual ones. Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line, in the Event Musical Stages the films scroll in the background All stages of the Series Missions can be replayed at will in the Musical Stages mode, but in reality Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line rewards the player continuously. It's like a matryoshka: completing stages earns experience points for the party and also Rhytmia, a currency that unlocks collectibles at each new threshold reached. And each stage of the campaign offers a mission, that is a challenge to be overcome to get your hands on another reward thatit can be a consumable, a CollectaCard that depicts characters and monsters, a new InvocaGemma for fights, a new visual element for the ProfiCard that represents us online. Final Bar Line is also multiplayer: not only can you play each stage in cooperative presence - you simply share the inputs - but you can challenge online players in Multi-Battle mode: the latter is very fun, because it is possible ~ annoy~ opponents with a plethora of pitfalls, and in the end everyone gets a small reward anyway. The GDR component Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line, building the right party is key to passing each mission We talked about battles, experience points and invocations... but how does it work? In fact, Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line includes a nice RPG component that more casual players can safely ignore, enjoying every piece of the game anyway; however, those who want to unlock every collectible, character or record will have to rack their brains a little. The unlocked characters are divided into various types - Magic, Physical, Defense and so on - and by leveling up, with the experience points earned, they also learn various skills that can be set to a maximum of four for each character. The strategic combination of types and skills is very important: in the stage selection screen we can find various suggestions on the type of enemies we will have to face, so it might be more appropriate to choose characters who cast spells of a certain element, who can cure or remove anomalous conditions such as Petra and Poison. In ~combat~ our characters are fully automated and attack or cast spells based on a number of conditions, such as when we hit a certain number of triggers of a specific type or when we receive positive or negative ratings, even simply reaching a specific playing time of the song. The same goes for the Invoker Gem, which deals elemental damage and grants a buff that can make a difference. Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line, in Multi-Battle mode is played in four In reality, you only lose by making a mistake in hitting the triggers: the sum of the Life Points of the party members constitutes an indicator that is discharged with each of our mistakes, and obviously with zero Life Points you go to Game Over. This is why the higher difficulty levels are even more demanding: if you get too many triggers wrong, you don't even get to the end of the song because the party is ~defeated~ earlier. By setting it correctly, however, you can collect more errors and inflict more damage, and in doing so you get to challenge the real bosses, completing the missions that offer the best rewards. But beyond this RPG dynamic there is the collecting component that it concerns not only the songs, the Cards and all the rest, but also the playable characters, which are more than a hundred and include protagonists and antagonists in the form of chibi, that is very cute. They're adorable, detailed and beautifully animated, and they give a whimsical but hilarious tone to the whole experience: collecting them and then growing them, unlocking their abilities, is practically a game within a game. Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line, the InvocaGemme allow you to recall the famous summons All in all, Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line is pure fun and good music. It is not a title that can be dissected from a technical point of view; graphically it is essential but very colorful and enjoyable, and on the soundtrack it doesn't even make sense to express ourselves, in this sense the elaborate way in which indieszero has managed to match the progress of the songs to the rhythm and movements of the triggers deserves all our attention screen. A single note could be made to the computer graphics films that run in the background in the Event Musical Stages, which are in low resolution as in the original, but it is a precise nostalgic choice that we do not feel like criticizing. In fact, it is difficult to find something to criticize Theatrhythm: Final Bar Line because it does what it's supposed to do admirably and more, but if we have to be picky, then on Nintendo Switch the loads feel a hair more than on PlayStation 5 - although the game is absolutely perfect and perhaps more indicated in terms of portability, but also very playable on TV - and some screens tend to be poorly organized, making the player go through too many menus.", "date": "2023-02-19", "grade": "9.0"}
