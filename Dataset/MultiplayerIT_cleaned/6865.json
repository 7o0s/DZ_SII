Made by MixedBag, a development team based in Turin made up of only two people, the game arrives on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita after the PC debut and the mobile reduction for iOS terminals; and precisely ~invents~ new ways of conceiving an apparently inflated genre such as that of space shooters with a third-person view. Yes, because there are no hordes of aliens to eliminate, but mechanics that focus on exploration and even on solving small visual puzzles, in order to offer users a decidedly different experience from the usual, characterized by a hardcore approach and solutions rather original aesthetics and games. Our goal in the various modes and missions available is to eliminate all the blue cubes present within the stages, so as to bring up the ~nucleus~ of the location and destroy it too, generating a sort of black hole that swallows up in a few moments the enemy structures and projects us towards the next level. Futuridium EP Deluxe is a very inspired and original indie shooter, challenging but rewarding The art of balancing Futuridium EP Deluxe is one of those apparently hard and angular titles, but which after a few games are assimilated and transform their peculiarities into something natural. In this case, the mechanisms that regulate the flight of the spacecraft, which can be piloted using three different views (in third person, in close third person or in absolute first person), are essential but rather difficult, with the possibility of accelerating the perpetual motion of the vehicle by acting on the right backbone, to immediately reverse direction by pressing the Square key and to open fire with the X key. If we don't have enough space for a turn, we will have to reverse course and ~zigzag~ until we reach the objective, following a geometric approach that destabilizes at the beginning but then turns out to be even friendly in its facets. Carrying out a similar operation inside open spaces is one thing; doing so when there are various obstacles and walls in the way, however, is a whole other matter and ending up against a wall will certainly generate a fit of frustration. The management of energy and game over, as mentioned at the beginning, certainly refers to an idea of hardcore gaming, even if there is no shortage of possibilities to have a few more chances, first of all the ~continues~ that are obtained by bringing completing the missions successfully and/or collecting particular bonuses, linked to completing the stages without dying, within a very limited time limit or by destroying all the cubes in a flowing combo. Alive, dead or X key In Futuridium EP Deluxe our reference is an energy bar which is located in the upper part of the screen and which descends inexorably, accelerating its emptying in case of impact with an obstacle or a missile, recharging only marginally when we eliminate the cubes. In some cases, unfortunately, the distances are such that remaining with little energy invariably translates into game over, and in the absence of credits this leads to having to repeat the entire area all over again, with its ten levels that include a final boss. A hardcore approach, as already mentioned, which becomes fast-paced when the acoustic signal warns us that we must hurry, but which also knows how to open up to exploratory ambitions when the levels become larger, almost boundless, and the cubes must be sought one by one. one, venturing inside apparently too narrow tunnels, perhaps chasing a train that goes back and forth in the location and paying attention to the mines that protect certain areas. Furthermore, some bosses turn out to be small jewels of design and challenge, even if we proceed in this sense between ups and downs. The aspects we have described so far concern the main mode of Futuridium EP Deluxe, but there are other side ones that help increase the duration of the experience; for example the single levels and the Classic mode, characterized by the lack of the accelerator and the presence of four degrees of difficulty. Finally, it is possible to unlock a fun extra mode, Flappyridium, which pays homage to the mobile blockbuster Flappy Bird by putting us in a very similar situation, in which you have to try to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding obstacles and using only two controls, to raise or lower the spacecraft in a horizontally scrolling two-dimensional context. Playstation 4 trophies There are thirteen Trophies present in Futuridium EP Deluxe, and for Octto keep them you have to put in a lot of effort. Beyond the achievements obtainable by completing the various areas of the Arcade mode, in fact, most of the Trophies are linked to improbable undertakings, such as completing the Classic mode with a single credit, ringing a hundred cube combo and unlocking a certain number of medals. Images, sounds and portability The sound sector is the master during the games with Futuridium EP Deluxe, thanks to a series of electronic songs, often in dubstep style, signed by Luca ~dgout~ Gasperoni and Omar ~Qubit~ Ferrero. What is offered to our ears is therefore an excellent soundtrack, to be appreciated with headphones if possible, and accompanies an action that scrolls on the screen at a fixed sixty frames per second on PlayStation 4, something less on PlayStation Vita. The graphic style is that of an indie, essential by vocation and by need, and brings to mind the vector settings of Virtua Racing, when the polygons took their first steps and specific chips were needed to manage them on consoles. The fruition of the experience seemed to us to be equal on the two platforms, thanks to a control system that is in all cases precise and reactive, in line with what we are asked to do in the game, or maneuvers that are sometimes very rapid and to the millimeter. The support of the cross-buy function, which allows you to download the game at will on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation Vita, is unfortunately not accompanied by the cross-save, which would have allowed you to resume the game exactly where we left off when switching from one console to the other. However, this is the only real flaw for a title that PlayStation Plus subscribers can buy with a 20% discount (at 7.99 euros instead of 9.99) and which definitely deserves attention, regardless of its being a production all Italian.", "date": "2014-10-06", "grade": "8.0"}
