Turn-based strategy is a genre that lends itself particularly well to portability, so we were also eager to get our hands on the new chapter of Disgaea, a series that has its roots in the PlayStation 2 era and which hadn't seen a new release for six years. below the re-proposed for Switch as Disgaea 5 Complete. Stories of zombies and gods If you're new to Disgaea, then you should know that narrative has never played a huge role in this franchise. There is always a main storyline that justifies the misadventures of the protagonists, but often the plot becomes so delusional that you get to the end without fully understanding what happened and why. Usually the plot takes the form of a collection of vignettes, narrative arcs focused on the various characters who motivate their actions and eventually their entry into the player's forces, as the latter approaches, mission after mission, the final rush. In short, Disgaea 6 is neither Fire Emblem nor Final Fantasy Tactics: the dialogues are mostly continuous gags that play on the idiosyncrasies of the different characters, using a decidedly Japanese-style humor. Therefore, it is not so much the message or the meaning of the story that matters, as the actual writing which must, in a word, entertain. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. Here, the story of Zed, a zombie who chases the God of Destruction throughout the Netherworld with the specific aim of beating him, is not exactly the most brilliant we have experienced in almost twenty years of Disgaea. It often makes you smile, and some characters, such as the pompous Misedor or the hysterical Ivar, are truly hilarious, but most of the dialogue lacks that flicker of sarcasm and genius that characterized the previous episodes. Double entendres abound and most of the time the writing insists on the same catchphrases, gags that end up tiring after a few hours and that seem to be there to fill space and lengthen the soup. The protagonist, in particular, is quite stereotypical in character to be a zombie who reincarnates infinitely, but all in all those who know English will certainly have a few laughs: the game, in fact, has not been localized in our language. On the other hand, those approaching the series for the first time will be able to count on a completely new story, unrelated to the previous ones, except for some nice cameos or easter eggs. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. Disgaea 6 was in fact thought of as an ideal starting point for new players in various aspects, not least that of the narrative. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Nippon Ichi has switched completely to 3D, abandoning once and for all the two-dimensional sprites that moved on the isometric maps to embrace a more modern audience. The choice, initially greeted with skepticism by the community of aficionados, proved to be more successful than expected. We will miss the pixel art of yesteryear, but the new 3D models, embellished with excellent cel shading and good animations, appear more coherent in the general artistic context, giving their best in the spectacular cinematics that reproduce spells and special attacks. Everything else leaves something to be desired. Except for some particularly inspired maps, the scenarios are poor in detail, but it is above all the performances that disappoint. Disgaea 6 allows you to choose between three different graphics settings: Graphics, Balanced and Performance. After having tested them for several hours, we can say that Balanced is the only one that really makes sense to exist: while dirtying the graphics a bit, it manages to maintain a fluidity that Graphics dreams of, given that it exchanges stability for mediocre antialiasing. Performance, on the other hand, doesn't make sense at all: the image loses so much resolution that it becomes unwatchable. In any case, we know for a fact that Switch can do better. For old and new players Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. Explaining the dynamics of a title like Disgaea is un titanic enterprise, if only because they are very numerous and many of them are independent from the others. This, in a sense, has always been the strong point of the Nippon Ichi series, which can be played and enjoyed without delving too much into the gameplay; on the other hand, those who love to do math, memorize statistics and build impossible armies can literally spend hundreds of hours on a title that takes about thirty hours to complete just the main campaign. We will therefore focus on the most important mechanics and on the innovations that distinguish Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny from its predecessors. First of all, it should be emphasized that the dreaded simplifications that we had noticed in the demo did not weigh us that much and, indeed, in some cases we ended up finding them well studied. Returning to the previous discussion, it was above all the players who invested a lot of time in customizing their units who had fun with the ~numbers~ of Disgaea, a series known for its exaggeration. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. Where it used to be necessary to work on characters, equipment and skills to inflict millions or billions of damage, Disgaea 6 takes a shortcut and greatly accelerates this process, making these levels reach in a matter of hours and without too much effort. On the one hand, this solution mortifies the effort in the old games; on the other, it is clear that Nippon Ichi wanted to insist on this peculiar aspect of the franchise - complete with hype - precisely because it distinguishes it from any other turn-based strategy game on the market. Putting ourselves in the shoes of a player who has never had anything to do with Disgaea, we must admit that the diabolical plan of the Japanese software house has its own reason. This does not mean that investing in the game is less rewarding. Nippon Ichi has simply raised the bar, increasing the maximum level achievable (now 99,999,999 and, yes, you read that right) and proportionally increasing the values that the statistics can reach. You start with characters that have five-digit values and that can only reach the billions by leveling up, which is much faster than before. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. One of the most interesting differences with the past lies precisely in the way experience points are earned. Once each unit received them after performing an action, and this led to a significant imbalance between the characters we moved more often, such as the protagonists, and all the others. Now, however, experience points are awarded at the end of the mission to all units that took part in the battle, and only those that stood out the most, perhaps by performing specific actions - for example, inflicting final blows or healing allies - earn some bonus experience. In addition to experience points, each unit also earns a currency called Mana, necessary to enhance spells and special techniques so that they inflict more damage or have a greater range, learn new Evilities (passive skills that already appeared in previous Disgaea) or transform them into scrolls to teach them to other characters, and so on. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. Mana also serves to call the Dark Assembly together: it is a kind of minigame in which you bet on the consensus of the senators of the Netherworld regarding our requests, a consensus that we can possibly also buy by hook or by crook. This historic function of the series returns with a myriad of old and new options, among which the Super Reincarnation system stands out, which allows you to restart a character from level 1 while retaining the skills learned and a percentage of the values achieved in the various statistics: in this Thus, as it increases in level, its parameters will reach higher and higher values. This is how players can ~break~ the gameplay of Disgaea 6. Super Reincarnating characters over and over again, accumulating Mana and exploiting the functions of the Dark Assembly, numbers can be reached that are simply meaningless. From this point of view, the evergreen Cheat Shop also helps, which allows you to modify some parameters as a compensation during the games, for example by increasing the experience points but decreasing the Mana, the incoming money, etc. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. The Juice Bar, on the other hand, is a brilliant addition that we hope to see again in the future, perhaps with a better finish. This service allows you to distribute experience points and mana earned in etc. at willit, for example by those characters who have reached the allowed limit and who would otherwise waste these resources. The Juice Bar therefore serves to micromanage the characters in an even more precise way, but unfortunately it requires an exorbitant amount of HL (the money of the Netherworld, in short) to be exploited often and soon ends up in the background. A last novelty that we have used little, but still appreciated, is the Demonic Intelligence. This function recalls the Gambit system of Final Fantasy XII, although it is also more complex: in practice we can set one or more ~threads of thought~ for each character, directives linked by circumstances and logics that automate behavior in battle. For example, we can make a character heal himself using a consumable whenever his health drops below a certain percentage. By setting up multiple train of thoughts, we can fully automate battles, writing the artificial intelligence of our characters first hand. It's a complicated operation that takes time and patience, but could become a valuable resource for players who like to grind for hours on end. Strategic fights Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. It's worth spending a few words on the combat system for all those readers who have never got their hands on a Disgaea. As we said, explaining it in detail would be difficult, so we advise you to download the demo for Nintendo Switch available on the eShop: it will act as a tutorial and you can import your saves into the final game, should you decide to buy it. Disgaea 6 is basically a turn-based strategy game. Once a mission has been chosen, each enemy must be defeated to win the battle, which begins by deploying a certain number of units in our army. The battle takes place by alternating the player's turn and that of the enemies. During his turn, the player can move his characters, make them attack or perform other actions, without following a precise order as happens in many other strategy games. For example, you can perform an action with one character, move another and then move the first into its place and so on. Furthermore, the characters will not follow the orders given until you have given your OK with the Execute command or you have not ended your turn: in the second case, any pending orders will be executed before it is the enemies' turn.

In addition to being extraordinarily versatile and free, the combat system of Disgaea 6 contemplates a ridiculous amount of mechanics and features that the player can cross in various ways. Arranging his units around enemies in a certain order or formation triggers multiple and combined attacks. The characters can lift each other to launch from one point of the map to another and gain ground, or form absurd human towers to reach elevated positions otherwise inaccessible. The historical dynamic of the Geo Panel also returns: practically a part of the map could be influenced by artifacts called Geo Symbols that give the units above it advantages or disadvantages. The player can manipulate the Geo Panel, perhaps by destroying or moving Geo Symbols, to appropriate those advantages or weaken enemies in the most imaginative and creative ways. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, an image of the game in the Nintendo Switch version. Although slightly simplified - for example, the characters can no longer wield secondary weapons and the monsters we can recruit no longer have unique abilities as in the past - the combat system of Disgaea 6 has nothing to envy of the previous episodes. Some mechanics of the old Disgaea are missing, such as the possibility of wielding monsters as weapons or the Revenge mode but, even with all the exaggeration and absurdity that distinguish it, even in a Disgaea too much would have risked crippling. On the other hand, the contents are not lacking. Between the main missions, the DLC missions and the procedural maps of the Item World - unfortunately less imaginative or elaborate than in the past, but always fun to tackle to upgrade your equipment - Disgaea 6 is a very rich title that cannot disappoint fans of turn-based strategists and all-Japanese nonsense.
