The famous phrase of an equally famous amaro lends itself quite well to Rust's debut on consoles, three years after the official launch on PC (2018) which in turn took place after a good five years in Early Access. Steps have been taken since 2013, for a game that has won the spotlight on Steam despite its extremely punitive nature towards which not everyone could be in favor. The success on Twitch and YouTube was not enough to guarantee him a console conversion in a relatively short time, unlike other games of the same tenor such as Ark and DayZ: only today can we enjoy the fruits on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (it is not foreseen at the moment). moment a next-gen version) but looking at the final result are we really sure it's a good thing? Before continuing, we would like to specify that this review of Rust for PS4 and Xbox One will concern the conversion itself and will not deal with the game as a whole: the experience is the same, indeed not entirely being further behind in terms of content compared to the original. If you want to know it in detail, we recommend the review of the PC version. A quick overview of Rust We still want to spend two words to contextualize Rust, in order to make you understand what it is about in broad terms and possibly push you to read the review. Developed by the independent studio Facepunch Studios, it is bluntly a PvP survival game: although PvE is also present, it is more of an accessory, useful for getting an idea of some mechanics without the constant threat of other players. The player's task, of course, is to stay alive by using every possible means and starting from having only a stone, a torch and underwear with him. Gathering resources is essential, as well as managing hunger and thirst, avoiding radioactive areas, always keeping warm and avoiding, or learning to manage, dangers of various kinds - animals or humans, the latter represented by the other players. Thanks to the resources, useful tools can be built, progressing from the basic ones to more complex and efficient ones, whether they are weapons, buildings, clothing or whatever. This provided you manage to survive long enough and no, it's not easy at all: death is a constant in Rust, which brings us back to that famous shore, half-naked and vulnerable, with each of our departures. It is therefore an exercise in patience, a constant testing of our will in and out of the game, because we can even turn off the console, but Rust still lives on - with all the consequences of the case. Travian, OGame and similar games should have taught you that for certain experiences there is no concept of pause: either you continuously follow the misadventures of your avatar, or you prepare a strategy to limit the damage when you can't play. If not, welcome to Groundhog Day. A rusty conversion Rust on Xbox One Without sweetening the pill, Rust Console Edition is not a good conversion. In graphic terms it is faithful to the PC counterpart and the problem is precisely this: we were not here to expect a quality equal to the most modern triple A, however we are faced with not well defined 3D models and poorly cared for animations, accompanied by low resolution textures that don't exactly make you cry for a miracle. The audio sector in turn does not shine for efficiency, presenting sound effects that are not very realistic and in many cases not differentiated from each other (just think of moving on different surfaces, you will notice very few if any changes); in the same way, the feedback returned by the clashes, with fire or melee, certainly cannot be defined as commendable. Again, without expecting the aesthetic/sound miracle we would have undoubtedly expected an extra effort. Not wanting to overweight these aspects, let's move on to the experience itself, specifically the controls. Overall, Facepunch Studios has done a good job, looking for the best compromise for an experience that on consoles cannot have the same fluidity as on PC. This at least as regards the intuitiveness of the interface: inventory and menus are easily recalled, while the classic mapping of the commands regarding crafting and combat allows you to get carried away after a fairly short practice. Sometimes it feels a bit clunky and cumbersome, but nothing that makes the experience unplayable. Intuitiveness, however, is not enough to make everything effective when you get to the heart of the experience. The controls show the side especially when it comes to aiming and shooting, two vital actions in an unforgiving worldor like that of Rust and that if hindered become a problem; especially shooting, as you might have guessed, and no matter how much we tweak settings or aim sensitivity - it's never going to look optimal. Rust on Xbox One If all these aspects have already made us turn up our noses, the real, serious problem of Rust on consoles are the bugs but in this sense we must make a premise: we played the Xbox One version of the game on Xbox Series X, as there was no next-gen optimization, and this means that some difficulties could be due to having tried it on this console. However, it is difficult for us to believe that every single problem is attributable to this situation, on the contrary, usually the greater power of Series X drastically improves the frame rate and the general graphics quality. Occasional issues with crafting, input lag, weapons crashing, crashing the game while trying to join a server, minor bugs like floating objects, choppy performance, freezes...all issues that the patches didn't help fix , sometimes increasing the number of bugs that can show up. When compared to the PC version, Rust Console Edition is an inferior product from every point of view, old even before it was born and destined to walk on a parallel path to the original (the same roadmap will not be the same for the two editions). As things stand, the game sabotages itself and that's a shame, because at times it manages to return that Rust-esque feel that PC gamers are so familiar with. However, if, for every enthusiasm, we are forced to pay the price of being randomly kicked off the server, not being able to create certain objects or interact with others, something is definitely wrong. In general, even in the best case scenario in which a game does not suffer crippling bugs, the feeling is still that of being faced with a mediocre experience that has nothing to do with the original. An excessive price for a mediocre yield Perhaps we could have been slightly more relaxed if Rust Console Edition weren't sold at a price that has no raison d'tre and in general for a vague hint of ~pay to win~ due to the different versions and related advantages: you go from the edition basic at 49.99, Deluxe at 59.99 up to Ultimate at 79.99. Sure, they can give us all the small advantages of this world but if we don't know how to make good use of them, the situation doesn't present imbalances. However, it is undeniable that, for the game that it proves to be, even the basic edition is not at all in line in terms of price. Considering the cost a negative factor, within a review, is always a delicate matter to evaluate, but in this case we cannot fail to do so: Rust Console Edition is an inferior product compared to the PC counterpart, complete and reliable, yet it costs much more more.", "date": "2021-06-07", "grade": "5.0"}
