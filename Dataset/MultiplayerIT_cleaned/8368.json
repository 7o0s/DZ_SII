With the official announcement of the localization of Tales of Xillia for 2013, probably closely followed by Tales of Xillia 2, PlayStation 3 users will have no reason to complain about Namco Bandai's questionable commercial choices for a while. However, Tales of Vesperia remains in limbo, for which it is still necessary to have an Xbox 360 and, more difficult, a rare copy of the game. This Tales of Graces F, on the other hand, is another rather strange decision. Namco Bandai seems to have wanted to spread the franchise across all consoles, but in the West it has limited itself to localizing a machine game. Thus, in America and Europe, Vesperia remains on Xbox 360, Tales of Symphonia 2 is a Wii exclusive and this port of Tales of Graces for the Nintendo console has been chosen as a trailblazer on Sony consoles. A bizarre strategy, but at least now we can enjoy the enhanced version of one of the best jRPGs of this generation. Provided you know English, of course. Friendz forevah Fans of the Tales series know very well what they are getting into. The brand has always stood out for its somewhat eccentric plots, written as if they were a real Japanese animated series with all the clichs of the case, and Tales of Graces F is no exception. On the contrary, in a certain sense it exacerbates the caricatured characterization of the characters who become the lifeline of a not exactly memorable story. In fact, the game begins with our future heroes still children and the first two or three hours of the adventure mainly serve to let us know them and to establish the relationships and characters of the characters, only to then disintegrate this subtle balance with a chilling twist. The capricious Asbel Lhant and his shy little brother Hubert are the sons of the squire of a small village on the edge of the kingdom of Barony. Asbel should be the responsible eldest son, but instead he keeps getting into trouble despite the admonitions of his friend Cheria, who is in poor health. In one of these raids, Hubert and Asbel come across an amnesiac girl who they baptize Sophie and who they take home as if it were a stray puppy. At the same time, little Prince Richard, visiting Lhant, gets involved in Asbel's troubles: a deep friendship is born but a series of catastrophic events calls into question the status quo, dividing the children for about ten years. When the story really begins, Asbel lives far from home, now a skilled swordsman on the verge of knighthood, personally trained by the famous Malik Caeaser. It is at this point that the past comes back to bite him with news that will bring him back to Lhant, between old friends and dormant tensions: from here a plot begins to develop that will force our heroes on a journey to save the world, as per jRPG tradition . In short, as you may have understood, the story is the typical anime in which unity is strength, love always wins and friendship is the most important thing in the world. Nothing new under the sun, but seeing the protagonists grow up, who change radically from petulant kids to methodical adventurers, tugs at the heartstrings and binds us deeply to characters that otherwise would have seemed too stereotyped. This PlayStation 3 version also includes a very welcome additional epilogue lasting several hours compared to the Japanese edition for Nintendo Wii, which definitively concludes the story by illustrating the fate of each character. Playstation 3 trophies The Trophies are inevitable, 50 total divided into 37 Bronze, 10 Silver, 2 Gold and Platinum. To earn them, just proceed in the adventure and unlock the various Titles of the characters, but also defeat various bosses within a certain time limit. The hour of violence Structurally, Tales of Graces F does not deviate in any way from the classic setting of old-fashioned jRPGs: the player is led by the hand by the plot through the game world, an almost freely explorable three-dimensional map from which it is possible to access cities and dungeons. You talk to NPCs, watch the next cutscene, buy and sell at the little shops, then drop into dungeons and solve some simple puzzles while battling monster after monster to reach the boss, then the cycle starts again in a different place and it continues like this, from beginning to end. In short, Tales of Graces F does nothing original in this respect, but what it does it does damn well, above all thanks to a simply hilarious combat system. It's not easy to get carried away: the first hours of the game, when the protagonists are children, offer a simplified battle systemto teach us how to fight monsters slowly, assimilating each mechanic a little at a time. The system develops in its entirety only when the characters grow and you get free access to every mechanic, resource and fighting style. Unlike the latest Tales to hit the West, Tales of Graces F relies almost entirely on Chain Capacity or CC points. Each character begins combat with a certain amount that are consumed by each action or attack. Even running freely around the battlefield consumes CC and the only way to recharge them is to stand still or play with style, dodging, parrying and counterattacking in good time. At first, the battle system appears noticeably limited, the player penalized by the low amount of CC is forced to interrupt the assault to recharge them. After a few hours, however, it is impossible not to appreciate every nuance of what is, hands down, the most intricate and satisfying combat system of the franchise. Weapons and extra skills increase the reload speed and the base amount of CC, allowing the player to connect more and more attacks in very long and devastating combos, and to perform special shots that are as effective as they are spectacular, still requiring a fair amount of skill in managing resources and points weak elementals of various enemies. The battle system of Tales of Graces F literally drags the player, urging him to fight better and better and more and more, to unlock all the various skills related to the titles of the characters. In fact, each of them applies passive and active bonuses, but it is necessary to fully upgrade a specific Title to take advantage of its bonuses even after changing it for another. The Titles are obtained by progressing in the story, completing the sidequests and performing particular actions such as, in fact, enhancing the Titles already earned. Grace's Anatomy Between Titles and Chain Capacity there is also a novelty for the franchise halfway between the cooking system and the creation of objects: the Eleth Mixer allows you to combine foods and objects to enjoy special bonuses during fights and beyond, which they consume the energy of this device forcing us to recharge it from time to time to continue using it. It is an almost irrelevant mechanic in a normal game, much more useful at advanced difficulty levels or when facing the usual secret bosses. It goes without saying that the more than forty hours of gameplay required to complete the adventure require a micromanagement of statistics, equipment and objects that betrays a colorful and childish audiovisual sector. Tales of Graces F is a much more complex game than it appears, but the simplicity of the graphics can certainly be misleading. However, remember that this is a port from Nintendo Wii: Namco Bandai has done a more than discreet job in increasing the resolution and tweaking the color palette, increasing the saturation of the colors and the sharpness of the textures. We are far from the glories of Tales of Vesperia or Tales of Xillia, but Tales of Graces F, albeit old, remains a visually pleasant, clean and detailed game, thanks also to the refined and exquisitely Japanese character design by Mutsumi Inomata. Instead, the fights betray its old-generation origins, which show the side above all on the animation department: the polygonal count of the models has been slightly improved, as well as the quality of the numerous light and particle effects, but the characters continue to move in a a little woody and unnatural, though it's not easy to notice in the confusion of a battle. All of this is framed by the soundtrack of a genuinely somewhat subdued Motoi Sakuraba. The tracks are many and of good quality, but not as incisive and memorable as others of his previous compositions, especially for the Tales series; overall the accompaniment is good, but some are repeated a little too much and others are quickly forgotten. The dubbing work is discreet, with a choice of actors that is not always perfectly fitting and a few too many petulant voices.", "date": "2012-08-22", "grade": "8.4"}
