With Gearbox's Aliens: Colonial Marines still a few months away, those who grew up between facehuggers and Queen Mothers will however find great relief in waiting thanks to Aliens: Infestation, an episode for Nintendo DS developed by Wayforward Technologies in collaboration with Gearbox itself, published from Sega and which hit store shelves sensationally - and guiltily - under the radar. Disposable Marine Aliens: Infestation is a scrolling action/adventure that is clearly inspired by similar titles from the 16-bit era of the 90s; the team behind the project in this sense is certainly not without experience, with recent precedents such as Shantae (GBC and DSi), Contra 4 (DS) and Thor (DS) just to name a few. A respectable pedigree, and in fact Aliens: Infestation is a product of great quality, probably even beyond expectations. The basic concept sees the player in control of a marine, chosen from a group of four; with the exception of aesthetic and personality differences, expressed through the lines of dialogue, there is no distinction between one and the other pad in hand. Nonetheless, the choice of characterizing each protagonist allows for the establishment of an albeit subtle emotional bond between the player and his alter ego, which is expressed above all at the moment of the latter's death. Yes, because in Aliens: Infestation the marines die, and there is no potion or miraculous intervention that can resurrect them; once they're down, it's over. When a member of your group leaves, you can choose with which other marine among those still available to continue the adventure, from exactly the same point you just reached. It is obvious that seeing the number of men under one's command dwindle dramatically causes some anxiety; fortunately it is possible to replace the slots left empty with new soldiers, encountered during the progression hidden in some ravine or perhaps trapped by the aliens themselves. In total there are about twenty of them. Although in practice the marines are nothing more than ~lives~ available to the player, the solution chosen by Wayforward is absolutely valid and interesting, such as to actually contribute to adding something to the game as a whole. Of course, in this way a single charismatic and effective protagonist is missing, but he is not missed; because in the end the protagonists are them, the Aliens, and even with the limits of 2D and the DS's animation capabilities, the result is sufficiently valid and disturbing to leave fans of the series satisfied. A fundamental contribution in this sense lies in the lethality of the monsters, which can quickly affect a large part of their energy bar. Bishop! The game itself, as we said at the beginning, is an action adventure entirely attributable to the ~metroidvania~ genre; we move between rooms, tunnels and elevators, trying to obtain keys or objects with which to reach previously closed areas. The map, a fundamental element of aid in being able to orient oneself in the various settings, has a structure absolutely similar to that of the classic titles with Samus or any Belmont as the protagonist. The control system is valid and well structured: a couple of keys for shooting and a secondary attack, one for jumping, a last one for operating and interacting with sensitive elements (or performing a somersault), and finally the right backbone to start run, being careful not to use up your entire stamina bar. Mastering the shot soon becomes essential to be able to dodge the blows of the enemies; the fights, although not particularly refined, gain pathos precisely due to the impact they can potentially have on the precious residual energy, as well as due to the awareness of the scarcity of medikits and ammunition boxes that can be recovered during one's journey. Of note are the clashes with the bosses, rather evocative and challenging. Clearly fundamental, in such a game, is the level design; Wayforward in this sense has learned from the mistakes of the past, giving life to a product which, although lacking in originality in this respect and never reaching the crystalline quality of the best Metroids, follows all the fundamental dictates of the trend with skill and attention. Finally, the attention to detail is positive, and more generally the feeling that the team is actually made up of lovers of the film series; an egempio is the mini-game to unlock in which, using the stylus, you have to repeat the famous game of the knife on Bishop's hand. An almost completely superfluous gem from a gameplay point of view, but which helps to compose a product that fans cannot fail to appreciate.", "date": "2011-10-18", "grade": "8.5"}
