{"name": "Morte ai non-morti!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/101472-all-zombies-must-die-morte-ai-non-morti.html", "text": "When you live in a town called Deadhill, it's clear that anything can happen. Jack, the protagonist of All Zombies Must Die! he is aware of it, therefore the unleashing of a sudden invasion of zombies does not catch him that much unprepared. His experience as an inveterate gamer has shown him the way over and over again in moments like this, and so the boy takes up the first weapon that comes to hand and begins to kill the undead (again), until he realizes that his ex-girlfriend Rachel is barricaded in the police station. Together with Brian and Luxo, these are the protagonists of the new title developed by Doublesix Games, a team formed by the authors of the spectacular Geometry Wars: Galaxies, who once again try their hand at the twin analog shooter genre after Burn Zombie Burn!. The elements at stake are more or less the same: a character design that winks at cartoons, thus placing itself in antithesis with a macabre theme such as that of the living dead; a good variety of weapons, in this case upgradeable through the acquisition of materials and therefore a crafting procedure; the presence of RPG elements relating to the characters, which, depending on the zombies eliminated, increase their experience level and earn points that can be spent to improve the various skills. All Zombies Must Die! has been available on the Xbox LIVE digital platform since last December and later landed on the PlayStation Network. The PC version, which can be purchased on Steam for 9.99 euros, is therefore the latest addition but has no differences whatsoever with what is seen on the console, apart from some compatibility problems with the Xbox 360 controller: unfortunately we were in no way able to get the right analog stick to work during our tests, which forced us to fall back on mouse and keyboard controls. Not exactly an idyllic combination for a shooter of this type. Shoot and run The gameplay of the Doublesix Games product does not necessarily imply the use of firearms to make their way through zombies, even if it would have been better to insist on that point. Punching enemies or hitting them with a club, in fact, proves to be a very slow practice even if our character already enjoys some enhancements, and in cases of overwhelming numerical superiority (practically always) this approach forces us to move often and continue to hit desperately. The first shotgun therefore arrives as a blessing, and despite the limit of two shots in the barrel (which forces you to always reload, given that the living dead usually only go down with a single buckshot if we hit them point-blank) it does its job perfectly , even against very large groups. Eliminating zombies produces bonuses of various kinds, from ~sandwiches~ that restore the health bar to essential ammunition, passing through a series of materials that are obtained in certain situations and which can be useful for the creation of new weapons. If an undead passes near a flame and catches fire, in fact, killing him will earn us some wood (don't ask us why, it's just like that), and the combination of logs, a lighter and a machine gun light will give life to a machine gun with incendiary bullets. The shooter dynamics appear well implemented, and sometimes we will find ourselves slaloming among the living dead and shooting at the same time, almost as if it were a space-based shoot'em-up. Unfortunately, the lack of an online multiplayer mode significantly reduces the appeal of the experience, which can still be enjoyed together with a friend on the same PC. All mine the city The city of Deadhill is divided in the game into various neighborhoods delimited by ~barriers~ controlled by robots. To move from one area to another it is often necessary to complete small missions on their own behalf of these robots, which most often simply consist in eliminating a certain number of enemies. The action of All Zombies Must Die! therefore it takes place in this way: we are given a mission, almost always of collection, and we must complete it by making our way through the zombies, leveling our alter ego as a result of the killings, and then returning to the operational base which is located at the interior of abandoned police station. The problem is that this structure repeats itself practically indefinitely, and the introduction of new characters does not have the effect of changing things. In fact, from a gameplay point of view, one of the elements that works best is the arrival of always different zombies, equipped with particular abilities, but otherwise the experience ends up becoming quite monotonous iin a hurry and can't even count, as already mentioned, on an online multiplayer mode, which would certainly have made the atmosphere more sparkling and smoothed out the edges of the game a bit. Finally, as far as the technical aspect is concerned, the cartoonish drawing style is pleasant, the characters have good animations and even the scenarios are fairly characterized.", "date": "2012-04-10", "grade": "7.0"}
