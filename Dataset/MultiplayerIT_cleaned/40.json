{"name": "Columns - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/columns-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday. During the era of Nintendo dominance, at the time of the NES, Mario's company decided to launch a portable console that would revolutionize the way we played in a way comparable to what the walkman did for music: the GameBoy. Nintendo hadn't been the first to think about it, nor was the GameBoy the first portable device marketed. Yet, a winning combination of design, autonomy and software park determined the triumph of that console. The killer application, however, was just a puzzle: Tetris. Thus, Atari's Lynx was equipped with Klax, whose name was even assonant with that of the console. Sega, on the other hand, didn't limit itself to a home computer conversion, but produced an original, profound title that met with great public success: Columns. Published on Master System and Megadrive and later in portable version on Game Gear, Columns did not reach the brilliance of Tetris: but the game still stood out for its minimal charm and for the originality of the device. The Megadrive version is the one available today for Wii in all the glory of the original. What is it today. Columns is a simple puzzle, in which the player is forced to eliminate the gems that fall from the top of the playing area by aligning a minimum of three at a time vertically, horizontally or vertically. Gems fall in vertical groups of three. In addition to orienting the falling point, the player is allowed to change the vertical order of the three gems in the group to orient their colors and, therefore, plan their elimination. The mechanism is simple in its basic premises, but lends itself to a good deal of strategic complication in the prediction of ~accumulating~ combinations (which can grow to explosive proportions). The increasing speed of the difficulty levels also forces the player to increasingly rapid responses, minimal but perfect planning and an agreement between reflexes and strategy. Over the course of fifteen years, the puzzle game genre has experienced a certain ramification rather than evolution. Tetris has continued to build on the original formula (sometimes with the help of the third dimension) without any particular evolution of the quality of the original mechanism, Nintendo has worked with various developers on a series of unusual puzzles such as Tetris Attack and Wario's Woods, and Columns itself formed the starting point, together with titles such as Puyo Puyo, for a series of variations on the theme (not forgetting two sequels on Megadrive and the discreet Columns Crowns). The player therefore has many alternatives on the market, but it is still true that puzzle games are a type of game in which the extras, graphical cosmetics and alternative game modes have relatively little effect on a presentation with a high-level main mode. The publication of the subsequent episodes, which add very little to the original, seems unlikely. Therefore, the purchase of Columns can be said to be recommended to all enthusiasts of the genre, to those affected by nostalgia for a certain era (the music of Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos, exotic and melancholic, help well in this sense) and to all those who go looking for a multiplayer brain gym that remains top notch. If there is a genre of games that is completely safe from the passage of time even from a technological point of view, it is that of puzzle games. Essential bricks, basic formants and very simple decorative aesthetics, if minimal and stylish, continue to give a face to the real stake: the logical gear and the challenge to the player. Columns is now available in the Wii Virtual Console catalog. Are its sixteen-bit resolution gems and logic worth 600 Wii Points?", "date": "2007-03-12", "grade": null}
