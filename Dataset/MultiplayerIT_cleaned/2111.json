{"name": "Final Fantasy X", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-x-5.html", "text": "The saga continues on PS2... Final Fantasy X was born in the shadow of Final Fantasy VIII starting from the development team where several exponents who participated in the creation of the eighth chapter of the saga militate. They are: director Yoshinori Kitase, writer Kazushige Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, and designer Tetsuya Nomura. Composer Nobuo Uematsu is on the staff, but this time assisted by two other composers: Junya Nakano who worked on Another Mind and Threads of Fate and Masashi Hamauzu known for Front Mission and SaGa Frontier II. The singer Rikki instead recorded the beautiful ~Suteki da ne~ (in English ~Isn't it wonderful?~) which has already enchanted the eardrums of Japanese gamers. The plot of this tenth chapter is set in the aquatic world of Spira. The technologically advanced population of this strange world had been mysteriously destroyed by an evil force called Sin. Sin embodies all the evils of the aquatic world and is the primary threat to those who populate Spira also because it is difficult for them to know precisely where Sin will launch his attacks. The programmers of Squaresoft have given themselves a lot to do and have created a vast world full of environments detailed in every detail and chock full of locations to explore. You will be able to greatly appreciate the care taken in the creation of the backgrounds which demonstrates how Squaresoft is not a superficial producer, but always tries to offer the best to its users. Tidus, Yuna and company! The first character you will have to deal with in the game will be Tidus, a blond young man from the past who arrived in Spira without knowing the real reason why he came here. Tidus is skilled with a sword, but also an expert in Blitzball, a very popular water sport in the world of Spira. The female protagonist of the game instead responds to the name of Yuna. The beautiful Yuna is the daughter of a powerful ~summoner~ of Aeon and is also the victim of recurring nightmares behind which Sin's hand is surely hidden. The beautiful ~summoner~ will leave together with Tidus and the other party members in search of the different Aeon scattered throughout the Ebon temples in order to acquire and summon them in battles against the forces of evil. Only by acquiring all Aeon Yuna will he be able to destroy Sin. Tidus' task will be to stay by her side to protect her and help her complete the arduous mission. The infamous Sphere Board System! While Tidus and Yuna will be the main characters of the game, five other heroes will join the two during the adventure. They will be: Wakka, Lulu, Kimahri Lonzo, Rikku, and Auron. If you remember correctly in FFVIII each character had his own limit break: also in FFX it is present but under the name of Overdrive. The attack techniques used by Tidus are similar to those used by Squall Lionhearth in FFVIII. Auron instead will use an Overdrive in which you will have to press the right sequence of buttons to activate different types of combos with the sword. Each character will be characterized by a particular Overdrive that can be activated when the vital level suffers high damage that causes the Overdrive bar to rise. Characters can also make use of other skills, including spells, but these will have to be learned through a new acquisition method called the Sphere Board System. Instead of traditional experience points, party members will be able to acquire AP. Each AP a character gains raises their Sphere Level which will allow them to move along the Sphere Board and access Sphere items that will either impact stats or unlock new abilities. The Ap can therefore be used at will and at any time of the game to improve any parameter of your character. Logically, all of this has been studied by Squaresoft to make frequent random battles less frustrating, as only with the acquisition of AP can you improve your characters' abilities. Suaresoft has also drastically decreased the number of items to tidy up your menu! From now on, the only items needed in your inventory will be swords and shields! The effects of the Spheres will be varied and sometimes they will reveal skills that can only be learned by certain characters. The battle system presents some novelties: in addition to the attacks of the characters engaged in battle, you can deploy the Aeons themselves as additional characters. When the Aeons are summoned they remain present in battle and can be attacked by your enemies like normal characters: they stay by your side until you run out of HP prjust like normal characters. Also during the battles you can change the party to your liking by replacing the characters that compose it. When you are not engaged in battle, you can spend your time trying one of the many minigames scattered throughout the world of FFX. The funniest and most complete is certainly Blitzball, a strange underwater sport in which you'll have to try to score the most goals to win the game. The show has yet to begin! The graphic power of the PS2 clearly affects the final product of FFX and the graphics sector makes significant steps forward in terms of technology. The world of FFX is based on a polygonal realization instead of the pre-rendered backgrounds seen in the previous chapters. The creation of the FFX characters is very reminiscent of the one used in The Bouncer even if in essence from the point of view of the playability of the two titles they are completely different. The making of the movies has been done entirely in 3D and makes the story sequences more cinematic, although the view of the characters is still the one created through a fixed camera in perspective. As in Chrono Cross, the world of FFX is the first episode of the series to offer flesh-and-blood monsters that roam the game map. However only some bosses are displayed while the very boring random battles have not been eliminated even if the development team had hoped for it at the beginning, but due to the enormous work that was expected to make each creature visible on the map it dropped all hypotheses of project implementation. The most important news is the controversial use of voice acting in the story of Final Fantasy. In the most important scenes of the game you will no longer be limited to reading and scrolling through the sentences of the protagonists, but you will be able to hear their voices as in a real film: the words uttered will also be accompanied by the facial expressions of the characters. This possibility of listening to the dialogues can be deactivated by returning to the old subtitles that will appear on the game screen. Playing X with an eye to the future! Final Fantasy X arrives in Italy almost a year late compared to the Japanese version. Surely it would have been more appreciated if it had arrived with a less marked delay precisely because when it came out last year it was considered one of the best videogame realities on the market for PS2. With the release of games of the caliber of Metal Gera Solid 2 which, in addition to presenting immediate gameplay, have stratospheric graphics, perhaps a little interest has fallen above all in all those who would have lived Final Fantasy X as a mainly visual experience rather than from the point of view of the actual game. It is hard for those accustomed to action games to get used to the gameplay of an RPG like FFX, but perhaps the lack of graphically competitive games in June 2001 with the Squaresoft masterpiece would have contributed to the greater interest of users in experimenting with a new genre that showed innovative and rewarding characteristics. Unfortunately, the passage of time has never benefited technology which is always in continuous evolution and FFX is an example of how continuous evolution creates masterpieces destined to become very common titles within a year dominated by new and innovative giants as we now expect from Final Fantasy XI. Pro: Finally the tenth installment of the series! Extremely accurate graphics down to the smallest detail The battle system is similar to the traditional one with some small innovations that have a positive effect on the whole The Ap system is innovative and at the same time easy to learn Cons: Too bad it came out so late in Italy Sometimes it seems to me to relive the usual Final Fantasy storyline were it not for a few twists and turns Finally he has arrived! To be honest, I don't think I've ever waited as long in my life for the release of a game as in the case of Final Fantasy X. I started following the story of this title two years ago, and I still can't get over the fact that the beautiful DVD that contains this wonderful RPG has also arrived at my house. Despite having read a lot of news that helped to ruin the surprise in some cases by revealing a preview of some fundamental features of the plot, my desire to fully play FFX hasn't vanished at all, in fact I couldn't wait to find myself with the pad in my hands to intensely experience this new adventure by Squaresoft! I believe that few games manage to keep their charm intact despite their release being so distant from the different markets in which it is programmed.FFX in Japan is by now an obsolete game, a good memory which however has already passed, while in Italy we await it as the latest Square masterpiece given that the eleventh chapter for us Europeans is only a dream which will come true during 2003 if we will be lucky. There was talk of a release of FFX for the Italian market already for the end of December 2001: later the game was announced for mid-February 2002 and in the end it was postponed to May 29th 2002. This date will be remembered by all lovers of RPG and more, because believe me, FFX is truly a gaming experience that no one can fail to appreciate.", "date": "2002-05-29", "grade": null}
