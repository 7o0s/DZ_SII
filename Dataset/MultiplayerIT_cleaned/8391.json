The development seemed too far behind, especially from a technical point of view and considering what happened in the past with the Xbox 360 conversion of the first title, making a mistake again seemed really too easy. And unfortunately our worst predictions have come true, first with a series of delays that led to this PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 release that arrived almost four months after the PC edition and then with the conversion that we find ourselves in our hands and which, we say it right away, it doesn't shine for cleanliness and technical quality despite the renewed contribution of the Wizarbox guys. If nothing else, we appreciate the decision to include the first full-bodied DLC released for free in the conversions: The Temple of the Air which allows you to have a handful of additional quests and hours of gameplay set on an unpublished island. The end of the old world The inspiration that gives life to the series is the expulsion of the gods, with the fearsome titans, mythical elemental creatures, who suddenly find themselves free to roam the earth. In the first chapter our hero, armed with a blade and contemptuous of danger, finds himself having to face a titan who is hidden from view in the volcano of the island of Faranga. But the ending is just the beginning of a much larger story. In fact, the other titans are devastating the world and also the groups encountered on the first island, or Inquisition, Tribals and Villains, are a representation of great forces that play an important role in the plot of the title. Risen 2: Dark Waters starts right from a coastal fort of the Inquisition, with the main character playing the role of a lieutenant with a decidedly demotivated attitude. In fact, almost nothing is left of the old world except the city of Caldera which is already largely engulfed in flames. The sea is full of dangers and the kraken continues to sink all the imprudent vessels. The only hope is to migrate to the new world which is effectively a fantasy vision of thirteenth century South America complete with a Caribbean archipelago. However, the enchanting islands are the hunting ground of pirates and they have never got along with the law and uniforms. Fortunately, there is an ongoing split among the buccaneers and this allows us to once again support the beautiful Patty, daughter of Barba D'Argento, and to set sail towards new adventures using both the soldiers and the Inquisition as support. Unfortunately, being in the middle of two factions has its cons and obviously many other dangers lurk around the corner with omnipotent creatures, huge rock giants and a curse that is unpleasant to say the least. Simple but not linear In essence, the first Risen was the introduction to this sequel, with the world that in the second chapter opens up into a series of islands to explore. The aim is to recover four artifacts that as many greedy captains have pocketed by unleashing the aforementioned curse. The general feeling, we say it immediately, is the classic one of the Piranha Bytes titles, with ordinary men faced with immense powers in a mix between credible Middle Ages and fantasy at full speed. However, the pirate component that in the first chapter was linked to a couple of characters and here instead is at the center of everything grows dramatically, with our hero who finds himself having to mediate between pirates and soldiers by playing the role of the Caribbean buccaneer. A middle character therefore, who does not allied himself with any faction and who has accepted his role as a hero, despite the ironic vein that distinguishes him. There are some crossroads, but they are ends in themselves and do not produce upheavals in the game world. In essence, betraying an indigenous population or the Inquisition does not cause exile from a place and even after having made a terrible pirate flee we can easily go back to buying our grog from the fort's shop as if nothing had happened. An obviously functional choice that does not force the player to truncate subquests and links, but which does not have much role-playing. If nothing else, the contextual choices, the investigative quests and the various outcomes of numerous social missions still manage to give that role-playing feeling to the whole, thanks to the possibility of tackling almost all the tasks, including the missions of the main plot, in an absolutely not linear. There is no doubt, however, that in many respects the work of Piranha Bytes almost seems closer to an action adventure with extremely deep and varied gameplay rather thanto a classic RPG to which the German software house itself had accustomed us over the years. Stuffed fights The fulcrum of the action is represented by the duels between swordsmen, almost action style with aim lock on the opponent and dynamic exchanges of moves, parries and counter moves. But in Risen 2: Dark Waters this is expanded upon by guns, dirty tricks and even first person shotguns and spears. Unfortunately, the result is not perfectly balanced, probably due to too much difference between the various types of combat. Furthermore, the main character is much stiffer than seen in the first chapter of the series and the rifles allow you to exploit all the classic artificial intelligence displacement problems, typical of open world titles. Yet the whole is credible and initially, when money and experience points are scarce, it forces a careful evaluation of the skills to be learned since these radically influence the character's combat possibilities. Since the number of buttons on the pad is limited, the game relies on a pop-up radial menu that can be brought up by holding down the right backbone so as to allow the quick selection of eight different objects, weapons or dirty tricks. Obviously the configurability is total and the use of the menu pauses the game adding a pinch of tactics to the fights. Unfortunately, the types of monsters are few and some are decidedly uninspired. The artificial intelligence is also quite poor and even creatures that have defensive abilities can be fooled easily. To balance the developers have decided that the player can not parry the blows of the monsters granting us only a kick to remove the fangs or claws that try to bite into the flesh. This obviously gives great relevance to the approach phase and makes rifles much more useful than swords. In fact, sword fighting, which we discussed at the beginning of the paragraph, is evidently designed for clashes between human beings, with real combos of thrust and pistol. In a way it's a stretch, with the hero not being able to deflect a claw with the blade, but that differentiates hunting from dueling and creates two completely different types of gameplay. Paradoxically, the best made creatures are the animals that attack only when threatened and circle, charge and run in a much more believable way than the linear approach of monsters and humanoids. Playstation 3 trophies There are 57 trophies in Risen 2: Dark Waters including those related to the DLC already included in the game. Thirteen are secret and directly connected to key moments of the main quest while about half of the remaining ones are unlocked by carrying out secondary missions. There are numerous trophies related to the so-called collectibles such as the only gold trophy that is earned by carrying out 250 quests or the silver ones related to the killing of various quantities of enemies or the acquisition of large sums of gold. Obviously there is no shortage of the legendary platinum that will force you to play dozens and dozens of hours. The rise of a hero Risen 2: Dark Waters mon lacks the classic burglary, theft and crafting skills. Stealth is handled automatically by the game, although walking slowly is welcome and the knack for crouching and silently helps tremendously. The role-playing system is broken down into various character growth components. It starts from the five basic characteristics that can be upgraded to a maximum of eight levels by spending the glory or experience points that are earned by carrying out a very large number of actions in the game. They range from proficiency with blades and firearms, to stamina, cunning and voodoo. Each of these stats has three directly linked talents that grow automatically as the levels of the ~mother~ characteristic increase and based on equipment, possession of collectibles hidden throughout the game world and temporarily by drinking potions. To close the circle there are the skills, the highlight of the entire role-playing experience of Risen 2: Dark Waters. These can only be learned through the NPCs scattered around the game world who, with sound coins, will be able to teach us their knowledge as long as they have certain requirements: a certain level of the main characteristic and sometimes other interconnected skills. It is extremely important to carefully evaluate what to learn since without acquiring skills the character does not have the possibility to counterattack, dodge or perform critical hits. Sure, the ability to shoot an enemy during a dialoguego is tempting, but finding yourself paralyzed in front of a horde of rampaging pirates is not an experience to put in any self-respecting travel guide. The title includes all sorts of pirate suits, each with a bonus to a specific skill. The crafting is differentiated for rifles, swords and takes a completely different path in voodoo which allows you to create potions and dramatically enhance their effects as well as particular scepters to be used as weapons to significantly weaken the enemy or ~stimulate~ him to fight alongside us . Alongside the standard equipment there are also a series of specific objects related to the only two professions in the game: the seeker and the hunter. In essence, treasures must be dug up with a shovel and the mines, unlike those found by poor Christopher Columbus, are full of gold to be extracted with a pickaxe. Furthermore, the beasts, whose skin is worth almost as much as a precious gem, can be skinned, cut up and deprived of their tusks, which are also obviously precious. Well, each of these possibilities depends on a special tool to find, buy and always keep in your pocket. Xbox 360 goals Risen 2: Dark Waters offers 56 objectives for a total of 1100 points already containing the DLC dedicated to the Air Temple. Of this huge number, thirteen are secrets and all relate to very important moments of the main quest. Of the remaining objectives, a good half are related to side missions, while the others are part of the famous collectibles linked to particular actions and range from killing precise numbers of enemies, collecting certain quantities of gold, discovering hidden treasures and breaking into of locks. It will not be difficult to collect them all provided you have dozens of hours available. The first steps in the new world Risen 2: Dark Waters is not an extremely open-ended RPG. The playing areas are limited and the islands can be crossed in a few minutes. But at the same time all the locations are full of ravines, caves and hills that force the player to use the sense of direction more than what happens in completely open titles. Also, considering the action adventure structure of the title, the fact that the zones are clearly separated, which includes a loading screen for sea voyages between islands, is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, new microworlds to be explored from time to time make us feel like new Vasco De Gama with the sensation of discovery that is undoubtedly similar to the climates and atmosphere of the title. Furthermore, although they are always Caribbean islands full of plants, the artists of Piranha Bytes have done an excellent job of characterizing colors and places with huge waterfalls and grassy hills alternating with dark and deep canyons. Unfortunately the job is not as good in the case of dungeons. Simple caves and temples made up of a few square rooms are probably realistic but they don't do justice to a fantasy title about gods and ancient treasures. Apart from dungeons and free exploration, a large part of the developers' work was therefore spent on the context and on the narrative sector. The result is certainly excellent but such a setting does not allow record longevity. In forty hours it is possible to do various side quests and be ready to go towards the grand finale. Obviously the sauce gets longer if you decide to explore every nook and cranny of the explorable territories in search of every single treasure. We spend the last words for the crew that will accompany us on our itinerant journey. The game does not offer real party management but merely lets us be accompanied by a character among those we have convinced to follow us in our adventures. At any time we can go back on board our ship and choose another adventure companion but, once we get off the ground, he will just follow us and fight in a totally automatic way alongside us, remaining on the ground waiting for our treatment if hit in deadly way. In short, forget about party management in the classic sense or the possibility of venturing out accompanied by the strength of large numbers. A tragic console conversion Unfortunately the only real aspect where the console conversion heavily shows the side is in the graphic aspect. In fact, Risen 2: Dark Waters appears on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 not only technically greatly scaled down compared to the PC counterpart, as is normal on these occasions, but also with various problems following. The aesthetic sector is in fact able to offer glimpses that are also quite spectacular in outdoor situations with a pleasant rendering of the vegetation and the few structures", "date": "2012-08-01", "grade": "7.9"}
