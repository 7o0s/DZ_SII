{"name": "Desert Rats VS Afrika Corps", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/desert-rats-vs-afrika-corps.html", "text": "It's easy to say RTS The definition of RTS, Real Time Strategic (or strategic in real time), would fit perfectly on this title, were it not that over the years this definition has ended up being a trademark for all those games that have the characteristics of games like WarCraft. In fact, this genre usually provides that the player, in addition to relying on his own offensive troops, can dig mines and cut down trees to obtain the resources necessary for the production of units and buildings. Therefore, the single unit deployed in the field very often risks not having the right weight in the battle, and the weight is almost not felt even for huge losses since, in abundance of resources, it is possible to continue a sufficient production to complete the mission. In DSAK, however, things go a little differently. After the briefing phase, in which the mission objectives are set out, the player is asked to spend a certain amount of points to compose his own army for the following mission by choosing from an assortment of infantry, motorized and air unit types. Based on the choices made at the beginning of the level, the player will have to pass the mission without being able to count on other troops. This heavily affects the entire game setup. The classic RTS does not face the preventive organization of the mission, thus leaving open the taste of creating your own customized tactic based only on information regarding the position of the troops at the start of the mission and the primary objective. Strategy and military tactics, therefore, match for once properly and for this reason we can speak of a Real Time Tactic game rather than a strategic one. The story: four gentlemen, a young lady and the war. The story is not always important in a strategy game. Sometimes it seems almost put there to make sense of everything, a minimum of cohesion, other times it is just mentioned, still others it merges to such an extent with the game itself that it becomes a cult for fans (see the Warcraft and Starcraft saga). In the case of DRAK the historical context would already be enough to outline most of the events; it would be enough to stick to the facts to build a plot full of twists and turns. Nonetheless, the developers have well thought of stuffing everything with a subtle and intelligent film plot. Four officers from four different countries engaged in the African campaign share a crucial experience for their lives as the world powers squeeze every last drop of their forces to prevail over the opposing faction. Lafarge is an officer of the French legion at odds with the puppet government of Vichy, and therefore locked up as a prisoner in a fort in the heart of the desert; with him is an Englishman, also a prisoner. The furtive intervention of Gosling, a US officer, however daring, manages to give the two freedom and the assembled group sets off in an attempt to rejoin the ranks of the allies. On the way back, the group comes across the carcass of a German panzer. Lurking under his shadow Hartmann, a Nazi officer, stealthily waits for the convoy, gun in hand. But at the moment of the clash, when Sinclair and Hartmann come face to face ready to shoot an extraordinary thing happens, the two, both Olympic athletes, recognize each other as the two athletes who a few years earlier had shared the joy of triumph at the Berlin Games . Unable to pretend that their respective countries are not in conflict, the two promise each other a personal truce in honor of their old friendship. The four thus reach the meeting point with La Fleur, a seductive French actress who has long been a collaborator of the allied forces, with the aim of getting to safety on board the plane she piloted. But when it's time to leave, due to an excessive load, Hrtmann decides to remain on the ground to cover the back of his newfound friend, and then rejoin the arriving German troops. Thanks to the initial plot, the player will follow the story passing from one faction to another and following the events of the protagonists from one side of the barricade to the other. The five initial characters, combined with a host of supporting actors will form the key figures of the game. These ~heroes~ will have a very important weight in the game and their life will have to be preserved at any cost. A zoom on the game The approach to the game differs little from the canons of the classic RTS, starting from the management of the movements and actions of the troopsending with the special abilities assigned to heroes. Each unit will be able to count on detailed characteristics that define its performance in battle, accuracy in hitting the target, resistance and speed in action. Special units such as the doctor can provide service directly in the field in a totally automatic and intelligent way; for this you will not be forced to chase crazed doctors who run after the wounded exposing themselves to the danger of being killed. The troop specializations, very numerous and customized for each army corps in the game, have a huge impact on strategy. For example, a machine gun operator on the ground will be able to mow down an entire platoon with ease, while a rifleman, much more agile, is more suitable for outflanking missions, just as the sniper will be more suitable for quick and isolated actions, or precision and absolute accuracy. There is also the possibility of occupying buildings and controlling vehicles of all kinds. In the first case, a building, depending on the case, will be able to provide a bonus on the resistance of the units and an advantage on the accuracy of the hits, while, as regards the vehicles, it will be possible to have advantages on mobility and attack power. A vast range of heavy and non-heavy vehicles, starting from motorcycles with sidecars to ending with the most impressive armored vehicles, can be controlled by occupying them with their own units. The occupants often die before the vehicle is totally destroyed, for this reason it is possible to take possession of unattended enemy vehicles, as it is possible to abandon a vehicle that is too damaged and therefore risky for the lives of the units present in it. At the time of occupation, the insignia of your army will be displayed on the vehicle, with a very pleasant result. Imagine being able to control a tank flying the Italian flag with the royal coat of arms, it is certainly a rather rare and particular thing, being always used to being considered an irrelevant minority in games of the genre. It will also be possible to invoke the intervention of the air force, which will be able to drop bombs, fire on enemy troops or simply patrol a territory that is currently unreachable. The different game modes allow you to travel the story along different paths, and it will be possible to choose whether to take sides only on one of the two fronts or to choose a more complete approach by following the story that intertwines the events of the allies with those of the axis. There is also a multiplayer mode. Technicalities DRAk is certainly worthy of being defined as a quality product. Graphically satisfying, the game can count on a decent graphics engine, which, while not presenting anything extraordinary or revolutionary, seems to lend itself very well to the task assigned to it. The camera rotates 360, zooms in and pans; the shadows are dynamic and follow the direction of the sun. Vehicles and ammunition finished on the ground leave their mark, and are very slow to disappear, which is very important for strategic purposes. The player will have 8 different types of specialized infantry and 7 vehicle categories at his disposal. Each armament has its own characteristics (in addition to a personalized set of sounds), each weapon will have its impact on the battlefield, therefore a good tactical skill is required to choose the best starting equipment. The level of artificial intelligence present in the game is remarkable, and supported by a series of devices that can only improve the governance of the actions. The player can create even very large groups of units and assign them up to a maximum of three instructions at a time. The animations of the soldier and vehicle models do justice to the originals, as does the entire audio system, designed with great care. The soundtrack, worthy of the best war film, composed by BAFTA Award winners Tamas Kreiner and Ervin Nagy, was recorded at the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. Final comments Ultimately, the game appears to be a good investment for all those who love this very particular historical period and for those who want to put their nerves, brains and strategist qualities to the test. Quality, fun, compelling storyline and good gameplay, combined with the tactical approach of the game give this title an unexpected caliber. Pros: Compelling story The more tactical approach to the game is highly appreciated Many types of units, vehicles and weapons present Praiseworthy audio system Cons: The zoom only achieves a real 12 meters of detail, but what's the use of a more detailed zoom? The scenarios are not very varied, being North Africa they are mainly desert The epic charm of the Second World War has been tickling the imagination of screenwriters and directors for years. Some to do justice to the heroic deeds and patriotic spasms of the period, some not to forget its horrors, some simply to tell a story that touches everyone's heart in every corner of the planet. Despite cinema being its greatest user, even the much more restricted and young panorama of videogames hasn't hesitated over the years to plunder with both hands that so bitter glimmer of history of the last century. Platform, arcade, shooter and strategy, without exception, have taken advantage of this opportunity as they cannot in any way miss out on such a popular theme. The developers of Digital Reality, a bubbly Hungarian software house, certainly could not abstain from the race. The passion for the strategic genre, already demonstrated with Platton and Haegemony, has not shown signs of diminishing. Desert Rats VS Afrika Corps, the latest jewel of the Hungarian company, is ready to conquer the videogame market and claim its share of success.", "date": "2004-04-01", "grade": null}
