{"name": "Everybody's Golf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everybodys-golf.html", "text": "Minna no Golf, which we have become Everybody's Golf, is a simulation that boasts legions of admirers in Japan and which relies on a truly immediate and immediately captivating game system, let's analyze it in detail. The single player game is divided into three modes: the Stroke Competition that allows us to compete in the circuits that we have unlocked, the Putt which is a 9-hole competition that takes place exclusively on the green, and finally the Challenge which is the real heart of Everybody's Golf. In this last mode we will play a regular season on the various 9 or 18 hole courses that we will be able to unlock, by winning these tournaments we will get new objects and new characters that we will be able to use during the game. The ability to change the characters and their clothing, their hairstyle and their accessories is certainly an incentive to continue playing and is one of the peculiarities of this light-hearted golf series. All these modes can also be exploited in multiplayer by exploiting the wireless connection of which the PSP is equipped, giving life to challenges of the past at the last hole. All modes can be enjoyed in wireless multiplayer for up to eight players As in almost all sports titles, it is also possible to train to improve one's shots, the ability to give effect to the ball or to increase the length of our swing, all essential things for a career golfer. The game interface is very simple and immediate to master. The swing is based on an indicator located at the bottom of our display which must be started by pressing a key which then, with the right timing, must be risked to determine the power of the shot and the precision in hitting the ball. It is also possible to set this last function automatically and therefore focus our attention exclusively on the power of the swing. When the power bar starts flowing under our eyes it will be possible, using the directional cross, to give the effect to the ball, in order to make it ~run~ or trying to make it stop when it touches the grass. Starting to play won't be difficult but perfectly mastering our shots won't be a trivial matter, we will always have to take into consideration some variables such as the wind and the inclination of the ground, and the phase of approach to the hole will be very delicate above all. Everything that takes place on the green is, in fact, fundamental to the success of our challenge. The green display mode will help us, showing us the slope of the land with very thin luminous lines that will increase the speed as the slope of the lawn increases. The technical realization of the SCE title is certainly valuable, even if having focused everything on a cartoony and unrealistic look did not force the developers to make the most of the PSP hardware. The colors are very bright and the characters absolutely caricatured and full of the right appeal, it almost seems to see a classic Japanese ~anime~. The interlude scenes that see our character celebrate in the event of a birdie or suffer in the event of a bogey are very beautiful. There are a total of ten golfers, five caddies and six courses of increasing difficulty. The greatest flaw of Everybody's Golf is also one of its strengths; in the sense that a big incentive to continue playing is certainly given by unlocking new characters with their items, unfortunately this ~search~ becomes quite long and at times frustrating, it could certainly have been better managed by the developers. Another significant lack to be attributed to the SCE title is the fact that it does not have an online mode; certainly the possibility of challenging friends equipped with PSP is very satisfying, but the presence of an online structure would have greatly facilitated the possibility of finding opponents, not to mention the positive impact it would have had on the longevity of Everybody's Golf. Our assessment of Everybody's Golf can only be positive: a good game, technically well done and capable of bringing even non-experts closer to golf with its freshness and immediacy. Certainly the lack of an online mode and the sometimes frustrating behavior of the CPU slightly affect the evaluation. In conclusion, we strongly advise you to try the SCE title, you will not regret it and you will understand that between a Wipeout Pure and a Virtua Tennis: World Tour, a relaxing game of golf is what you need. Pros Immediate and engaging Good technical realization Multiplayer up to eight players Cons At times a bit frustrating Lack of an online mode After making herself loved on mother Sony's home consoles, the Everyb seriesody's Golf lands on the first portable console of the Japanese company. Among our favorites in the European launch lineup of the PSP, we have to admit, the title of SCE was not present, but after playing it for a long time we have become infected and our opinion has radically changed.", "date": "2005-10-05", "grade": null}
