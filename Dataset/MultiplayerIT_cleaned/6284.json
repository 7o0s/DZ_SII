Homesick is also a game that fails to fully express its potential. A lazy yawn is the simple introduction to his world. We get up from an old mattress and observe the environment around us. From the open windows enters a blinding light, in the truest sense of the word. In fact we can't walk under direct sunlight, otherwise the screen goes blank and we are pushed back to the first shaded space. The entire environment is in a state of disrepair, like a hastily abandoned, radiation-skinned city. Are we in a school? In a hospital? Difficult to say, also because each book or document is written in a non-existent, incomprehensible language. At least up to a certain point in the game, but we'll come back to that later. We therefore find ourselves shrouded in mystery from the very first moments, with our minds full of questions. We can only open the cupboard drawers, look for clues in the rooms, collect some objects. Calm, sleepy gestures that convey a sense of torpor. Although this approach binds very well to the atmosphere that reigns around us, it is detrimental to the player's attention. Indeed, Homesick lacks a purpose linked to the character we play, of which we know nothing until almost the end of the game. There is no purpose that can overcome our resistance and make us participants in a story. We will see later that each area still has an always the same goal to achieve, albeit with different means each time, but it is too disconnected from any explicit will of the character to make it ours. The light, ethereal world of Homesick is fatally weightless, and like a balloon it flies out of our hands, leaving little or nothing behind. So is Homesick a walking simulator? In part yes, because we are forced to walk calmly in its environments, but the environmental narration does not stimulate us to continue, full of wonder and curiosity as happens for example in Dear Esther. In Homesick, on the other hand, there are puzzles to solve and precise actions to take in each section of the game, otherwise you won't continue. That's when running becomes a desire and finally a frustrated necessity, because having to walk slowly to get back to the rooms you've already visited in search of a solution is exhausting. On the one hand we therefore have beautiful environments and a soundtrack that accompanies us gently, on the other a game system that denies the relaxed and disengaged approach of the anonymous protagonist, insisting on puzzles. And then there are the hatchet sections. It's best to talk about these right away. Homesick is an ephemeral and rarefied walk, a beautiful box of memories without surprises But not at night If we look away from the beautiful screens and don't let ourselves be tempted by the notes of the sweet soundtrack, we clearly see that Homesick is based on a rigid and repetitive game system. A closed door separates each section from the next. To open this door we must perform certain actions and follow a precise ritual: fill the bucket we carry with water and water the withered flowers so that they return to show their splendid blue petals. Once this is done we have to find a bed and sleep. When we wake up, night has fallen, we have an ax in hand and we have to run without stopping too long in the same spot, otherwise the screen goes black and the protagonist wakes up. These game sections, surprising compared to what we've seen and done during the day, are a great missed opportunity. At night we only have to run up to the door that we couldn't reach before and destroy it with an axe. The path is short and unobstructed, so the only difficulty is that you may have forgotten a key action during the day, like flipping a light switch or removing the hooks from the case that holds the hatchet. Elementary actions that are usually corrected with a second attempt. Well, the first time we saw this nightmarish section we wondered what terrifying awaited us ahead, but it didn't take much to understand that it's just another routine action, a simple reference to a fact from the past that is discovered end. The puzzles on the other hand are quite interesting, despite some repetition, such as having to find a bathtub twice to fill the same bucket of water. Instead, we remember with pleasure the moment we finally learned to read. As children, we rediscovered the letters of the alphabet in a touching and poetic way, playing with wooden dice forgotten in the rooms. On that occasion, Homesick made brilliant use of puzzles, which would have been nice to see in other sections of the game. Unfortunately the title ends just when we begin to discover the world of him. He sows many evocative images behind him, but he lacks the narrative force necessary not to scatter them like dust blown off an old album of memories.", "date": "2015-06-04", "grade": "6.5"}
