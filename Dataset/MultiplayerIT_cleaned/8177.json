And so if in mid-October we found ourselves playing the excellent Dishonored, now it's the turn of another stealth game, but this time with a third person view and free camera, Hitman: Absolution. To talk about the titles related to the series in question there is always a certain reverence, either because the brand has now quickly entered the hearts of a large part of video game enthusiasts, or due to the particular charm of its protagonist. After all, the monk, an assassin distinguished by the number 47 dressed in a black tuxedo, white shirt and red tie, has for years been an undoubtedly charismatic character and one of the most loved by the public. Also for this reason Absolution, the first conceived entirely for next-gen consoles, was and is without a doubt one of the most awaited titles of this year. Developed by IO Interactive, this new episode promises to bring the genre back to the celebration of the stealth mechanics that made the fortune of the first chapters of the saga. How? Let's find out together. The elimination on behalf of the Agency of an old friend, and the ~recovery~ of little Victoria, a very important young woman for the organization's projects and keeper of a secret that we obviously don't want to reveal to you, are the prelude to a story with a not very original plot, but still full of twists and turns, which it will lead Agent 47 to stand right against the ICA and to face his past. The adventure in this sense is structured in missions, about twenty, with maps of considerable size built in order to simulate open world environments, so as to move all the gameplay on the decisions made by the player, who has great freedom of action. Hitman: Absolution in fact, does not oblige the user to strictly follow a particular approach or a specific predefined path to complete a task, but leaves him free to act as he sees fit, except in some cases where there are sequences linear heavily scripted to look spectacular. It being understood that the title developed by IO Interactive encourages and rewards stealth-type action. In reality, compared to the previous chapters of the series, here we are not dealing with sandbox maps in all respects since each single level is divided into more or less large sub-sections where Agent 47 must fulfill certain objectives and therefore reach the exit to go to the next area. This is a ploy adopted by the developer probably to keep the breadth of the scenario under control and the management of the many characters on the screen as well as to offer a better structured, albeit slightly more guided, gaming experience. This particular subdivision of the levels then collides with a truly anomalous rescue management that sometimes pushes the trial and error mechanics typical of the stealth genre excessively. In fact, the game only offers manual checkpoints scattered in an extremely limited number within the sections (very often there is only one or even none) which can be activated by Hitman only when he is anonymous. This means that when you die or you want to try to repeat a phase to perform a cleaner or more spectacular action, you are very often forced to restart from the beginning of the level or from a very backward checkpoint, effectively forcing the player to putting up with dialogues already heard or walking around an area for a long time before returning to the point that saw his death or that prompted him to try again. The ways of murder are endless Returning to the discourse inherent in the playful structure of the product, the basic mechanics are simple: the position of the primary objective to be eliminated is known in broad terms, usually surrounded by guards and located in some sector that is not easily accessible without being noticed. But how to get from the starting point A to the finishing point B to complete the level, how many people will be killed along the way, the way, the times in which to dress up or how much the surrounding environment will be used to hide or to eliminate any guards, is left to the imagination and skills of the gamer. Just to give some concrete examples, you can decide to eliminate a criminal quickly and strikingly, shooting him from a distance with a sniper rifle or blowing him up perhaps after luring him into a trap. Or choose less noisy and flashy methods, strangling him in an isolated alleyor, by stabbing him while he is standing in front of a stall intent on choosing the right ingredients to season a sandwich he wants to buy, or even while he is walking on the sidewalk, blending into the crowd using a disguise to go unnoticed. Just the lack of ~spectators~ to the crimes to be committed is an element not to be underestimated in Hitman: Absolution since this allows the player to receive a good final score. In fact, one of the most interesting elements of the product is the particular classification system which evaluates the gamer's way of acting in real time, assigning him a vote at the end of each mission based on performance and taking into account parameters such as the number of witnesses, precisely , who witnessed the assassination, the degree of difficulty in carrying out one's task, the number of innocent people killed or that of opponents (it is often advisable to avoid eliminating too many), the times in which one has been identified, and etc. A vote that is certainly not positive can have negative repercussions on the advancement of the characteristics of the character, who makes use of an upgrade system that allows him to increase his assassin skills and to unlock new useful characteristics for subsequent missions. Xbox 360 goals Hitman: Absolution features 46 Achievements for a total of 1000G. To obtain them you have to indulge yourself by performing different types of actions, such as for example killing 47 enemies with headshots with a sniper rifle, eliminating the Saints, playing a contract created by a friend or obtaining the Silent Assassin rating, and so on. The killer instinct The scenarios can also hide sub-missions, so what initially may seem like a ~simple~ mission to escape or kill a boss can also turn into something else. This factor encourages the player to explore, interact and study well every little detail of the areas in which he is located if he wants to complete the product one hundred percent to the point that it will very often be necessary to replay the individual missions several times to complete all the challenges ~ hidden~ in each level. The quotation marks are a must since in reality at any time it is possible to pause the game and watch a comfortable summary screen illustrating those still to be completed. An idea from the developer to meet the laziest players but which sometimes leads to annoying spoilers by actually suggesting the most imaginative methods to carry out the murder within each level. The key element of the gameplay, however, is the Instinct. By committing crimes and managing the scenario properly, the gamer can load this particular ability of the bald assassin by activating it with the simple press of one of the back buttons. In this way it is possible to highlight the enemy presences in the vicinity (even beyond the walls) and the direction of their future movements, with the main objectives to be eliminated in red, and with yellow potential dangers, secondary victims or other points of interest of the scenario such as interaction zones, or potentially useful elements such as glasses, bottles or sticks. Each setting in this sense is literally dotted with objects that can be used both as improvised weapons and as a source of distraction to attract enemy attention elsewhere. If necessary, a sort of bullet time can also be activated, a function through which it is possible to spend part of the Instinct bar to manually select the individual enemies to be killed while time is slowed down to then kick off extremely precise and choreographic. In all of this, the artificial intelligence of the enemies performs quite well, albeit with some small defects typical of this type of product, obviously in relation to the degree of difficulty chosen at the beginning of the game. Of these there are five: the first two, Easy and Normal, are suitable for ~normal~ users and constitute a standard level of challenge, while the remaining three are perfect for ~pro~ players. The last options mentioned, in fact, make the experience even more complex since it increases not only the damage inflicted by enemies, but also their ability to identify the bald killer while he is hiding, and the number of guards present on each map. In addition, instinct is heavily limited in its functioning, to become practically absent in an attempt to offer the most realistic stealth experience possible. Playstation 3 trophies To be in keeping with the protagonist, Hitman: Absolution offers 47 trophies, two of which are gold and eleven silver, in addition to the inevitable trophy. Asfor Xbox 360 achievements, many prizes are linked to the completion of the main story and the execution of all the challenges proposed in each level but there is no shortage of trophies linked to the use of specific weapons or to the achievement of particularly imaginative murders. Not an easy challenge The last level of difficulty in particular is really difficult since it even deprives the user of the interface, forcing him to proceed without objective indicators or counting of remaining ammunition. But already at the Normal level the degree of challenge offered by the IO Interactive title is still very respectable, with the opponents attentive to every suspicious movement even if in some situations a vaguely compartmentalized structure is noticed, with the guards assigned to a certain room which tend to remain there despite something obvious perhaps having happened in the one next to it, giving agent 47 the possibility in case of identification to go back to the beginning of the level to lose track of him. This limitation becomes less evident at higher difficulty levels, where the guards, as mentioned before, are present in greater numbers, and above all where identification almost always corresponds to an immediate death. In fact, the enemies do not hesitate for a moment to hunt down the killer managed by the gamer, filling him with hot lead. Speaking of shootings, it should be noted that the cover system works quite well in these situations, following in the concept that of modern third-person shooters, vice versa the artificial intelligence loses almost all its charm and credibility in these moments, giving life in unbelievable and funny firefights. But on the other hand it must be added that in Hitman: Absolution that of shootings is a lateral and secondary aspect. Still remaining in the field of novelty, another interesting one is the mode called Contracts. This takes advantage of a sort of editor and through the online then allows you to share your ~creations~, if we can define them that way, with the rest of the world, stimulating other users to carry out the same mission in one way rather than another, improving perhaps the score of the gamer who created and shared the content, collecting the relative reward. Death contracts Going into detail, every single level of the main adventure can be played in creation mode: here, the potential victims are chosen up to a maximum of three units among the various NPCs present in the scenario, and the way out of it, the Agent 47 can be sneaked around the level, using whatever tactics you like to take out the characters you want. These become mandatory for anyone who decides to try to complete the contract conceived and shared on the net like the ~rules~ decided by the user who created everything, such as a limit of days within which the challenge will remain active, or the weapons available to the would-be killer, setting in motion a frenetic mechanism that will allow anyone to indulge themselves by choosing the most imaginative and effective techniques. Precisely on the subject of weapons, it is a pity to note the precise choice of the developer to eliminate one of the tactical elements that have made the fortune of the series: the possibility of choosing the paraphernalia at the beginning of the mission. In Hitman: Absolution, Agent 47 is armed automatically based on the mission and how the previous sections of the same level ended and there are even some contracts in which the killer is without his iconic silenced pistols. Fortunately, the great availability of blunt and sharp weapons present on the scenario, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, partially manage to compensate for this questionable decision by the developer. Going to conclude, we dedicate the final notes as always to the technical sector. From the point of view of graphics, the game has its ups and downs: the design of the environments is excellent, the attention to detail in some areas and the creation of the main characters, who boast more than convincing polygonal models, credible facial expressions, beautiful animations and a certain ability to keep the average quality always at the same level. The figures in the background are decidedly worse, too similar to each other and poorly finished in some cases, and there is also some occasional uncertainty in terms of vertical synchrony of the image. However, everything is balanced by the good use of particle effects, especially those related to atmospheric events, and the skilful play of light and shadow that give the eye an overview capable of leaving behind the counting of polygons or some textures less performing than the average.
