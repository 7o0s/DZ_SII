Let's start immediately by confirming what was possible to deduce by reading between the lines of the previous two tests and which appears clear in the final code. The latest work Dice is a rather marked change of course compared to the prototype, placing itself in the wake of Modern Warfare 2, reinventing itself as an extremely linear, scripted title, with very varied missions thanks also to the use of the most disparate means. However, all this cancels the open spaces of the first title, placing the player in a narrow ~track~, which it is still possible to widen dramatically given the destruction of a large part of the scenario guaranteed by the renewed and sumptuous Frostbyte 2.0. 12 stations to hell The story that binds the twelve missions starts immediately with a first twist. We are in 1944 in the role of a group of marines intent on recovering a defecting Japanese scientist, creator of a secret weapon capable of reversing the tide of the conflict. Obviously something will go wrong, dooming the recovery mission to failure. After a leap of seventy years we find ours in Siberia, during what is in all respects the third world war. In the role of soldier Marlowe we have to assist one of our agents sent into enemy territory to collect something, something that we will discover to be what was lost in the initial prologue. Here too everything will go wrong, the four will find themselves forced to literally chase the weapon, up and down South America, between deserts, jungles, forests, ancient villages and burning cities. The dynamics between the various members of the team are presented to us in a more serious way, we laugh and laugh often but thanks to the last-ditch atmosphere, the black comedy register of the first chapter is here made less evident, given that they come to personal thoughts and problems often surface, in order to make it easier and more immediate to become attached to the members of ~bad company~. This greater deepening of the personalities of our heroes (without however falling into long and boring internal monologues) does not find the right foothold in the way the events are narrated. The story is presented to us in a very ~flat~, ~quiet~ way, without the baroque excesses (perhaps hardly intelligible) of the Activision-branded competition. The progress of the events, the various turning points and more or less phoned twists that follow one another, do not strike the player strongly, the cut scenes, technically stunning both from a visual point of view and for the quality of the Italian dubbing, have the only function of connection between the various theaters of battle, not giving that added value to the story. In about 8-10 hours of play everything works, the thread of the conversation is not lost, but the impression is that the urgency of the Bad Company's actions, the drama of the events in which they find themselves fail to hit the stomach player like Modern Warfare 2 had been able to do. This is not a particular reference to No Russian, the story does not try at all costs to resemble that of a Tom Clancy film, which is good because in this way you are released from the continuous search for the biggest bang or the most unsettling twist. thus avoiding the inherent dangers of such a choice, but on the other hand it is also a bad thing because one runs the risk of following an ~unspectacular~ path, a sort of aurea mediocritas, in the positive and literal sense of the expression, i.e. that of an optimal moderation, in short, without any excess, upwards or downwards. The same thing happens for the goodness of the missions that await us. If in MW 2 (impossible not to mention the competition when Dice decided to place themselves on the same level) some were frankly unsuccessful, while others were very classy, in a constant ~up and down~ for all three acts of the game, in Battlefield : Bad Company 2 this does not happen, there are no style drops and parts that don't work (perhaps only the only short final mission), but at the same time there are not even unforgettable moments, not even in the opening bars which represent the best part of the game. He says nothing is wrong, each mission is a clockwork mechanism that doesn't miss a beat, but everything runs away all too smoothly, we have a lot of fun but the impression is that once the game is over it disappears in a flash from our heads. In short, it seems that the developers wanted to dare little in the writing phase, what comes out is a practically perfect little homework, but cold and without particular flashes. Waiting then for the obvious and ~revealed~ third cchapter... Guaranteed destruction Leaving the examination of the narrative mechanisms, it's time to talk about the mechanics of the game. As written at the beginning Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has become in all respects a classic fps, the wide spaces, a certain sense of freedom of movement almost like free roaming of the first chapter have now given way to dynamics closer to a taste mainstream, casual if you will. Thankfully the level design and destructive capacity of Frostbyte 2.0 widen the horizons, but all those expecting to find a larger and more detailed Serdaristan be warned. The game excels in taking us to the most diverse scenarios, we start in the Russian ice and end up in free fall, passing through jungles, rivers and scorching deserts. In order not to miss anything, it is also possible to drive quad bikes, tanks, armed boats, UAVs and be a machine gunner on helicopters and trucks. There is everything that such a game can and must offer and from this point of view Dice is not stingy with locations and possibilities. There are also missions that ~quote~ other titles, such as the one in which we have to snipe from above, covering ourselves with the sound of thunder, the guards of a village or one in which we have to avoid freezing in the high mountains (the icy and shaky view is beautiful ) by blowing up the usual explosive barrels to warm us up. Linearity and scripting, quite evident in some situations, however, are cornered when the player is given the opportunity to create his own path within the villages, real arenas in which the level design is so meticulously designed by allow us a freedom of action never seen before. What is most surprising in the world created by Dice is the management of spaces, which are never simple flat tables cluttered with objects with which to shelter. The verticality of the scenarios is one of the main characteristics: in urban areas, or rather those in which the huts give way to cities or small settlements, there are two or three-storey houses, one is constantly surrounded by enemies every window or roof, plus obviously those attacking us on the street. It is possible to enter or climb each building, we can blow the covers with the Gustav or the grenade launcher, and if we see a nice group of explosive red barrels one can be sure that a choreographic collapse will level that building by obscuring our view with the rising dust. Of course, if we can destroy enemy shelters, so can they. So here you never stand still for a second, either because even reinforced concrete crumbles in an instant, or because grenades and missiles at any level of difficulty chosen are never lacking. From this point of view Bad Company 2 proves to have the best fps mechanics of the moment, it takes the best from the competition, leaving out the ~free roaming~ aspect and strengthening everything with the destructive wonders of the Frostbyte, encouraging the movements to take the enemies. The scripting cross and delight of this generation of shooters is not too invasive and fortunately the continuous respawning of the enemies is completely absent, indeed after a good shooting, when an unreal silence hangs in the air, the voice of one of the our comrades who warns us to go further. Obviously there is always the danger of memorizing the positions of the enemies to take them out without problems, but fortunately our opponents demonstrate good intelligence, varying their movements and covering each other. Sometimes, however, the scripting shows the rope, affecting the compactness and ~credibility~ of the scene shown. During one of the final missions, before passing the trigger, i.e. the ~clap~ for the next scene, the motionless ~actors~ were already visible ready to go into action, a perfect target for our XM8 with optics. Naturally this is an extreme case, but the impression is that sometimes areas are formed in which enemies engulf and stop, nullifying the good artificial intelligence implemented in the game. It was initially said that the large spaces, and therefore the exploration they guaranteed, are absent. It is certainly so, but at the same time the game invites us to sift through the areas inch by inch, to find the enemies' weapons (which will then be made available whenever we come across equipment crates), and to destroy communication equipment, all conveniently marked on the map. The beauty of razing to the ground From a technical point of view the game is absolutely without reservations. For this review Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was installed on a rather powerful PC with a lot of Direct X 11 supplied, but it was also played on Xbox anyway360 and PlayStation 3. Any gaming platform has returned sumptuous results, both for detail and for fluidity, but the striking global impact is impressive, thanks to all those graphic delicacies, from shaders, to bumb mapping, passing through lighting dynamics and volumetric mists (or both as in the humid Bolivian forests) that the game bestows at every turn. Not to be underestimated then the beautiful cutscenes that return close-up textures to the maximum of their splendor and which, as written above, are very well recited and dubbed. If in the clashes the game stretches its muscles, with whole parts of the scenario falling apart, credible physics brings alive the barrage of explosions, with rubble flying everywhere, with smoke and dust that all too often blocks the view, making the game even more realistic. Another great advantage of Bad Company 2 is that it sends hyper-detailed scenarios of almost colossal visual depth and breadth to video, nothing to do with certain bitmaps that delimited the environments of the competition. Obviously so much visual majesty has only scenographic functions (Bad Company 2 is not Crysis, yes we see an endless valley, but we can only go through a narrow gorge inside it) but it is undeniable that this manages to amaze whenever it happens, and this is often recurring given Dice's predilection for starting missions from the top. Alongside the visual excellence, however, there is another one, the one concerning the sound sector. The soundtrack can be listened to with extreme pleasure, alternating ~classic~ instrumental pieces for the most important moments, with others in which, to underline lighter situations in which the team takes a breather, a piece with clear 50s notes starts . The audio track then literally explodes with sound effects, if possible the best ever inserted in a fps. The realism of the sounds is not limited to a perfect and obvious sampling, but to an incredible positioning and modification of the same according to the emission point. In this sense, being able to play Battlefield: Bad Company 2 with a 5.1 system is an unforgettable experience. Furthermore, if the view is obscured thanks to the smoke and dust raised by the clashes, even the hearing can be partially knocked out, or when a grenade exploded too close deafens us and makes our ears ring for a few seconds too long. Network War If until just over a month ago the single player campaign was a mystery since Dice hadn't leaked anything about it, the multiplayer instead, thanks to the beta sessions played several times on all the output platforms, is certainly a well-known thing. Compared to the first beta on PlayStation 3, the developers have declared that they have made more than a hundred corrections in the most diverse sectors, and without a doubt it is possible to say that the excellent work done for the single-player campaign finds its perfect equivalent in the multiplayer one. There are four game modes, next to the team deathmatch, there are the modes that represent the core of the Bad Company 2 multiplayer offer, or Conquest, Race and Team Race. All three are structured in objectives, thanks to which the absence of a real cooperative mode in the game becomes less heavy, in the light of the fact that the specialization of the soldier class chosen and acting as a team are essential requirements for come to victory. Conquista is a sort of capture the flag, while running requires us to destroy - or defend - M-Com stations (2 in Team Run and 6 in ~Simple Run~). The proposed menu would seem not too elaborate, but multiple factors, all well balanced and amalgamated with each other, complicate things, making the development of the games very tactical and reasoned, perhaps a little less frenetic than the competition. First of all, even here there are no safe covers, everything can be razed to the ground, therefore it is necessary to move continuously. The maps (for a total of ten) are huge, and offer multiple tactical possibilities, including buildings and dense vegetation, construction sites, bridges and snowy landscapes. It is impossible to travel the larger ones from one end to the other, so here is at our disposal a series of vehicles such as tanks, light armored vehicles, jeeps, quads, troop transports and helicopters, which might seem to be the masters of the scene, but which instead thrown into the fray without method are coffins on four wheels or with propellers. The battle must be played with extreme coordination, an armored car alone, given the presence of fixed anti-tank positions and enemies equipped with a bazooka or C4, is condemned to explode in a short time if not", "date": "2010-03-02", "grade": "9.0"}
