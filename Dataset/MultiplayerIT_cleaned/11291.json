{"name": "Wall-E", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wall-e.html", "text": "We are in the year 2100, and the planet is governed by a single large multinational, which puts waste disposal and separate collection at the bottom of its priorities. So much so that, at a certain point, human beings are forced to abandon the Earth while waiting for it to be cleaned up by a series of robot-sweepers. It is an operation that fails: after seven hundred years, the only robot still functioning is too small to make a difference. Watching old movies on TV he has developed his own conscience, feelings, and spends his time collecting strange objects found in the huge landfill where he lives. One day, however, things change: a tapered-shaped female android arrives from the sky, and little Wall-E falls in love. It is the beginning of a great adventure, on which the future of humanity also depends... The tie-in made by THQ Wireless has the characteristics of an action game, but owes a lot to the puzzle genre. In fact, in each stage we will have the task of recovering a particular object, and to do so we will have to resort to Wall-E's main ability: to collect waste to transform it into cubes. By grabbing and throwing these cubes, we will be able to create ~ladders~ to reach otherwise inaccessible platforms, activate switches through their weight and so on. The puzzle connotation is highlighted by the possibility of starting the level over at any time, which is essential when we have used the available objects incorrectly and there is no way to recover them. The complexity of the stages increases as you go along, and at the beginning each location is presented to us through a series of shots, to understand how we will have to move. Everything is based on the use of cubes, and in some cases the place of application of these objects will not be very close; for this reason, by pressing the left function key we will be able to activate a free view, which allows us to observe the stage in its entirety to identify the points that interest us and plan strategies. In any case, in the early stages the game accompanies us holding hands, thanks to a series of indications and suggestions. We proceed gradually, gradually unlocking new objects and new locations, so we cannot immediately venture into the more complex areas. The control system is very simple: we move Wall-E using the joystick, which is also responsible for jumping (by pressing it up), while the 5 key is used to collect a pile of rubbish: two are needed to create a compressed cube. The developers have inserted some variables regarding the objects, which have different characteristics (see ~heavy~ cubes, for example) and therefore must be used in specific areas. The graphics of the game are just discrete, let's say that it is functional to the action but nothing more. The Wall-E sprite is faithful to the character seen in the film, but obviously does not boast the same quality of the animations, which are indeed essential and made up of a few frames. Interaction with the scenery is limited to collecting rubbish and creating compressed cubes, while the same locations are often differentiated more by the color tone used (which generally indicates the time of day) than by a variety of graphic elements. Scrolling boasts average fluidity. As far as the sound is concerned, unfortunately things are not better, on the contrary: there is only one accompanying music (equipped with an independent volume adjustment, which is always welcome), and it is nothing special.
