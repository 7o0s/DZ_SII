Beyond the emblematic case of Gameloft, now considered to all intents and purposes a ~serious~ software house that has been churning out sequels of its main brands for years, the enormous sales success of a title can only inevitably herald its sequel. However, this marketing rule applies both to ~triple A~ mega-productions and to the so-called ~toys~, simple pastimes with an ingenious concept and immediate gameplay, the undisputed protagonists of the success of the App Store. Super Blast 2, a classic vertical scrolling space shooter easily attributable to the second category among those just mentioned, while probably not reaping victims from hype, thanks to a remarkable first episode has been able to deserve a place in the sun in the App Store's Mare Magnum. 2D gyroscope The main advantage of a title devoid of narrative ambitions is to place the player immediately at the center of the action. In the case of Super Blast 2, this undeniable truth is literally confirmed, thanks to the particular conformation of the only menu present: the only possible settings are in fact linked to the activation or not of music and effects, the level of difficulty and the access to the Open Feint configuration (completely optional given the full support for Game Center). Starting to play is therefore a matter of a handful of seconds: maximum speed for maximum practicality, elements which, we will never get tired of saying it, in the development of a title for the most mobile of platforms cannot and must not be underestimated. The protagonist of this space shooter is a friendly robot, more similar to a vacuum cleaner bin than a lethal killer automaton, but which, despite its certainly not terrifying appearance, has truly explosive potential. Firmly gripping the terminal (even with one hand), the player's task will be to direct the volleys of bullets launched automatically by the robot towards the numerous enemies who will stand in the way of the courageous intergalactic journey. However, the weapons supplied with the small automaton are fixed: aiming will therefore mean physically moving it to the right and left, simultaneously shaking the device. Therefore, no virtual analog lever, nor control delegated to swiping the fingertips on the screen: the only input mode allowed is that linked to movement, recorded however not by the classic accelerometers, but by the more ~exotic~ gyroscope, present on the iPhone 4 and on latest iPod Touches. Of course, support for the simple accelerometer is also guaranteed for the previous models, but the advantages of a ~two-dimensional~ use of the new sensor integrated by Apple are easily visible by playing in positions that are not exactly ~orthodox~, such as for example when lying down: the problems in movement detection in these limit situations are definitively overcome thanks to the gyroscope, which allows you to play the title in practically any situation. Despite the reactivity in detecting movements, Super Blast 2 integrates a hint of physics, relating to the weight of the small robot, which makes its movement awkward, especially during the passage from a static position to a dynamic one (once the initial inertia has been overcome , it is certainly easier to maneuver the protagonist). The only interaction allowed in the field of weapons concerns the activation, by touching a random point on the display, of special super bombs useful for wiping out a large number of enemies at the same time; the latter are quite varied even if rather anonymous, mainly made up of other ~bad~ automatons in addition to the difficult end-of-level bosses, each with different types of scripted attacks. Alongside super bombs, ordinary weapons are very diversified but above all full of special effects during use; Basically you can only use the classic double laser, but thanks to the frequently released bonuses (including the upgrade to increase life) you can take advantage of triple laser cannons, electric streams, mines or rotating blades. The weapon balancing criterion is decidedly intuitive: simply, a greater damage inflicted corresponds to a lower launch speed. However, a particular applause goes to the technical realization: graphically, the title enjoys incredible fluidity, as well as a pleasant and clean three-dimensional graphics, beautiful animations and spectacular light effects; the audio sector will never appear in special collections of soundtracks, but at least ssometimes the effects don't bother.
