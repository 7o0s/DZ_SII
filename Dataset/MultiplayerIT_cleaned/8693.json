The project of bringing at least a slice of the Mass Effect universe to iOS devices has in fact experienced several attempts, starting with the decidedly unsuccessful Mass Effect Galaxy which appeared in mid-2009 and was then disowned by Bioware itself due to the serious qualitative gaps that characterized it. , to the point of being permanently removed from the App Store. More interesting was the publication of the graphic novel subtitled Redemption, which thanks to the work of screenwriters Mac Walters and John Jackson Miller narrated the story of the asari Liara T'Soni after the destruction of the Normandy SR-1. However, the release of the third chapter of the main series was evidently too important an opportunity to make the most of an exclusive spin-off for smartphones (the Android version is on its way) that would wash away the shame of the aforementioned Galaxy by convincing skeptics. To be on the safe side, the Australian team Ironmonkey Studios was hired, already the author of the convincing mobile version of Dead Space for Electronic Arts. What could go wrong? So many enemies, so much glory Mass Effect Infiltrator offers a completely new set of characters and a story: the protagonist is a certain Randall Ezno, a Cerberus soldier who rebels against the organization when he discovers its evil plans that also involve his friend Inari. For a series as founded on narration and characterization as Mass Effect is, Infiltrator from this point of view can only bring a first, strong disappointment. Randall is in fact a flat and banal hero bordering on inconsistency, not at all incisive, and at the same time the plot remains on a disarming lightness, without ever providing real reasons of interest to the player. It goes without saying that there are no tangible links between the events of Mass Effect Infiltrator and those of the main series either. Such little attention to the background of the game can only leave those who know the classic modus operandi of Bioware titles rather perplexed, but in any case it could be an acceptable renunciation in the face of an extremely valid product from a playful point of view. Unfortunately the effort of Ironmonkey Studios can not even be defined in this way. The choice in terms of game design was to focus on a third-person shooter strongly focused on the cover system and the control interface. In practice, Mass Effect Infiltrator, also given the absolutely linear level design, is nothing more than a series of firefights in more or less large areas connected to each other by corridors; precisely for this reason, the EA production rests on a rather elaborate combat system that needs a little practice before becoming familiar with it. In summary, each available weapon has a precise range of action; if the enemies are within this radius, a blue reticle around them allows - once touched - to start shooting in that direction. The ability to move the viewfinder allows you to aim precisely at various areas of the body, in order to try to hit the weak point which almost always coincides with the head. There is no shortage of biotic powers and various more or less useful skills, which however become fundamental in order to obtain more style points; the latter are generously given in the event that a certain variety is adopted in the fights, chaining kills and alternating weapons and powers, thus stimulating the player not to fossilize on a single type of approach. At the end of each fight, an overall assessment takes into account the style, energy and time consumed, thus allowing you to obtain a certain amount of credits, to spend in the shop to buy or upgrade other weapons, skills, armor and so on. Although interesting on paper, in practice the combat system soon shows its limits due to a certain imprecision in the controls, a lack of general refinement and a very serious poverty of the artificial intelligence of the enemies. The repetitiveness of the development of the adventure (combat, corridor, combat, corridor...) certainly doesn't help in this sense. Even the inclusion of moral choices, one of the most important and developed elements in the main series, has been inserted in Mass Effect Infiltrator in a listless and inconclusive way: the choice between hero and renegade always resolves itself into the decision between killing or not a member of Cerberus, without however this choice having any kind of practical effect in the rest of the game. The only real connection between Infiltrator and Mass Effect 3 is in the intel points, to be obtainedalso in combat and which can be used either by converting them into money, or on the contrary by sending them to the ~Galaxy at War~ thus increasing the level of ~galactic reactivity~ precisely of the third chapter on consoles, all this by synchronizing your Origin account. Finally the graphic component, good if not sensational, with some evident drops in the quality of the textures and the framerate, and with settings with a very fluctuating yield.", "date": "2012-03-08", "grade": "5.8"}
