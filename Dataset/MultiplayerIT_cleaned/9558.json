A pure hack and slash gameplay, between infinite corridors to empty and objects to loot from victims and chests, chasing stats and upgrades. Finally, a view that in the best top-down tradition allows you to enhance the work done on the characters, environments and finishes without making the complex shine for technical achievement, especially when compared to certain recent technological prowess. Dungeon Hunter II, an action role-playing game developed and produced by Gameloft, is entirely described by the previous propositions, sinking its roots in an ancient genre canonized by some exponents, Diablo above all, to the point of becoming stagnant in terms of ideas without losing charm and fun, as demonstrated in recent years by the various Fate, Deathspank, Torchlight and soon its sequel, which in 2011 anticipated the third chapter of the Blizzard saga by a few months. The one that has been available for some time on the iPhone proved to be a product capable of adding nothing to the original formula or of perfecting it from any point of view, but standing out for its fun and quantity of content. One match leads to another The mechanics adopted (also) by Dungeon Hunter II are those that rarely fail if performed with a minimum of care: the plot is a simple pretext to send the protagonist and user into environments partially created randomly, overall convincing a bit repetitive, and partly designed ad hoc, to then whet their playful appetites by giving a set of statistics, linked to the character and his equipment, which stimulate him to move forward with a continuous sense of growth, therefore of improvement. Every few seconds at most an enemy dies, each enemy means experience points and new objects that turn into simple choices related to statistics, skills, the weapon you hold or the protections you wear: nothing particularly bizarre and indeed often it is not a question of real choices, since most of the time it is a matter of common sense and numbers, but the idea that improvements and powers are around every corner ready to wait for us, is an attraction too strong not to listen to the voice asking to play a few more minutes. The classes, three with magician, warrior and assassin who can then further specialize by following several paths each, are one of the mirrors of the almost total absence of will not only to innovate but also to mix the stylistic features of the genre in an original way, however this failure proactive thrust, also visible in the management of objects or in the narration, with primary and secondary quests absolutely irrelevant for the purposes of the experience, are balanced by a reasoned study of the offer in relation to the platform on which it is brought. Above all, the control system, offering itself both in the form of a virtual analog stick and asking you to point your finger at the point to reach or at the enemy or object to interact with, allows you to choose between two equally functional possibilities, while the The cooperative implementation, available on models from 3GS onwards, is devoid of options but functional in giving up to four players the possibility of sharing the same game environment. Longevity, in itself very good considering even the presence of options for single player or for the group, grows further if you want to deepen the development of the individual classes, returning to the development of the character and opting for new paths in the assignment phase skill points or specializations. The visual sector, as mentioned at the beginning, enjoys a discreet technical realization that always remains functional to the fantasy style, devoted to the representation of dark scenes and characters, immersed in a violent world. The implementation of the interface and menus is also more than good, which despite the many options remain usable.
