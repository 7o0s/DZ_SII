{"name": "Zoo Keeper", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zoo-keeper.html", "text": "We could all go to the municipal zoo If it is really legitimate to speak of ~plot~ in a puzzle game, Zoo Keeper puts the user in the role of the park guardian, charged by a perpetually angry director to put the animals in order: obviously, making use of the Nintendo DS stylus all inside a playful puzzle scheme. As announced in the introduction, Zoo Keeper is nothing more than a version of Bejeweled with icons depicting stylized beasts instead of jewels, so the gameplay is so intuitive that it is literally more difficult to explain than to play. Everything is resolved within the touch screen of the console, which houses a grid of eight squares by eight occupied by as many animal heads. The interaction is limited to the possibility of changing the positions of icons adjacent to each other in order to unite three or more beasts in a row, so as to make them disappear from the screen and allow the entry of new tiles. Considering how the movement of the animals is tolerated only when it causes the immediate concatenation - and relative disappearance - of figures, the composing of combos and chains is a task reserved exclusively to luck: that is, it is accomplished only when the descent of new icons causes ( randomly) the formation of files. Obviously, success in Zoo Keeper is not determined by good luck alone, but it is necessary to have a good eye and a quick hand, also because the playful rhythm is marked by a countdown which is pushed back by collecting points: moreover, the game meets the user in difficulty by granting him a maximum of three bonuses (selectable on the edge of the screen) useful for identifying the movements that can be carried out, and totally resetting the grid in the absence of any opportunity for union. Zoo Keeper is all here, and thanks to this simplicity, the Ingition product proves to be incredibly fun and exciting, one of those typical ~I play one more game and then I stop~ games. 100 animals are enough for me In addition to the intuitive and captivating play scheme, another undoubted strength of Zoo Keeper is the absolute perfection of the control system, which is resolved in the sole use of the stylus. One could hardly think of a better way to tackle such a game, which thanks to the characteristics of the Nintendo DS further gains in terms of immediacy and fun. Ideal for a quick game in your spare time but absolutely capable of capturing the user even for considerable periods of time, Zoo Keeper offers - in addition to the main game mode - some discreet small variations on the theme. Tokoton 100 allows you to level up only after placing one hundred animals in order; Time Attack pushes the player towards the high-score to be achieved before time runs out; Quest offers 10 stages marked by different objectives; finally, the interesting Two-player mode allows exciting challenges between two Nintendo DS owners with a single game cartridge. As we can see, Zoo Keeper diligently respects the dictates of the puzzle game, and this same discourse can be expanded in favor of the cosmetic sector, clear, simple and free of unnecessary frills. The bright colors are the masters, giving a feeling of lightness and joy accentuated by sound effects and nice music even if rather repetitive in the long run. The double screen of Nintendo DS is discreetly exploited by Zoo Keeper, with the touch screen which, as mentioned, houses the game grid, while the other display shows an image of the lucky animal (whose rows give double points) and the count of the score. Again nothing excessive, and for a game like Zoo Keeper that's fine. Comment Zoo Keeper is what could be defined as a ~big little game~, an extremely simple puzzle game from both a technical and a playful point of view, but capable of giving massive doses of fun. Undoubted beneficiary of the characteristics of Nintendo DS (touch screen and stylus work like a charm), Zoo Keeper makes immediacy and its ability to excite its best weapons, and is therefore recommended to anyone who appreciates a bit of healthy, disenchanted puzzle action. Pros Intuitive and fun Perfect for the touch screen Colorful and functional graphics Cons It's a real clone of Bejeweled Combos and chains based only on luck Raise your hand if you know Bejeweled, a hugely popular puzzle game that has made PCs, PDAs and mobile phones its territory of conquest (also making an appearance in the Arcade section of Xbox Live). This is a simple but captivating game in which it is necessary to align jewels of the same color in order to make themdisappear from the screen and accumulate points: an intuitive and decidedly winning game formula, which, not surprisingly, was literally plundered by Ignition Entertainment for its Zoo Keeper on Nintendo DS.", "date": "2006-03-31", "grade": null}
