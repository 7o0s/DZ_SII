In Breach and Clear: Deadline you control ~Rambo~ super-equipped against the ravenous brain-suckers. We won't waste time telling a non-existent narrative pretext or even the reason that will lead you to explore a city to solve the various quests: you've already heard everything in a million other stories and it wouldn't interest you anyway. All you need to hear is any reason to go ~out there~ and kick the butt of the lame abominations, who tend to be very interested in you all the time. In Breach and Clear: Deadline you control a team of four: each has well-defined specifications and different weapons, although in the course of the events you may take different paths. In fact, everyone has the ability to be offensive at different shooting heights: from far away, from medium distance or only up close. This alone alarms you about the tactical component expected in a title that, on paper, winks at that masterpiece that is XCOM, but in fact tends to distance itself a lot from the work recently redone by Firaxis Games. A simple ~click~ of the mouse is enough to move the team, as if we were in a Diablo-style game, with the isometric view showing us its members from above and, if necessary, slicing any building, from the ceiling up , if we were in an interior. The possibility of controlling each character independently invites us from the initial tutorial to become familiar with the tactical view. Zombies like hot lead and in Breach and Clear: Deadline we are very generous with them The undead stagger And it's not just them who walk with a limp. In fact, we awaited the release of the beta in order to better understand how the development team had corrected most of the bugs we had encountered in the previous beta phase. The reality was a patch that didn't fix some of the nastier flaws we ran into. In some cases, in fact, during the attacks, when you start the tactical phase, the game makes the weapons disappear from the hands of your team, with the obvious consequences of the case, without being able to review them until a restart. Among other things, it has also happened frequently that we lose the possibility of controlling the team because the commands are disabled, with the obligation of having to restart the mission from the previous checkpoint. Another problem, rather in an indie game of this genre anyway, is artificial intelligence. Relegating everything with the term ~zombie~, so as to simplify the concept with a simple direct charge, is not always possible, considering that you will also have to deal with human opponents. The absurdity is to think that there is someone who will choose, alone, to go against a team of four people armed with a toy gun. The boldest enemy strategy, which simply involves moving away from safe cover, is almost always also the stupidest as it makes easy targets for a good sniper's fire. Furthermore, inside the buildings our line of fire allows you to cross some walls, in the spaces closest to the doors, without a precise logic and this is positive for us who shoot at the undead, but also for the enemies still alive that they want to make skin. Although the graphics are simple, each environment offers enough ideas to always be recognizable, not hinder us in the progress of the group and give us a safe shelter in the event of an assault. The barricades, improvised or dilapidated, will not always offer shelter to everyone, indeed we could suffer attacks from all fronts, which is why it is essential to try to engage each party member in strategic positions to then eradicate the hordes of enemies. You will have to make an effort to give everyone something to do, under penalty of less advancement of his experience level, just like in an RPG. In fact, passing a level allows your good soldiers to add a skill point to one of the various branches of specialization available. You will also be able to find loot scattered throughout the various areas with new weapons, upgrades and grafts for the latter, ammunition, medkits and so on. Every time you complete a mission, usually of the type ~go to this place to get this thing~ or ~rescue X who is in point Y~, you can take a breather in a classic ~safe house~. As expected, you can deposit your excess loot, if you do not want to take it with you at the risk of running out of space or to go to a workbench to process your equipmentnto. The least interesting part of the experience shows itself strongly when you discover that in many situations instead of a placement of the various members studied at the table, it will be enough to select the whole team and take down one enemy at a time. Fortunately, beyond a certain threshold, the title finally claims to give greater value to the team as such.", "date": "2015-07-27", "grade": "7.0"}
