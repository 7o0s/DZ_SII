{"name": "Destinazione: L'Isola del Tesoro - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destinazione-lisola-del-tesoro-recensione.html", "text": "A three-headed monkey will bury us Destination: Treasure Island is powered by the same graphics engine that powered the first Atlantis: The Lost Tales by Cryo, dated 1997, and which over the years has been improved and used for dozens of other graphic adventures. The game interface is also very similar. Not bad, given that we are talking about what is perhaps the most conservative genre ever, which still cannot free itself from the shadow of its more illustrious predecessors. The locations are large fixed screens navigable at 360, with only a few animations to make them more lively and lively. They are generally very well made in terms of colors and details, even if they don't shine in style or characterization. Let's say that they do their dirty work and nothing more and that they certainly won't remain imprinted in the history of video games (holy Guybrush, help us). As in any self-respecting graphic adventure, various objects, suggestions and puzzles are distributed for the different locations. The former are always quite visible and hardly get confused with the scenarios, which avoids the sad practice of pixel hunting; the latter are equally evident so evident that they are often placed in an improbable way, like the statue on the beach or the button pad in the mouth of the stone skull. In general, however, there would be little to complain about, were it not that the developers have practically decided to include the solution within the game. But we'll talk about that later. you can hear better acting in school plays where at least the singsongs are justified by the young age of the actors A three-headed monkey will bury us Inventory management is very simple, with collected items being placed in slots where you can combine them with other items or disassemble them, in the case of already combined items. To select them, just grab them and press the right mouse button, so as to make them active and make them appear at the top of the screen. The only novelty is represented by the knots, i.e. the need to tie objects together using some of the most well-known and complex sailors' knots. Don't worry, doing it is everyone's business. In practice, when something needs to be knotted, a kind of subgame begins in which you have to guess the sequence of actions necessary to make the knot. The alternatives to choose from are two or ~one~ (they will also have thought of the children) and in case of failure you are not penalized but you can immediately try again starting from scratch. The difficulty is practically nil, even when there are many phases of the node (maximum nine). In practice, these are short moments that can be liked for their ~pedagogical~ side, but which disappoint a lot from the playful one. Adventure dimension Lovers of graphic adventures are such because they enjoy spending hours in front of the screen looking for objects, solving puzzles and deciphering clues. What are normally defined as the main defects of the genre are actually its strengths, given that any adventurer worthy of the name considers a game that runs too fast without engaging his neurons as disappointing. It's a matter of expectations. From this point of view Destination: Treasure Island is disappointing. Some puzzles are well thought out, but Long John Silver's ~riddle~ device, a nursery rhyme that is practically the solution to most of the puzzles in the game, makes many situations bland that otherwise would have required more reasoning time to be overcome. Some might suggest not reading it, but it's hard to avoid reading it because it often appears on the screen; Does it feel nice to have to close your eyes or turn away while playing? Moreover, it is a very strong narrative element, and ignoring it is counterproductive if you want to follow the plot. In short, summing up, it is possible to reach the end of the game in a few hours, in our case in an afternoon and an evening with a dinner break. It's not much. And shut up! But now we come to what is probably the biggest flaw of the Italian edition of the game: dubbing. Let's say right away that the localization is very good and there are no gross errors in the texts. Maybe something more could have been done with nursery rhymes and songs, but they're still not bad. Unfortunately it was chosen to dub the characters in our language, with results that defining amateur is paying him a compliment. The voice actors chosen are probably not actors because they lack diction and intonation. It is possible to hear better acting in school plays where at least the singsongs are justified by the young age of the actors. It would have been betterI would like to leave the speech in the original language and translate only the written text, in this way the atmosphere, already not exceptional, would not have been compromised. There are few games that can ~boast~ a dubbing of this quality and we hope that in the near future there will be no new subscribers. For the rest, all that remains is to rely on the commentary for the final verdict. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 3 800 MHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 64 MB Video Card: Any 64 MB DirectX 9.0 compatible Disk Space: 1.3 GB Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment Destination: Treasure Island is a game designed for everyone, both for the configuration needed to run it, decidedly below current standards, and for the adventure itself, light in plot and puzzles and therefore also suitable for an audience of preteens. Probably the most disappointed will be, on the other hand, the die-hard adventurers who will devour it in a few hours and who will be left with a bitter taste in their mouths noting the overall paucity of this production. Pros Good for newbies Intuitive and tested game system Good inventory management Cons Short They could have avoided including the solution in the game The voice acting is really awful The story is not passionate What happens to characters in a book? How does their life evolve after the end of the story told? Will they really live happily ever after, or, as Schopenhauer supposed, are happy endings only possible because we never know what will happen next? Is oblivion their true happiness? Probably asking these questions is the obvious consequence of the love one feels for any narrative work, be it a book, a film, a theater show or a video game. The sequels are not shocking when they are made for structured works starting off for seriality (for example Matrix), or when the seriality is inherent in the product itself and is made explicit in a continuous game of references and openings that serve to generate permanent dissatisfaction in the user, dissatisfaction that can never be completely filled. The subject changes when we talk about classics of the past, by now digested by a certain culture, and seen as monolithic points of reference, for better or for worse, by past, present and future generations. What happened to Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins at the end of Treasure Island, the well-known pirate novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson at the end of the nineteenth century? The authors of Destination: Treasure Island, an adventure video game set a few years after the events narrated in the book, tried to answer this question, in a rather bland way. The plot is quite inconsistent: Jim Hawkins, who grew up and became a captain, receives the unexpected visit of the parrot of the now deceased Long John Silver, while being held prisoner in his ship by a group of pirates intent on killing him for some events that occurred a few years earlier. After a daring escape, Jim finds himself sailing alone following the directions given to him by the parrot, with which he manages to arrive on a mysterious island, where he will have to decipher a strange nursery rhyme to try to get to Long John's hidden treasure. Obviously there will be twists, actually rather phoned, and equally obviously our hero, to succeed in his enterprise, will have to overcome a long series of more or less complex puzzles.", "date": "2007-07-04", "grade": null}
