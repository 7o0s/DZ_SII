{"name": "Tre mappe per Reach", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82864-tre-mappe-per-reach.html", "text": "To understand if the mechanics of a map work at their best, sometimes it takes weeks of play in dozens of different modes but some elements are immediately clear. The risks for balancing are evident when there are too many points for campers, snipers, ambushes and when the terrain instead of speeding up the map risks slowing down its mechanics. On the other hand, the need to make the maps playable even with the DMR headshots and perks such as jetpack and running have distorted the needs in terms of gamedesign of the Bungie series and apart from an increase in size, there are few base maps that have actually taken into account of these new needs. Need that this Noble Pack seems to consider with particular attention even if 800 Microsoft Points may seem too much for an addition all in all due. Breaking Point - 8 to 16 players Somewhat similar to Halo 3's Avalanche, the snowy map with two bases and the mountain in between, this new 16-player map is vast, but also more compact and fast-paced than other maps of its type. And even if often the main confrontation zone is the bridge that connects the two zones, it is the high ground between the two bases that represents the control zone of Point of Break, allowing those who occupy it to keep their means and objectives under their gaze . But in a large map full of buildings it is not easy to control the rocky ridge which is often more useful for escaping enemy vehicles than as a camping area for snipers. However in Invasion, which is the main mode of the map, fleeing is not a viable option as the objective is in the human base and all forces are converging towards this location. The first phase of the invasion asks the Covenant to conquer, as usual in this mode, one of two available positions in order to advance. Once set foot in enemy territory, the attackers must then recover a bomb to place it in one of the two side switches of the main structure which, once exploded, causes the hangar to open. In fact, the main objective is kept inside the base which must be stolen and taken away with a flying transport. However, the third part is more difficult for the defenders than the first two maps of the invasion mode. The spawn points are close enough to allow continuous exploits by the attackers and the road ahead with the objective to steal is short and practically free of obstacles. In short, in the event that the attackers manage to recover or deactivate the vehicles, the game is practically done. The defenders are in fact forced to use practically any means to stop the opponents who arrive at high speed with ghost and invisibility trying to move the target even slightly towards the Phantom waiting for them. Aesthetically it is a beautiful map which, despite the polygonal mass, runs smoothly even in the most agitated moments and recovers a single player setting that is little used in multiplayer. A huge crack in the ice shows an ancient building wrapped in ice and in the background an apocalyptic horizon heralds the icy fate of whoever loses this battle. Tempest - 8 to 16 players Tempest is a medium map that pits two bases, and two gun emplacements eye to eye with each other a few feet apart, and is located on a beach in the shade of a high cliff. The main peculiarities of Tempest are the limit to small vehicles, a small tunnel in the rock that allows you to get around the battlefield and the practically specular arrangement of the weapons among which the two missile launchers obviously stand out. The design of the hiding places is excellent and the numerous holes allow you to escape and often lead to jump pads placed to facilitate rapid movement. Not excessive heights, even if there is the possibility of climbing with the jetpack while becoming visible, and an extremely pleasant look complete the picture of a map that does not leave much space for camping and the control of a specific area but focuses on action and fluid movement. Inspired by the ~Create a World~ set, it is evidently better than its companions included in Halo Reach. Tempest is drawn more carefully and with more carefully placed cover and weapons. A cross between the well-balanced deathmatch maps from the first Halo and the Halo Reach map design that doesn't give too much DMR like many Create-a-World generated maps do. At first glance, the queen mode of this map is undoubtedly the 4v4 deathmatch but thanks to the defensive perks of Halo Reach, the horizontality of the map and the lack of heavy vehicles, it is also enjoyable with 16 players. Obviously, like any self-respecting specular map, it is perfect pIt's the CTF that can finally be played outdoors without Scorpion tanks that don't fit well with this mode. Xbox 360 goals Even if it is made up of only three maps, this DLC does not give up adding 250 points distributed in 7 new objectives. They range from the simplest, such as completing the second objective of Breaking Point or getting a double kill with the shotgun, to less immediate ones such as conquering all the flags in a matchmaking game in stockpile mode. Nothing impossible, however, even if the skill of the players has now grown a lot and achieving objectives in multiplayer is no longer as simple as it was at the beginning. Anchor 9 - for 2 to 8 players Anchor 9 is a medium sized closed map set in space. The spaceship hanging in the center of the map and the external landscape immediately suggest that more space has been given to graphics than in other closed maps such as Sword Base. On the contrary, the concept is similar to that of Sword Base with two opposite symmetrical structures, which make it a perfect map for 4 vs 4 team objectives, and a central area where most of the clashes take place in the modes that require the carrying of flags or bombs. But the central area, always compared to that of Sword Base, is richer in defenses and complex structures behind which to take shelter and branches off towards four openings, two large on the ground and two small ones at the top of the structure in the center of the branch, which allow to go out into space. Outside the magnetic fields that seal the atmosphere of the base there are in fact some walkways which, subject to extremely low gravity, allow unlikely escapes thanks to the possibility of making huge jumps. Huge leaps which in the wrong situation can turn us into easy targets but which in certain situations can also allow us to escape from a desperate situation. In team deathmatch it is a particularly popular area that allows a good team to take refuge in one of the side terraces. But by placing a couple of bombs at the right time, even if it's not easy at all, the whole thing can end up in a frenzy of flying bodies and daring and at the same time spectacular situations. Among other things, the terrace that is located just outside the two larger openings can be used to instantly reach the upper terrace of the two bases thanks to the low gravity that allows you to jump higher. Of course, good timing is needed to make the most of the transition between the two different gravities, but it is undoubtedly a useful option that sometimes allows you to anticipate an opponent or to quickly transport flags, bombs and so on to the goal. In fact, the concept of Anchor 9, while not reaching the extreme verticality of Sword Base, provides for floors and gradients that allow for bypasses, ambushes and are essential for making modes such as oddball interesting. In short, a closed map, and without vehicles, but which includes almost all the possible situations in the other maps of the same type included in Halo Reach. The great design of the open spaces and the breathtaking panorama are the icing on the cake that consecrates this map pack as one of the most successful in the history of Halo.", "date": "2010-12-06", "grade": "8.0"}
