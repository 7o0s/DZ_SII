{"name": "Scudetto 2007 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scudetto-2007-recensione-2.html", "text": "5-5-5 As expected, there are very few novelties in this version of the popular Eidos franchise, and 2007 is mostly referred to the update of the squads and formations of the available teams. Nonetheless, Scudetto 2007 is such a vast and profound title that to expect a total renewal every year would be sincerely ridiculous; and so here we are again in the role of a coach with everything to prove, who is entrusted with the reins of a team chosen to his liking among a huge number belonging to Italian, European or world championships. Obviously for each team, based on the potential of the men and of the club, a seasonal objective is entrusted to try to complete, such as salvation, winning the championship, promotion and so on. As expected, however, the undertaking is far from simple; Scudetto 2007 is certainly not a game to be taken lightly, and there are so many components to take into consideration and to follow even just to start a game that they can exalt the enthusiast as well as discourage those approaching the genre for the first time. Training, transfer market, player conditions, injury management, contacts with other clubs, organization and management of your support team, training, schemes, tactics, etc., trying to dose economic resources well so as not to risk an ominous bankruptcy. Interesting is the ability to ~talk~ with your players before, during and after the game, choosing from a set of predefined sentences; this to motivate the players and try to bring out their character, being careful not to go down too hard with serious repercussions on the athlete's morale. After this enormous preliminary phase, it is then time to take the field, and also under this aspect the programmers wanted to provide a large number of possibilities to the user, who can decide whether to go directly to the result (highly discouraged), follow the textual chronicle of the meeting, or see it with your own eyes through a very, very stylized representation. In reality, unless you set the passage of time in real or slightly accelerated mode, this option becomes almost useless, since everything becomes as understandable as seeing a crowded anthill. The bench is hot It goes without saying that from a strictly technical point of view, the 2007 Scudetto is practically nil; the sound is almost completely absent and everything is managed through menus. The latter, due to the amount of data that is represented in each screen, are not exactly streamlined, and navigation between the various pages is often a bit too cumbersome. Fortunately, the uploads have been reduced to a minimum, and even on PSP there is very little to wait except for the initial loading. On the other hand, the size of the save is quite substantial, which on Ps2 takes up almost an entire memory card. There really isn't much more to add; the Eidos production is exactly what was legitimate to expect on the eve, or a product aimed at a specific target, which will undoubtedly make fans of the genre happy without converting those who, on the contrary, have never loved this type of football video game. Final comment Scudetto Championship Manager 2007 for Ps2 and Psp is a product that is not surprising, and which is limited to updating and smoothing out the defects of last year's edition. The result is therefore a competent, deep, well-finished, complex managerial game, which suffers on consoles above all due to a certain cumbersomeness in the interface and in navigating through the menus. Even with its flaws, the Eidos production is still a title that is undoubtedly recommended for lovers of the genre, waiting for the more than predictable 2008 edition. Pros Competent and profound Good loading speed It will make enthusiasts happy Cons Cumbersome menu navigation Technically fine too bland Historical defects of the series always present The passion for football of Italians is well known. Equally well-known are the so-called ~bar chats~ with which we football enthusiasts often love to fill our mouths, criticizing players and coaches, in the belief that we can do a much better job for them. And as often happens, video games are placed somewhere between reality and fantasy, in this specific case football management titles, which have been on the crest of the wave for many years now and followed by a large group of enthusiasts. Among these, Ps2 and PSP users can now finally be added, thanks to the 2007 edition of Scudetto Championship Manager.", "date": "2007-05-02", "grade": null}
