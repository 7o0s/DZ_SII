{"name": "Kingdom: New Lands", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181342-kingdom-new-lands-ho-visto-un-re.html", "text": "Like the one in Dario Fo's legendary song, the king of Kingdom: New Lands is also sitting on a saddle, but unlike that he doesn't cry, because in fact he doesn't even have the time. In spite of monarchs who bask in opulence, our king takes great pains to build and protect his kingdom, acting at the forefront on many fronts to ensure that his land grows and is not harmed by the of enemies. The game started in 2013 as a flash title, but then expanded and evolved conquering the subtitle New Lands and landing on PC a couple of years ago and in 2016 on Xbox One, obtaining excellent results. It is a difficult title to catalog, which collects elements from different genres and puts them together in a decidedly original way, also due to the lateral shot and its being based entirely on the two-dimensional plane, which necessarily simplifies the system of control but without renouncing considerable strategic and managerial depth. Basically, it is about guiding the king to discover new lands to annex to his kingdom, adding environments, increasing the population under his control, rebuilding buildings and structures and making everything work for the best, as well as investing in defensive systems that guarantee the protection of areas against the attacks of enemies, be they human or otherworldly. Because apparently the fascinating lands that the sovereign explores on his horse are also quite dangerous, and continually subject to infiltration and attack attempts by various demons who constantly threaten their integrity. Also for this reason the life of the king appears decidedly full and demanding in Kingdom: New Lands, which at all times requires you to carry out coordinated and well-planned actions, while also focusing a lot on the contemplation of its wonderful aesthetic aspect. The king's life has never been more challenging than in Kingdom: New Lands A horse and a bag of coins It all starts with a crown, a horse and a bag of coins, the foundation for empire building. The king therefore finds himself riding and discovering new lands, and above all investing money in the annexation of new subjects, in the construction of structures and in the organization of defenses. The minimalist and direct style that characterizes the game right from the start does not immediately make the objectives and the best way to invest the money to achieve them very clear, so it is essentially a question of trying and observing the consequences, and the excellent looking graphics undoubtedly help to make this contemplative component of the gameplay particularly enjoyable. The mechanics therefore provide for moving to the right or left between the explorable territories, the giving of money for the various construction and defense activities of the kingdom and, when night falls, the organization of defenses from the invasion of enemies. It is basically a matter of trying to survive as long as possible, in a structure that therefore amalgamates strategic, management and survival elements represented with a very original cut. The ultimate goal is the construction of a ship with which to set off to discover new lands, on which we find ourselves restarting the same procedure but within different settings and with increasing difficulty, re-proposing situations similar to those seen previously even if arranged differently. The simplicity of the control system makes Kingdom: New Lands a game particularly suitable for mobile platforms, which in fact welcome it practically perfectly except for some uncertainty in detecting touches on the screen. Its challenging structure gives depth to the experience, but it must be said that the charm given off by the bitmap graphics is particularly effective here in kidnapping the player within this strange world. We are now accustomed to artistic 2D solutions but in this case the attention to detail appears extreme and the beauty of the scenarios, with the day/night cycle and the passing of the seasons to continuously vary its appearance, represents a great push to continue exploring and in the construction of kingdoms, even in the face of an inevitable repetitiveness.", "date": "2017-03-24", "grade": "8.2"}
