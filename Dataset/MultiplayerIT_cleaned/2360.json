{"name": "Shogun: The Mongol invasion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shogun-the-mongol-invasion.html", "text": "Mongols vs Japanese But what would have happened if the Mongol armies had managed to invade Japanese soil? Would they conquer Japan? The player's challenge begins at this point, where they will be given the choice of defending as the Japanese army or attacking as the wild Mongol hordes move. The title introduces us to the battlefield by showing us some scenes from the film RAN (1985 masterpiece: the use of colors and sound is incredible, the story is a transposition of Shakespeare's King Lear; Kurosawa creates an exceptional ~visionary~ form of expression such as in the delirious fifteen minutes during the assault on the castle, which our game shows us a short scene.With ten million dollars as a budget it is the most expensive film in Japanese cinema, 2000 extras for the battle scenes, 250 horses, 1400 armor , 4 nominations in Hollywood, Oscar for costumes). New units and more.. Once the scenario has been defined, let's see what this expansion for Shogun can offer (remember that to play it you must necessarily own a version of Shogun). The new Mongol faction brings with it a good number of units, but there are also additions for the opposing ranks: here's a brief overview. The Ninjas: in the first episode these fighters could not be deployed in combat, while, unfortunately, thanks to this pack they will actively participate on the battlefield: unfortunately they are completely useless. Perhaps they are difficult to maneuver, but their effectiveness is too limited, their cost too high, making them the worst balanced new unit. New units and more.. The ~Korean Skirmishers~, equipped with shields, light armor, capable of throwing spears. They are not very vulnerable to arrow attacks from enemies, but their weakness is hand-to-hand combat. Another hole in the water are the ~Thunder Bombers~, equipped with primitive weapons that work with gunpowder. Their ammunition is really powerful, but before throwing them you will have to be too close to the opponents. Among other things, their weapons are completely inaccurate and the result is often to damage even their own troops. To be used with great care. Then there are the new ~Korean Guardsmen~, completely similar to the Japanese ~Naginata~, perhaps less powerful, but still faster. The new ~Naginata~ cavalry was created to disrupt defensive troops. Their slowness and light armor are well balanced by the power of their weapons, capable of overpowering stronger and more well-defended foes. The new Mongol crossbowmen are very accurate and deadly. Their slowness and long reload time make them a unit that must be stacked against cavalry to be defended. And if we talk about cavalry we cannot mention the two new pillars of the game: the Mongolian light and heavy cavalry. Horse archers are fast and really important to winning fights. Knowing how to maneuver them well will mean having resolved a good part of the clashes. New units and more.. The introduction of new units, in addition to bringing new interest to the game, however, in my opinion, changed some balances that had been created and that the most profound connoisseurs of Shogun know perfectly. For multiplayer challenges, for example, parameters have been set within which to create the army to take to the battlefield. Now, with the introduction of this very powerful new army, the advantage of choosing Mongol troops is visible. From now on there is a risk that multiplayer matches will only be held between troops of the same side (Japanese vs Japanese or Mongol vs Mongol). Another change that can be criticized is that relating to morale. With this expansion, it was in fact raised (and then readjusted again with patch 1.01). Now the units go less in running away (retreat) (while in Shogun it was much easier to see troops run away), but they fight in a more realistic way and in any case when you manage to send the opponent to flee (less often than in the original game) it will be a real joy! And the graphics? In addition to all this, improvements can also be seen in the graphical interface. The new maps are really well made (there are also coastal maps and areas with lakes): the editor included in the game will make you happy, also because it is extremely easy to use (there should be some screenshots of maps made by me in 5 minutes). And the graphics? The only notable graphical improvement is the dust that is kicked up by moving armies. Instead, we note ~thumbs down~ for the graphic design of the new troops (but I think this is a marginal aspect of the game; in fact, the atmosphere is always really well recreated, thanks to really excellent sound effects and music). Finally, as a side dish, six new game modes (for example the ~king of the hill~ and the ~last man standing~; the more fun and tactical mode is still the classic one), much improved servers, capable of hosting games with more of the canonical two players (who enjoy playing in eight at the same time): these elements undoubtedly represent one of the main reasons for buying for fans of the game's multiplayer mode. The editor Let's talk briefly about the map editor included in the game: to reach it you will have to go inside the options menu and choose Editor. After choosing the size of the map to create, you will be transported to the playing area. There are few tools to choose from, but they are decidedly functional: you can raise and lower the ground level as you like, in order to create mountainous areas, rolling hills, ~Po~ plains or even lakes (in fact, below a certain level the ground will turn into water.. the six screens in the paragraph demonstrate the creation of a map). The editor After structuring the plan of your level, there are three tools to use: in fact, you can place textures, models of houses, rocks, structures and trees as you like. There are so many textures (161) and with them you can draw roads, rocky areas, settlements and everything you have ever seen in Shogun on the ground. The number of textures The editor usable for map (41) it might seem low, but in order not to weigh down your levels, I advise you to limit its use. The insertable models and trees are gems that will allow you to customize your ~environments~ in a very personal way. The same goes for the models for the textures. Don't abuse it, also because there are limitations in the program, which shows you how many structures you can still place. Surely enthusiasts will be happy to be able to get their hands on this tool. The verdict is: Considering the aforementioned elements and the 4 new campaigns, really well cared for and capable of offering a truly remarkable number of hours of gameplay, I can only recommend the purchase of this add-on to fans who have appreciated the original title. If you have doubts about the longevity of the expansion, put them aside, because defending or conquering Japan has become even more difficult... In conclusion, ~The mongol invasion~ does not distort the wealth and strategic complexity that made him Shogun of the best and most loved war simulators, and indeed expands its possibilities. So... happy shopping! The screenshots Before finishing, a last roundup of shots dedicated to some details added by the expansion: Mongols vs Japanese In the thirteenth century, Kublai Khan ruled the greatest empire the world had ever seen. From the Danube to the Pacific, his word as Khan of the Mongols was law. And he always wanted more. After subduing China, his lust for conquest led him to plan the extension of his dominions by sea. His attention turned to the islands of Japan. History tells us that the attempt to conquer Japan ended bitterly for Kublai Khan, when his fleet was destroyed by a hurricane (from the mystical and divine kamikaze wind: precisely for this episode the Japanese pilots of the Second World War, who voted upon death they would raise a divine wind against the American enemy).", "date": "2001-11-16", "grade": null}
