{"name": "DOOM Eternal: recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/doom-eternal-recensione.html", "text": "We had left the Doom Slayer, also known as the Doom Guy, teleported who knows where in the epilogue of the DOOM reboot. And now the time has finally come to see (and experience) the next chapter in his escalation of violence and terror fueled by personal vengeance against the demons that have threatened humanity and turned his entire existence upside down. It is starting from this simple and effective narrative premise that the umpteenth sequel to id Software's most prolific and best-selling franchise, also produced this time by Bethesda Softworks, DOOM Eternal, kicks off. An hyper-adrenaline sequel, perfectly in line with its predecessor, which leaves very little time to stop and breathe and which, partly due to its peculiar gameplay and partly due to a very strict embargo, we played practically all at once breath. Now we will try to rearrange the ideas to try to make you better understand the judgment and considerations at the basis of our review of DOOM Eternal which, it is clear from these first few lines, we liked and satisfied us exactly as we were liked and satisfied its predecessor even if for partly different reasons. Because let's say it right away: Eternal is configured as the enhanced and corrected more of the same of that gameplay that the reboot of DOOM, and only it, has been able to create and define. A side note: during our review session it was not possible to access the multiplayer component made up of the new asymmetric Battle Mode which sees a Slayer player face two other users who impersonate as many demons selected from a roster of 5 creatures. Despite this lack, we considered the single player campaign of the game sufficient to express an opinion on the title and therefore we refer you to our future multiplayer special to read our considerations on the matter. History Let's start with the most accessory element of the DOOM Eternal gaming experience: its plot. The game is the immediate continuation of what was narrated in the 2016 DOOM but its prologue is so basic and frayed that, even those who remembered the very few essential elements of the prequel story by heart, will struggle a lot to find points of contact or in any case elements of continuity. Eternal immediately launches you into the action, without worrying in the least about either remembering what had happened, or justifying the time that passed between the events of the two chapters (about a couple of years). This immediately shows how id Software wants to repeat slavish one of the DOOM mantras: the almost total uselessness of the plot or in any case its need to remain in the background as a pure glue capable of justifying any changes of setting or, at the limit, the introduction of some even bigger, ruthless and cool to deal with. So, whether or not you've played DOOM 2016 (or any other DOOM), you can safely jump into Eternal without risking missing out on any plot passages or remaining ignorant of fascinating twists and turns. Yes, that's right, something happened in the reboot, we killed someone important, saved someone else, caused a bit of a mess and suddenly we're somewhere else, no one knows why or how, even more enraged and with the need to kill more demons. However, as we proceed with the single player campaign of DOOM Eternal, we realize how this time id Software wanted to at least make an attempt: to tell something that had its own coherence and that would draw the outlines of a journey of growth of the protagonist ; a sort of epilogue to a rebellion that has been going on for millennia and that has its roots in that anger that punctuates every action of the DOOM Slayer since he appeared in the known universe and began to wield weapons and other instruments of death. therefore not being able to go into the details of the story told in Eternal both for spoiler issues and for a whole series of limitations related to the embargo, we must however underline that we appreciated the game's ability not to neglect some passages of the plot of the previous chapter by proposing again even key characters, and at the same time we were struck by id Software's willingness to create a sort of continuity within the jagged and disconnected (and often conflicting) universe of DOOM. It's just a pity that to appreciate these ~niceties~ it will be necessary to have a lot of patience to read the numerous entries that make up the game codex, obviously after having found and collected them all along the progression of the campaign. Acampaign that will take you a good 15-18 hours to complete by aiming to collect all the secrets and collectibles scattered throughout the levels. For the rest of the game, the story is instead told through skimpy cutscenes, various background dialogues and the inevitable written text that accompanies the loading of a new level. All in perfect id Software style, in short. The gameplay But it is true that if you have approached this review, you will hardly have done so driven by the desire to face a walking simulator or some title with a strong narrative component. DOOM Eternal is, beyond some frills, pure gameplay: a first person shooter where, first of all, you shoot a lot, and then, if you have some time before the next fight, you ask yourself a few questions. Going more specifically to the gameplay, we are faced with a sort of hybrid between an arena shooter and a more classic ~corridor~ FPS. Let it be clear that those who have already played the DOOM of 2016 know exactly what they will be faced with since Eternal, as we said at the beginning of the article, is a more of the same: more full-bodied, more extensive in mechanics and, in some aspects, more refined. We were talking about the hybrid because in the game there will be phases in which we will have to go through very linear sections of connection with very few or no monsters, sometimes enriched by platform segments, interspersed with real arenas where the game will launch us against waves gradually growing number of enemies increasingly varied in the composition of the opposing ranks. These parts of the level are well marked to allow us to understand at a glance, observing the inevitable and simply perfect 3D map, when we need to prepare and when instead we can breathe for a moment. Within these arenas, Eternal completely changes pace and the combat becomes obsessive and hyper-adrenaline forcing the player to demonstrate great skill and timeliness in commands, always being careful to study the geometry of the level design to make the most of platforms, obstacles , buffers, holds and takes them in a long convulsive dance where jumps, dash, change of weapons and modules, collection of resources, shots, epic kills and any other way to do damage, become essential tools for survival. The timing and perfect management of the attack and escape actions become elements that the player must master in an exemplary way if he wants to proceed victorious in the continuation of the DOOM Eternal campaign, especially if he decides to play the game starting from the third level of difficulty to go up. There are 5 plus an activated option that links the game over to the consumption of extra lives that can be collected around the level. One can perfectly understand how much this sequel is built on the structure of the 2016 DOOM, like a sort of sarcophagus that covers the previous chapter but at the same time leaves some interstitial space to insert new mechanics and elements so as to enrich an already perfectly tested gameplay. Everything is oiled and run in, but not everything in our opinion manages to expand the original gameplay naturally. As already happened in the past, DOOM's combat is based on a sort of Chinese morra where stone, paper and scissors are interpreted by the mouths of fire with which we inflict damage, by the chainsaw that allows you to kill demons with one blow weaker ones (or with 3 greater ones) to recover ammunition and from the well-known epic kills that allow you to finish off a stunned monster with a gruesome animation to gain vital energy. These 3 methods of offense have been joined in this sequel as many new attacks. A special melee shot, the fist of blood, which charges through epic kills and which allows you to inflict a lot of area damage, a shoulder flamethrower which sets enemies on fire on the frontal cone and allows them to release armor when we hit them as long as they are on fire and two different types of grenades that allow us to do further explosion damage or to freeze the opponents for a few seconds. These introductions, if on the one hand they enrich and offer a minimum of novelty and originality to a gameplay otherwise identical to itself, on the other hand they are not perfectly blended and grafted into the ~original~ Chinese morra. Or at least they don't seem to have undergone the same finishing work. There is certainly little to say about the flamethrower which is the only one that fits perfectly into the shooting loop represented by the need to recover energy, ammunition and armor during the kills, while we are were less pleased by the fist of bloodwhich is performed with the same key as the classic melee strike and the epic kill. In the frenzy of the most advanced fights, in fact, you will very often ~unload~ it against a minor demon, convinced that the latter is in stunning mode and therefore ready for the epic killing, essential for recovering energy. And rest assured that not having a handful of blood ready can often turn into an easy rout if cornered by many contemporary enemies. But the management of the double grenade convinced us even less: not so much for their decidedly obvious basic utility, but also in this case for a little intuitive management of the commands. Instead of being able to choose 2 different keys to launch the 2 types of explosives, id Software has seen fit to dedicate a key to the actual launch and another key to the switch of the active grenade. Also in this case, since DOOM Eternal is not a reflexive and staid shooter, the need to actually press an extra key every time you want to throw ~the other~ grenade, translates into trivial errors that can compromise war dance and therefore in not feeling perfectly and completely masters of all the paraphernalia at our disposal. However, we want one question to be very clear: we realize that we are looking for the elusive hair in the egg but, in our opinion, in a title like DOOM Eternal where the player's skill, the control of the arena and the perfect management of weapons and special functions are an integral part of a gameplay that has its own fun in being completely ~skill-based~, any distracting element or not perfectly optimized can immediately trigger frustration. The unlockables The desire to expand and enrich the existing gameplay is very clear in the choice of id Software to dramatically enhance the unlockables of DOOM Eternal. The 2 additional modules for each weapon return from the previous chapter (with the exception of a pair of guns that cannot be upgraded), which in fact represent the secondary fire mode that can be used with the right button. These modules, once acquired, can be modified on the fly even during the action by pressing a key and waiting for the time necessary for the animation. These are options that significantly alter the use of the equipment and that the player will learn to master during the campaign, ending up with personal preferences based on his style of play. Once again, each module can then be further enhanced to have additional bonuses or effects, but to do so we will have to spend coins that are earned by reducing the level of corruption of each level. To do this we will have to complete all the various encounters with enemies including a couple of extra bonus activities which we will discuss later. Each module also has a mastery level that is unlocked by completing a certain activity, usually the killing of a certain number of opponents using that weapon's special ability. Instead, forming part of the collectible secrets scattered throughout the levels, we find another type of tokens that can be spent to upgrade the DOOM Slayer's Praetor armor: these are passive bonuses ranging from upgrades relating to the 2 grenades, up to greater resistance to explosions of barrels or radioactive liquids, without neglecting an increase in the speed of epic kills or the change of weapons and modules and an improvement in the functions of the automap. Runes also return from the previous DOOM, these too to be found around the levels and which determine some passive upgrades always related to movement speed and bonuses linked to epic killings. We will be able to assemble 3 of them at a time, which can be modified through the internal menu of the game. And we are not finished yet because in Eternal the crystals of the sentinels also return, which allow you to have a permanent increase in the maximum value of vital energy, armor and ammunition. Only this time while we choose what to upgrade, we will also be able to have access to further passive bonuses, linked to the shoulder flamethrower and epic kills. In short, there was a real hemorrhage of elements that can be unlocked, upgraded and configured and if on the one hand this made us happy because it allows an even more granular customization of the style of play so as to meet everyone's preferences, on the other hand, from the very first hours of the game, a certain basic confusion between the various management screens is noticed and, more generally, a tendency is perceived in the game to throw a lot of things at you to unlock, perhaps even too many if you start to thoroughly analyze their functionality.", "date": "2020-03-17", "grade": "8.8"}
