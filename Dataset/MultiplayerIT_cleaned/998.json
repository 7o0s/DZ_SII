{"name": "God of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/god-of-war-2.html", "text": "The Wrath of the Gods For the setting of its product, the Sony studio in Santa Monica has decided to use a ~revised and corrected~ version of classical Greek mythology. The main character is in fact Kratos, a Spartan general willing to do anything to satisfy his hunger for victory; also willing to sell his soul to Ares, the god of war, in order to obtain such great power as to make him invincible. Yet the story opens with the statuary protagonist in despair as he leaps from the highest mountain in Greece. Flashback. Three weeks before. From here begins the adventure of Kratos, and immediately the player is thrown into the center of the action on a ship in the middle of the Aegean Sea, obviously full of undead warriors who are anything but friendly. But what already transpires after the first moments of the game is one of the most characteristic aspects of God of War, or the extreme violence and the abundant amount of blood that characterizes each clash. Armed with a pair of swords tied to his forearms with chains, Kratos is in fact one of the most mercilessly gory characters that the screens of any console have been able to witness. Severed heads and limbs are the norm, while pressing the delegated grappling key generates even more lethal effects in relation to the enemy faced: sinking your hands into the spine and splitting the victim's body into two parts is an example, as is the possibility to jump on the head of the gigantic cyclops and then open their belly with his own blade and so on. Initially it's all here, blind and brutal fury without many questions; yes, because the story of Kratos unfolds little by little, in such an apt and exciting way as to overshadow a screenplay that is very suitable for the purpose, but certainly not particularly original. Yet step by step we begin to empathize with this semi-naked warrior, with a sculpted physique and a proud gaze, apparently devoid of any feeling but in reality moved by a great thirst for revenge. An enormous contribution to this ~evolution~ of the player/alter-ego relationship is provided by the majestic epic mission that the gods, Zeus in the first place, assign to the mortal Kratos: to kill the god of war Ares, and thus stop his mad thirst for destruction that is wreaking havoc on the city of Athens. A mission that is impossible only to imagine, if it weren't for the presence of the ~Pandora's box~ which in the imagination of the developers is nothing but the only weapon capable of killing a god. Obviously obtaining it is far from an easy undertaking, and the search for this only source of hope for Kratos is in fact what commits most of the game hours offered by God of War. The gods are with me The game mechanics of the title created by Santa Monica studios, as already mentioned above, are clearly based on action. And in a game belonging to this vein, the most important element regarding the enjoyment of the overall experience is undoubtedly the control system. In this sense, the American programmers have been able to create what can be defined as a real point of reference for the genre, making the Dual Shock an authentic and direct means of connection between player and character. Kratos' reactivity is in fact exceptional, so much so that it allows you to have an excellent command after just a few moments of play; in this sense, the decision to delegate to the right analog the possibility of making a sprint in the chosen direction is decidedly apt, ideal for avoiding shots and attacking immediately. Perfectly aware of the need to continuously stimulate the user with a soft but very extensive learning curve, the game designers have decided to give life to a real evolution of Kratos, by learning new moves and skills that go slowly to broaden the spectrum of available actions. Among these there is no shortage of new weapons and spells, provided by encounters with ~friend~ gods on particular occasions. The amalgam between the combat system and the use of spells is excellent, with the latter authentically demonstrating that they have a function that is not at all ancillary within the overall economy. On the contrary, the different approaches that these provide to the mere physical confrontation with the opponents give a further dose of variety and depth to the game, already guaranteed by the sublime combat system. Speaking of enemies, obviously the programmers wanted to stay on topic by creating a host of creatures that refers directly to the mythological monsters of the epic poems: minotaurs, cyclops, gorgons, harpies, hydras and so on, each with its own schemeof attack, its strengths and weaknesses and each eliminated with a different coup de grace. Yes, because among the many goodies inserted by the Santa Monica team, there is also the possibility of performing a real special move once a certain amount of damage has been inflicted on enemies. At this point, in fact, an icon of the circle key will appear on the head of the latter, the pressure of which will start - during the clashes with the ~larger~ creatures - a real ~mini-game~ ... obviously from the results particularly gory. And so, for example with the minotaurs, it will be possible to witness a showdown to be won by repeatedly and quickly hitting the delegate key, to then see Kratos thrust the sword into the skull through the monster's mouth. For the cyclops, however, the matter is different, since it is necessary to press a sequence of keys to be able to open their guts without the slightest mercy ... and so on. In reality, two or three more enemy races would not have hurt, but already the God of War bestiary can boast a variety and a characterization completely unknown to many games of the genre. The beauty of Olympus Technically, Sony production is an authentic monument to the goodness of Ps2 hardware, if entrusted to competent hands. First of all, the settings of God of War are not divided into levels but are part of a single, huge world that opens up seamlessly in front of the player. No loading, no waiting. The data is continuously streamed from the disc to the Ps2 processor providing a feeling of credibility and belonging to the landscapes and places crossed that truly has few equals. The majesty of the polygonal environments created by the US team is simply incredible, both in the representation of the opulent city of Athens as in an arid and steep mountain when in an alienating desert and so on. The artistic direction of the Santa Monica team has succeeded in the arduous task of providing God of War with a uniqueness and a ~magic~ that only a few great games can boast of possessing. Some passages, then, are of those truly capable of remaining inextricably impressed in the eyes and hearts of gamers. One above all, the first meeting with Ares... But more generally, every detail of Sony production demonstrates a care and an inspiration that is typical only of titles worthy of entering history. The animations, for example, are connected to each other in a perfect way, without the slightest detachment between one and the other. Or the details and special effects, such as the sand that rises in the middle of the desert or the particle effects, or even the goodness of the textures and the solidity of the frame rate, only rarely scratched by some slight but irrelevant slowdown in the most agitated situations. The level design is excellent, and the tone of the adventure is always very high without moments of pause or tiredness thanks also to the presence of simple but well-studied puzzles that give further variety to the adventure. Among the most exciting moments of God of War, the boss fights undoubtedly deserve mention; in these cases the validity of the graphics engine is reconfirmed, animating creatures of enormous dimensions to perfection in a credible way and putting the player in the position of having to make up for the evident physical inferiority with alternative solutions to direct confrontation. It is a real shame in this sense that this kind of clashes can be counted on the fingers of one hand during the entire adventure. But probably the artistic aspect of the game that impresses most of all is the sound. The way the orchestrated pieces propel Kratos' exploits, now with energy and vigor, now with light accompaniment, is just perfect; the goodness of the musical choice is such as not to disfigure at all within a Hollywood blockbuster, and only by listening to it with your own ears can you realize its importance within the concept of involvement offered by God of War. Obviously the sound effects and the dubbing (English) are also extremely valid, confirming the commitment made by the programmers in the round. A perfect game then? Almost. Yes because unfortunately the Sony production is a wonderful experience, but slightly too short; in expert hands it is not difficult to reach the end before 9 hours of play. An acceptable longevity for an action game, but which could have been further extended especially in the final part of the adventure. And it is precisely in the last half hour of God of War that one is caught by the feeling that the programmers had to speed up to meet the deadline, with an all too rapid closure from a narrative point of view accompanied by a sagainst final a bit too classic, even more so considering the already mentioned previous approaches with the bosses. But these are still elements that cannot affect the incredible overall quality of the effort of Santa Monica Studios, a game that came out of nowhere but worthy of entering the top 10 of the best titles that appeared on the Sony monolith. Comment God of War is, quite simply, among the best games that Playstation 2 has offered in its entire life. It seems strange to speak in these terms of a product released without anyone noticing, far from the hype and clamor that usually accompanies titles of similar thickness. Yet the effort of Santa Monica Studios is a real monument of the action genre, capable of oozing quality from every pore and equipped with a simply exceptional game structure. Which, flanked by a sumptuous graphic design and a simply incredible audio component, make God of War a must-buy for any lover of the genre. An ~almost~ masterpiece therefore, which finds its only real defects in a not very consistent longevity and in a sincerely subdued final half hour compared to the rest of the adventure. But these are details that cannot tarnish the brilliance of one of the most promising series of the coming years. Pros: Fabulous control system Exciting setting and engaging story development Gorgeous graphics and incredible audio Cons: Slightly too short Final half hour a little underwhelming A few more bosses and enemies would have been nice Second comment by Antonio ~Tanzen~ Fucito God of War is that action you don't expect, you follow it in strict silence during the course of its development, trusting in the good qualities transpired from the few videos that appeared on the net and from a summary test made during the last E3. Once you play it, you find yourself faced with an overflowing title and with an audio / visual sector that pushes Playstation 2 to the highest levels. GOW is positioned directly at the top of the action game genre, it is a title that manages to bring many sacred monsters of the genre into line, it is fun, immediate and constantly growing, with some absolutely interesting gimmicks (such as those to defeat certain types of creatures) in economy and game variety. If these are the premises, we have before us a series that will be talked about a lot over the next few years. Italian adaptation and Extra The version of God of War for our territory is completely localized in Italian, both in texts and in speech. The work done is generally good, beyond some repetition in the voice actors used for the various characters. The video adaptation sees once again the absence of the 60hz option and the progressive mode (present instead in the NTSC US version) but despite this it is well done, with black bands reduced to the bone and good general speed and fluidity. Finally, special mention should be made for the numerous extras present, some of which will be available after completing the adventure for the first time. Starting with the making of the game (all translated into Italian), passing through the possibility of viewing all the videos, the presence of a new extremely difficult level of difficulty, a mini-game, the levels eliminated in the final version and many other goodies that rotate around the world of Kratos, which we hope will be a protagonist again with the next generation of Consoles. Strange fate that of God of War. Presented during the first months of 2004, and able to collect excellent impressions from critics during E3 of the same year, it then continued its development period in almost absolute silence, reaching store shelves without hype or marketing campaigns high-sounding. And where is the strangeness, you ask? On the other hand, this is the fate that unites the vast majority of medium quality products for Ps2. The strangeness lies in the fact that God of War is not only not a ~medium quality~ product at all, but on the contrary it represents one of the best action games that has appeared during this generation of consoles.", "date": "2005-03-21", "grade": null}
