{"name": "SkateBird", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skatebird-recensione.html", "text": "There aren't many skateboard games and those on the market hardly manage to get out of the tradition imposed by good old Tony Hawk. This is why SkateBird's review can be particularly interesting, given that it is a title that offers something a little different from the usual in this area. The basic idea is decidedly bizarre: instead of normal human beings who perform on tables equipped with wheels, in this case we are dealing with birds of various species and features which, for the rest, prove capable of performing precisely the same tricks of the overrated Homo Sapiens, apparently. There's also a story behind this oddity: the birds seem to be friends with a human whose life isn't going exactly in the best way, and so they decided to help her recover. How? Through a complex plan that starts from tidying up the house and ends up upsetting the gray work routine of the person in question, all to be carried out simply by skateboarding and performing tricks around different environments. There is very little sense in all this, but the fact was to find an excuse to put birds on skateboards and set goals to complete through the levels, and it is perhaps even more than we usually find in a game of this guy, so we're not complaining. On the other hand, birds somehow manage to be truly charismatic, even more than the usual licensed skaters, although their anatomy makes it rather complicated to understand precisely how tricks are performed, as well as seeing them rather rigid in terms of physical interaction with the elements of the scenery, but it's all part of the strange game. Skater birds on a mission In SkateBird, the birds ride skateboards and perform classic tricks The ~story~, if we want to define it that way, takes place through five scenarios that start from the girl's apartment and develop in various external settings and then return to the initial house, positioning in these various objectives to be completed but offering, essentially , a large amount of ramps, edges and lines for grinding, jumps and other possibilities to perform ollies and chained tricks. Since we are talking about rather small birds, the scenarios reflect this unprecedented scale by presenting oversized objects, having to look at them from the particular perspective of sparrows, parrots or the like. The effect is a bit that of the old Micro Machines, with more or less everyday scenarios but in a magnified version given the new point of view, all experienced, in this case, through the use of the skateboard. The story unfolds through missions which are basically pretexts to perform certain performances, giving a certain sense of narrative progression to the execution of assorted tricks. At the end of the day, we do not deviate from the standards imposed by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in 1999, which can disappoint all those who expected something actually different from an approach of this kind, also because the overall results are well below what was achieved with the recent Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. What remains valid, in Skatebird, however, is its particular characterization, which remains impressed and pushes us to become attached to the strange characters and unusual settings in which it takes place: the game never wants to take itself seriously and this is an important aspect, adding humor to gameplay that does not, however, give up even complex technicalities, as is the tradition of the genre. More classic gameplay than expected In SkateBird we perform in everyday settings with oversized objects The idea of skater birds is little exploited, based above all on the possibility of performing a double ollie to reach a height that is normally impossible, as well as being able to glide using the supplied wings. These are features that work to increase the verticality of the levels, but in the general gameplay they don't find great depth of use, since the tricks still derive from the classic tradition. The result is a sort of middle ground between an arcade driven to paroxysm and a classic skateboard game, which struggles a bit to find its place and make sense of the basic concept, while still being fun even as a simple digression from the standard genre. The other characterizing element of SkateBird also suffers from the same problem, namely the fact of being a brilliant idea but not fully exploited, remaining little more than a divertissement on the standard canvas: we are talking about bird-friendly level design. Carrying the action in a countthis miniaturized can give free rein to the imagination in the construction of parks, paths and structures, which in fact characterize a large part of the levels of the game, but everything tends to remain a bit dispersive. It is not easy to understand exactly which way to go to find the various missions to undertake, also due to a somewhat reduced visual distance, given by a somewhat aggressive blurring of the elements further away from the protagonist. A bird with special customization in SkateBird Once you find the NPCs that start the various ~quests~, the game finds its best moments, because these tasks are usually well-constructed and able to balance exploration of the scenarios and the need to learn the tricks to perform, but it is not easy to maintain a good rhythm in the action. The interludes with the other birds are always very enjoyable, and it is clear how this feature of the birds has been well exploited by the developers, peppering the action with surreal humor. Another important element of Skatebird such as customization also beats on this key: as you progress in the game, you unlock new types of birds, colors, clothes and accessories to change the appearance of the protagonist, with a truly remarkable amount of combinations and laughable results guaranteed.", "date": "2021-09-20", "grade": "6.2"}
