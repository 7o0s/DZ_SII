One of the most popular gamebook series was Lone Wolf, which recently became a video game on mobile platforms thanks to Forge Reply. However, in a way even more linked to textual narration, the British team Inkle, already quite an expert in the genre thanks to the two chapters of Sorcery!, has decided to reinterpret Jules Verne's classic ~around the world in 80 days~ in a steampunk sauce . And the result is truly amazing. 80 Days is a gamebook of the modern era, of extraordinary quality from every point of view 80 Days has only one ~defect~, if you can define it that way: it is a game completely in English, and considering the amount of text that you need to read, at least a sufficient knowledge of the language is essential. If you do not meet this requirement, unfortunately Inkle's product will not be appreciated. Closing the necessary parenthesis, let's go to the point: 80 Days was born from the same premises as Verne's work, starting from the protagonists who are also in this case Phileas Fogg, a rich English gentleman, and his French servant Passepartout. The player is called to take on the role of the latter during the journey that will take both around the world in an attempt to circumnavigate it in 80 days. The game essentially develops in the choice of the route to take, or in which cities to visit each time in a non-linear or pre-established way, for a total of 150: each small or large location brings with it a broad textual description of the place, the areas that can be explored and possibly the people with whom you can interact to discover the new routes to choose from. The portions of the story often end with crossroads, which precisely allow choices to be made that determine the subsequent development of events. But it's not just about this: during the trip, Passepartout also has to deal with managing Fogg's finances, because each leg has a cost that can also be considerable based on the vehicle used and the distance to travel. Making a bank withdrawal is not always possible due to the time required, so it is often useful to manage purchases and sales at local markets: what you buy in one place can have a lot of value in another, which is why it is necessary to organize this sort of micro-economy in the best possible way. Also because every object in your possession consumes space inside the suitcase: although it is possible to buy more, transporting them around the world involves an additional cost that must be considered. In addition to this, there is also the gentleman's health to take into consideration: exhausting, long journeys and in uncomfortable conditions compromise Mr. Fogg's well-being, which is why it is advisable to take care of him both with small attentions and with curative objects and clothing suitable for the place visited. These are playful elements that fit well within what is and remains a product completely devoted to storytelling: and it is precisely in this aspect that one can appreciate the exceptional work done by Meg Jayanth, writer and author of the plot of 80 Days for a mammoth work of half a million words. Each city brings with it an adventure, each journey involves encounters with different characters, friendly or otherwise, often bizarre, and the decisions made have tangible consequences that affect the progression of the story. And obviously every game is different from the other, because the path to be taken through the different stages can also prove to be completely different. Although in a product of this type the graphic component is all in all marginal, Inkle has also succeeded in giving life to a more than pleasant aesthetic, characterized by a rather original style and full of personality. Also noteworthy is the accompaniment by Laurence Chapman, always polite, pleasant and fully in focus.", "date": "2014-09-22", "grade": "9.0"}
