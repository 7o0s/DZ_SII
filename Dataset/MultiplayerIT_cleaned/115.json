A somewhat muted game compared to other more high-sounding productions, the adventure of the French team has in fact managed to be appreciated by both critics and the public, making itself talked about on several occasions. It is a product not without some defects, but able to convince above all thanks to the setting and the narrative aspect, which we also had the opportunity to deepen in its time through a special seen from the eyes of a parent. A deserved success therefore, which Asobo Studio recently celebrated with the announcement of the sequel A Plague Tale: Requiem, arriving in 2022, and with the news of the publication of A Plague Tale: Innocence also on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X | S, as well as on Nintendo Switch in the cloud version. A tempting opportunity to recover this title in case you missed it during the previous generation, considering that the game is available for download at no additional cost both via PlayStation subscription Plus that Xbox Game Pass, with the addition of support for the hardware capabilities offered by the two platforms. Given the necessary premises, we just have to get to the heart of our review of A Plague Tale: Innocence for PS5 and Xbox Series X | S. Storyline and gameplay In many respects it is, of course, the same A Plague Tale: Innocence that we saw a couple of years ago: we will therefore not be repeating the same things written in the review of A Plague Tale: Innocence published in its time. For the benefit of those who want a small summary of the setting, however, let's remember that the story told takes place in the Kingdom of France in 1348, grappling with the Hundred Years War against the Kingdom of England. In addition to this conflict, like all of Europe, the house of the De Rune family (which we know at the beginning of the story) is also overwhelmed by the black plague, thus starting the particularly dark period in which the world imagined by the developers of A Plague Tale: Innocence. The protagonist is the young Amicia, forced to leave home in the company of her little brother Hugo, suffering from a mysterious illness. The two will thus have to make their way through battlefields and places infested with rats, to be carefully avoided as they are the number one suspects for the spread of the disease. As for the gameplay of A Plague Tale: Innocence, the dominant component is without a shadow of doubt the stealth one. A girl and a boy would certainly not be able to hold a candle to soldiers, especially considering that Amicia is equipped only with a sling. The latter can however be used in case of need as a weapon, above all on the occasion of some forced confrontations, but its main use is to distract the enemies by making noise away from the two children and thus allowing the young woman and her brother Hugo to sneak off undisturbed. The level of challenge proposed to the player is not particularly high, but fortunately it is possible to modify some parameters of the options to add a pinch of pathos to the adventure. The PS5 version So let's now come to the nextgen test, carried out on PlayStation 5. First of all, you need to download the 1.09 patch which adds the features related to the new consoles to A Plague Tale: Innocence. The first difference is noticeable as soon as the game is started: the PS5 remains silent, while trying to run the PS4 Pro version you immediately hear the fans start at full speed. All this already from the initial menu, without even starting the actual game. This is a very welcome practical aspect for our ears. From a technical point of view, the notes of the nextgen patch of A Plague Tale: Innocence speak of support for 4K UHD, which however in the final act translates into a more modest resolution of 2560x1440p. However, this is a gain if we consider that the PlayStation 4 Pro version ran with its 1080p upscaling, but obviously far from the true 4K resolution guaranteed by the PC version. Beyond the technicalities, the graphic improvement is tangible to the eye especially as regards the cleaning of the image, completing what was already an excellent job in the care of the colors and settings, inspired by the paintings of Claude Lorrain. If in the review of the PlayStation 4 version we complained of a loss of detail in the transition from internal to external scenes, adit's all getting extremely sharper. Facial details such as freckles are thus much better distinguished and the rendering of the hair of the characters appears much improved. The blur effect in the image, which previously often accompanied the action, has also been significantly reduced. From the transition to the nextgen, the management of the lights also gains, especially as regards the lighting of the characters in the dim light and the management of the shadows in general. Another welcome element is the transition to sixty frames per second, which, net of very slight drops, makes the action of the game flow more fluidly. We also note what is practically a zeroing of loading times, thanks to which it is possible to get to the heart of A Plague Tale: Innocence in a very few moments. As regards the PlayStation 5 version, we also register support for the features offered by the DualSense controller. The game is now much more precise in giving feedback to the player through vibration, also improving some phases of the gameplay through this aspect. When we run away from some pursuer we can, for example, ~feel~ Amicia's faster and more frightened step in our hands, thus at least partially fueling the feeling of really having it breathing down our necks, which instead was a bit lacking in the old version. Similarly, when the protagonist spins her slingshot we can now perceive the movement with the controller, finding the inevitable resistance in the adaptive trigger of the R2 key when we go to throw the stone. Finally, for those who love to play using a good pair of headphones, such as the Pulse 3D, they will be pleased to know about the support for 3D audio, which certainly doesn't hurt.", "date": "2021-07-08", "grade": "8.2"}
