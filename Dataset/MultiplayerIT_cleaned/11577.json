{"name": "Silent Hunter 4 U-Boat Missions - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-hunter-4-u-boat-missions-recensione.html", "text": "Another move With the fourth episode of Ubisoft's successful submerged saga we had moved from the Old Lady (and we're not talking about the football teams, but from Europe) to migrate to the Pacific Ocean where, literally, fleets of irritated Japanese gave a hard time to the American submarine commanders. If you managed to survive the continuous air attacks and depth charges, with this expansion Ubisoft wanted to make things even more complicated for you: if in fact, in the months following the attack on Pearl Harbor you will enjoy enormous naval and air superiority , which you will have to administer according to your needs, the situation will gradually worsen as the conflict progresses, realistically resuming the US advance through the islands first (who remembers Guadalcanal?) and then up to the enemy's command heart, Japan. The gameplay remains substantially unchanged compared to the base game, but some interesting innovations make this expansion worthy of the vote you find on the side. The first news It was said that the game mechanics are always the same: start from a base of your choice, sink as much floating stuff as possible (maybe not the allied ships), flee from irritated enemies and return safely to the base. Wolves of The Pacific's worst flaw was precisely the repetitiveness of the action, slightly mitigated by a small variety in the missions assigned, but still perceptible after several hours of play: in U-Boat Missions, everything is enriched by the possibility of requesting the intervention of allied units, both air and naval. Because playing the role of the always good Americans is boring by now and being on the side of the bad guys has its charm, as well as having a huge hold on the fairer sex and on Fucito The first news Thanks to an improved scripting system, the chance of allied and enemy convoys colliding is greatly increased, allowing you to participate in epic battles between good and evil, where only the pure of heart will survive. No, this is about another review, don't pay attention to it. Large-scale clashes, it was said, which give you a feeling of total immersion (this is really painful, luckily Pierpaolo is no longer with us, otherwise he would have already fired me) in the game, giving you the impression of fighting not only a tiny and isolated confrontation, but rather to be a small pawn in an immensely greater conflict. And also the last one! The developers didn't stop there: the possibility of requesting the intervention of allied units is only the tip of the iceberg of the strategic system envisaged by this expansion, which fits into a decidedly broader context. The possibility of requesting the intervention of allied units is, in the first place, subject to your skills and your rank: do not think that the Admiralty places all its fleet and resources at the disposal of the first rookie, but access to the most powerful means you will have to earn them on the field, sinking the greatest number of enemy units and not requiring unnecessary and expensive sorties of naval units or reconnaissance flights. Initially you will be able to rely on a small number of reconnaissance aircraft, very useful for identifying the most vulnerable enemy units and avoiding dangerous clashes with the always fearsome destroyers: then thanks to a completely rewritten AI system, all the allied units you call you they will communicate (if you can receive messages, check your residual credit) all the sightings made, providing you with geographical coordinates and a whole series of very useful information. Don't think, however, that you have victory in your hand: if you behave like fools and sacrifice too many allied lives with excessively dangerous requests for support, as well as losing precious prestige points, you will risk receiving an unpleasant ~Permission Denied~ (like when I asked for a raise, same thing) when you need it most to save yourself and your crew. Comment A pleasant package, this U-Boat Missions, with an unfortunate name, but still well packaged. In addition to the usual aesthetic upgrades and the introduction of new units (see gray box nearby), Ubisoft has brought a breath of fresh air to its base game, giving you an excellent reason to reinstall this little masterpiece. The strategic system works wonderfully and we are sure it will be integrated in future expansions or, why not, in a future Silent Hunter V. Enjoy your immersion!Pros & ConsPros Interesting expansion Well thought out strategy system Back to U-boats Cons Stay Silent Hunter 4 Graphics slightly outdated More news? The package also includes a series of graphics fixes (whichpatch 1.4 had however already brought), the possibility of starting from new Japanese bases such as Penang, Singapore, Jakarta and Surabaya and new units under your control, such as reconnaissance aircraft and some German ships, including a devastating heavy cruiser, able to stand up to the most heavily armored American warships. Add to it new navigation maps, intelligence information and a more complex system of upgrades, slightly different from the one seen in Wolves of The Pacific. What more do you want from life? Silent Hunter 4: U-Boat Missions is available for PC. Introduction We return to the depths of the ocean with a nice expansive package (a term freshly coined for the occasion, which will make most people's skin crawl), but this time again in the role of a German commander Because, let's face it, play the role of the always good Americans are tired of it now and being on the side of the bad guys has its charm, as well as having a huge hold on the fairer sex!", "date": "2008-03-10", "grade": null}
