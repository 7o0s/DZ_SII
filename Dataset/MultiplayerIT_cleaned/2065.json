{"name": "Fila Decathlon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fila-decathlon.html", "text": "You have to train to win The game offers us only two modes: Championship or Training. Obviously the advice is to start from a practical training session in which we can freely select one of the ten (this explains why deca=ten -thlon) specialties present. They range from 100m to the long jump, from high jump to 100m hurdles to pass through discus throw, javelin throw, 400m, 1500m, shot put and pole vault. Obviously, before being able to start the actual training, it will be essential to carefully follow the instructions that the developers have implemented for all of us. We will be able to witness a simulated event in which the CPU explains to us point by point which commands to use to best perform a specific athletic gesture. We will immediately notice several affinities with the track'n filed command system, i.e. alternatively pressing the A and B keys as quickly as possible, then clicking on the arrow keys at the right moment to throw the weight or take a high jump, just to give a few examples . After the instructions and after a bit of training in the various disciplines we are ready to face the only real game mode or the Championship! Finally the championship In the Championship mode we will be asked to choose which nation to represent among the fifteen available. After completing this formality (no parameter of the athlete will change) we will finally be ready to give life to one of the most grueling challenges you have ever participated in. Here we will no longer be able to choose which discipline to try our hand at but we will have an obligatory path that will wind through the two days of the event and will lead us to compete with 4 other digital players representing half the world. Unfortunately it will be almost impossible to keep up with him. For when you make an effort to press A and B quickly, the speed bar will never match that of your opponents, bringing an unhealthy dose of frustration that will accompany you in the continuation of the Championship. Another inconsistency is the presence of an option (which can be activated from the main screen under Options) which will allow us to enable or disable the wind. Once set on, no information will be provided regarding its direction or speed and frankly, in three days of testing the product, I have never been affected by the presence of this phantom wind. Once the tournament is finished (obviously in the last places) you will totally lack the incentive to continue, moreover in the absence of any bonuses and extras. Graphics and Sound The backdrops are well designed and filled with Fila and THQ advertising billboards (who knows why) as well as the characterization of the athletes is well done. In short, if you have Track'n Field in mind we will find a graphically similar product in our hands with the addition of some interesting musical motifs that will constantly accompany us in the continuation of the races. Inevitable effects typical of the world of athletics such as the initial start, or the noise of the weight when it lands. In general, this sector behaves without infamy or praise! Row & Funds Summing up, Fila Decathlon is yet another title that focuses entirely on the license, while neglecting all the aspects that make a title attractive. After 10 years we still have to review titles that have much, much to envy to Konami's track'n filed that ran on the ancient NES. Really not recommended to everyone! PROS: Fila license CONS: Mistuned difficulty Only one real game mode Licensed products have always been the cross and delight of the videogame people. Films, comics, TV series, more or less hidden advertising of large multinationals are going to influence the gaming world more and more massively. Even this Fila Decathlon does not escape the charm of an official license so much so that it shows off the Fila brand, the result of an agreement that will lead THQ to develop various sports titles using the brand of one of the world's leaders in sportswear. But as expected, the game boasts the license and little else, let's see why!", "date": "2002-07-02", "grade": null}
