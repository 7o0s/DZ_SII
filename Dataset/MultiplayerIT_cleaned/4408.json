The answer can never really be unequivocal: certain little-sold titles may seem more deserving of a return to stores than others, but even planetary successes deserve a remaster or a change of platform after a generational change, especially if we are talking about products that are significant for gaming everything. Today, however, we are talking about a real extreme case; of a game that almost unchallenged dominates the top of its genre, whose only bad luck was coming out for one of the most ignored consoles of the great N, and which even in an alternative universe where fate had been less adverse to it would have deserved without a shadow of doubt a port on Switch... Today we're talking about Bayonetta 2. And no guys, we're not exaggerating: Bayonetta 2 is the best action hack 'n' slash ever made, an evolution of its predecessor in all respects, capable of reach peaks of entertainment and entertainment that are unthinkable even within a sub-genre that makes excess and speed its lowest common denominators. His arrival on Switch is therefore sacrosanct, obvious, and very sensible in anticipation of the already announced Bayonetta 3 (which we await in the throes of sacred fury). However, a basic problem remains, namely the effective quality of the work performed; because the inclusion of the Nintendo hybrid console in the library will also be mandatory in this case, but it must be done with care and criterion, or you risk ruining a masterpiece. The wonder of imperfection Overall Bayonetta 2 and the first Bayonetta are closely related, and narratively fit together like a perfect puzzle (a feature that greatly increases the enjoyment of finishing them in series). However, the plot is certainly not the strong point of this second chapter, since it is an enjoyable story but far from being extraordinary, and serves more than anything else to justify increasingly absurd and dangerous situations in which to insert the most unstoppable witch of the gaming world. More precisely, the story of the second chapter revolves around the strange imbalances between the forces of hell and heaven, and Bayonetta's desperate race against time to save the soul of Jeanne, trapped in hell after an unexpected accident. The final result? A game where the developers have had the opportunity to indulge themselves more than ever, with opponents coming both from the depths of hell and from above, and which literally makes its predecessor pale in terms of variety of opponents and chapters. To all this is clearly added a magnificent gameplay: direct evolution of the previous one but taken to the limit by even more peculiar weapons, a valuable increase in learnable maneuvers and combinations, and by a more sensible key configuration (which facilitates the use of the dodge while fixed targeting of enemies). The combat system is therefore something indescribable, capable of leading to moments of pure ecstasy when everything fits perfectly and dear Cereza gracefully dances between exploding enemies, final blows with instruments of torture, huge demonic projections, and weapon variables (especially the Undine, with their ability to set opponents on fire and freeze them, have always won us over). Yet even in a diamond there can be an imperfection, and Bayonetta 2 in fact lacks hubris, focusing too much on huge and spectacular bosses at the expense of maneuver precision. Overall, the result is a slightly less refined game than its predecessor, which reaches its zenith in clashes against multiple opponents, but loses some sense in front of certain enemies as big as buildings. Faster. stronger. We are talking about criticisms shouted into the wind, mind you: some bosses that are worse calculated than others are not enough to diminish an experience that embodies all that is beautiful about Platinum's action stylish, and is significantly more fun than the first chapter ( and to any other action, to be honest). On Switch then the quality of the title takes a further leap, and not only for the possibility of taking it with you wherever you go, but also for a significant improvement in fluidity. On the other hand Bayonetta 2 was one of the most beautiful and ~heavy~ titles in the WiiU library, and Nintendo's not exactly very powerful machine often failed to withstand the blow, so much so that the game sometimes had sharp drops in frame rate, and could hardly ever hold the 60 fps fixed. On Switch? The situation is quite different, and in the docked version everything flows almost flawlessly, with practically imperceptible drops in the most excited moments. Less welland instead in portability, where in certain maps particularly rich in details and enemies there are some hiccups (but in general we are faced with a frame rate that is still more stable than that seen in the past). This is a significant step forward for a game where reflexes are very important and the responsiveness of the commands is fundamental; the developers have therefore decided to leave the graphic impact alone and focus on optimization, maintaining a 720p resolution instead of aiming for the usual 1080p. We approve of the decision, in all sincerity: the game remains beautiful to look at, and a little more definition would have added very little to its already unpredictable and excessive cutscenes. Too bad that there are no extra content in this version, however priced upwards. You will be able to use Amiibo for costumes and extra bonuses (the same as in the WiiU version), still play cooperatively with the double apotheosis, and selectively replay the old chapters once all the weapons have been unlocked, but nothing real news. Not that there are few contents, please.", "date": "2018-02-14", "grade": "9.0"}
