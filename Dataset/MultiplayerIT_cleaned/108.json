{"name": "Assault Heroes - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assault-heroes-recensione.html", "text": "Multiplayer A self-respecting shooter must have a multiplayer mode, and Assault Heroes is no exception. At the beginning of the game we can choose whether to play alone or with a partner, which can be enjoyed either offline or through Xbox Live. In both cases, we will find ourselves facing practically the same game, but with a partner on our side, a twin who will fight cooperatively. Obviously, if you are inclined to play in company, this implies greater fun, also due to the fact that it often involves a challenge within a challenge in an attempt to grab all the power-ups that appear on the screen, before the other. On Xbox Live there is also the usual global ranking, or referring to your friends list, of the best scores obtained. A very simple concept With the evolution of videogame genres, and the technological advance of the next gen, it is a pleasure to go back to playing a title like Assault Heroes. It doesn't often happen now that we go back to the mindset that characterizes the most classic meaning of shooters: we are alone, in a hostile environment, everything that moves on the screen is a threat, and must be done away with. Where else is it possible, if not within Xbox Live Arcade, to find a game that liquidates all the story factor within a black background screen with a short writing, in which it is quickly explained that ~we are the last survivors of a strike team, and we have to fight our way up to the secret underground laboratory~? What this secret lab is, why we have to destroy it, what happened to all the others we don't care, that's not the point: simply, these are the facts, that's all you need to know when it comes to dodging bullets and destroying everything surrounds us. This is practically the backbone of the game, however enriched by a series of features that make the title particularly tempting: you fight both on foot and on board a vehicle, there is an energy bar to keep under control and we will have to juggle between three types of basic weapons, each with its own characteristics. To get an idea of what you'll find in front of you, think of Commando, Robotron, Total Carnage, Smash TV, SpyHunter and Total Annihilation: Assault Heroes comes out as a delightful medley of the main features of the games listed. Those who know them will be pleased to note the quotes inside, those who have not had the opportunity to try these classics, will find the Wanako title a breath of fresh air in the field of shooters. commands! Assault Heroes is essentially a vertical scrolling shooter (although in some cases there is movement on the horizontal axis, and in any case minimal movement is allowed on both axes), with the screen forcibly moving forward but also having the ability to stop and freeze its movement, to catch your breath and have time to collect bonuses. We move around the game maps aboard a vehicle, a sort of armored and armed dune buggy, which can be transformed into a motorboat if necessary, from which it is possible to get off and walk. The vehicle's energy is quantified by a bar, which drops in proportion to the damage received: when this reaches zero, the vehicle explodes, and forces us to go on foot (or on a water scooter in the ~marine~) for a certain period of time, after which the vehicle regenerates and can be driven again. The moment we find ourselves on foot, we will obviously be very exposed to enemy attacks, one bullet is enough to lose our lives and our attacks will be much less effective. However, for experienced players this can be counterbalanced by greater freedom of movement (but at low speed), and by the fact that enemies killed without using their vehicle earn double points. The fact that we are driving a car or a motorboat implies a different movement model to what we are used to expecting in a shooter: moving from one direction to another, for example, does not happen immediately, but we must take into account the time that the vehicle takes to change direction, first having to turn on itself and then taking the new direction of travel. This requires a more complex calculation of response times, and a more careful assessment of the position to take when we approach enemies, aware that we cannot count on the possibility of zig-zagging at high speed between bullets. The setting of the controls is reminiscent of Geometry Wars, to remain in the Live Arcade environment: with the left analog stick you control the vehicle, with the right one you direct the shot, with the right trigger you launch the bombs (also directional), while with the right backbone you select the type of weapon to use. The special attacks are implemented, in single player mode, by pressing Y, which triggers a vast explosion around the protagonist in the more classic ~smart bomb~ style, while by pressing X in co-operative mode (simultaneously with our partner) you access the combined special attack. By pressing B you can get off the vehicle and go on foot. It's a jungle out there The relative simplicity of the controls therefore implies the need to know how to use them perfectly, as in the tradition of the old arcade school. On the one hand, therefore, there is the need to calculate the movements of the vehicle well by virtue of its ~intricacy~, on the other, the only three types of weapon present hide the fact of having to use them in the best possible way: machine gun, flamethrower and cannon are in fact suitable for specific uses, and require the player to be switched frequently and with the right timing, since each of them is suitable for a particular type of enemy, but has weaknesses compared to the others. In the most typical shooter style, the enemies will come at us in torrents: land, sea, air, infantry and paratroopers will do everything to prevent you from accessing the precious ~secret underground laboratory~, bombarding you with blows or simply coming at you. As an example of the simple strategic thinking that must be employed, the best way to get rid of infantry (particularly the fearsome explosive kamikazes, who will lunge at them with howling battle cries) is a 360-degree flamethrower spray, while for for armored vehicles, the use of the cannon is recommended, extremely powerful but very slow in reloading. The machine gun, on the other hand, is the typical intermediate weapon, suitable for all purposes but not excessively powerful, nor very fast. Obviously, continuing in the game it is possible to collect different power-ups that will increase the power of each specific weapon, but to keep them you will need to stay alive as long as possible, or additional shields for the vehicle or simply bonus points. The normal destructive routine is occasionally broken by some phases in which we find ourselves using the character on foot. In these cases we enter some underground bases, leaving the trusty car outside, and we find ourselves walking through dark corridors with a close-up view of our alter-ego, who, armed with a rifle, will have to make his way up to the central hall of the basis. Quick reflexes are extremely required in these sections, since we have no energy bar and a single shot immediately concludes the mission, taking us outside and precluding us from achieving precious additional scores. At the end of each area, into which the 5 levels that make up the game are divided (not many to tell the truth), we will also be able to collide with the traditional bosses, who, in line with the shooter archetype, will have to be defeated by learning the their attack patterns, to avoid taking hits, and using the correct weapons at the right time. Graphics and sound Of course, we have to deal with the fact that we are dealing with a game developed specifically for Live Arcade, or one can say ~on savings~, but we must admit that technically Assault Heroes is undoubtedly one of the best productions seen so far among those in downloads. Looking at the richness of detail that characterizes the scenarios, the good light effects on the metal walls and the explosions, one cannot help but notice how behind this production there has been a genuine commitment, on the part of the Wanakos, in making a product which, although destined to enter a budget circuit, stands out as a small pearl. The graphics are simple, but very accurate and well defined, with scenarios full of details and with many elements that can be destroyed. Of course, the level design is nothing particularly inspired, with settings and situations that know a little already seen, but it is also true that it is a product that has no pretensions of being excessively original. The polygons perform well in representing a game with exquisitely two-dimensional dynamics in 3D, refining the glance through beautiful textures, bump mapping galore and good lighting effects. Really nice to see. The developers have even included very short cut-scenes in some phases of the game to emphasize certain moments, such as the arrival of the bosses, or the entry into new settings: nothing particularly shocking, but still nice to see. As for the sound sector, beyondof the rather anonymous effects of gunfire and explosions (although the howl of the kamikazes remains in the head), it can be said that the music is not overly boring, which is a good result compared to much of the Live Arcade competition, with choices of rhythms, sounds and melodies that refer somewhat to the tradition of the genre. Goals 360 Like any Live Arcade game, Assault Heroes allows you to collect a maximum of 200 points to add to your Gamertag, distributed over 12 objectives. These can be unlocked either with simple game progression (completing levels and killing bosses), or by performing particular actions, such as completing an area with a certain percentage of hits, destroying a given minimum amount of enemies, without even losing a life etc. In general, the first group of objectives can be easily reached by completing the levels, while the second requires a greater commitment in game performance. Comment Assault Heroes is worth all 800 Microsoft Points required to purchase it. Of course, the genre may not be appreciated by everyone, but it is objectively difficult to find a better title in the current Xbox Live offer. The main flaw is actually the canonicity that distinguishes it, which at the same time can be a point in favor or against. The dynamic is typical of the genre, in its most classic sense: shoot and run, with some opening towards a minimum of tactics given the possibility of changing the weapons to be used. The enemies never present excessive difficulties and the attack patterns are always rather predictable, which severely limits longevity (the more experienced can easily finish it in an afternoon), but the search for objectives to unlock and the online rankings are always an incentive to get back to the game. Assault Heroes is a must buy for shooter lovers, a purchase definitely recommended for those who don't disdain the genre, while for those who really can't stand the dynamics of shoot'em up there is always the possibility to download the demo and check whether the title is worth buying. Pros Remarkable technical achievement Immediate and fun Attractive price Cons Obviously shallow Short and not too difficult Nothing new One nice thing about Xbox Live Arcade is that it's a free zone in today's gaming landscape. With its intention of providing an alternative to the modern dynamics of the electronic entertainment business, where it is often the invested capital that makes the difference on the success of a game, Live Arcade is capable of presenting titles which, by virtue of a low cost in the development phase and consequently as a product to the public, are difficult to find in the normal retail circuit, but this does not necessarily represent a second choice. The Microsoft digital delivery service therefore becomes an almost timeless place, where some definitions of videogames anchored to the classic examples of it find good space, being able to be described as ~a sort of geographical map, to be explored through different tools, coexisting with the 'idea of hyperreal danger', for example, according to the definition given by Carzo and Centorrino, which is now difficult to fit into all of today's videogame production. Features that combine well with the simple structure of a shooter in the most classic arcade style like Assault Heroes, which due to market dynamics has become a rare commodity nowadays, even more if we consider the care with which it was packaged by Wanako Studios.", "date": "2007-02-07", "grade": null}
