{"name": "Heroes Chronicles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heroes-chronicles.html", "text": "Here is broadly how the plot of the 4 chapters unfolds Warlords of the Wastelands (purple color) After hundreds of years of oppression, Tarnum discovers the true history of his people, and at the head of an army of barbarians fights against tyrants. Marching across the arid homelands of the north to the swamps of the south, he follows in the footsteps (and surpasses them, I would say) of his ancestors until the defeat of the Mage emperors. Conquest of the Underworld (red color) When the soul of Queen Allison's father is kidnapped from Heaven, Tarnum will take care of guiding the maiden through the mazes of the abyss and cursed and endless lands of Underworld. Every step of this epic journey will be hindered by the flames of hell and by demons, as well as by the cold mists of the city-necropolis of the dead, who will try in every way to make Tarnum a perennial inhabitant of these places. Masters of the Elements (blue color) The Elemental Lords decide to end 10,000 years of peace and make the earth their battlefield, unless Tarnum overcomes his distrust of magic and learns the spells necessary to build the metropolis Conflux (where all elements of the plane of existence converge) and defeat them. To be able to raise such an army to face and defeat the lords of the elements, he will have to travel through the magical clouds, the shining oceans, the rocky mountains and the fiery deserts of the planes of existence. Clash of the Dragons (green color) Not even the forest elf armies of Rampart can survive the combined forces of the Black, Red, Rust, Blue and Crystal Dragons led by the Dragon-Queen Mutare. As the elves retreat into the thick forests and planes of magic the immortal hero, Tarnum, rides to battle this new foe, who seeks to unbalance the balance of power in the realm and who would bend the world to his will. A panoramic view Here's the first thing that comes to mind when evaluating what these 4 ~icons~ of the Might and Magic universe have to offer. In fact, those who have never played the original title will have an eye on everything they can find in terms of settings, creatures, cities, spells. If you want to go into more detail, I suggest you shoot the descriptive and complete ~pistol~ in the HOMM3 review of some time ago, again by the undersigned. For the laziest clickers (you know I love you too) I'll make a brief summary of the summary (a Knorr die from the Heroes universe). It is a turn-based fantasy-strategic game, in which you command different heroes, belonging to different typical classes (warriors, wizards, etc) and less typical ones (beastmasters, heretics). These heroes in your pay are the leaders of the armies of creatures (many and very varied) who together will form your armies, which you will use to fight enemy heroes and to lay siege to cities. In the meantime, a bland eye to the management part of the whole will take place with the collection and exchange of resources, the construction of buildings and the expansion of cities ... as well as healthy exploration and search for magical artifacts. Said like this, either it sounds pretty ordinary to you, or you'll think that all this stuff can hardly be synthesized in one game. In reality the very nature of the game and how it is conceived is its success: a series of ingenious ideas that find fuel and outlet in your imagination. Month-long events and endless campaigns depicted in synergy between text, images and imagination. This is a game you either hate or love to death... Let's go back to ~Chronicles~. Compared to its digital dad, it doesn't offer the possibility of playing single and random maps, and it doesn't even contain the free and complete map and campaign editor (features present in HOMM3) and it doesn't even stand out aesthetically. Same graphics and same interface. It's a shame? I'd say no... since a lot of weight has been given to the plot and events, with many situations described and dealt with in different ways. (Moreover, each of the individual chapters works independently and does not need to install the ~parent~). Riding without ever stopping... Surely the feeling of ~completeness~ is missing here, yet I can't imagine myself without these chapters on Tarnum's life. Call me stubborn, worshipper, etc. but just the fact that a game is able to offer so much official and good quality material almost 4 years after its release should make us think, even those who would stop only to say ~It's a dirty commercial ploy~. Maybe maybe there are other reasons, and they hide from the eye of the superficial. LThe spontaneity of this game, its genuine desire not to compete with the competition, the proposal of something that stimulates the imagination and arouses healthy fun are the winning keys and few titles can boast of possessing them all. My question is this: why feel omniscient and limit yourself to the trend of aesthetics at all costs and fast paced gameplay, when it's so pleasant to let yourself be hypnotized and seduced (ahem... clearly I don't sleep with boxes of Heroes Chronicles ^_^') sometimes also from the pleasure of pure entertainment for its own sake... the joy of realizing that one sits down after lunch and gets up when the first shadows of evening rise outside the window? (phrase classified in 1st place for the ~Cuore Puro e Animo Innocente 2001~ prize competition, here I laughed, n.d.Pucci). As you will have understood by yourself, a serious lesson in ~good-playing~, not free from the aforementioned defects, but capable of reinventing in you a videogame feeling that has been dormant for too long now. The four of the Ave Maria Those who don't die see each other again, and here the sentence falls right at the bean: we are about to talk about Heroes Chronicles, a series of official expansions of the now well-established blockbuster Heroes of Might and Magic III (at least in Anglo-Saxon land, here perhaps less), effectively bringing the ~extensions~ of the original game to 6. After Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death (the latter also playable separately from HOMM3, since it is an enriched version of the same). The main feature of HC is the common thread of the plot, which binds them together. In fact we can speak of 4 chapters of a single mega-expansion. Everything revolves around the figure of the mythical Tarnum, his vicissitudes and glorious battles, first as King of the barbarians, then as a creature brought back to life after death, up to his deeds as a mythical legend. A tormented character, who you will immediately see as the protagonist of exhausted situations...", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
