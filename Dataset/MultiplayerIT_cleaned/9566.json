The only freedom granted is to take a good look around and calculate the times of our passage, as well as try to shield ourselves by returning fire with fire. We reiterate the thought: it is clear that behind the aesthetic minimalism of Bit Trip there is a certain conceptual development, just as a decisive evolution of the series is evident within a reasoned path, which from a primordial soup made of a few pixels and a structure primitive is evolving towards increasingly complex mechanics, albeit invariably linked to a few short actions, eye-hand coordination and instantaneous reflex to escape the omnipresent and hyper-real danger, which is a fundamental part of the specific video game. We must not misrepresent Gaijin's message: Bit Trip Fate is not a simple homage to the old video game classics, nor just a return to arcade atmospheres and two-dimensional scrolling shooters but rather a new playful offer set within ~ancient~ forms aesthetics, another gameplay gem that delves into the roots of the same video game medium. The archetype of the shooter is therefore reworked with the introduction of a main element capable of profoundly transforming the entire experience, i.e. that particular line that cuts the screen in two and which represents the only possible trajectory for Commander Video, carried by the world of jumps and platforms of the excellent Bit Trip Runner to a context, if possible, even more alien in this Bit Trip Fate. The basic elements are the same that characterize the rest of the series as well as the recommendations to be made to the player: it is a question of carrying out elementary commands but with almost perfect timing, having a certain sense of rhythm and possibly a good dose of patience. Armed with these bases, getting kidnapped by the game in question is easy. The thin yellow line The concept on which the entire structure of the game is based is simple but ingenious, transforming the millenary structure of shooters with a single innovative element. Commander Video, the protagonist with a square silhouette shot with pixels, finds himself traveling within various levels with a vaguely spatial setting, scrolling from left to right, as per tradition, but his movement is inextricably linked to a luminous line, variously twisted, which cuts the screen in two. This results in an important constraint on the player's possibilities, who whereas in normal shooters can count on a wide freedom of movement in order to dodge the hail of enemy bullets in the best possible way, here he can only move back and forth (through the analog stick of the Nunchuck) on the line, leaving his chances of salvation to the right timing and precise calculation of the trajectory of enemies and bullets. Conversely, the ~shot~ which normally follows a straight line from the tip of the spaceship to the outer edge of the screen, here radiates freely in 360 degrees based on the position of the pointer, controlled by the Remote Control. Although at first glance the playful experience seems decidedly set on the nostalgic recollection of the old shoot'em'ups, we are forced to immediately abandon habits and preconceptions and adapt to a completely different game system, which only recalls the classic dynamics of the genre in form. Indeed, in the journey of Commander Video we find levels with progressive difficulty, various recurring types of enemies each equipped with particular characteristics in terms of movement, defense and firepower, clashes with terrible bosses and also the typical old school power-ups, between evolution continues of the weapons and support ~pod~ applications, all elements taken from tradition but reinterpreted in pure Bit Trip style. In the same vein, we must also mention the somewhat sustained difficulty of the whole game, especially during the boss fights where it rears up to rather frustrating levels, also considering the ease with which (another traditional element of Gaijin productions) we are sent back to the start of the level. It is essential, in order to appreciate the game, to have a good reserve of patience, also considering that the essentiality of the game allows practically no margin for error. Another irresistible trip The aesthetics of Bit Trip Fate, like that of its predecessors, is strongly stylized according to the precepts of the games in the Gaijin series. Minimalist and forcibly simple, the world designed for this aThe Commander Video adventure is another tribute to the classic video game iconography, i.e. the bitmap graphics of the 80s, based on a few squared pixels with a simple line. The use of polygons and three-dimensional grafts only reiterates the paradoxical perspective game that bends the new graphic technology to the ancient styles, here sought after and flaunted as a stylistic code instead of forcibly accepted as the necessary original technical compromise. The result, however, is always pleasant, also thanks to the excellent integration of the audio sector which, as another distinctive feature of the series, permeates the game action by associating intradiegetic sounds (shots, explosions) in the same musical texture of the soundtrack , transforming the player's action on the controller into a rhythm that is integral to the non-diegetic audio accompaniment, even if the fusion is not as pervasive here as in the Runner episode, which remains arguably the high point of the series. When dealing with a product with a strong stylistic connotation, above all based on simplicity and minimalism, it is important that everything is congruous and coherent with a certain overall vision, which is fully evident in this game, despite the There is an evident process of enrichment of the on-screen elements that has taken place over the course of the series, in particular with the great acceleration imparted in this sense by Bit Trip Runner.", "date": "2010-12-16", "grade": "7.8"}
