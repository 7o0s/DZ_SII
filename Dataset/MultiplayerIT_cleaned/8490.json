It would have been a sad and completely undeserved fate for this colorful graphic adventure, which was instead saved by Zodiac, the digital delivery platform dedicated to graphic adventures on which you can play it exclusively with Italian subtitles. Now that Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World is safely waiting to be downloaded, let's get to know the crew aboard the ship we're on at the start of the game. On the bridge, tight in a lilac overalls and with orange hair and beard is Brawe, space police officer and protagonist of this story. Kralek, the obnoxious navigator on board, does his job reluctantly just a few steps away from us. He's blond and doesn't seem to respect us like he should. Below deck awaits Rowboat, an automaton currently out of use. First we'll have to fix our trusty automaton, then set course for Jama Space and respond to a simple distress call. Obviously everything will go wrong and what was supposed to be a routine mission will prove to be the first piece of a galactic intrigue that will lead us to embark the sensual Agent Luna and use a cloned ex-pirate to foil a conspiracy and save the universe. Estimated time: eight hours well spent. Assuming you're one of those who would go back to when LucasArts adventures dominated the scene. Otherwise, the risk is of feeling like a child wondering how dad managed to have fun with toy trains. Well, we warned you, now get ready we are about to disembark. Space monkey Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World is such a heartfelt homage to the graphic adventures of the 90s that, if it had come out at that time, it would have been a masterpiece. The resemblance to The Secret of Monkey Island is strong: there are very well characterized characters, a stunned protagonist who thinks he is a daredevil hero, puzzles that are solved by messing with objects and a surreal sense of humor, as well as of course the pirates ( we have not seen any monkeys, if we take away that gibbon Brawe). As a time traveler however, Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World is very enjoyable. Brawe is a successful hero, so much so that he could very well return for a sequel or even as the protagonist of another type of game. His robot is the archetype of the faithful squire and there is also a damsel in a 70s onesie who represents the lost intelligence of the protagonist. If we add to this the ramshackle spaceship of Brawe, arch enemies dressed in black and a space setting that does not disdain the boilers, we will have a beautiful narrative world. Certainly the story that binds all these elements is not a prize, but lightly and without delay it unfolds until the end. Too bad for the twists and turns sabotaged by the clips that show who the traitors are and what they are talking about, but on the other hand Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World is not an adventure of suspense and mystery. Rather, Brawe's quackery and his improbable contraptions are the engine of the plot. For our part, we will obviously have to help the super policeman solve puzzles along the way, which often stand out for their imagination without weighing too much on the meninges. Thanks to the simplified interface - at least this is up to date - the commands are reduced to just three possibilities: observe, speak, use. Also the only element we have to focus on are the objects. In fact, no puzzle is linked to the dialogues: just try all the options and if something has to happen it happens, without many headaches. As in the best tradition of classic adventures, one can still get stuck, either because an object hidden in a screen escapes us or because some steps follow a logic that is not of this earth. Luckily there is a button that highlights all the sensitive points and gets us out of the way, but do you want to put the pleasure of racking your brain like in the good old days? If you are a purist who likes to hunt for pixels then it will take you from 5 to 8 hours to finish the game. Alternatively, if you like to win easy, you can choose the Casual mode before starting the adventure. This leads us to talk about the few flashes of modernity of Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World and the third and final paragraph of this guided tour in his universe. A touch of the 21st century We said. Before starting the adventure you can choose the level of difficulty. The version for newbies shortens monologues and triggers small onesautomatisms in solving puzzles. If you are old-fashioned adventurers this is obviously not your way. In addition to this initial crossroads, another small variation on the classic formula is that of being able to switch from Brawe to Luna or Denny, a former pirate resurrected from the ashes. Unfortunately this possibility is not exploited much and is limited to small moments of cooperation between the members of the group. Finally there are some nice unlockable achievements. Contrary to what happens in The Waking Dead they are not unlocked only because we proceed in the adventure, but also reserve some surprises for players who attempt more or less bizarre or fun actions. Overall, forgetting the anonymous soundtracks that you will never carry in your hearts, Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World has a more than satisfactory presentation. The characters are designed with a captivating style that personalizes them properly, the backdrops stand out in the choice of bright colors. Unfortunately not all of them are as detailed as those depicting the interior of the spaceship, but they are still pleasant. The adventure is light, transparent in its nostalgia operation and with a discreet personality. However, the feeling remains that he could have dared more instead of always keeping within the reassuring confines of the path already trodden.", "date": "2012-06-18", "grade": "7.8"}
