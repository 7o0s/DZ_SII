A series that has historically made the passion of the developers and the dedication of those who love it its strong point, tying Sports Interactive and its fans in a double thread. A link on which a mass of data also rests, generated precisely by the players, who for some time now have had the opportunity to participate in the definition of the immense game database as ~researchers~, happy to give their contribution to the object of their football veneration. After celebrating two decades of life last year, despite the approach of the next gen Football Manager keeps its loyalty to the PC platform intact, indeed relaunching it with the arrival for the first time of the Linux version of Football Manager 2014. an aspect not to be underestimated, considering those that already exist for Windows and Mac and the arrival of Cloud save support via Steam, with which to carry on your game on any computer you are on. Reasons for joy also for those who love to customize the game with logos and other elements, given the potential opened up by the support for Steam Workshop. But beyond the news related to the Valve platform, once again the development team has announced an impressive number of new game elements, quantified by Miles Jacobson and company in over 1,000 additions. In the era in which chalk and slate give way to iPads for screens on the bench, this time let's go and see what the guys from Sports Interactive have studied for us. Betas and bugs The version of Football Manager 2014 used for this review is the same beta that those who pre-ordered via Steam have gained access to. Those who know the series know that they have to deal with some bugs that inevitably afflict the game every year, and the Sports Interactive forums confirm that this time too there is no escaping. The developers, however, have announced that they have a large number of bugfixes planned ahead of the game's release, scheduled for October 31st. As for this review, it's good to consider that some problems historically come up after hours and hours of play, so we don't mind if we miss something. Full trainer In Football Manager 2014, the attention of the developers was particularly placed on the game interface, renewing what was definitely the element that most showed signs of age. The changes made by Sports Interactive affect more or less all the menus, starting with the news where you can now enjoy more information, while remaining on the same page, with the ability to select some key options without going to another screen. However, the changes concern all the areas used by the manager to manage his team, with particular attention to the reports generated by his collaborators. In this sense, the new screen dedicated to reports from scouts is appreciable, as are the additional options with which to manage your group of observers more efficiently than in the past. Similar treatment also for training, which can now take advantage of a main hub where they can keep an eye on the most significant parameters thanks to pie charts, together with the report of their staff on individual training performance and indications for preparing the next one match. Always available, of course, the area where you can individually define the program of your players, for a section dedicated to training now fully matured, after the renewal process started by the abandonment of the hated sliders, resisted until a few editions ago. The general optimization is tangible, with significant gains in time and clarity in managing the affairs of your team, even if for the more specific settings there is always digging in the various menus. Remaining on the subject of graphic improvements, it is necessary to underline the further effort to make the game's 3D engine finally acceptable especially in terms of animations. A little less in the unfolding of the game, where elements a little beyond realism remain, such as the high number of posts taken in various games and the ratio between shots and goals scored to be reviewed. Where is FM Classic? Since we prefer to focus on the traditional gameplay of Football Manager in this review, those who want to know more about FM Classic don't want to. For the novices of this series, however, we will have news coming in the next few days. Suffice it to say, for the moment, that Sports Interactive has also thought of the fans of the simpler and faster mode, raising the limit of playable countries, introducing new unlockables and a useful match planning tool. Teamwork Another aspect that Jacobson and his team have shown they want to improve in recent years is that linked to the interaction with the players and the rest of society, where once again we find some welcome additions. In particular, Football Manager 2014 gives a new weight to the management of the team, historically somewhat eclipsed by game mechanics. In addition to negotiating market budgets and other activities, the coach can now discuss with Moratti (or Thohir, at this point?) on duty on how to carry on the corporate project, also thanks to the new entry represented by job interviews , basic step to take before sitting on a new bench. As far as the rest of the team is concerned, a representative player, such as the captain, can now be asked to talk to any elements that are down in form, to try to get his partner to improve his performance before reaching the end of the game. 'extrema ratio of lecture by the manager. While noting further work done on press conferences, these remain one of the more monotonous elements in Football Manager 2014 as well, where the temptation to send one's deputy in front of journalists is getting stronger. Relations with your team are obviously not the only ones affected by the addition of new features, given that tactics can now enjoy greater clarity in defining the roles and tasks of the players, also thanks to the system that completely abandons the old sliders. Very welcome news also with regard to the shouts from the sidelines during the match, where together with the maintenance of the suggestions by the deputy (you can also follow his instructions with a click), we finally find the introduction of a specific indication to know which directives conflict with others, leading the interface to report the latter in red. For example, if you tell the team to prefer crosses, the attack via the central streets will change colour. Among the thousands of innovations announced by Sports Interactive, there is naturally also room for transfers, which can now enjoy a series of new clauses regarding both purchase operations and contracts with players. In fact, it becomes possible to buy a player to leave him on loan to his home team, or to guarantee the loyalty of one of his players by offering him an economic bonus even for matches where he sits on the bench. A somewhat particular choice, on the other hand, is that of extending the bargaining of business with other clubs with the real-time system already seen for discussing contracts with the prosecutors, however alongside the traditional shift system, which therefore does not disappear.
