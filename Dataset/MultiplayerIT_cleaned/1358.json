{"name": "Unreal Tournament 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-tournament-2004.html", "text": "The review of the game (by Luca Sinopoli) Unreal Tournament 2004 is undoubtedly the best representative of a new category of games which, thanks to the spread of online gaming, is gaining ground in recent years: that of electronic-sports (or e-sports if you prefer) . Defining the new Epic Games effort simply a shooter to be played in multiplayer would, in fact, be quite an understatement. UT 2004 is a sport, with numerous specialties and its own rules. To excel you need to know every secret, every nuance... you need to train! As in the best tradition of sports series, it seems the intention of the developers to release a new version of this discipline almost annually, which can only be practiced on virtual playing fields. The last Unreal Tournament was released more than a year ago (late 2002, to be precise) and after many months the new version is finally in our hands. It is important to be immediately clear: UT2004 does not represent a clean break with the past. Neither from a purely technical point of view, nor as regards the game concept. In the same way, it cannot be defined as a simple update, although at first superficial approach it may give such an impression. The improvements and additions offered by this new release are such and so many as to deserve full attention and to raise the game to a threshold that goes beyond the mere commercial gimmick aimed at exploiting an established and well-known brand. But let's go in order. What about my console? Since the release of Unreal Tournament 2003, the developers have made the decision not to limit themselves to making a simple console conversion of the series but to create a new one: Unreal Championship. In conjunction with the release of UT2004, Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict was also announced. UC2 will make the most of the features of the Xbox (a platform for which it is expected during the autumn of this year) to offer a single and multiplayer gaming experience worthy of the name. Among the most interesting news is the possibility of engaging in hand-to-hand combat using a third-person view. Go-go news The solid foundation behind UT2004 is the same that every UT2003 player is familiar with. The engine that moves everything is the same but filed, improved and perfected very well so as not to disfigure even after almost a year and a half after its first appearance. Browsing through the various features and possibilities offered by UT, one easily realizes how Epic Games has included in this new version everything that it did not have the opportunity to offer in the previous edition and, at the same time, has taken its spit from the feedback of many fans to give a gaming experience close to the wishes of the players. The first major innovation to mention is certainly the introduction of vehicles. Calm down, calm down! It's true, they were already present (more or less secretly) in UT2003 but only now are they really an integral part of the game. I won't hide from you that there was a lot of curiosity to see how Epic Games would have managed to make the contemporary presence of vehicles and fully armed individuals harmonious and, above all, balanced. Now that I had the chance to try the final version of the game directly, I can finally say it: they succeeded. It wasn't easy. But it went really well! Go-go news In UT2004 the player will have the possibility to become the protagonist of action scenes, worthy of the best sci-fi film, aboard futuristic tanks, jeeps, aerial vehicles and spaceships. The total number of vehicles currently available is nine, each of them has its own characteristics and different firepower. Most of the means allow more players to get on board by cheerfully dividing the tasks (someone drives and some fires...). The emplacements equipped with armed turrets must then be added to the vehicles. Scattered throughout the game maps represent strategic points of vital importance for the ultimate success. UT offers 10 different game modes. Those who have played the past edition ad nauseam will immediately feel comfortable with most of them. It should be specified, however, that the introduction of vehicles significantly changes the approach to some of them. The weapons have reached the remarkable number of 17 models, in the best tradition, each equipped with a double fire mode. Compared to the previous edition, four new entries have been introduced (the Mine Layer, the Avril: Anti Vehicle Rocket Launcher, the Grenade Launcher and the Sniper Rifle). All weapons have a graphic restyling that makes them even more aesthetically appealing. In UT2004 the number of characters from which to choose your alter ego increases exponentially and what is even more appreciable has increased the number of available maps. From this point of view, Epic Games has done an absolutely mammoth job. The final version of the game features something like one hundred maps (some indoors, some outdoors). A huge amount! In reality almost half are nothing but historical locations taken directly from the past edition. Effectively playing UT2004 being inside a map like DM-Asbestos or DM-Antalus creates a considerable sense of deja-vu and one naturally wonders if one is playing something new or has inadvertently started the wrong game. The truth is that the developers' decision to also include all the UT2003 maps should be taken as a pleasant gift that will surely delight the most nostalgic players or those who have not had the opportunity to buy the past edition of Unreal Tournament. Go-go news On the ~technological~ side, the innovations are just as interesting. Gamers will now have the ability to initiate voice chats during gameplay. The only requirement? A nice microphone (also available in a bundle with the Special Edition of UT2004 for 59.90). This new feature makes game modes that require coordination and organization within the same team even more exciting. Going from ~wasting time~ writing text messages (perhaps while an unfriendly Rocket Launcher is behind you) to having the possibility of not interrupting the action by communicating directly from the microphone is all to the advantage of playability and frenzy of action. Still on the subject of vocal communications, it is worth mentioning the interesting possibility of commanding the bots of your team directly via voice commands. In this case, a clear pronunciation without whispering is absolutely necessary... in short, those who don't feel ready can improvise a very personal diction course! We close this brief overview of the main news by mentioning a complete restyling of the game menus and the HUD, improved artificial intelligence of the bots, the possibility of voting for maps during multiplayer sessions and, last but not least, the introduction of Unreal TV. At a time when the importance of the media is ever growing, Unreal Tournament could not help but offer its own broadcast channel. How about having the opportunity to observe your opponents' games 24 hours a day as simple spectators? What are those perplexed and thoughtful faces? Watching and studying the way the best net-players play is the best way to grow one's skills as an electronic sportsman! What game are we playing? Unreal Tournament 2004 offers an incredible variety of game modes. Ten, to be precise, are the possibilities offered to the player. It starts from the cornerstones that every self-respecting multiplayer first person shooter must offer: the Deathmatch, in the most classic of all against all; the Team Deathmatch (Team Deathmatch), its team variant and the Capture the Flag (Capture the Flag) in which the two protagonist teams will have to take possession of each other's flag. Doing so and being able to bring the flag near your base will mean scoring a point. Of course, whoever scores the most wins. What game are we playing? Particularly interesting is the Assault mode (Assault) in which the players, always divided into two teams, will have to play both in defense and attack mode. In the latter case, as the map varies, the objectives to be completed in sequence will be different. On-screen indicators will show in real time the areas to go to to move forward in the mission and the sequence of objectives to complete. The team that performs best in attack and defense (in this case everything must be done to prevent the opponents from completing the objectives) will win the match. UT2004, for this type of game, offers 6 different maps. Let's move on to Bombing Run. Another team game. In this case the aim will be to get hold of the ball and go beyond the ring of the enemy team. Succeeding by throwing the ball with precision will collect 3 points, exaggerate by passing the enemy goal with the sphere under theaccio will lead to scoring 7. There are 12 maps dedicated to the Bombing Run. What game are we playing? Double Domination is once again a team mode. The game consists in taking possession of the domination points scattered around the map by touching them. Once this is done, it is essential to keep this situation unchanged for at least 10 seconds, defending what has been courageously conquered. If successful, you get a point. As always, the final count of the points will decide the winners and losers. 12 maps available for Double Domination. The motto of the Last Man Standing (All'Ultimo Uomo) is: ~there will be only one~. Players start with a limited number of lives. Each kill decreases their number. The main rule is very simple: the last one alive wins. What game are we playing? Invasion (Invasion) is an all against all where, however, the enemies to fraggare will not be their opponents but hordes of very bad monsters (those who have played Unreal will recognize some of them ...). A radar will give the player indications regarding the location of the fearsome creatures. Objective? Keep your skin dear! We come to the penultimate mode: Mutant (Mutant). The first frag of the match determines who will be the Mutant, player who will enjoy super speed, skill, resistance, damage capacity and so on. The other players will have the arduous task of taking out the ~gifted~. Whoever succeeds in the enterprise will become the new mutant. In respect of the biblical phrase ~the last will be the first~ there is glory even for the ~lowest~. The last one in the standings automatically becomes the Parasite....also endowed with super-capacity! The last three modes mentioned are all set in the same maps available for Deathmatch sessions. What game are we playing? We close this overview with one of the most interesting and successful game modes of UT2004: Onslaught (Energy). We return, again, to team play: red and blue. The scenarios are enriched by energy points that must be made your own. The team that succeeds first wins. Onslaught makes heavy use of the vehicles introduced in this Unreal Tournament. In order to excel in this type of game it will be absolutely necessary to become familiar with the control system of the various vehicles (very intuitive) and with their characteristics (speed, firepower, type of weapons available, etc.). Necessary, then, a highly coordinated teamwork ... on pain of premature defeat! There are nine maps developed for the Energy mode. As if all this were not enough, it is good to remember that each game mode can be customized and modified in some aspects through the activation of the Mutators. Snack buddies In any First Person Shooter weapons play a fundamental role. It is very important that the various units are as balanced as possible and able to have such different functions as to justify their existence. The situation for a software house becomes even more difficult if the developed game offers as many as 17 (each with double fire mode). Luckily for us at Epic Games they definitely know how to do it! I dance alone UT2004, as expected, can be easily enjoyed both online and offline. The single-player mode surprises with completeness. Epic Games has packed a gift package for respectable single game lovers. By selecting the ~One Player~ option from the main menu, it will be possible to create your own alter ego. You will be offered the possibility to select the most liked character, the name and, to top it all off, the name and crest of your team (in addition to the difficulty level). After having given vent to his imagination, the player will have to show that he can do it by successfully concluding a series of meetings in Deathmatch. If he succeeds in the enterprise, the doors will open to the creation of his own very personal team. It will be possible to select different teammates each with different characteristics (accuracy, aggression, agility and tactics). Inaugurated the team you enter the highlight of the game. Other close-knit teams are ready to challenge the newborn gang of fraggers. I dance alone It will be your job to show the ability of the leader and of the whole team by accepting the challenges that you will gradually have the opportunity to unlock. The single-player mode is enhanced by a team management system that will force you to take care of your fellow adventurers. It will be your concern to take care of them when they come out of the", "date": "2004-03-24", "grade": null}
