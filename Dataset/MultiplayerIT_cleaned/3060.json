{"name": "Song of Horror", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/song-of-horror-recensione.html", "text": "Halloween, a haunted house to be explored owned by the Usher family, pardon, Husher, in a game whose difficulty levels are based on the names of some of the best-known horror authors who ever lived, such as Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft. The first impression is already seen, indeed read, so much so that it almost seemed not worth writing the review of Song of Horror, the title of the independent studio Protocol Games which really did its best to let us know which sources it drew on with full hands. Despite everything we must confess that this follower of Alone in the Dark has something to say. His is not a revolutionary discourse, but he does not lack personality, at least in the realization, much more solid than one might expect. Horror adventure Song of Horror is an episodic adventure in which we play as different characters, all trying to find out what happened to the writer Sebastian P. Husher, his family and an employee of his publishing house, a certain Daniel, who first went to investigate. Just as Daniel we will learn that the Husher house has something wrong. We will guide him in the prologue and, without revealing his fate, the investigations will take off from him which, starting from the mansion (first episode) will lead us to visit a creepy antique shop (second episode). Unfortunately for the conclusion of the story we have to wait for the three missing episodes, so we will avoid giving conclusive judgments on the plot. As already mentioned, Song of Horror is an emulator of Alone in the Dark. So the view is in the third person and each environment is shown through shots chosen by the authors. In each episode you can control four different characters (the cast changes almost completely from episode to episode), one at a time, all in their own way interested in solving the mystery of the Hushers. Each of them has its own character, its past and unique abilities, related to stealth and strength, which, as we will see, are used to get by against the Presence, the supernatural entity that comes from who knows where and wants to eliminate us for no one knows why. . Note that in case of death the characters are lost forever and the investigation must be continued with one of the survivors. If all four die, instead, you have to start over from the beginning, simply trying to pay more attention (or selecting a lower difficulty level). Gameplay In terms of gameplay Song of Horror is a real classic adventure with puzzles and puzzles to solve. Most of the time is spent exploring, examining and collecting objects, and then combining them with others or using them on the interactive points of the scenario, all well highlighted. The puzzles are of different types and range from the search for a combination to open a safe, to that of some disturbing dolls belonging to one of Mr. Husher's children. To make exploration dangerous is the aforementioned Presence, which can't wait to kill us mercilessly, even if it doesn't initially seem too threatening. The Presence does not roam the rooms and never manifests itself as a single enemy. If you spot us, usually due to too much noise made or for purely dramatic reasons, we will have to try to save our skin in two possible ways: by winning a test of strength to prevent him from passing a door or by finding a hiding place, then avoiding getting caught from panic. In both cases we will have to overcome mini-games that will require either the frantic pressure of some keys, or the rhythmic one of the two backbones of the controller. Unfortunately these sequences are the least successful part of the game, in particular that of panic which, if you are unable to follow the right rhythm, can turn into a real agony. Game mechanics and graphics However, the biggest problem of Song of Horror is another: it struggles to be scary. The game is full of slamming doors, appliances that short out just as we pass them, eerie noises, and all the typical chair-jumping champs of the genre. The general atmosphere is excellent, built as it is on the skilful use of lighting sources and on the details with which the settings are stuffed, skilfully composed even if not exactly very original. For example, Casa Husher is a Victorian building full of disturbing junk which, added to everyday objects, makes the environment realistic and therefore more convincing in creating anxiety: we find ourselves in the lived home of someone to whom something recently happened and whose presence is suggested by many details (food left unfinished, table set and more). The same antique shop from the second episodeor it is built following the same criteria and is a credible place even if it recalls the paranormal right from the entrance. Unfortunately it is the Presence that is less threatening than it should be. It's actually very dangerous, because a few mistakes are enough to be killed, but the fact that it always comes suddenly and that in any case our survival is linked to mini-games, dampens the tension quite a bit. The possibility of eavesdropping on doors to hear if there is danger on the other side slightly increases the sense of incumbency of the enemy, but once you understand how it works, there is very little to fear. The adventure itself is still enjoyable because of the puzzles and the mystery itself, but it presents itself as one of those experiences that go neither up nor down, although undoubtedly well done. From a technical point of view, Song of Horror is a good independent production. As already reported, the settings are made in a truly convincing way, both from the point of view of the objects and from that of the lighting, although the spaces to visit are not very large. The 3D characters, on the other hand, aren't that great, both in terms of models and animations, but it's an insurmountable problem if you don't have a budget that can take advantage of the most modern technologies such as mocap or high definition scanning of people. Fortunately for most of the time the characters are framed in medium shot, with close-ups and very close-ups reserved only for some specific situations, so you can also turn a blind eye to some expressionless faces or to the female characters who shake as if they were on a runway even as they are investigating the disappearance of a family. In terms of duration, however, a lot depends on the speed of solving the puzzles. We finished the first episode in about three hours, while the second one took a little less time. Let's say that in general we doubt that a single episode could last more than four hours. Notes on the following paragraphs After months of waiting we were able to play the entire Protocol Games adventure. The following paragraph is an addition to the original review, which covers the last three episodes and corrects some of the impressions of the previous paragraphs. The comment has also been changed, as has the grade, from 7 to 8. Episodes 3, 4 and 5 The first two episodes of Song of Horror were just a taste of what awaits players in the final part of the game. To be honest, they were the weakest chapters of the entire adventure. On a narrative level, they acted as a premise and ended with a decisive revelation, which however left the player hanging on the most beautiful. In a certain sense, with the subsequent episodes, the ones we have had the opportunity to try these days, the Protocol Games title blossoms. It doesn't become a masterpiece, but it certainly becomes more interesting and intense, even as a horror experience, thanks to the construction of more fascinating and richer settings from a visual point of view and from that of the imagination of its own narrative universe. The structure of the game remains the same, with each episode being played by multiple characters (ten in total with new ones being introduced with each chapter). So what was said for the previous episodes also remains valid for the third, fourth and fifth. The only change in this regard is the work done to fix some small technical problems, with the game looking much cleaner than the original release. Compared to the first two episodes, even in the last three there is no shortage of clichs, but they are much better channeled within a broader narrative, which finally manages to fully show its Lovecraftian side, up to the courageous ending that rewards everyone the efforts made, rigorously and intelligently following the model of horror dictated by the master of Providence. Of course, some problems with the minigames remain, just as there are narrative inconsistencies due to the multiple protagonists, but the experience is better overall than the one already experienced, so much so that we partially reevaluate what we had already played. For the record, and without giving big advances, the third episode is set inside a large university, where the Presence is stronger than ever and where terrible things have happened involving Husher. The investigations then lead us to an ancient abbey in episode 4, where evil takes on new forms and becomes even more threatening and present. This episode has a particularity compared to the others: each character starts the adventure from a different point. This is an interesting structural variant, which reflects what the developers have tried to addvariety where possible, experimenting with new solutions. Finally there is episode five, the most disturbing and the most successful, set in an abandoned asylum, haunted by its ex-patients. It is here that we will have to face the brutal ending, one of the best seen in a horror video game in recent years. From a technical point of view, the last three episodes are in line with the previous ones. In general, the work done by Protocol Games is excellent, especially if we think that it is an independent team, and offers detailed and very intriguing locations. There is no shortage of highly visionary moments, often inspired by classics of the genre, as well as some really tense. The choice of a third-person gameplay similar to the classic Resident Evil has certainly helped in this sense, because small places and always framed from a certain distance allow imperfections to be better masked. Be that as it may, we are faced with an excellent work, which bodes well for the next title of this promising and talented studio.", "date": "2020-06-03", "grade": "8.0"}
