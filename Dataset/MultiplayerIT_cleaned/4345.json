{"name": "High On Life", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/high-on-life-recensione.html", "text": "We didn't realize it, but there must have been a moment, a precise instant in time, when video games simply stopped being entertainment products with an exquisitely punk soul, to embark on a maturation process that made the medium the art form we know today. There are fewer and fewer newspaper articles that oppose their excesses and, even if it made us a lot angry, we have to admit that we liked a little that the most cravated part of public opinion found them damned unbearable. Absurdly, even a game like the new Grand Theft Auto will try with all its might to be as least controversial as possible, a symptom of how that trend that has led society to seek political correctness at any cost has finally invaded our little little garden made of violence, chainsaws and very innocent beach volleyball. Seriously, the transformation of the industry was a fundamental step in the evolution experienced by the modern video game, but it is indisputably true that immoderate and over the top productions have gradually disappeared from physical stores and digital PC and console. That's why, after all, it was more than natural that a project like High On Life managed to catalyze the curiosity of such a vast audience, attracted by the hand that hides behind a seemingly ordinary shooter. The game is in fact the latest effort by Squanch Games, the development studio founded by that Justin Roiland known in the news above all for having co-created Rick & Morty, the animated series of Adult Swim appreciated as much for its sharp comedy as for the his ability to always stage crazy and surreal situations. Both products take place in a galaxy full of strangeness and alien body fluids, so there were all the conditions to be faced with a video game capable of capturing the best qualities of the series to translate them into a lively and unruly interactive experience, as well as delightfully vulgar. An experiment worthy of Rick Sanchez, but one that succeeded or failed spectacularly? We tell you about it in our review of High On Life. A quick adventure, in and out in 10 hours High On Life proves that the talking gun idea works like a charm On paper, there is no real point of contact between the plot of High On Life and that of Rick & Morty, but a few minutes spent in the game are enough to realize how the two works are very close, in terms of setting and atmosphere . High On Life puts us in the role of a young high school student, who assumes in some ways the same role that Morty has in the series, suddenly thrown into an eventful galactic adventure after the alien cartel G3, arrived on Earth, begins to use humans as drug by smoking people like joints. Boss after boss our goal will be to dismantle the criminal hierarchy of the cartel, a task made easier by a cast of supporting actors who in the case of High On Life also coincides with the arsenal available to the protagonist. As if the narrative concept weren't absurd enough in itself, the key peculiarity of the Squanch Games title is that the talking weapons in the protagonist's hand are none other than sentient aliens, the Gatlians, each endowed with its own comic personality and with a very wide mouth, for how they love to perform in hilarious altercations full of profanity and curses, in every moment of the adventure. To tell the truth, everyone speaks very much in High On Life and it is a pity that the game lacks an Italian localization: as in other Roiland works, the dialogues are in fact omnipresent and very fast, and considering that comedy is the beating heart of the game , it's unbearable to miss jokes while you're intent on tearing apart aliens. In High On Life, the quaint town of Blim City will serve as the hub for all of the adventure Fortunately, there is no risk of missing anything about the plot of High On Life, which remains light and carefree for all the 10 hours it took us to get to the end credits. Squanch Games had no desire to enter the Olympus of science fiction, which is why the studio concentrated on weaving the threads of a story that was above all amusing, rather than compelling. In Roiland's game you laugh from beginning to end and this is undoubtedly the most important quality of High On Life, even if the choice to start immediately with a bang ends up penalizing the advanced stages of the story. In the first 30 minutes, you'll find yourself shooting a baby, buying a gallon of alien sperm, and watching galactic porn alongside the creature che now lives on the sofa in your home, and since the game then struggles to propose a coherent crescendo of borderline situations that can repeat the dismay of these events, everything will seem less and less absurd as the hours go by. The result, quite predictable, is that the first act of High On Life will stick with you like the first time you discovered what you can really do with an Internet connection, while the rest will affect you significantly less. Chopping up aliens could have been more fun In High On Life the unique abilities of the various Gatlians are all well researched and very effective If over the hours you will inevitably get used to the Roilandian excesses of High On Life, its gameplay will only improve, passing from one revolution to another as the most prominent exponents of the G3 cartel are brought down. The DNA of the game, in fact, is grafted with Metroidvania elements hand-in-hand with so many movement potentials that the protagonist unlocks only after having access to new Gatlians. There are five in total, and each of them will not only offer substantial variations on the theme during combat, but will unlock unique features that will make accessible areas of the setting that previously seemed completely unreachable. Kenny, voiced by Roiland in the voice of Morty Smith, is the first of the Gatlians encountered during the story and does not offer particular skills except for a secondary fire mode useful for moving self-propelled platforms while Tello, for example, is a dagger with strong homicidal instincts that joins enough soon to the protagonist, immediately revolutionizing his perception of the spaces on the map. Tello, in fact, unlocks not only the possibility of knocking down enemies hand-to-hand, but also the vertical exploration of the setting, thanks to the grappling hook included in its handle. Sweezey shoots piercing needles and can slow down time by freezing air ducts and allowing the character to pass through them, while Gus is a shotgun very useful in close combat who can also place platforms on some segments of the setting. Finally, Creatura gives birth on the spot to little monsters that attack the enemy, and which also have the power to activate electrical devices in unreachable places in the level. After the third hour of High On Life, you will already be fed up with taking out aliens covered in yellow slime This strong variety, unfortunately, collides with the intrinsic repetitiveness of the fights that always stage the same enemies and the same situations from start to finish. The catalog of antagonists includes just four varieties of aliens that recur throughout the adventure, the AI certainly does not shine for strategic cunning, and the level design of the arenas is simply banal, to the point that towards the end of the story they have very little stimuli and are fought with a fair impatience, despite the expanded arsenal and the new gameplay possibilities. For heaven's sake, despite being rather ordinary, the gunplay also works very well at times thanks to a host of modifications and upgrades that distort the behavior of each weapon, but every quality is lost against the background of always identical shootings, which after a few hours games no longer offer any ludic incentive to the player. It is precisely in this field of production signed by Squanch Games that in our opinion the game shows all the limits of a true indie budget, and it is in some ways a good thing that in the allocation of resources the studio wanted to give priority to writing in any case, because without it High On Life would have sunk like a Spanish galleon. However, when on the test bench there is what on balance is always and in any case a shooter, such gaps have a considerable weight on the final judgment. However, a separate mention must be dedicated to the boss fights, which are different throughout the adventure and always original, full of platform phases and characterized by brilliant comedy. We don't want to reveal too much about it but the one with Tettolon, we anticipate it, will leave you truly amazed. Technical compartment In High On Life the boss fights are all original and very, very fun Even the technical sector of High On Life highlights the profoundly indie nature of the Squanch Games title. If after the day one patch the game is now stable around 60 frames per second (previously it was stuck at 30), what hasn't improved at all is its graphic impact, clearly below expectations as regards models and quality of the settings. The studio has chosen to give a cartoonish look to its speverything and this from a certain point of view has eliminated many annoyances in terms of graphic fidelity, but although the models of the Gatlians are excellent, if we look at the secondary characters and the NPCs that populate the levels it is easy to realize how hasty they were certain choices. We tried the game on Xbox Series X and the polygonal model of the protagonist's sister, one of the characters with the most jokes in the entire title, is very poorly cared for and has insufficient facial animations across the board, while in Blim City and in the other levels of the game NPCs and creatures lazily repeat themselves without offering any variety whatsoever, although the studio had all the space to give full scope to the imagination and create unique and original aliens.", "date": "2022-12-16", "grade": "7.5"}
