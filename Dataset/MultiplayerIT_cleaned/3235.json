{"name": "Overdrive City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overdrive-city-recensione.html", "text": "In the review of Overdrive City we discover how the free-to-play ~pluggable~ management system can also be adapted to the extent of car enthusiasts, with the creation of a small pocket world entirely dedicated to cars and racing. There is a phase more similar to standard racing games, even if it is a definition to be taken in a very broad sense in this case, but most of the gameplay is set on the dynamics of mobile management, which in turn is based on a hybridization of several characteristics. There is a bit of the city builder, a bit of the manager and in general a lot of work of collecting and managing resources, which largely depend on expectations and on a careful strategy in investing objects and the various international currencies. game. The general problem of this type of title is actually a bit like this: when it emerges that the complexity of a game lies more than anything else in the management of its complicated and artificial traps, it is clear that there is something quite wrong with its structure background, although it would be unfair to limit Overdrive City to this. Meanwhile, it is undoubtedly an unprecedented approach to management, which presents new atmospheres and dynamics in its particular point of view entirely focused on the world of engines and this is already no small thing. It must also be said that the ~guide~ sections manage to entertain at first, despite their ultra-simplified mechanics, and it is a pity that they will probably be canceled, in the long run, by the possibility of activating auto-play and skipping them clearly, which is inevitable in order not to run into an obsessive repetitiveness. In short, the strength of Overdrive City derives precisely from the fact that it absolutely concentrates on a particular element, or rather the passion for cars, thus managing to make a game that in fact does not present any significant innovations interesting for those who have the right inclination or a particularly fun structure. The fact that you always have to deal with so many different aspects is a good push to keep attention on the game, but above all the collecting spirit towards cars is the real engine that pushes you to go back to playing, at least for enthusiasts. The city of cars As a new promise of racing, we strangely also find ourselves in the unprecedented role of mayor of a city entirely dedicated to cars, with the dual intention of raising our notoriety and our level in the world of car racing but also growing the city, expanding it with new facilities and activities. On the one hand, therefore, we are dealing with a sort of motor-themed city builder: as per tradition, we can build roads, modify the configuration of the land and construct new buildings and structures capable of expanding the business of the city, which is all about car care and racing. On the other hand, at the most specific level, we can take part in various types of racing and take care of every single car in our ever-expanding garage, modifying different aspects starting from the bodywork to get to the various internal upgrades. The construction of the city follows a rather simple scheme: each building has a specific function, ranging from the constant supply of raw materials (spark plugs and keys used as in-game currency to access races and modifications or spare parts to upgrade cars) to car care, right up to the races. This part of the game is the one that most faithfully follows the classic mechanism of the mobile ~Tycoon~ management system, with the micro-transactions that obviously push to be present with ever greater insistence in the progression. The supply of raw materials and currencies capable of giving us access to the other parts of the game (racing and car upgrades) in fact follows the inevitable calculated breaks, which force us to wait between one game and another or to purchase micro-transactions to speed things up. Racing, on the other hand, is based on an extremely simple but somehow pleasant gameplay: with an isometric view that almost recalls classics of the genre such as Neo Drift Out, we find ourselves simply controlling the speed of the car by holding down the accelerator or braking, while driving, otherwise, is fully automatic. This is clearly an extreme simplification, but which is perfectly associated with mobile use even with one hand, without completely eliminating the request for a certain timing. All this becomes superfluous if autoplay is activated: the option is harmful from a gameplay point of view but can become necessary to avoid excessive repetitiveness. Finally, the last element to be taken into consideration in stBreaking composite of Overdrive City is car care, which is then the most characterizing part of the game, as far as the long term is concerned. It is the spirit of the collector that Overdrive City aims at the most, teasing it with excellent reproductions of real licensed cars, belonging to numerous international brands. The conquest of new models, the expansion of the garage, their modification and simply the fact of being able to carefully admire them in the dedicated section is in fact the main engine that drives constant progression in the game, even at the cost of running into the usual traps free-to-play, for those who are more overwhelmed by the passion for collecting.", "date": "2020-02-19", "grade": "7.0"}
