Capcom world can make is to play as if we were facing a three-on-three version of Street Fighter in front of our eyes. Huge mistake. The classic scheme so dear to Ryu or Ken that sees us perform a Hadouken followed by a Shoryuken to impact the opponent's flying kick, is here reduced to one of the tactical variants of the game, and not even the most effective. A tradition, or rather a consolidated practice over the years, swept away by gameplay in many ways similar to the many fighting games derived from manga, in which the battlefield is not only what you walk on, but the whole level, especially the height of the stage, making ~three-dimensional~ what is to all intents and purposes (aesthetics aside) a two-dimensional fighting game. Different from usual At first, distracted glance, Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 can give the impression of having sacrificed all the technicality, all the maniacal perfection instilled by Ono San in the gameplay of Street Fighter IV in favor of a staging that is as usable as possible to all, which can immediately gratify even the less savvy players from the very first games. And it certainly is so, if we stop at the first ~reading~ level of the game. Ryota Niitsuma, lately working on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, in this sense, has completely streamlined the control method, leaving aside the six-key scheme, in favor of three attack keys, either kicks or punches, divided between weak, medium and heavy. To these are added the one assigned to the aerial combo, the two upper backbones for the switch of the three wrestlers, and the lower ones respectively for the sprint and for the activation of the special move. As if that weren't enough then, when choosing the three wrestlers, we are also asked whether to choose to activate the simplified controls, which maps the special moves to a single key, a simplification that is all too much for dummies given that the special attacks to be sent by heart they are not many, moreover they are the same for almost all the wrestlers. In light of this, from the first game it's all a flow of special moves, pyrotechnic explosions, fast combo moves, large laser beams, rockets, bombs, energy waves and so on, a real feast for the eyes. However, if we venture beyond the surface, if we push ourselves to try to apply all the possibilities offered by the game, Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 will be able to be really deep, even if in a very different way from Street Fighter IV. The focus of the game is speed, everything revolves around making your fingers dance frantically on the pad, trying to chain together a very long series of shots, in which the single or group special move is just the tip of the iceberg. Stratified mechanics Most of the time the starting point of these combos is the quick one-two attack weak, medium, strong to follow up with all our ~arsenal~. The possibilities are really many. We can simply - and trivially - limit ourselves to using a special or hyper move (single or group), but this contrasts decidedly with the philosophy of the game. The first thing to keep in mind is the possibility of throwing opponents into the air, simply by pressing the X button on PlayStation 3 or A on Xbox 360. From here, with the right timing, it is easy to pull off an air combo: we can really indulge in simple attacks, specials, holds, or calling into question the other wrestlers on the team, generating truly remarkable chaos on the screen. All with the greatest possible freedom, deciding how to strike, when to strike and with whom to strike. The effect can be very stunning especially when you suffer a hail of blows of this kind, but in the same way, after a lot of perseverance, being the active protagonists of a kilometric sequence of attacks is a source of great satisfaction. There is not only this though. Others are the factors put in place by Capcom to ~complicate~ his fighting game. Each external wrestler, when called upon for a quick attack, has different types of ~assists~ at his disposal, which can be frontal, downwards or upwards. Knowing how to choose a team that covers all possible offensive angles therefore becomes fundamental, above all because in many cases it is possible to ~fly~, or at least make a double or triple jump capable of overcoming ~barriers~ of various kinds. The possibility of breaking an aerial combo is also thrown into the gameplay cauldron, if the person who suffers it understands (a bit like in penalty shootouts) the direction pressed on the cross at the time of the quick entry into the scene of the fighter in the benchesna. But it doesn't end here, Capcom has also included an advanced parry, capable of ~unbalancing~ whoever is carrying out an attack, different types of hyper if performed individually, and in order not to miss anything even the so-called X-Factor, not to be confused with the television talent show, which, in addition to giving us the possibility of delivering more powerful blows and reloading the health bar slowly over time, also allows us to cancel even the hyper opponents. Not bad right? But how do I do? All this range of possibilities, more played on the speed of execution, than with the actual technicality, however, must be thoroughly gutted to be assimilated, unfortunately for us Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 does little or nothing to help us in this sense. Although the game, as previously written, leaves us a lot of ~freedom of choice~, many combos, and especially the longer ones, need a lot of application to be learned. In this sense, and setting aside the Arcade and online modes for a moment, the game offers only two ~zones~ in which to train. The rich range of Training options needs no explanation while Missions should be the school where to study the combat system. In practice, however, the long combos to be carried out, starting from a simple Hadouken up to aerial ~mileage~ ones, must necessarily be memorized as only the name of the attacks appears on the screen, but not the keys to press, and all this involves putting paused and reading the moves menu. Really uncomfortable, but above all it effectively resets the only alternative mode to the meager single player. Furthermore, this is the only way to get to know the more particular mechanics of the game, consequently those who face the Niitsuma universe for the first time could skip them at the same time, given the extreme cumbersomeness of the explanation (then masked by methods of accessory game). This is the game's biggest problem, the absolute lack of offline alternatives other than one-time play. There is nothing, just the six encounters up to the final boss and that's it. Final boss who is then one of the least inspired and fun in recent years. Obviously a fighting game is not born to be enjoyed alone, but there is a strong lack of something more, such as a time attack, a scenario, a survivor and so on. There is a substantial amount of unlockable items in the form of artwork, movies, biographies, models gallery and dozens of titles to be placed on the gamer tag to show off in multiplayer, but this is not enough to give substance to a really poor single player of content. In heaven and on earth Where the game hits the mark is in the roster, well balanced, capable of making every hero perfectly attractive, not relegating him only to his role as a fighter versed only in attacks from a distance or in close quarters. Given the complexity of the gameplay, which in the hands of more experienced players could make Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 a sort of cross between a fighting game and a shooter, it was necessary to make the thirty-six characters capable of doing a little bit of everything, still it being understood that the ~specialization~ is always evident. From this point of view, being closed in a corner is certainly not a dead end, either because between teleports, triple jumps and the ability to fly there is always a way to escape, or because even those who seem to be relegated to the role of thugs they are capable of launching ranged attacks, even if with a melee weapon, like X-23 or Wolverine. Not to mention that what on the ground are horizontal attacks from a distance, in the air they turn into downward strikes. More generally there is no one who is not appreciated, every single physical and offense feature has been well thought out, but like, if not more than a Street Fighter IV, to fully exploit the potential requires a lot of dedication, and a lot speed with the pad. Pad that works discreetly with the title, given the stratification of the game mechanics, in short, usable even if played ~at a minimum~ but which requires an arcade stick to achieve perfection, facilitating access to all the keys rather than simplifying the correct execution of half moons and so on. This is the only imbalance in the title, which does not forgive simple newbies, but also good amateurs, if dealing with experts, perhaps equipped with joysticks. Xbox 360 goals Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 rewards the player with 47 achievements for a total of one thousand points. In addition to the ~internal~ objectives that make us earn the titles, the actual ones relate to both the offline and the online part of the game. They are earned by simple progression, by rising in rank, or by earning a certain score, mwhile the toughest ones see us committed to satisfying particular game conditions. A real show On the multiplayer side, the game offer set up by Capcom is certainly well structured. It is possible to access ranked and unranked matches, enter or create waiting rooms, setting everything according to your rank and region of origin. Also, just like in the arcade, we can make someone interrupt our game ~against the computer~, thus quickly moving on to a good match against a human opponent. But where the game really excels is in the visual sector. Rarely have we witnessed a staging so rich in detail, full of explosions of color and special effects, perfect animations and full of touches of class. Each frame is a real show for our eyes, each character is perfectly characterized in accordance with his ~biography~, just see how the Arthur of Ghost'n'Goblins does not retreat, preferring to run backwards knees high, or Haggar doing a jump kick just like in the days of Final Fight and so on. The only note that can be made to Capcom is to have included only ten, but very detailed and ~alive~ stages, in the same way we cannot fail to notice the drastic cut of the characters on the roster, from the over fifty of the second chapter to the almost forty (dlc included) of the title being tested. Cuts probably due to the implementation of the new design and its new game engine, which seems to ~Americanize~ the style of character design, abandoning the more typically Japanese one of the series.", "date": "2011-02-15", "grade": "8.4"}
