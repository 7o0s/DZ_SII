{"name": "Micro RPG", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/micro-rpg-recensione.html", "text": "Reduction to a minimum is a concept studied in depth in mobile games, often managing to bring out structures and gameplay capable of adapting perfectly to use on smartphones, between simplicity and study of the components for a good balance. The operation is not as simple as it might seem and achieving the right balance between the parts, building a game inside a nutshell, requires considerable art on the part of the developers, but when everything works, you can find yourself in front of a miniature jewel. In the Micro RPG review we see how the goal has been almost fully achieved by JoliYeti Games, with the only hesitation represented by a repetitiveness that inevitably occurs within a few hours, when, however, one might think that the title has now reached the its goal, as a free-to-play game for very short sessions. Calling it an RPG would clearly be excessive, but the title ~Micro RPG~ can make sense as it manages to capture the essence of some elements of the genre, compacting them into a single reiterated action that is based on the clash with enemies. The totally sacrificed part is obviously the narrative one: there is no construction of the quests, dialogues or exploration in this micro-game, which however condenses in a loop of a few seconds some typical characteristics of the RPG as regards the action on the field of battle, as well as constant character progression based on feats accomplished in combat. The result is a game with a very simple structure, but with a well thought-out mechanism, which also requires a minimum of skill and precision, capable of providing a much more structured pastime for ~on the fly~ sessions than many similar idle games and mobile games . All represented, however, with a pleasant and welcoming style that integrates perfectly with the very concept behind the game. Between fights, loot and evolution Micro RPG, images between combat gameplay and map The founding elements of the Micro RPG gameplay are the fights, the loot and the constant evolution of the character, which can actually be considered fundamental characteristics of the role-playing game, if the narrative parts and exploration are not taken into consideration. The mechanism is very simple and incredibly effective: the protagonist, whose various alternatives can be unlocked by progressing through the game, is placed in the center of the screen, surrounded by enemies at 360 degrees who try to approach and hit him. The action takes place in turns, and in the one reserved for the player a circular interface appears with an arrow that rotates clockwise: the aim is to touch the screen at the right time to hit the enemies highlighted at that moment by the arrow, while in the opponent's turn they try to move and hit the protagonist. It is possible to carry a maximum of three weapons for each fight, which can be selected with the buttons at the bottom of the screen and modify the range of action of the attack in terms of distance from the protagonist, rotation speed of the arrow and damage inflicted . This very simple system is a surprisingly effective translation of the standard characteristics of the different RPG weapons, proposing the classic distinction between short, medium and long range as well as the different power of these and the precision required, all elements conveyed simply by the variation in the rotation of the arrow and in the positioning of the circle drawn by it. Each type of enemy also has its own specific behavior and attacks, as well as weaknesses or strengths that can be unhinged with the use of the right weapon, which requires a minimum of tactical approach in selecting the attack to use and the target to choose. Micro RPG, more screenshots between fights and weapon management Each clash represents a box on the map to be completed and requires the achievement of a main and a secondary objective, both focused on a certain amount and type of enemies to be killed within the limit number of turns set. The path leads up to the final battle with the boss of the level, to then move on to a new area with a different setting and enemies. Added to this is a basic management of the character, which allows constant enhancement with the conquest of new weapons and the upgrade of these, through the spending of various in-game currencies. Being a free-to-play, it is clear where this is going, but to tell the truth Micro RPG does not seem to push too much on microtransactions. There is certainly a bit of grinding, once the first settling levels have passed, but if yesit takes in small doses and with the right pace it is possible not to run into obvious paywalls, although the incremental mechanism is strongly based on spending, at least of the currencies conquered simply by playing.", "date": "2022-02-03", "grade": "7.0"}
