Even if its connotations would have all the credentials to make it a favorite among game designers, it is a fact that apart from titles like L.A. Noire, the second Max Payne and a few others, there is a real hole compared to other types of story embraced by electronic entertainment. After the very little memorable Funk of Titans, the independent team A Crowd of Monsters has decided to try to conquer this no man's land with Blues and Bullets, a new adventure with an episode structure similar to that of the Telltale Games series of games. Five appointments therefore, starting from the first entitled ~The End of Peace~, which arrived on Steam some time ago: we have completed it for you, in order to understand if it may be worth investing in this product that has almost reached surprise on our screens. Thought you knew everything about Eliot Ness, the Untouchables and Al Capone? Blues and Bullets says no! Small talk and badge The protagonist of Blues and Bullets is Eliot Ness, an agent active during the American Prohibition that really existed. Fans of gangster stories the name will have already reminded the team of the Untouchables, of which Ness was the head, who became famous for having succeeded in bringing Al Capone to justice. Even if revisited in the way that we let you discover in case you decide to play Blues and Bullets, this piece of true history remains more or less similar in the adventure of A Crowd of Monsters, where the fate of subsequent Ness changes to the arrest of Capone. After failing to solve a case of missing children, the agent retires and ends up opening a diner in Santa Esperanza, a city with a fictitious name where the game is set. Without revealing too much about the plot, we limit ourselves to saying that the protagonist continues to maintain relations with the police, finding himself entangled in his past to face a new case linked to the disappearance of a young girl, with what appears to be a sect behind a series of new kidnappings. After a fairly successful prologue, in which we find ourselves in the role of the aforementioned little girl, the story encounters a somewhat slow initial phase, then leaving room towards the middle for a series of events that succeed in the overall objective of attracting attention of the player, also thanks to some quite unusual ideas for the genre. Just when you think you've seen it all between on-screen elements that ~asking~ to be clicked on and dialogues to carry out, Blues and Bullets' first surprise comes in a scene in which Ness finds himself up against a series of criminals. From an adventure, the game becomes a real third-person shooter, complete with cover, aiming and reloading: nothing particularly challenging in reality, but something rather interesting that bodes well for further study in the other four chapters which will have to arrive. Also in the second part of this first episode, the player finds himself having to reconstruct the events of a crime starting from the clues present at his scene, in a way that follows the way of reasoning of the detectives: the structure works quite well, especially in the moment in which Ness ~tells~ what happened by retracing the actions of the characters involved inside the house. Again, the only thing to complain about is the difficulty, given that the clues are all there as if to call us with a large red eye icon. Red, White and Black The noir setting of Blues and Bullets is defined from the very first moments thanks to the use of black and white to represent the scene. These two colors are flanked only by the red tones of some elements, the result of a not at all random choice aimed at enhancing the color of blood, passion and violence. The final effect renders quite well, giving an overall cut that is very reminiscent of Sin City from a stylistic point of view, recalling at times even the most distressing phases of the first season of True Detective. An excellent themed soundtrack contributes to all this, created ad hoc, together with appreciable dialogues, for which A Crowd of Monsters also resorted to the ~clever~ of calling Doug Cockle to voice the main character, whom fans of The Witcher will recognize as the voice of Geralt. As often happens, however, the independent nature of the game ends up coming out in some aspects, starting from the technical one: the camera angles sometimes prevent the player from seeing where he is going, whilethree the fluidity of the animation suffers from quite significant drops in frame rates in the wider shots. Even if, as we said, the plot and dialogues can be judged in a positive way, the script discovers the side of some naiveties that leave the player with a big question mark painted on his face, such as in a battle in which Ness faces an enemy while his ally is reading a book without intervening. In conclusion, we can say that we liked this first episode of Blues and Bullets: if you love the genre and its setting, we recommend it, provided you are willing to overlook some flaws and some aspects that we would like to see explored, as well as wanting to naturally accept the risk represented by four chapters still to come.", "date": "2015-08-27", "grade": null}
