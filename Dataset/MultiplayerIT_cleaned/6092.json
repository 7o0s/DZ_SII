It is almost difficult to digest all that goodness enclosed in a device of a handful of inches. Then, suddenly, a glimmer of lucidity brings to mind that almost eighteen years have passed since that November 1997 and that the world has moved on quite a bit. In a few years the mobile sector has come to offer us technically monstrous titles and here the magic is transformed into a sort of melancholy which does not however stifle the desire to throw oneself back on the streets of the splendid Midgard, a combination of extreme fantasy and cyberpunk tones. A grand departure for Final Fantasy VII capable of immediately assaulting the player's senses with elaborate three-dimensional animations, cutscenes of the highest level at the time and a powerful mix of computer graphics animations and three-dimensional characters. All mixed with a game system that is not particularly complex but capable of tickling the player's ego with simplicity: we are obviously talking about materials, those gems that, set in weapons, allow powerful combinations that become even more powerful if combined with potions and capable objects to bring characters back to life or to repeat an attack. The most powerful combinations increase the character's potential to such an extent that he is able to face the two Weapons, two beings so massive and powerful that they are unbeatable if faced without preparation. However, it is clear that these are absolutely unnecessary extras. Final Fantasy VII can entertain for a good hundred hours but can be tackled, enjoyed and completed comfortably without even remotely approaching the maximum potential of the character. With the sole aim of enjoying the experience, it takes about forty hours to face the inevitable destiny of Cloud which is to chase the nemesis Sephiroth, discover the mysteries of the Jenova specimen and suffer from road accidents that we will not mention for don't spoil the experience for newbies even if it is hard to believe that there is someone who does not know what we are talking about. Final Fantasy VII sold more than 100,000 copies in its first two weeks of availability on PlayStation Network, was re-released for the second on PC and continued to sell since its arrival on Steam in July 2013. After all, this is the heart of Final Fantasy VII, its ability to involve with simplicity. It is no wonder that it was the first JRPG to hit hard in the West, perfect international standard-bearer, clear in mechanics and powerful from a narrative point of view. Before the awaited remake it's time to refresh your memory with the mobile version of Final Fantasy VII A world of memories in the palm of your hand Already available for iOS and probably coming soon for Android, the mobile version of Final Fantasy VII which for the Japanese has already been playable since 2014 through the Dive In streaming service anticipates the long-awaited and finally announced remake that fans of the most iconic title in the series they have been clamoring for several years. The edition in question is not the PlayStation one but the 1998 PC one which enjoys some features allowed by graphics acceleration. This translates into a more pleasant world map and softer models but also more detached from the two-dimensional backdrops which today, especially on tablets, are quite aged. The effect of interlaced scanning, typical of CRT monitors and televisions, would have helped but as we will see this porting, whose greatest advantage is the very fast loading, is not the most accurate; moreover, consumption is quite high for a game that is approaching twenty years of age but it is also true that Final Fantasy VII never gives a break to the battery between shots, computer graphics scenes and continuous passages between the battlefield and the exploratory phase. Final Fantasy VII marked the advent of spectacular JRPGs and for this very reason it left its mark: the first 3D chapter of the series, it surpassed the inevitable technological limits of its era by placing the characters on two-dimensional graphic backgrounds and adding to the recipe graphic adventure such as computer graphics animations integrated into the game fabric. The models have never been at their best but have survived, also thanks to the deformed characterization, the once powerful cutscenes that can still be watched but which have inevitably aged. On the other hand, the Limit Breaks, super moves passively charged by taking blows from enemies, and the animations are still spectacular, net of the poverty of polygonsthree-dimensional that become stunning in the case of spells like Knights of the Round and Neo Bahamut. In this case the 3D, despite being clearly vintage, flexes its muscles while the shots rotate and alternate rapidly to magnify laser beams, cannon shots and explosions in a riot of fires and rock fragments. Some of these animations are really massive, spectacular sequences but at the same time so long that they are not digestible if repeated too many times just like it happened in some situations of Final Fantasy VII. Those who have faced the Weapons know what we are talking about and will feel a cold shiver to discover that even in this mobile port of the Square title there is no way to skip the spell animations. Fortunately, the configuration menu is pretty rich and also includes a slider that allows you to slow down or significantly increase the speed of the game, including animations. The save system remains faithful to the original: in the middle of the missions it is necessary to find the save points while in the main map it is possible to save at will. The real additions of this porting are few and a couple risk heavily altering the experience: the first is undoubtedly positive and concerns the implementation of iCloud support, which in addition to matching the protagonist's name allows you to secure your savegames and use them on both iPad and iPhone. The second novelty, on the other hand, is controversial, even if in many ways convenient, and translates into a button that allows you to completely disable random encounters. The latest novelty could instead be dangerous: in the configuration menu we are in fact given the possibility of maximizing the character to enjoy the narrative experience without too many problems, but giving in to temptation the gameplay is lost with the risk that playing becomes fatally boring. Fantastic but not too much It doesn't matter how vast Final Fantasy VII actually is: the greatest value of JRPG Square is that of transmitting breadth, variety, dramatic lightness, the inevitable environmentalist message and lots of beautiful vintage music. Thanks to this, Final Fantasy VII is still able to keep us glued to the screen, but this magic cracks when we find ourselves battling with touch controls which, as has already happened with countless portings, are totally inadequate for the Square title. The commands, part of which are superimposed on the game screen with a bad visual effect, are woody and not very precise, which gets worse when playing on smartphones and the small size of the image even makes it difficult to understand the direction to take. Fortunately there is a key that activates the indications on the screen, as in the original, and having to do with an RPG we have all the time in the world to make our way. Furthermore, although in combat the control system is still difficult, it is not particularly difficult to move around the menus to choose attacks, spells and objects to use. But it is still not possible to completely overlook the matter even taking into consideration the intrinsic difficulties of a mobile port of a title which will soon be 20 years old and whose original assets have been partly lost. We are not complaining about the game screen in four thirds, we are not even claiming the adaptation of the texts in Italian and we have never hoped for a remake or a distorted version since this one will arrive next year. But we would have expected to see a more appropriate price given the numerous compromises and we would have wished for a greater commitment from developers who, we can bet, set to work on this conversion fully aware that the mobile version of Final Fantasy VII is destined to sell a lot. Instead, in this port, screen rotation has not even been implemented and so we find ourselves in the hands of a title with an interface that is difficult to use and ugly to look at that does not offer great news compared to the original. However, we have to say, the keys all visible on the screen can get used to, we can choose between dynamic or fixed directional cross and the title is compatible with MFi controllers. In short, adapting is possible and doing so can make sense both for nostalgics who own at least one iPhone 4S and for those who have not had the opportunity to play one of the universal symbols of the JRPG genre. A title made so not only by the technical sector, the only element compromised by the years, but by the iconic music, by the bunch of bananas placed on Cloud's head, by the thousand improbable creatures and by a narrative sector full of memorable characters and events of all kinds . Between impressionable gallant dates dto the choices in the dialogues and mini-games such as the chocobo competition there is so much iron on the fire to be captured for hours and hours lulled by an amazing soundtrack composed by a fully fit Uematsu. For the occasion, despite having the optical support available, the composer preferred the midi samples, probably also for reasons of space, but this choice did not prevent the Final Fantasy VII combat music from being one of the most recognizable and well-known songs among gamers of every era. The only exception, not in a negative way, is the track of the fight with Sephiroth, One Winged Angel, created using sampled voices that quote excerpts from the Carmina Burana and make the final fight memorable to say the least. In essence, Final Fantasy in the mobile version is still playable and is still a memorable experience even if the work of Square Enix on this conversion discovers the side of various criticisms and the 16 euros of the price make this unpleasant observation even heavier.", "date": "2015-08-27", "grade": "7.5"}
