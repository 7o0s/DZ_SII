{"name": "Need for Speed Heat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-heat-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Need for Speed Heat, the new episode of the series produced by Electronic Arts, takes us to visit Palm City, a city inspired by Miami that lives a double life: during the day its streets host the races of an important official sporting event , at night they turn into the territory of crews who challenge each other in dangerous clandestine races. A phenomenon that the local police are determined to counter in any way, even resorting to strong methods; and this is exactly how the game's campaign opens, when the band of the young but courageous pilot Ana Rivera is dismantled by the all too vigorous intervention of the agents in the service of the ruthless commander Frank Mercer.After the tutorial, the game asks us to choose a avatar among twelve different characters, whose appearance can be changed thanks to a whole series of sponsored hairstyles, accessories and clothes, and to select a car from among the first available cars. Our alter ego is a boy who has just arrived in the city but eager to make a name for himself, who comes into contact with Ana and her brother Lucas: the latter offers him a roof to sleep under, as well as a well-stocked garage for setting up the his car. Our first entrance to the shelter corresponds to the introduction of the main mechanics of Need for Speed Heat, that is the possibility of going out on the street during the day or at night. What changes? Practically everything: during the day we will be able to participate in official events and earn money useful for the purchase of new cars and spare parts, while at night we will be able to run defying the law to earn reputation and thus be able to access new main missions, as well as unlocking further cars and upgrades. However, there is a small detail: when the sun goes down on Palm City, the police literally hunt down anyone who owns a vehicle prepared for the races, creating tenacious and spectacular chases from which it will not be easy to escape, especially at the start of the campaign. Getting arrested and/or destroying the car due to too many impacts will reset the potential progress made up to that point in the night session, each time confronting us with a difficult decision: to look for another clandestine race to maximize the results or reach the nearest shelter and collect what has been collected up to that moment? Cars, processing and gameplay The idea of double progression undoubtedly represents the most interesting aspect of Need for Speed Heat: it is a mechanism that enlivens the experience, encouraging us to divide our efforts between the two different moments of the day to pursue growth at all round of our character and his fleet of cars. Available at a dealer on the map, the cars are divided into no less than one hundred and twenty-seven models belonging to real brands (in order: Acura, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Audi, BMW, Buick, Chevrolet, Dodge, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Infiniti , Jaguar, Koenigsegg, Lamborghini, Land Rover, Lotus, Mazda, McLaren, Mercedes, Mercury, Mini, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Pagani, Playmouth, Polestar, Pontiac, Porsche, SRT, Subaru, Volkswagen and Volvo) and show some degree of variety in terms of year of production and category, passing from muscle cars to custom-built cars, from compacts to SUVs, and in any case offering a good starting point in terms of tuning. This aspect of the game is particularly emphasized, as per tradition for the series, and allows you to purchase and assemble components that act on four categories (engine, chassis, transmission and auxiliary), each divided into different items. The idea is obviously to avoid any limitation and allow players to use their favorite car in any type of event, whether it's asphalt or off-road races, provided they have the necessary components. An intention on paper that is interesting, but which in practice ends up diminishing the breadth of the aforementioned car fleet, given that it is precisely possible to try your hand at any type of event using always the same vehicle, suitably modified. Of course, it's also true that preparing different cars for different needs and selecting them on the fly before a race turns out to be a much more immediate operation than changing the setup from time to time. Which leads us to talk about the driving model, which unfortunately or fortunately does not go beyond the arcade vocation that has always characterized the franchise. In short, do not expect particular differences between one machine and another, nor a realistic representation of weight and road holding, but rather a high degree of environmental destructibility, impacts often minimized with respect toto their potential gravity (a full-on front-end? More than anything else it will slow you down and the aesthetic damage to the car will be limited) and a great emphasis on controlled drifts, on balance the only way to deal effectively with tight corners. Need for Speed Heat handles them in an interesting way, simply asking us to let go of the accelerator, turn the wheel and sink the pedal again so that the rear of the car starts but remains controllable through quick touches of counter-steering. Of course, we can also choose to open Live Tuning and activate the electronic traction control: this will reduce wheel slip when restarting, but it will prevent us from performing powerslides in that way, forcing us to use the handbrake: a technique that you will rarely choose to privilege. Online or offline? Need for Speed Heat can be played solo or online, accessing servers hosting sixteen players. The difference in the latter case lies in the possibility of choosing whether to compete alone or challenge all the other users in each event: a simple but interesting mechanism, which during our tests proved to be effective in terms of matchmaking and netcode solidity. Since this is also the well-tested AllDrive technology from Electronic Arts, we imagine there will be no problems at the official launch. Playstation 4 trophies The 43 Need for Speed Heat Trophies are obtained by completing all the chapters of the campaign, the extra narrative events and dedicating yourself to the many challenges present on the Palm City map: billboards to destroy, ramps for long jumps, speed cameras in front of which darting at full speed. There is clearly no shortage of achievements related to upgrading and customizations. History, structure and technical realization The Need for Speed Heat campaign, as mentioned, will see us join a crew determined to make a name for itself, both in official events and in clandestine ones. This last activity will soon put us in contact with the dark side of the Palm City police force, which apparently has something to hide. We don't want to reveal anything about the plot: it seemed to us to be written in a discreet way (with well-interpreted dialogues in the Italian dubbing) but it doesn't go beyond very specific narrative canons, which refer to film productions that are not exactly profound, along the lines of Fast & Furious and of the same film adaptation of Need for Speed. What weighs on the experience is instead the structure, which maintains the now traditional open world setting by giving us a fairly large map, divided into districts characterized by different landscapes, each with a shelter to reach and unlock. It's a pity that we always find ourselves in Lucas' workshop: an enhancement of this aspect would have helped to entice us to explore the scenario for reasons other than the simple desire to do everything. However, the problem is not limited to these details, on the contrary it is systematic and also influences the progression, clipping the wings of a formula which, with the necessary precautions, could have fully expressed its potential. In fact, it happens that the events remain available on the map even immediately after we have completed them, giving way to a sensational grinding (although the jackpots go down from attempt to attempt) which allows you to quickly collect the money needed to buy a new car or some new upgrades. The trick is not applicable to reputation, given that at night it is easy to raise the alarm level and find several police cars on you, but in the end it is enough to go back to the shelter and go out into the street again to obtain the same results, perhaps favoring the competitions with the best ratio between rewards and effort. It's a shame, because a little more attention and courage would really have been enough to avoid these blunders and at the same time enhance the setting in its entirety, pushing us to get out of the usual areas and try our hand at special events based on drifts, one-on-one challenges -one or races within closed circuits. As regards the technical realization, Need for Speed Heat offers substantially better graphics than that of Payback, which had sensational and obvious pop-up problems. Ghost Games has taken great care of the effects, see the implementation of the screen space reflection in every puddle and the dynamic, variable and convincing weather, which creates truly spectacular sequences in combination with a good use of HDR (especially at sunset) and the inevitable motion blur. Unfortunately, in some situations there are still some uncertaintiesIt's up to the 30 frames per second target, and it's strange that it happens in relatively quiet moments rather than in the middle of a furious wet night race, considering everything the graphics engine has to deal with at that juncture. The polygonal models of the characters are discreet but mostly dated, especially our avatar, while there is obviously nothing to say about the cars, they are really well done. Moreover, it is possible to customize its appearance in the shelter, modifying not only the paint (with the option of applying vinyl or downloading ready-made models from the community), the rims, the spoiler and the appendices, but even the roar of the engine: a touch of class that enthusiasts will not fail to appreciate. Finally, the soundtrack is a mix of trap and hip hop not exactly in line with our tastes, but it is clearly a subjective matter.", "date": "2019-11-08", "grade": "7.5"}
