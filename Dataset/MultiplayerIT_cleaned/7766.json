A premise that is certainly intriguing in the context of a mobile play offer currently very unbalanced on puzzle games and endless runners, but will it be enough to make the title worth downloading? Without words In a way as mysterious as it is fascinating, Hero of Many does not present any line of text either to describe the story that forms the background to the action, much less to illustrate the commands and objectives of the game to the user. A brief introduction only lets you foresee what is the general setting of the adventure, set in a crepuscular underwater world: the protagonist is an unspecified luminous sphere, which will have to gather around itself as many marine creatures as possible (entirely similar to tadpoles) and get to the end of the 26 levels avoiding obstacles, solving simple environmental puzzles and above all facing an aquatic species similar to your own but decidedly hostile. As mentioned at the beginning, Hero of Many says absolutely nothing about himself, even delegating the task of explaining the control system to three number icons, which are also rather cryptic. Fortunately, the Trickster Arts title is really simple: it is therefore sufficient to hold your finger down on any part of the screen to make the sphere move in that direction (keeping in mind that the further you move away from the center of the display, the more the movement will be fast), while a quick swipe allows you to launch your handful of creatures forward. From here on, however, every element that makes up the playful structure of the title must be literally discovered by the user: therefore, a pinch of intuition is needed to understand, for example, that the crystals that light up along the way act as checkpoints or that the lights that light up on the walls indicate that you have already traveled that road. However, other things must be experienced on your own skin, since it is difficult to establish in advance whether such an element of the scenario is a simple graphic tinsel or if it can be a danger to the safety of your group. When it doesn't enjoy confusing the user's ideas, Hero of Many still proves to be a very pleasant experience, even if not too varied: once the novelty effect is exhausted, much of the game focuses on those three-four juxtaposed elements yes with taste and style throughout the 26 levels, but which still do not offer great diversification. Time is therefore spent exploring stages full of forks, looking for luminous balls that increase one's aggregating power and scattered creatures to add to the group: as the size of the latter increases, the possibilities of moving heavy objects (i.e. the rocks that constitute the leitmotif of the environmental puzzles) and of having the better of the enemies increase, in an extremely basic combat logic that rewards the deployment composed of several units. Despite the subtlety of a gameplay that in some ways can even be boring, Hero of Many still manages to excite, thanks above all to a very successful atmosphere resulting from an excellent job in terms of audiovisual design. Both the settings are therefore fascinating, with black and white silhouettes that stand out against backdrops with colors that change as the adventure progresses, and the creation of the creatures on the screen, capable of transmitting emotions despite their primitive nature. Finally, the contribution of the sound is excellent, which is why Hero of Many deserves to be played with earphones: in addition to a dynamic musical accompaniment that effectively underlines what is happening on the screen, the title can count on truly convincing effects, capable of giving idea of being in the depths of the sea. Hero of Many is more beautiful to look at than to play, but it also has an undeniable charm", "date": "2013-06-28", "grade": "7.7"}
