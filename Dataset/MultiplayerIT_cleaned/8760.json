It is not so? It doesn't matter, because within the six scenarios that make up the Greedy Penguins single player campaign, divided into a total of over seventy levels, our goal will be precisely this: to make sure that the penguins on the screen eat their fresh little fish and that the ~mascot~ of the moment (a walrus, a pink elephant, a crocodile and so on) gets the ice creams that spring up every time we complete this operation. An operation that will turn out to be less trivial than one might imagine, considering that the fish are from time to time closed in a net and that the location will not contribute to making their journey to the penguins' gargarozzo easier, instead placing us in front of a series of obstacles that we can only overcome with the right amount of reasoning, promptness and skill. That's not all, because there are also some strict rules to respect, under penalty of game over: penguins of a certain color can only eat fish of the same shade, otherwise they will start vomiting and we will have to start the stage all over again. Completing each challenge quickly and accurately entitles you to a reward ranging from one to three fish, the total of which affects the possibility of accessing the new areas (even if, by paying an additional 79 cents, we can unlock all the location). Today we eat fish The control system adopted by Shamrock Games for Greedy Penguins is completely based on the touch screen and is really simple. In fact, it is enough to touch the interactable elements on the screen to obtain a reaction, to ~trigger~ a movement that will lead, with the necessary precautions, each fish towards the respective penguin. The physical implications of the gameplay on the one hand make the experience interesting and have a certain depth, on the other hand they amplify the feeling that sometimes everything goes well simply for a matter of luck. Let's explain ourselves better: as long as it comes to freeing a little fish from its net, rolling it down a slope and therefore leading it to the penguin who will swallow it, that's one thing; when solving the level involves painstakingly calculating the time and inertia for one fish to bounce off the other, both to fall into a slot in the right order and then bounce with enough force to get close to the penguins and be eaten, well , it is clear that something in terms of level design has been left to chance. It goes without saying that as a direct consequence we have long sessions dedicated to trial & error, until luck gives us a hand. Sometimes, however, not even that is enough, because the game asks us to be extremely precise but then it is not in turn, at least as regards the responsiveness of the controls. Very often we touch a ~switch~ without it activating correctly, and the attempt inevitably vanishes, forcing us to restart the stage. The technical sector doesn't do much to resolve the situation: the design in general is nice, some verses make you smile but the animations are made up of very few frames and are not really a pretty sight.
