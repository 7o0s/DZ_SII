Like few others, the saga, willy-nilly, opens the doors of subjectivism. Let's think of those who criticized Demon's Souls many years ago - or even Dark Souls - and who perhaps today, after having scratched the surface, have remained completely subjugated and dependent on the From Software universe. The niche and word of mouth got the upper hand, the passion in narrating a setting gave way to an unstoppable behemoth. And then, title after title, the DLC made a dent in that complete, fascinating world, one of the last remaining purist dimensions. We didn't like the first downloadable content framed by the Shibuya and Tanimura trilogy, not because of bug or frame problems, but precisely because it was anonymous, forgettable, superfluous. Now, we know you've already read below. Our goal is to clarify the reason for that judgment and to push anyone who is scrolling through these lines to ask themselves two questions: what, exactly, do you want from a Soul? What, however, do you expect? In our case, over the years, we have come to a conclusion: we want something fascinating, unique, that continues to excite us, something that cannot be replicated by other teams, capable of exalting us and making us feel part of a profound world. Instead, we expect that, out of respect for the saga itself, the quality is always at the highest levels and anyone who interferes in the Souls ecosystem does not ruin the infrastructure built by the efforts made in the previous episodes. And that green symbol, a little further down, actually masks unacceptable flaws for a fan, but fortunately - this time - weighed by an overall construction of the content that is light years more stimulating and interesting than Crown of the Sunken King. Finally, the hope of seeing a second content that could at least boast this name has found its meaning of existence. But from there to perfection the road is still long. While not without flaws, Crown of the Old Iron King fulfills many fan wishes This tower is tall Artistically, the covered section of the Brume Tower complex is inspired and compelling. Both the external visuals and the interiors are designed with the main themes rendered quite well throughout the content: the concept of flames and ashes blend with criterion and naturalness from start to finish, helping to embellish that sense of vagueness in a lore that , moving forward with the DLC, seems to ask more questions than answers. Will the last of the promised contents be able to clarify the sown? Crown of the Old Iron King remains on a medium difficulty level: there are no difficulty peaks ready to make blood spit but overall the whole section manages to give good satisfaction, especially in the face of the areas covered by the Cinerei Idols. Here we come to the first, good idea of the team: nothing incredible, given that the area influences had already been widely used in the base adventure (the urns, for example) but certainly the sensation of breathing down the neck to quickly find the artifacts it is palpable, appreciable. A staple of the crown trilogy seems to be verticality: like Shulva and the sanctuary, Brume Tower is full of sections in which to explore every nook and cranny using self-propelled platforms, ladders, traps and unsafe passages. All level design already seen, but the aesthetic characterization of some parts is truly over the top, although don't be surprised if the conclusion of your search will be a dead end or a corridor that ends with a loop. Enemies and patterns have ups and downs: the initial range of creatures rather calibrated downwards is contrasted by an advancement that offers singular attacks and strategies, even for the more experienced. This expansion inherits its biggest problem from Crown of the Sunken King though: the bosses. Seen, dodged Three humanoid bosses, two of which with far from innovative attacks and one completely identical to a boss already faced. It almost seems that From has become lazy in coloring its enemy pool with novelties. It is not possible to propose a trilogy of DLCs that has the triptych of bosses as a common thread and then not make the slightest effort to offer something more in terms of uniqueness and particularity in the clashes. We are not talking about easy fights or unwatchable bosses, but you will certainly hardly remember them for their characterization. Only the second optional boss has some distinctive features, relatively in particular to the rather evocative combat area, which can at least aspire to embed itself in your memory, but the remaining two clashes flow away with too much artistic superficiality. The level design, the network of passages and rooms, the architectural motifs usesyou, the platform phases, the Ashen Idols: all factors that weigh positively on the judgment of this DLC and bring it higher than the plate where we place two of the three bosses, really not very galvanizing. Only for these reasons do we feel like suggesting spending to enthusiasts, but the content excellence we expected from From Software had to be something else, much more committed and incisive and above all much easier to recommend its purchase. Crown of the Old Iron King is superior to the previous DLC for the density of the factors described above and for a completion time which, thanks to the ramification of the plans and a discreet endgame content, guarantees a greater number of hours to spend inside. A studied and satisfying backtracking together with intriguing narrative slices refer the puzzle of the crown trilogy to the latest content arriving in less than a month. But from the last piece of the mosaic we expect at least fireworks and something that makes us feel truly amazed: From must justify the trust placed by the fans who bought the Season Pass sight unseen.", "date": "2014-09-01", "grade": null}
