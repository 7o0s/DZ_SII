If it was once acceptable in a certain sense, we must admit that lately the trend has become worrying, not so much for the main series (which will soon see the release of two remakes, to tell the truth) as for the various spin-offs which are produced annually especially for the Nintendo DS. The Mystery Dungeon series in particular has never shone in quality but initially offered a handful of rather intriguing ideas and Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky is configured as the ~deluxe~ version that complements the usual two parallel games, in this case Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. I thought I saw a Pikachu Being a sort of special edition parallel to Explorers of Darkness and Explorers of Time, Explorers of Sky shares the premises and, to be honest, most of the contents. The incipit is typical of this spin-off series: the player wakes up out of the blue with the appearance of a pokmon (it will be an initial test to decide them and in Explorers of the Sky more creatures have been added) and to find out how What happened, he joins a guild of Pokmon adventurers, with whom he mysteriously manages to communicate. At this point the game becomes nothing more than a dungeon-crawler in which the player, together with a group of pokmon, explore various labyrinths to complete the missions activated from time to time. The latter are exactly the same proposals in Explorers of Darkness and Explorers of Time, only a handful have been added that are characterized by slightly more interesting plots: one of the most serious flaws of the series remains in fact the childishness of the narration and dialogues, which immediately identify Mystery Dungeon as a franchise aimed at children, despite the goodness of the ideas in terms of plot. From this point of view, even the delightful retro graphic frame takes on the connotations of a hasty and listless development: Explorers of Sky is too reminiscent of a Game Boy Advance production to be the third edition of a Nintendo DS software. The sprites are poor in detail and barely animated, the settings are rather banal and the randomly generated dungeons are terribly linear and repetitive. And again the same sound effects of the Game Boy Classic era are reproduced when the pokmon open their mouths: this is a real mystery. Mysterious recycling Very few labyrinths have been added in Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky and the new features proposed are non-existent to say the least: the new locations, in short, do not stand out in the least in the boring pile already played in Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. Even the game system has not enjoyed any modifications or improvements and is re-proposed as it is: the player controls a party formed by himself and some pokmon and explores the dungeons moving on a sort of grid or chessboard in sync with the other creatures that populate the area. Should conflict arise, combat plays out differently than in the classic series and resembles a bizarre cross between a turn-based strategy and a traditional RPG. Each pokmon maintains the franchise's characteristic abilities and series veterans will immediately feel at home, although the gameplay has been heavily simplified compared to the depth that the regular series reached in the later stages. The combat system is therefore the most interesting part of Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky but it becomes repetitive quickly: it does not require particular skill or planning and the variety is lacking in a few hours, fortunately the amount of pokmon that can be recruited makes the less static adventure and the ability to take advantage of the wi-fi connection to run to the aid of a friend defeated and lost in a dungeon, exploring it on our own, certainly remains a rare feature, but well implemented and intriguing.", "date": "2009-12-10", "grade": "5.0"}
