This is because the two previous twin titles ~Where's my water~ and ~Where's my Perry~ but also the best seller ~Temple Run~ have contributed to the discharge of the batteries inserted into many iOS devices, thanks to the spot-on approach to the gameplay focused on immediacy and intuitiveness. Environmental puzzles therefore, perfectly contextualized, whose simple and effective formula has proved to be a success; also in Mittens the forces of physics are back in play but, this time, the real protagonists of the game will be the bumps and rebounds. An insatiable kitten As per tradition, the nice developers of the Mickey Mouse house wanted to insert a sort of very light plot in Mittens, in order to give a pretext to the otherwise inexplicable ups and downs of the protagonist. The young cat that gives the game its name has in fact been struck by the charms of an aristocratic kitten, to whose flattery he easily gives in. However, like any classy woman, the kitten is certainly not willing to give herself so easily to her suitor, who sees her love subjected to at least three tests of courage. In essence, it will be a matter of satisfying the whims and cravings of the cat, which can be summarized in milk, colored balloons and mice. The objective of the game is therefore to cross buildings, roofs and ledges up to the coveted final prize, cutting wooden beams and ropes with your finger and exploiting the ~bouncy~ properties of objects and animals arranged along the way. Each of the three game environments, divided into 20 normal and 5 special levels, offers different opportunities for Mittens to move around; for example in the world of Milktown, with a purely urban setting, the cat can slide on curtains and roofs, bounce on the lines to hang the laundry but also take advantage of the passing birds, which will transport it to otherwise inaccessible places. But that's not all, in fact in the presence of TV antennas, the nice ball of fur attaches to them and automatically prepares for an Angry Birds-style launch; bending the antenna with your finger calculates the ideal trajectory, removing it immediately starts the short parabola. Interactions with the environment are not only pleasant, in fact there are also heartless individuals in the world who can't stand cats and would even have the courage to take them with a pan or a window sash. Naturally, the ironic and amusing context in which all this takes place does not allow us to assume even the slightest reference to any anti-animal attitude, indeed the shady individual armed with a frying pan is the one who usually ends up worse in the levels in which he appears. The opening of the door however, as well as the jet of water in the presence of special valves, is another method for making the Mittens jumps gain altitude. We leave the reader with the pleasure of discovering all the numerous interactions present in the other levels (the funny little monkeys in the circus are particularly noteworthy) which, although varying in the different executions, will all lead to the same final result, to analyze the simple scoring system, linked essentially just the conquest of the three diamonds scattered throughout the levels. The final schemes, marked in red, are the most difficult and cumbersome to overcome but in general the degree of difficulty is never too high. The game graphics are also beautiful as usual, based on two-dimensional animated backgrounds of the highest quality, and the general reactivity, which allows the execution of maneuvers in perfect synchrony. Finally, a real gem is the celebration ballet that the protagonist performs each time a goal is achieved.", "date": "2013-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
