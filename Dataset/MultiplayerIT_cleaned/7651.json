After the very first Nintendo DS episode dated 2008, Europe skipped the publication of the two direct sequels (Heroes of Asgard and The Drowned City) and it's almost a miracle that Legends of the Titan hit the shelves, probably prompted by the enormous success of the new Nintendo portable. The reasons for the long absence of Etrian Odyssey are easily understood, since that first chapter did not find the desired success, however it had both in Japan and in North America. In fact, the series has always been a bit indigestible to last-minute players: not only because of the extreme difficulties and complexity that have always characterized it, but also because of its rigid ~retro RPG~ foundations, a term with which timeless adventures such as Eye of the Beholder or Wizardry are increasingly defined lately. This time, however, something has changed. Who needs a story? Despite its somewhat childish appearance, colorful and full of extravagant characters with exquisitely Japanese character design, Etrian Odyssey IV is as far away as there can be from the typical jRPG that we are used to knowing in the form of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest or Tales of . To begin with, we could say that ~the story is there but you can't see it~: it is one of the main differences that distinguish it from the much more numerous competition, and which risks misleading users who do not know the franchise. The beginning of the story is very simple: Anxious to discover what lies beneath Yggdrasil, the world tree said to have created mankind, a guild of explorers sends their best adventurers to explore its surroundings and foundations to unlock all its secrets. The plot then evolves indirectly, while we are busy fighting monsters and exploring dungeons; we'll be updated on what's going on in the world once we're back in the main hub when we can have conversations with some NPCs. It's not us - understood as a group, since there is no real protagonist - who intervene directly on the events taking place around us, influencing our adventure and opening up new areas to explore. Our party is then made up of five characters that we will create at the beginning, first choosing their class and then their name, to which others will join as they approach the finale. The dialogues of these travel companions are very few and skimpy, mostly useful for defining their role in battle; there is no interaction between them, no love blossoms, no conflicts emerge. In short, the story is stripped down to the bone, and the player explores the world ~just for the fun of it~. It's a spell that can't work on everyone, and many may already feel out of place reading these lines, rightly more inclined to look for an RPG that excites them with dosed twists and well-characterized characters. However, if the concept of Etrian Odyssey is already intriguing you and you are curious to find out where the gameplay is going, read on, because that spell could pleasantly affect you too. Etrian Odyssey IV is not an adventure for everyone, but it will appeal to those looking for an excellent RPG with a vintage flavor The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect in Etrian Odyssey IV is not very effective, probably thought of as a mere visual tinsel that would have had no use at a playful level. On the one hand it is true, on the other it could have been better exploited to make the attacks of the enemies or some scenarios more effective in the moments of exploration. Just a little imagination Landsknecht, Nightseeker, Fortress, Dancer, Medic, Sniper and Runemaster: there are seven classes that allow us to create our party at the beginning of Etrian Odyssey IV, to which three more are added (Bushi, Arcanist and Imperial) gradually which continues in the adventure and in the story. At some point it will even be possible to unlock a secondary class to be associated with the main one of each character, and at each level up the capabilities of that character/class can be increased in one direction or another, enhancing certain aspects at the expense of others or not. It is immediately clear that, from the very beginning, Etrian Odyssey IV requires good party development planning; it is certainly possible, albeit at the expense of a small penalty, to reset the development of one or more characters, but the entire structure of the game and its fights is based on the synergies between party members and their skills. The player is not invited, he is really pressed to reflect on who to bring into battle and where to place him: the interface, clear and clean, perfectly explains the function of each skill, and it is physically impossible to make your way through only with sword strokes and randomly chosen attack spells. You have to play strategy, under penalty of Game Over. A logic that applies not only to normal enemies, but also and above all to FOE (Field On Enemy); these enemies roam freely around the map and represent real mini-bosses who keep more delicious items than usual. The search for FOE, treasures and the entrance to the next floor of the ~dungeon~ of the moment is the core of the gameplay of Etrian Odyssey IV, occasionally interspersed with the exploration of the sky using a special aircraft that will manage to climb higher and higher with the unfolding of events. Every now and then we return to the city, produce some objects, sell the collected treasures (unfortunately the limited inventory will often require much more than a few about-faces) and buy new accessories to improve the skills of our heroes. Then we dive back into the adventure: following the tradition of the aforementioned ~retro RPGs~ such as the aforementioned Eye of the Beholder, Etrian Odyssey IV develops everything in the first person. The upper screen of Nintendo 3DS allows us to look around and explore the current location, while on the lower one the route is automatically traced on a completely empty squared map. In fact, it will be up to us to place icons, notes and symbols, taking advantage of an interface that is a bit tricky at first but will nevertheless prove to be decidedly practical and intuitive. Cartography is a feature dear to the franchise, which in this episode perhaps finds its definitive expression thanks to the greater capabilities of the hardware. Also from a technical point of view, progress has been made, but not as clear-cut as we would have expected: dungeons and settings are much more colorful and full of details, thanks also to the better screen resolution, but perhaps still a little too repetitive , mostly made up of corridors and rooms that are all a bit the same depending on the theme of the day. Different speech regarding the fights: also this time we will never see our party, whose attacks, spells and abilities will be visually translated into special effects and short explanatory texts. Enemies, by contrast, are now fully polygonal and beautifully animated - especially in the case of bosses and FOEs - although we would have expected a greater variety of creatures. The usual, excellent soundtrack by Yuzo Koshiro closes the technical frame, which makes exploration and battles definitively more pleasant and exciting.", "date": "2013-08-29", "grade": "8.0"}
