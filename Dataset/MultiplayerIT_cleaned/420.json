{"name": "Legion Arena: Cult of Mithras - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legion-arena-cult-of-mithras-recensione.html", "text": "As part of the new distribution perspective of the company, the Cult of Mithras expansion pack is coming out these days, currently only available online in the form of a very small zip file (just 9 Mbytes). Remembering Rome It is a curious real-time strategy that takes its inspiration from the Total War saga: once the units to be sent into battle have been chosen, it is decided in advance how to arrange them, taking advantage of the morphological configuration of the game scenario, and are subsequently imparted - and in real time  orders simply by clicking on the mouse. At the end of each fight, bonus points are earned to spend to restore wounded units, upgrade those that have reached enough experience to level up, recruit the new and more lethal siege engines that were initially inaccessible due to cost. [C] In Cult of Mithras the Roman legions are overwhelmed by a mysterious army in Gaul A summary sheet of the units: you can find out more log in between battles [/C] Few ideas... but confused! The basic idea is actually simple, and continuing with the battles we realize how important, on paper, army planning and management should be to get the better of the troops controlled by the opponent. In reality, the poor artificial intelligence and the limited dimensions of the maps (elements that have not been improved by the expansion) end up making the clashes to mere frontal attacks devoid of the slightest tactics. During a game it happened to attack (with our entire army) a wing of the opposing line-up without the adjacent troops making the slightest effort to help the poor unfortunates: gross errors that shouldn't have been present, given that they are sidelined it is very little, both from the point of view of the game structure, which has remained practically unchanged, and from the technical one. They certainly didn't expect revolutionary changes from a simple 9 Mbyte file, but after trying Cult Of Mithras we realized that the only additions were new units and some maps (35 to be precise). Therefore, the technical limits derived above all from the nature of the game (it is a low-budget title) remain, such as the impossibility of rotating the camera, the paucity of graphic elements present in the maps, the annoying clipping effect. One wonders why these small software houses do not want to re-evaluate the two dimensions, given that the results would be much better. The fact that in order to access the new demon campaign it is necessary to have completed all those of the original game confirms that the expansion was dedicated to an extremely small group of users, and it is therefore only to those who madly loved Legion Arena that we recommend to consider Cult Of Mithras: the technical paucity, the repetitiveness of the action and the not really attractive price (it's offered at $15) make it undesirable for most players. Final comment Nothing good in this new effort by Slitherine Software: we didn't expect miracles or radical upheavals from a simple expansion, but it was reasonable to expect something more, especially as regards the balancing of units and the improvement of artificial intelligence. Even the introductory price was not very successful: in short, a game to forget.
