{"name": "SuperMonkeyBall 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/supermonkeyball-2.html", "text": "Shock the monkey SuperMonkeyBall 2 could easily be divided into two decidedly distinct sections: one related to the main game, the other to the party game. In the main game you will be able to face the 90 tracks available in the classic challenge, or in the story mode. The latter is one of the additions made compared to the previous version, in fact you will find yourself again in the role of Aiai, Meemee, Gongon and the little Baby, this time right within an exciting and intriguing story like never before ... In a apparently normal day, the quiet Jungle Island is obscured by a huge seaplane captained by a shady figure, also a monkey, named Bad-Boon, who first plunders the village depriving it of all bananas, then falls in love with the beautiful Meemee (so to speak, caspius is a monkey!), and here the troubles begin for our ~superchimpanzutieroi~. That's all? Well, actually there is some twist, but in principle yes. You will therefore have to travel the 90 tracks to complete both the story mode and the challenge mode, plus another 60 to unlock by finishing the various levels of the latter without ever continuing. The stages differ from the predecessor thanks to a greater use of disturbing elements such as spheres, rings, boulders and anything that can hinder the path leading to the finish line. All this gives the game a good level of diversification where in fact the prequel lacked, thus resulting, in the long run, rather monotonous. At the purely level of controls, the main game benefits from the same simplicity and immediacy of the progenitor where nothing else had to be used than the left analog stick and in which the octagonal conformation in which the same stick resides enjoyed its maximum splendor. Is everything easy then? Missing by idea. Anyone who played the first episode knows that SMB is far from easy, indeed, the excessive difficulty also makes this ~episode~ rather frustrating. It will therefore not be accessible to obtain the points necessary to unlock the six new and tasty minigames, considering that ~the old ones~ are included from the beginning. This is certainly the most positive parenthesis of the entire game, to the six mini-games present in the first edition (target, bowling, billiard, race, golf and fight) just as many are added and they are: boat, shot, dogfight, soccer, baseball and tennis . Twelve minigames therefore that vary and range in all directions, there really is something for all tastes, starting from the more static ones such as billiards and golf, passing through technical ones such as target and dogfight, up to the more chaotic like soccer and fight. The only sore point is the monkeyboat, or an arcade reproduction of one of the most popular extreme sports of the moment, or rafting. This minigame, among the most anticipated of the new series, lacks both in immediacy and in actual playability, the management of the rowing through the R and L backbones is too difficult. A flaw that does not affect the overall result, however. Has it technically improved? Of course yes. Amusement Vision have definitely done a good job in the development, giving the game a polygonal engine of considerable thickness. Everything runs at a constant 60 fps both in the main game and in the partygames, where in most of them the screen is divided into splits. The graphics are lively, in perfect harmony with the style of the game and boasts a background that is decidedly pleasant to look at. In fact, during the pilgrimage of our four little monkeys, we will have in the background lava waterfalls, streams of water and even (and this is definitely the best) the mammoth mouth of a whale which, when you are inside it, opens and closes. The polygonal models of the protagonists are, although improved, rather sparse despite the style applied to them being spot on. The sound is unfortunately the only colorless page of this splendid chapter as it is limited to being a mere background without ever dragging the action especially in the minigames, where the latter becomes more excited. Sympathetic, even if lacking depth, is instead the dubbing in the section concerning the story mode, where the monkeys will go on to ~uki-uki~ obviously translated for us humans... Final comment SuperMonkeyBall 2 is much more than an upgrade of the first episode, it is at the same time a good puzzle game and the best party game so far made for the 128 bit generation. The minigames satisfy, both in terms of variety and quantity, all the needs of video players, offering hours and hours of guaranteed fun. The main game is a huge challengeproportions in which only the most daring and skilled will be able to figure it out. Pros: Enormous longevity A successful evolution of the prequel in every aspect technically appreciable Cons: at times excessively frustrating sound just enough will not please those who did not like the first episode Last year, at the Japanese release of the GameCube, a mysterious game inspired by an old glory of yesteryear appeared among the launch titles: Marble Madness. The title was initially snubbed by users and struck down by the specialized press, but time, like the night, brings advice and Super Monkey Ball has seen itself re-evaluated and has earned the title of best launch x cube title. The game, in fact, made use of a decidedly original concept as well as exceptional gameplay. A year has therefore passed and Amusement Vision have every intention of retracing, with this highly anticipated sequel, the path they took a year ago.", "date": "2002-12-05", "grade": null}
