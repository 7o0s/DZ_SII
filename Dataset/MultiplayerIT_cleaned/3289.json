{"name": "Fight'N Rage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fightn-rage-recensione.html", "text": "It's always interesting to go back to talking about scrolling fighting games, a videogame genre that was very popular in arcades between the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s and which also found space and a following on the consoles of the time with some productions of excellent workmanship: just think of the various Final Fight, Streets of Rage 2 and TMNT: Turtles in Time. With the advent of polygonal graphics and the first experiments in the field of three dimensions, the trend has practically disappeared and there it took several years for it to make a comeback; but the enthusiasts of that time are adults today and maybe sometimes they happened to fantasize about how some concrete novelty could be introduced within that formula which is so amusing and at the same time so intrinsically limited. Well, an independent Uruguayan developer, Sebastian Garcia, the sole component of SebaGamesDev, thought about making these fantasies come true in the form of a game that has just landed on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S (but is already available on PC, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch) which pays homage to the classic scrolling fighting games but also tries to mix the cards a bit: we talk about it in the Fight'N Rage review. History, assumptions and controversies Fight'N Rage, Norris faces some opponents The story of Fight'N Rage is set in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by hordes of violent mutants who have subjugated the human race. The only ones to oppose this situation are two ninja warriors, F. Norris and the buxom Gal, and the mutant rebel Ricardo: joining forces, the three launch themselves head-on against the troops of the human-lion hybrid The Boss. As per tradition, however, the plot is nothing more than a trivial expedient to bring to the screen a sequence of increasingly complex scenarios and fights, which will see us face ten levels and an enormous amount of different opponents to complete the campaign and unlock one of the as many as fifty-six endings available. The author of Fight'N Rage has seen fit to enrich the experience in this way in order to enhance its replayability, going to plug what has always been one of the weak points of scrolling fighting games, namely the tendency to run out of them in one go of an afternoon and the scarce incentives to resume the experience beyond the pure and simple enjoyment of the gameplay, but we will talk about that shortly. Of course, in the aesthetic choices made by Garcia, controversial elements emerge, for example the practically chibi approach to Gal's design does not go well with her huge bouncing breasts, and although solutions of this type can be interpreted as a sort of mockery of the hypersexualization in vogue in the early 90s, when we find ourselves in fight of howler monkeys emulating Bruce Lee inevitably comes some doubt. Gameplay: Like the classics, more than the classics Fight'N Rage, the CRT-style warped screen can be set up in a number of ways Assuming that the entire development of Fight'N Rage revolves around the desire to revisit and improve what was the typical vision of scrolling fighting games, it is above all the gameplay that has a lot to say. Firstly because the author of the game has tried to differentiate the three protagonists in an important way, who therefore do not limit themselves to offering the same experience.F. Norris, who stands as the more balanced option, is basically a clone of Guy from Final Fight, pose included, and boasts good reach, spectacular combos and a super in which the character throws hundreds of punches against the enemy on duty, at Kenshiro. On the other hand, Gal seems to have come out of Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game, she has short arms and this forces her to shorten the distances a lot, but she is fast and has a really effective running attack. Fight'N Rage, Ricardo spins around to wipe out opponents Finally, Ricardo is a classic tank who resists for a long time before going down, but in fact he doesn't run and his holds represent a bit of a missed opportunity, given that he limits himself to crushing his opponents to the ground: from this point of view given the other two protagonists they do better, Norris in particular with his explosive Haggar-style jumping piledriver. Beyond the individual peculiarities, the combat system is not limited to the traditional combos, but uses juggling to push us to continue hitting the enemies even when they are in mid-air, as well as throwing them continuously against their companions to survive situations in which you find yourself literally besieged by mutants and performing these maneuvers well becomes the only way to survive. Fight'N Rage, cooperative chaosbut only locally The scenarios support these choices in a very convinced way, also here with various homages to the classic scrolling fighting games and a particularly difficult and frustrating aquatic level, in which it often happens to end up in the water while jumping or while defending yourself from the hateful boss flying at the end of the stage, losing valuable life energy each time. How is game over handled in Fight'N Rage? Very good, in our opinion: the ~continues~ are infinite, but you have to start the level over every time and this implies the impossibility of getting to the end credits too easily. There are also no upgrades for the characters: the coins you earn can only be spent on unlocking costumes, modes and extra content. Contents and cooperative Fight'N Rage, one of Norris' first unlockable costumes is yet another homage to the classics Here, speaking of the modalities, also from this point of view the good Sebastian Garcia has tried to push the accelerator full throttle and to fill one of the most common shortcomings of this videogame genre, inserting a whole series of alternative options in addition to the traditional campaign, from Battle Mode to Score Attack, from Survival to Time Attack. Nothing transcendental, but it's nice to have them. The extra modes are unlocked by completing specific tasks, for example by completing the story on normal difficulty it is possible to obtain companions controlled by the CPU for the inevitable cooperative, in this case for three participants: a real cornerstone of the Fight'N Rage experience, which however has to deal with a major limitation since it only works locally and not online. Technical realization: mature or amateur? Fight'N Rage, the aquatic level runs ~deep~ Scrolling through the credits of Fight'N Rage it turns out that the author of the game has used various public domain assets to put together the graphics of the stages and/or characters, but there is no doubt that he has done a decent job on the plan of the coin-op-style visual representation, providing us with different CRT-style ~curvature~ options for the screen, as well as the various scanlines or a sharp approach to the nice but not phenomenal pixel art graphics that embellish the product. we wrote earlier, there are some elements that leave us a bit dumbfounded and which are probably linked to personal sensitivities, but in general the technical system works very well (net of some strange slowdown) and the various transitions are captivating. Of course, the amazing soundtrack signed by Gonzalo Varela is undoubtedly the protagonist of the situation, thanks to an abundant quantity of songs of great depth, which involve and exalt as we hit left and right.", "date": "2023-03-09", "grade": "7.5"}
