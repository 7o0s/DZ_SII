{"name": "City of Brass", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199165-city-of-brass-city-of-brass-la-recensione.html", "text": "Among the development strategies aimed at increasing the level of challenge of a video game there is a rather simple one which consists in eliminating the saves. And it's a choice that rogue-like and rogue-lite proudly embrace, regardless of the basic gameplay setting, leaving the player with only one life available with which to complete a series of challenging and procedurally generated levels. Dying means starting over with completely transformed levels and enemy locations. The risk of this dynamic, we know well, is frustration, also because in most cases this type of game does not include a strong plot to support everything, but the satisfactions up for grabs can be worth the effort which is often lightened by mechanical of progression calibrated to give the player a few more possibilities without distorting the essence of the challenge. We find all this in City of Brass, a first-person rogue-lite developed by an Australian team also made up of veterans who have worked on the Bioshock series. And it is precisely for this reason that we are not surprised by a gameplay in some ways similar to the 2K Games series and its offspring, Dishonored included, with items to buy, upgrades of all kinds, stealth, two types of attack to combine and a 'high mobility. All declined, as we have said, in the name of a pure survival game that uses the plot as a mere pretext to invite us to go through thirteen levels that change with each game. It's a trap! Our journey into the ancient Arabian world of the City of Brass begins in front of a huge gate, armed with a whip in your left hand and a sword in your right hand. Behind us nothing while in front, along the only viable road, thirteen levels await us full of monsters and traps of those that do a lot of harm and that must be avoided at all costs in a game that allows us a limited energy stock. Four damages suffered in full, in fact, take us out of the way, bringing us back to the principle of a maze that changes shape with each new beginning. But the resources to survive the countless threats, which include rather challenging bosses, are certainly not lacking. The most faithful friend we have is our whip whose extension allows us to trigger traps from a distance, to collect objects out of reach, to exploit specific holds, to blind enemies or make them tumble to the ground. This must be exploited to the maximum just as it is essential to use environmental resources. Bombs, lamps, explosive barrels and the traps themselves are fundamental tools, artifices that allow us to eliminate enemies without entering hand-to-hand combat. In fact, it is not easy to avoid the damage suffered in close combat and this is because some enemies rush towards us like crazy, and because of a collision system that is not particularly precise. In any case, keeping a safe distance works and this is facilitated by dodging, by the possibility of overcoming the differences in height with a flash of the kidneys and by stealth which is always useful, but becomes essential in no uncertain terms when we find ourselves facing opposing forces that do not we can counter with brute force. Increasingly numerous in the advanced levels, enemies of this type target us with powerful spells that force us to flee, often into the arms of skeletons, wizards, archers and a thousand other monsters that stand between us and the final goal. Sometimes the escape is successful, but the random generation of the levels can put us in front of situations that border on the intractable unless we resort to caution. And this is precisely our main weapon as it becomes clear after a few attempts to face the City of Brass with too much sprint. In fact, in the Uppercut Games title, even treasures can hide lethal threats, while still maintaining their appeal thanks to the possibility of giving us welcome upgrades, and it is good not to be too distracted so as not to compromise the already low health. Ups and downs Recovering health in City of Brass is possible and it is good not to miss the opportunity given the high degree of challenge of the title. Unfortunately, the goods that can be purchased from the sellers are as random as the position of the sellers themselves, summoned from special locations, but the equipment available is so varied that it is difficult not to find something useful to buy with the gold obtained by playing. Between power-ups, magic boots, armor, rings and weapons with special powers, the possibilities for our character's evolution are considerable and the resources include bombs, lanterns and other tools scattered throughout the game. Player resourceskings are several and even include ghost chickens to use to confuse enemies even if, we say it right away, there is nothing that completely upsets the balance of the title, even in the case of modifiers applicable to matches, which guarantees a level of challenge always high. Nonetheless, some bonuses are more relevant than others and this concerns both the opportunity to recover some health, truly invaluable, as well as the possibility of deactivating traps in an entire level by paying five hundred coins is not bad. Furthermore, sellers can give us the possibility of storing an object to be reused in a subsequent game and can be manipulated, by spending one of the three wishes available in each game, to raise the level of purchasable objects. Obviously, given the setting of the title, randomness still plays an important role, but in the case of City of Brass it is balanced not only by the equipment but also by the skill in first person combat and by the wisdom in use of stealth, both important elements of a rogue-lite that is decidedly different from the average of the genre. All seasoned with the Arabian atmosphere that between spikes, skeletons and colors takes us back to the times of Prince of Persia. However, not everything turned out as hoped. Let's start by saying that the procedural generation works very well and guarantees maps that are always consistent, net of some traps that appear at the end of dead ends in which we will never set foot. The valid graphic sector that takes full advantage of the soft curves and the excellent lighting of the Unreal Engine, often shows the side due to the fluctuating quality of some details such as fire and grass, to say the least, waivable. Furthermore, the limited variety of the environment raises the risk that boredom will come forward, transforming the decidedly high challenge into frustration. And if we also put on the scales an equally repetitive soundtrack and a plot that it would be a compliment to define as thin, all the typical weaknesses of this genre emerge, only partially compensated for by the rich equipment and the peculiar gameplay setting. The aim, among other things, is often imprecise, despite the interface indicating the interactions of the whip with an icon, which is combined with a few too many bugs, sometimes capable of definitively blocking our avatar, and with not happy choices such as the fact that the companions that can be purchased from the vendors block our way, turning from an advantage into an obstacle on several occasions. Overall, however, City of Brass exceeds the sufficiency without too many problems and with some refinements it could turn into a decidedly interesting rogue-lite.", "date": "2018-05-14", "grade": "7.0"}
