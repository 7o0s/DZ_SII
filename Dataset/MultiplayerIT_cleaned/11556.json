{"name": "RiMS Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-rims-racing.html", "text": "We have finally completed our review of RiMS Racing, a two-wheeled simulation title from RaceWard Studio. This is the first project of this Italian development team, which wants us to experience the passion for motorcycles at 360 degrees. In addition to having created a driving model and a realistic physics engine, the developers have also taken care of the smallest details of the customization and modification of our racing cars. RiMS Racing brings a good degree of immersion even when we're in the pits or in our development center, where in addition to having to carry out the task of a driver, we'll have to take on the role of the team's engineer and mechanic. A real gem for those who like to disassemble and reassemble every tiny component of their bike, to then experiment with the changes made on the track by pushing with the hammer gas. After several hours of gameplay in which we tested the driving model, thoroughly experimented with the bike customization system and explored each game mode present, we are ready to tell you everything about the new RaceWard Studio simulation game. Motorcycles, tracks and customization components The list of bikes featured in RiMS Racing Within RiMS Racing, motorcycle enthusiasts will undoubtedly find what they are looking for. Although the developers have preferred to recreate only eight models of motorcycles among those of the most popular manufacturers within their software, their level of fidelity is absolutely to be rewarded. Since there are not many, we can also list them all, so as to offer you a complete overview of the available vehicles: Aprilia RSV4, BMW M 1000 RR, Suzuki GSX-R1000R, Honda CBR1000RR, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR, Yamaha YZF-R1, Ducati Panigale V4 R and MV Agusta F4 RC. In the future, other racing cars will undoubtedly arrive to take to the track through free updates or paid DLC. Then there are 15 tracks among which we find 10 official circuits reproduced with good fidelity such as Silverstone, Suzuka, Laguna Seca, Nrburgring and Zolder. For those who love to go directly to the street, the developers have created five locations with road courses set in the United States, Australia, Norway, Spain and Italy. In the latter it will simply be necessary to reach point B starting from point A and each track will also be available in the reverse version for greater variety. In addition to the extreme fidelity of two-wheeled racing cars, RaceWard Studio has implemented in RiMS Racing over 500 components available to customize each of the eight motorcycles present. They too are based on real counterparts, produced by brands such as Brembo, Akrapovi and Suzuki, with specific statistics and details on their performance, reliability and cost. Everything can be purchased simply using virtual currency, earned through the challenges, events and races proposed in the various game modes. The level of customization offered is therefore high and manages to fully satisfy the fantasies of every motorcycle lover. Game mode Central hub of Career Mode The central mode of RiMS Racing is undoubtedly the Career in which we will have to face the challenges on the track, modify the bike with new components and manage research, development and management with the engineers. First of all we will be asked to create our alter ego, customizing only his clothing (helmet, overalls, boots, gloves), the positions he assumes on the bike (use of the free foot in braking, number of fingers on the brake knob), without be able to change his physical appearance. The high amount of customization elements (there are about 200 official items of clothing) has made us overcome the absence of a facial editor for our protagonist. Also because in any case he will always wear a helmet. Once we enter the central hub of the Career mode we will have access to about seventy events including races, timed challenges, duels, private tests, events related to certain brands and cups. Each of them will make us earn in-game currency to be able to buy new components and motorcycles to improve our performance. Off the track we will also have to constantly improve the research and development department, together with the team management through the classic skill trees. The sense of progression, both of the bike and of our team, is well structured and gives satisfaction when you continue in the Career mode, gradually earning more and more game credits. Overall, however, there is a lack of variety in the proposed challenges, also because RiMS Racing encourages us to face them several times to improve and earn more credits. Progression tree insideor Career Mode In addition to the Career mode we then have the classic Single Race, in which we can customize various aspects such as the choice of bike, the weather conditions, the wear of the asphalt, the number of opponents (up to a maximum of 10 pilots controlled by the AI ), fuel consumption and other options. Similarly, even in Private Test mode we can decide to take to the track with a whole series of settings to try out new components, find the right setup for a specific track or simply to train and perfect our driving style. Then we have the Academy section with different challenges and objectives that are unlocked once completed in Career mode. By accessing the Academy we can then revisit these events to push ourselves further and improve our lap times. Among the events of the Academy, some elements of the game will be illustrated to us, even if we would have preferred to have a more exhaustive Tutorial mode to better understand all the various game mechanics, use of the components, etc. Finally, the developers of RaceWard Studio have also created a Multiplayer mode very similar to the Single Race, where you can challenge other players with the same customization options offered in offline mode. There is also the split screen, an element now rare even in games of this genre, absolutely appreciated for those who want to challenge some friends locally on the same screen. Gameplay on the track and in the pits Helmet camera The driving model offered by RiMS Racing brings a solid level of simulation. Getting on the saddle, gripping the accelerator and pushing our bikes to the maximum gives excellent sensations, especially when you become familiar with the control system. At first glance the game is certainly not immediate and when you hold your pad to push the bike on the track you will first have to get used to the physics engine and the reactivity of the two-wheeled vehicle. Nothing particularly strange in a simulation title like this, which rightly wants to detach itself from the more immediate arcade video games. However, there are three levels of difficulty with respective driving aids to be able to accompany the gamer in learning the correct control of the bike. We really appreciated the good learning curve available in RiMS Racing. Starting with the aids activated, we were able to understand how to deal with acceleration exits, braking and how to set up the bike when entering corners. The bike responds realistically to our commands, so much so that you can perceive the stiffness of the suspension under braking or the loss of the rear when we press the accelerator trigger on the pad. We will therefore have to learn how to dose the brake well when braking, set the curve at the right speed, keep in mind the wear of the tires lap after lap, balance the front or rear brakes and in general have a clean driving style that will reduce wear and maximize performance. Learning these elements at higher difficulties would have been decidedly more difficult, so much so that some players could even get bored before discovering the potential of the driving model. Our advice is therefore to start from the minimum difficulty in any case and then gradually remove all the aids once you have found a certain feeling with the bike. In this way, not only will you be able to have fun right away, but you will also be able to appreciate your improvement on the two-wheeled racing car which will undoubtedly give you great satisfaction. Bike customization in RiMS Racing As mentioned several times before, RiMS Racing also wants to take us off the track to improve our motorcycle. Both in the pit lane boxes and in our development center in Career mode we will be able to literally disassemble most of the components of our bike. In terms of gameplay, everything takes place with a series of mini-games in which we will have to press a sequence of keys to remove the screws, unscrew the bolts, replace the chain, inflate the tires, etc. Everything was done with extreme care, creating good animations in the editing phases, so much so that it seemed like a video lesson dedicated to mechanics. In the long run, however, these mechanical operations can get boring, because they will soon become very repetitive. Fortunately in the pits we will be able to delegate this task to our mechanics once hired by the team to carry out the pit stops in the shortest possible time. By installing new components on the bike and testing them on the track, you can easily notice the improvements made (only if the modification made makes sense on a particular track). Once disassembled however, the components dothey can also resell to recover part of the credits invested based on their degree of usury. Finding the right set of components and bike setup will be hard work, given the high number of options available. By dedicating time to this aspect of the gameplay, however, you will be able to obtain a significant improvement on the track, knowing that it was you who created it using your mechanical skills. With the simple push of a button you will have access to the CSM menu (Motorcycle Status Control) directly on your racing car. From here you can monitor the wear of the mounted components in real time and consequently change your setup or driving style to extend the life of your vehicle. Among the important parameters in the race we find fuel management and tire wear, essential for reaching the end of the race with the best possible performance. Third person top view Instead, we were disappointed by the behavior of the bikes in the rain, which is all too similar to the feeling we had in the dry. Being able to take the corners with the same speed in wet conditions didn't seem realistic at all. Instead, we appreciated the drying of the track on the ideal trajectory as the race continues, even if there is no actual dynamic weather, only the asphalt conditions change. Another critical point of RiMS Racing is undoubtedly the all too confusing artificial intelligence. We often see AI-controlled pilots making senseless maneuvers, which in several cases lead to very unrealistic stupid crashes. This holds across all difficulty levels tested, but hopefully will be fixed in future updates. On the other hand, the various cameras available in the game are good. For easier driving we used the external one behind the player, but for a more realistic experience we definitely preferred the first person view which took us directly on the bike. Technical compartment Laguna Seca under the helmet Finally, let's talk about the technical sector managed entirely by the Nacon KT Engine graphics engine. The latter is the same used in the popular WRC rally series, slightly adapted to this simulation focused more on official tracks and tracks. Unfortunately, the graphics engine fails to make us perceive the sensation of speed well with various effects such as motion blur. Although the tracks are reproduced in a realistic way compared to their real-life counterparts, some textures could be more detailed to offer a better visual rendering. There's also a rather notable pop-up issue, some minor bugs and occasional frame-rate drops that can detract from the experience. The wet effect is only discreet, as are the animations of the drivers and mechanics. On the other hand, the audio sector is excellent, both in the sound effects and in the soundtrack specially created for the title. The sound of the bikes is very realistic and changes depending on the camera used in the game, offering us a good degree of realism from this point of view. Being able to hear a different sound from the bike by changing the exhaust or other components is undoubtedly satisfying and offers a greater opportunity to customize one's available means.", "date": "2021-08-26", "grade": "8.1"}
