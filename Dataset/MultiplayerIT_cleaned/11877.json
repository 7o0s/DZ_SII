{"name": "Lode Runner", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lode-runner.html", "text": "For the period in which it was released, Lode Runner really played the role of a ~milestone~, introducing fresh and effective dynamics within a market anchored to heavy technical limitations, where the creativity and imagination of the developers really made the difference. The comparison with the world of mobile video games is clear, even if by now the technical innovations are there for all to see and it is possible to obtain results comparable to those of the old 16-bit consoles. This speech does not concern Lode Runner, however, a title that has always relied on substance rather than form and which confirms its line also in this new mobile version. The new Lode Runner immediately imposes its numbers: eighty internships, all immediately available, which together with the innovative editor can only excite fans of the original game. It is worth spending a few words immediately for this last feature, relatively new as far as wireless gaming is concerned: we will have completely carte blanche in building a level from scratch, with a series of ~tools~ positioned on the right side of the screen that allow you to create walls, stairs, enemies and so on. What about the ~classic~ game? Well, it's the same as always: we control a chubby character (very different from the little white man in the first version) and we have to find a way to reach the exit in each stage, avoiding contact with enemies and using ladders and platforms. The control system is extremely simple: with the joystick we move our alter-ego, while the two function keys make us dig graves to the right or to the left. Each hole we make in the ground does not last forever and disappears after a few seconds, therefore we must calculate the times well when we trap the opponents and we must also pay attention to the surfaces that cannot be scratched. It is clear that the difficulty gradually increases depending on the level. The technical realization of this remake of Lode Runner is certainly richer than the original, but in many ways it maintains the same characteristics of essentiality: the character does not boast an exceptional design or a large animation park, and the same can be said of the enemies who meet. The stages themselves are quite poor in elements and colors. In short, the developers limited themselves to making the game aesthetically functional to the action, which has always been a strong point of the franchise. What matters, in the eyes of the nostalgic, is that the inputs are promptly received and that the joystick of the telephone does not prove to be an insurmountable obstacle for the character to move rapidly in various directions. In that sense, Lode Runner performs quite well. Pros: Classic gameplay Eighty levels of play... ...and with the editor you can create new ones Against: Technically mediocre Only recommended for nostalgics Sometimes cumbersome", "date": "2007-10-31", "grade": "S.V."}
