Many have passed since the publication of Total War: Rome, remembered by fans with great affection not only for the role it played in consecrating the series after Medieval but also because the second chapter did not arouse the same enthusiasm. Precisely for this reason, Creative Assembly has decided to retrace its steps and instead of proposing a new chapter that puts us in command of the Roman legions, it has opted to re-propose the most appreciated one, with some tweaks here and there to modernize it, relying on the English of Feral Interactive . This is to tell you that if you read the Total War: Rome Remastered review and want to approach it, you will have to do it with the knowledge that you are briefly faced with the same game from 2004. There are some small changes, undeniable and the various supporting trailers have shown it , but see them as a new coat of paint on an otherwise functional base - albeit with its well-known flaws. No revolution, therefore, just a better presentation on an aesthetic level or to make it better used on modern computers. It is therefore not a chapter to be added to the more recent titles in terms of presentation, but a declared nostalgia operation that allows the game to come back into vogue after seventeen years and perhaps be discovered by those who have not tried it at the time: it is, without no doubt, the best way to enjoy an old classic. Between old and new For those unfamiliar with it, Total War: Rome, and more generally the series, is based on two main pillars: on the one hand we have the managerial aspect, useful for developing our empire through diplomacy, resource management, infrastructure construction and, in short, all those bureaucratic and political aspects without which we would not get very far. Knowing how to handle a pilum or forming a perfect tortoise is good, however the most important war is the one that moves between intrigues and agreements. On the other hand, as you will have understood, there is all the strategic component of real-time battles, where it is possible to command an army of up to two thousand units to get the better of the (not too brilliant) artificial intelligence, or leave both the PC to handle the fights for us. It must be said, however, that you will get the best results by doing it yourself. As written at the beginning, there is no big difference in the game structure compared to 2004 and unfortunately some aspects such as the aforementioned AI or pathfinding - the path chosen by the unit to reach the indicated area - they are as questionable now as then. The few changes have been made for a matter of overall balancing of units and civilizations, as well as the experience in general. At a glance you will immediately notice the increase in the number of soldiers within the classes, with a direct increase in the army itself: infantrymen, knights, archers, all the ranks have been enlarged and although being able to move up to twenty units just like seventeen years ago, the size of our army doubled. If you then want to manage the unit in detail, you can take a look at the options and decide how many warriors are right for you. Despite the veiled criticisms of artificial intelligence, there is no denying the work done by the developers in this sense in order to make it more competitive and less stupid when it comes to self-isolating or getting flanked with disarming ease as it was in its time. So yeah, enemies are more responsive and aggressive. The more experienced players, however, will be able to reverse even the most tragic situation in their favor and in general it is still possible to get the better of artificial intelligence even for the less experienced - provided it is not your very first approach with a strategic one. There's not much to say about pathfinding, it was tragic then and now it's not much better, considering that often you will have to intervene and bring your troops back on the right path before they, in a clear suicidal intent, go towards disaster despite having to proceed in straight line: direction that they will make inexplicably articulated with absurd maneuvers from real case studies. Total War: Rome Remastered increases the number of soldiers available The first real news for Total War: Rome Remastered is the weather, which can affect battles. Suffice it to the loss of effectiveness of the flaming arrows in case of rain, a small but sensible addition absent from the original game. Taking advantage of the fact that this pack includes the expansions Alexander and Barbarian Invasion, from the latter in particular the night battles are resumed, also made possible when using any of the factions belonging to the imperial campaign. Nothing fromdo with regard to naval battles, to be resolved automatically exactly as in 2004.As we wrote at the beginning, the controls and interface have also been revisited to bring the experience into line with modern standards: the camera now allows map rotation, together at a greater zoom level, while the user interface has been redesigned from the ground up to make everything accessible and just a click away - or keyboard, if you prefer shortcuts. Overall we are satisfied with the work done and the functionality that follows, improved without distorting it, nevertheless expert players may need a moment to get used to it. The situation is different with regard to the interface of the strategic counterpart, on which we are equally satisfied and critical: always with a view to having everything more accessible and under control at any time, there are some very interesting additions such as reminders for notifications not yet read or agents who have been stopped for too long; in this way there is no risk of carrying on the shift by forgetting important pieces during management. Other elements, on the contrary, seemed less intuitive than in the past, or maybe it's once again a matter of getting used to (especially on the management of settlements). Aesthetic side, even if a little less inspired than the original version, we still appreciated. Total War: Rome Remaster, management interface Beyond this, the management of the empire proceeds exactly as in the past. Alliances come and go, but if they stay it's better, the decision on which infrastructure to prioritize is the basis of a thriving city, large and capable armies are essential for quick and painless conquests possible - for us, certainly not for the enemies. All pleasantly familiar and, indeed, it even enjoys a discreet improvement in terms of diplomacy (therefore of the alliances mentioned above): if you are a fan of Total War: Rome, or of others as it is a rather common problem in the series, you will remember without doubt the bipolarity of the other civilizations, which behaved in such an unpredictable way as to make it unnecessarily complicated to understand how to behave towards them. Fortunately, the remaster intervenes in this sense and balances the attitude of the AI especially when it comes to interrupting an alliance: we will no longer be attacked without reason from one turn to another but the premises will be laid so that we can understand that we have reached a critical point. Quite simply, the agreements themselves will be broken by the allies before going on the offensive, which in any case will not take place before a few turns. Perhaps one of the changes that was most needed. From the point of view of new additions we find instead the merchant, an agent who joins the originals and is used to trade precious resources, increasing the income of our faction. Once again, it's something that veterans have to get used to, because playing for seventeen years following a precise pattern doesn't make it immediate to introduce a new pawn, but overall he's a figure capable of giving the right satisfaction. The Roman Empire in 4K Total War: Rome Remastered, the world map We close with the enormous and commendable work done with regard to graphics. Total War: Rome isn't quite at the same level as the recent chapters, yet the improvements made to textures, lighting, character models and buildings are undoubtedly very valid. In addition, and this was not at all obvious, the developers differentiate the soldiers of a unit so that each one looks different from the one next to it - a characteristic of the more recent games within the series and we greatly appreciated. it is doubtful that, while not deviating strongly from the original, this remaster has been well made and can be considered the best way to enjoy a great classic in 2021: however, if you are not convinced of these changes, you can always go through the options and customize the experience as you want, even doing without the novelties to bring the experience closer to the original one. Or, if you are only partially convinced, it is also possible to intervene on individual aspects to create a sort of middle ground between past and present. In short, there is something to satisfy all palates, allowing anyone to create their own ideal experience.", "date": "2021-04-28", "grade": "8.0"}
