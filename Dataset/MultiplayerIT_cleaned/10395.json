With this second chapter, which brings with it the expectations of more than twelve million people, the American software house has decided not to risk too much, rather to risk very little for the single player part and at the same time heavily refresh the multiplayer sector, making it if possible even more frenetic and explosive. This choice makes Infinity Ward's true goal increasingly clear, to make Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 the most played title of all time on world servers. Never like now so the single part is just little more than a good appetizer for the real main course. Change everything, nothing changes The events of the game begin exactly five years after those told in the first chapter, Imran Zakhaev from dead became the hero of the new warlike, authoritarian and ultra-nationalist Russia, within the new order the unscrupulous terrorist Makarov was able to thrive, more dangerous by bin Laden. To control it, Task Force 141 was formed, which brings together the best of the world's special troops, including the SAS. Without revealing too much of the story, including twists and turns, suffice it to say that the action follows the evolution of events by taking us around the world, between Afghanistan, Brazil, Moscow, the Caucasus and the United States itself. As in the first episode, the domino effect of our actions is told to us in short flashes, conversations, news reports and schemes between one mission and another, but this time everything seems less intelligible, more schematic. In short, they worked by subtraction, everything revolves around the said / unsaid and this certainly does not help to raise the quality of the narration, which represented an excellence of the first chapter. Although the boundary between good guys and bad guys is completely blurred, thus going to resolve the excessively Manichean division of the first Modern Warfare, the emotional impact of certain events, indeed of certain epochal upheavals that occur later in the game, is less strong, leaving the rather cold player, finding himself in the middle of the battle without the necessary outline of emotional preparation for it. It's a shame because some scenes, some missions are really strong, decidedly adult and morally unsettling, they are faced as if they were simple maps for their own sake. Never before have we regretted the long initial car journey of the first chapter, which immersed us in the story and introduced us to the actors of the game. All of this is missing here. Another criticality of the single player concerns the constant sense of deja vu that one feels while playing. Mind you, not that everything is a repetition of what was played two years ago, the moments in which one is amazed in front of the pyrotechnic choreography staged by Infinity Ward are still very many, but overall the impression is that of playing in some parts ~a film already seen~. The silent sniper infiltration missions are back, the infantry assaults are back with lots of armored vehicles to accompany, and even the ending, without saying anything, follows the last moments of Modern Warfare. But what fortunately remains the same is the pace, the ability of the developers to never get bored, in short, not to create first and second class levels. Except for the first part of the initial act, the game is continuous crescendo, there is never a moment's pause, the pacing, as the Anglo-Saxons say, remains constant above 180 bpm for the whole game. If on the one hand Infinity Ward has dared little, on the other it has greatly improved the internal quality of the narration of the missions: the events follow one another very quickly, the objectives change in the blink of an eye, there are no shortage of sudden detours, it is not simply to get from point a to point b. From this perspective, the developers have (as usual) found the perfect balance between storytelling and gameplay. Speaking instead of objective data, setting aside personal impressions, there are some adjustments loudly requested by users. The total duration has certainly been increased, completing the game requires just over seven hours at a regular level, while the much tougher hardened takes us to play at least eight hours. The gap between these two levels of difficulty is decidedly high as per tradition, but contrary to what happened in the first episode, the situations in which frustration peeps out are drastically lowerori, now reduced to a couple of moments and not to entire levels, in which lowering the difficulty (it is possible to do it at any time) can be the best solution to avoid launching the pad or mouse from the window. The infinite respawn of the enemies has been largely fixed: as per tradition it is not recommended to find a safe point where to stop to clean up the area, but it seems that the waves stop after a while, with the enemies varying their exit points and patterns scripted to follow. The artificial intelligence has not undergone major changes, as the difficulty level increases, the goodness of the opponent's aim increases dramatically, while it seems that the excessive use of grenades is not as excessive as in the past. The greater intelligence in finding cover in narrow spaces remains unchanged, while in larger areas, they seem more prone to suicidal runs in the mouth of our bullets and completely uncovered bursts. Second sun The level design engages us in narrow spaces, such as those of the first favela and the inevitable caves, and in much wider environments, definitely larger than the prototype, which lead to the Boneyard massacre, one of the final levels in which we have to go through an entire valley to reach the coveted extraction point. The development in height of the environments also seems to have increased, as in the aforementioned carioca mission or that of the gulag, while the tunnel effect of the missions is only partially corrected. In short, there isn't much freedom of movement, the road is the same and no detours are allowed, but many times it was possible to try to go around an obstacle rather than charging it head-on. There are many checkpoints and they allow you to never repeat too long portions of a session. They don't get passed a certain event, but they seem to be placed more or less randomly within the level. Hence, trying to vary the route a little, in addition to the tactical utility of the moment, is necessary to safeguard our nerves. The scripting of our comrades in arms is also completely unchanged, who follow us like shadows and who at the end of the fair are for almost all of the time completely detached from the action, given that, by force, the enemies will shoot only and exclusively at we. On a technical level, the engine overhaul of the first episode has given excellent, if not excellent results. The thing that most catches the eye is the greater polygonal mass sent to the screen. Some missions see us engaged in fighting dozens of soldiers, one or more armored vehicles, troop transports, helicopters, all in squares or large parking lots, full of buildings, shops and fleeing civilians. In addition, as if that were not enough, particles, explosions and reflections have certainly benefited from a considerable improvement, the same thing goes for the textures, which only for some sporadic secondary elements degrade qualitatively, remaining however on more than sufficient levels. Among all, the renewed management of the dynamic lights stands out, which gives us some glimpses of great impact, not only from a purely technical point of view, but also from an emotional one. One mission in particular, in complete darkness, unable to use any electronic lighting or tracking equipment, with only the illumination of flashes, mouth flashes and the occasional chemical torches is perhaps the most beautiful thing in the game, capable of making you shiver and immerse the player in the situation as only a few games have been able to do. Another excellence are the animations of our companions and enemies, very many and varied, brand new for example are those relating to the slide to get to the closest cover and blind shooting while running, small things but which denote the attention to detail from the guys at Infinity Ward. Honorable mention instead for the game's arsenal, far too vast almost bordering on dispersive: there's everything, assault rifles, sniper rifles, normal shotguns, repeating and lupara model, ballistic shields, spear grenades, rpg, javelin, stinger, various types of machine guns, light, heavy and compact and even remote turrets and the hyper gratifying Predator that takes the place of the AC 130, all embellished by many types of applied optics. He can't wait to try them, after having obviously unlocked them, in multiplayer games! Xbox 360 goals The 50 achievements reward the player with 1000 points. The achievements are all related to the single player mode and special operations. They are obtained simply by progressing in the game, unlocking the various spec ops tiers or by satisfying some particular conditions such as killing a certain amount of enemies in akimbo mode, killing 7 hens in 10 seconds in the favela or much simplercarefully taking out the opponents with the means, the riot shield, or using the various attachments available. We are not alone Once the single player is over, the game finally allows us to try the Spec Ops, with which it is possible to play cooperatively with a friend, both locally via split screen or online, in portions of levels with mechanics that closely resemble the horde mode of Gears of War. The twenty-five ops are quite varied and range from simple sieges in confined spaces to others in which it is necessary to move continuously in much larger ~arenas~, making use of all the kindly available weapons, including turrets and Predators, managing cooperation in very intelligent way, in other shots directly from Modern Warfare in which you are immersed in the radioactive lands of Chernobyl in counter sniping operations, or in which in the skies aboard the flying gunship you have to cover our companion on the ground. More generally, the challenge rate of these missions is very high, either because they are intrinsically very demanding (the various waves are more substantial and lethal from time to time), or because to reach the necessary amount of stars to play the last blocks of missions you basically need to up the difficulty level, and as we all know ad hardened is very hard to bring home the skin. If we then want to disconnect at least after the efforts made so far, the best thing is to tackle the snowmobile races taken from the end of the ~mountaineering~ mission shown several times, structured in check points as in Out Run, fun and very fast, but one wonders what they have to do with the Modern Warfare series. Fireworks If the single player works, but adds nothing to what we saw two years ago and the spec ops only partially satisfy our desire to play Modern Warfare cooperatively, it is in the multiplayer that the game finds its definitive consecration. That courage, that desire to innovate that was somewhat lacking in the solo part, here shines in all its power. There are many news. There are five default classes, among these the overwatch, armed with a light squad machine gun and bazooka and the riot control, equipped with a machine gun and ballistic shield, stand out. The others are the grenadier, with an assault rifle, the first recon with a compact machine gun and the sniper who immediately brings the Barret as a dowry. To this is added the possibility of creating one's own class: it is now possible to carry two ~long~ weapons. Not only pistols, but also shotguns, rocket launchers and machine guns. The Excessive Response perk is therefore no longer needed to increase one's firepower. From the start you are a killing machine, but at the same time the ammunition is reduced, so you need to be very precise and concentrate in small and lethal bursts. More than the new perks, the real novelties are the unpublished death streaks and killstreaks. The deathstreaks are passive skills that are activated after a certain number of deaths suffered, the first two are copycat, or the ability to steal before respawn the class of whoever killed us and painkiller, a temporary bonus to energy at the time of rebirth. The killstreaks are nothing more than aerial supports, but this time they are very many, around 15, and are unlocked as the level is acquired. We go from the UAV, to the first-person driving of the helicopters and the C130, passing through the Predator missiles up to the tactical nuclear bomb which is obtained after 25 consecutive kills. Interesting is the fact that it is possible to choose which of the unlocked ones to use (always for a maximum of three anyway), in fact the best players can only implement the most powerful ones that require longer killing streaks, and leave out the starting ones. Still speaking of weapons, it should be noted the exponential increase in the applicable attachments, various types of optics, red dot, holographic, Acog, thermal, heartbeat detectors, shotguns, akimbo (or two machine guns) and much more, all this allows you to customize your gaming experience to the max, finally giving meaning to all those weapons that are on the ground in the single player. Even the perks have undergone a general revamping, first of all they are of two types, the normal ones and the pro ones, an evolution of the standard ones. The latter are activated upon reaching a particular level or upon satisfying particular requirements. They have very varied effects, not always related to their ~father~: for example, stopping power pro guarantees greater damage against opposing killstreaks, while hardline pro which normally guarantees one less death to activate a death streak, in the pro version it subtracts a killing for one kilo", "date": "2009-11-10", "grade": "8.9"}
