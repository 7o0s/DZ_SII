{"name": "Tennis World Tour: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/200420-tennis-world-tour-tennis-world-tour-la-recensione.html", "text": "Tennis World Tour, developed by Breakpoint Studio and produced by Bigben Interactive, was released still incomplete. Even if it hadn't been officially declared (an improved and corrected version will arrive in 2019, and a new chapter in 2020/21) it would still have been evident from some almost amateurish animations, but above all from a rather worrying lack of content, starting from the online mode , which will be added in a few days, in theory to coincide with the release of the game on PC and Switch (June 12/19). It is not for this however, and we start this article directly from the salient point, that we consider it an insufficient tennis simulation. As anyone of you who has seen matches on television, or even better live, knows very well, there is something magical about professional tennis: the ball seems to be tied to the rackets of the two athletes by an invisible thread, it seems forced to follow a clean and perfect. The best tennis players in the world are able to exchange torpedoes for several seconds, seemingly effortlessly, forcing the ball into a fixed path. It is a kinetic dialogue of disarming beauty, almost a dance. And in reproducing this illusion, as you can also see from the videos around here, Tennis World Tour is quite successful. However, as anyone who has played tennis knows equally well, it is simply - in fact - an illusion. Hitting a ball well is difficult, it depends above all on the correct reading of the opponent's shot, and implies remarkable reflexes, correct positioning of the body and rapid preparation of the forehand/backhand. And this happens every single time, for every single shot of every single rally. What a tennis simulation - in general any tennis game - should do is not stage what we see on television, but give us the feeling that we are performing those acts ourselves. In this, Tennis World Tour proves quite inadequate. Not only the old Top Spin - of which it inherited a small part from the developers - but also the arcade series of Virtua Tennis, or even the caricature games like Mario Tennis, give a much more believable tactile sensation than hitting a ball. Hit the ball In summary, while maintaining a realistic appearance, World Tour Tennis almost makes us more spectators than actors, more directors of the exchange than authors of the same. The shots in theory would be all: topspin (circle), then rotation from bottom to top, backspin (X), top to bottom, and flat shot (square). To these are added the lob (with the triangle), the shot to be dosed with care (R2), and the short ball (a combination of keys, square plus L1). Every shot has to be loaded, and the more you load it - and the more time you have to do it - the stronger it comes from the string bed. Naturally, the more energetic the blow, the more it risks coming out. The service works similarly, but is much less intuitive. There is no throw/hit double-tap. One of the three main buttons can be pressed individually - to obtain a flat, kicked (high rebound) or cut, sliced serve respectively - and this generates a safe, slow service, but which hardly ends up out. On the contrary, to hit harder and take hold of the rally from the very beginning, you have to hold down one of the three buttons, release it only when the ball is at the top of its course in the air, and at the same time - without exaggerate - direct it towards a corner. It's hard, way too hard compared to the rest of the executions, to get a winning serve; and this even if you lead Federer or Kyrgios. Both because the setting chosen by Breakpoint Studio is not very intuitive, and because answering it is really too simple. And here we come to the main problem, the one that generates the feeling described at the beginning of the paragraph: the exchange is too automated. The player gives the impression that he knows where to go by himself, and when the shot starts to load he keeps running. This makes ~sticks,~ or weak shots, very rare indeed. So the winners decrease, and the very ability to sensibly command the exchange. Furthermore, precisely by virtue of the fact that the tennis player proceeds with his movements, sometimes he starts to direct the shot - always with the left stick - and ends up moving the athlete away from the ball. How many times in Virtua/Mario Tennis (let's forget Top Spin) have you positioned yourself badly, and the tennis player has blocked his shot in order to reach the ball? Well, that's a very rare occurrence here. Even without pressing any key, the player - moved in the right direction - tries to hit the ball by himself. And he always takes it, even if he sends it against the network. How to writeevamo, we feel more directors of the game than actors. As Andreotti said, paraphrasing Pius XI, it is a sin to think badly, but we often guess ourselves: these excessive automations could simply be wicked, or they could be prodromal to a future mobile conversion. The important thing is to be Roger Without a doubt, the developers of Tennis World Tour have done everything possible to make their creation the best tennis simulation of 2018, in contrast to AO Tennis. At least in appearance and sponsorship, they have succeeded. This title lacks three valuable pieces such as Nadal (AO Tennis testimonial, in fact), Murray and Djokovic (the advantage of having them was probably less than the expense), but boasts the main star of the tennis firmament, that is Roger Federer. Although it is annoying not being able to recreate the historic Federer-Nadal duel, in addition to the Swiss there was a careful selection of athletes who, despite presenting a significant imbalance in favor of males, is certainly satisfying. In addition to the elegant Wawrinka, Gasquet and Dimitrov (all with one-handed backhands), almost all the most promising young players on the circuit are present, from Kyrgios to Zverev, passing through Tsitsipas, Tiafoe and Fritz, as well as the Italian Fognini (and others ). As anticipated, there are only five WTA athletes, namely Muguruza, Kerber, Wozniacki, Keys and Bouchard. The animations of the game are not perfect: the tennis players often seem to skate on the playing field, sometimes they have robotic movements, in other cases they send the ball back to the sender without actually touching it (this is perhaps the most annoying flaw). Although not excellent in general, it must be said however that, especially in the main players, they are well characterized: Federer's serve resembles the real one, as well as his movements between one point and another. Kyrgios plays with two hands, has his personal grounded forehand, Wawrinka his overbearing serve, Gasquet his backhand. The two paid downloadable tennis players are also very well done, namely the legends McEnroe (in the final game left-handed, fortunately, despite being right-handed in the preview) and Agassi (from the mid-90s). As expected, we talk more about animations than about game tactics, since exchanges are very automated, they tend to look alike even between very different tennis players. From clubhouse to Wimbledon We have already mentioned that online is not - yet - available, which by now represents an indispensable section for every competitive game. We had not yet said however that not even double was entered, and this is a rather incomprehensible lack. In essence, in addition to the exhibitions, the only truly structured mode is the one linked to the Career. In this context, a tennis player is created through an editor, choosing clothes and technical characteristics (left-handed/right-handed, one-handed or two-handed backhand), as well as animations and somatic features (only a dozen faces inserted). Once the nationality and the name have been decided, it's time to start your climb to success, which starts from the end of the top 100. Through training, exhibitions, signings and tournaments, you must gradually improve your ranking, adding skills to the character and improving its stats. Winning brings experience and money: with the first one develops the talents of one's alter ego, with money instead one buys better materials and obtains the services of coaches and athletic trainers. Tennis activity, as in reality, is marked by the passing of the months: in spring you play on clay, in summer on grass, at the end - and beginning - of the year on hard courts. In each period, you can choose whether to dedicate yourself to improving your conditions (by training) or your ranking (by playing, and possibly winning, tournaments). Although the difference between the various terrains is of little importance from a game point of view, the fields, as in general the whole visual aspect, are made discreetly: they are not the real tournaments, but they almost always closely resemble them. Among the slams it is easy to recognize Wimbledon and the Australian Open, among the masters 1000 Miami (to name a few). Rarely are there completely invented competitions, such as our Colosseum which, being indoors and on concrete, has nothing to do with the Internazionali d'Italia. If the visual aspect is among the best parts of the game, the technical commentary is among the most embarrassing: the Italian voice should be that of Paolo Bertolucci, former tennis player and Sky commentator, but the sentences he says are exaggerated and repetitive, and related to the game action.", "date": "2018-06-07", "grade": "5.0"}
