{"name": "Saints Row", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saints-row-recensione-reboot.html", "text": "Saints Row is a strange series, albeit a cult of the 2000s. Born as a response to GTA, the Volition saga has seen ups and downs, between a couple of really interesting initial chapters and an increasingly rampant paucity over time. Everything seemed over several years ago now, but the announcement of the reboot of the series arrived like a bolt from the blue. New Saints, new roads, new companions and new enemies. It certainly cannot be said that everything went splendidly, but it is clear that the spirit of the series has remained true to itself. For better or for worse. If you are still not sure about the purchase and want to understand the value of the experience, read our review of the Saints Row reboot. The American (criminal) dream Saints Row - the editor is really deep Santo Ileso is the amusement park of this new chapter. A city that calls out to Nevada and Las Vegas. The Saints Row campaign unfolds over dozens and dozens of missions, of always different durations and carried out with a fair variety of situations. After passing a simple editor, but also capable of giving great depth, we get to know our group of inept roommates. Paying the rent now seems almost a chimera and what better way than to make ends meet between a robbery at a market and a pharmacy? After a series of good coups that went well, our brave men decide to found their own criminal interior of an old disused church, with more than a few references to works such as Fight Club. From here an abundant ten hours of narration unfold, seasoned with the usual absurdity so dear to the series. Between live role-playing games, searches for typical Happy Meal gadgets and a couple of twists that fail to keep the player's attention high. And this is probably the biggest problem of this reboot: it never really tries to take a leap forward, remaining anchored to narrative and gameplay logics that make it attractive only to those who feel the need for a light experience, but damn anachronistic. Welcome 2001 Saints Row - the merry bunch We come to the gist of the video game: the gameplay. Anyone familiar with Saints Row should be more than ready for the experience this reboot can offer. However, the objective of this type of operation is also to innovate, re-imagine and attract a portion of users who could misunderstand the presence of a numbered chapter. Far be it from us to want to play bigots or not understand the will and the target audience, but it is clear that Volition's work has remained anchored to outdated dictates twenty years ago, exactly like its predecessors. The main feeling that is perceived by playing Saints Row is that of a product that wants to look much more like GTA III than the fifth chapter, despite the technological advancement that the medium has given us in recent times. Unfortunately, a whole series of anachronistic design choices stigmatize it, leaving it there in the club of little more than enough titles, with all due respect to those who expected a real step forward for the series. All activities, whether main or secondary, are managed through the equally classic screen cell phone, which keeps the routes on the map, it allows us to manage our earnings, to find the most wanted people in the city and to contact the list of people who over the course of the hours will approach the rise to power of the Saints. Basically nothing new under the sun, but it is true that what works does not necessarily need to be changed and in this sense Volition has hit the mark. Saints Row - vehicle customization The experience is the simplest one can expect from an open world free roaming like Saints Row, including the lightness in the control system of one's alter ego, as well as the driving model - which however experiences some not exciting peaks - or of the shooting system. Shooting in Saints Row cannot be said to be fulfilling. The aiming is imprecise, the weapons have almost no weight and, even worse, there is no valid reason for the presence of enemies that do not die from headshots, like an RPG or a looter shooter at The Division. We talked about secondary activities and, as it was perhaps reasonable to expect, it is precisely there that Saints Row offers the greatest joys. Healthy and pure unpretentious fun and without attention to detail, with the sole purpose of putting the brain switch to ~off~ for a few hours and forgetting about design problems, technical and gameplay backwardness, to find yourself aloneliving that idea of ~juggling~ that was so dear to us even in the media speaking in the first decade of the 2000s. Saints Row - one of the factions Obviously the Saints would not be such if they did not expand their empire and therefore a sort of war board comes to our aid which allows you to invest the dirty money earned in the construction of new structures scattered around the city. Increasing control of Santo Ileso means earning much more money, which can then be spent on equipment, machine modifications and all those amenities that fill the hour meter. However, not everything is linked to money and the presence of a sort of experience level, combined with some challenges to be completed with progress, allow you to unlock specific skills such as increasing life points or choosing a series of advantages to apply in special slots that must also be bought with hard cash. To top it all off there is also the presence of a coop mode complete with matchmaking, which however we have not had the opportunity to test due to a repeated problem with the servers, probably linked only and solely to our test in advance of the release of the game. However, considering the presence of exploration limits that are far too restrictive during the missions, with on-screen countdowns that ~threaten~ the player to get back on the right path as quickly as possible, we imagine that the freedom of approach is practically not changed in any way. Lazy, but straight to the point Saints Row - fly, oh oh Volition's approach to this reboot immediately highlighted the desire to make the game more realistic in tone and proportions. Within the limits of the budget available to them, they have also succeeded discreetly in their intent, but without ever giving the impression of holding a jewel in their hands. The character models, the almost no variety in the opponents - divided as they are into a handful of repeated categories for each faction - and the little more than enough animations, collide with a more than pleasant city. The development team's choice not to create a gigantic map, but to limit everything to a handful of districts that can be reached in a few minutes by road vehicle or even less by flying with a helicopter, is a clear sign of the scale of the production and of awareness of one's means. It doesn't go much better when analyzing the artificial intelligence of enemies and supporting characters, with routines that practically never surprise the player, except for a few bugs here and there. Compared to the first tests it is clear that the cleaning work has been important, but also that the dirt is there, evident and tangible, difficult to eliminate completely, but impossible to hide even from the most attentive eyes. Discreetly dubbed in English - subtitled in Italian - albeit with a whole series of excesses that could make some turn up their noses, the reboot of Saints Row encloses the whole sense of the game itself in its contained dimensions.", "date": "2022-08-22", "grade": "7.2"}
