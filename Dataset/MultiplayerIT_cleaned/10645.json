{"name": "Thumper Pocket Edition+", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/thumper-pocket-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Apple Arcade has recently been pursuing an interesting strategy: in addition to the productions that make their debut on the subscription platform in an exclusive time period, the catalog is also enriched by re-editions of premium titles already available on the App Store, such as Thumper Pocket Edition. game developed by Drool, a team made up of former Harmonix employees, is presented in this case with a refined version, devoid of the technical uncertainties of the mobile debut and enriched by support for Bluetooth controllers, which remedy the limitations of touch commands during more challenging sequences. What is the result of these precautions? Let's find out in the Thumper Pocket Edition+ review. Gameplay Thumper Pocked Edition+, one of the first sequences of the campaign Immersed in a sort of abstract space scenario, in command of a metal beetle that runs very fast on an apparently infinite path, our goal in Thumper Pocket Edition + is to carry out a series of very rapid maneuvers trying to coordinate eye, ear and hand to respond as promptly as possible to what happens on the screen. In a manner corresponding to the synthetic rhythms that accompany us in this unusual experience, we will therefore have to touch the touch screen, hold it down and swipe right, left or up depending on the situation , with only two consecutive failure possibilities: if we waste both, we'll have to start over from the last checkpoint with frustration around the corner. A short tutorial introduces us to the game's controls, after which the unusual formula developed by the developers manifests itself in all its ruthlessness: curves that are announced only for an instant, ~notes~ to be intercepted at the thousandth, lanes to be changed on the fly and boss fights to memorize in detail so that everything doesn't turn into a long trial & error session. An eventuality that is largely inevitable. In short, we are not talking about a relaxing game; far from it: to complete the nine levels that make up the Thumper Pocket Edition + campaign you have to really commit, so much so that there are moments in which it seems to be in front of an artificially accelerated video and the touch controls prove to be inadequate almost immediately. Fortunately, as mentioned, you can fall back on the controller and take advantage of its precision to obtain better results. Technical realization Thumper Pocket Edition+, one of the ~notes~ along the approaching route If there is one aspect of Thumper Pocket Edition+ that fears few comparisons with the original Thumper (here the review) it is precisely the technical realization, which, net of less sophisticated effects, practically does not give up any of the psychedelic solutions and very fast sequences that characterize the PC and console versions of the game, with the added possibility of freely using the landscape or portrait view. The graphics literally shoot at 60 fps, without ever an uncertainty on the iPhone 12 Pro and with the possibility of doubling the frame rate when using an Apple device with a 120Hz refresh rate. The psychedelic colors and design go hand in hand with a highly inspiring and immersive soundscape that requires the use of a pair of headphones or earphones (not wireless, worth a latency incompatible with the gameplay) to be fully enjoyed.", "date": "2021-10-09", "grade": "8.0"}
