Repeating the success of Black Ops of friends/rivals Treyarch and putting an end to one of the trilogies that have most marked the gaming world in recent times, all with a very different team compared to that of the beginning, but which thanks to the graft in the running of Sledgehammer Games (and with the collaboration of Raven Software) seems to have found a natural substitute for the genius of West and Zampella, the bosses who left the American software house in 2010 due to ~misunderstandings~, complete with a long judicial dispute to complicate the things. Now that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is finally in stores, we can without a shadow of a doubt say that the work done by the developers is respectable, much better than the second chapter, able to offer a game offer which, while fitting in the tradition of the series, it manages to put together, as we usually say, quality and quantity, then taking the luxury of going to distort some of those basic mechanics that have decreed the success of the franchise. Once the disc is inserted, what do we find in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3? The menu is substantial. A campaign between five and six hours long if played on normal (few, but unfortunately in line with today's skimpy average), sixteen Spec Ops and sixteen Survival maps, plus all the multiplayer, playable not only online but also via split screen and system links. An undoubtedly very large package, a sign that the pair of developers at the helm did not limit themselves to doing the so-called homework, but aimed to package a title that could expand what has already been proposed in the previous chapters, in order to face the stiff competition across the board these days. Kill Makarov Many were disappointed by the Modern Warfare 2 campaign. Short, not very intense, with numerous recycled phases and above all plagued by narrative choices that compressed everything into a sequence of unrelated and not very intelligible missions. In short, a half fiasco. In this third chapter we start exactly where we left off: in the moments following Makarov's escape, with the third world war now a reality, so much so that the Russians have now taken the east coast of the United States. The story follows several protagonists on the battlefield, but basically the main events narrate the American counteroffensive in America and Europe, while the revived Soap, together with Price and Nikolai continue their personal war against Makarov around the world: in India , in Africa and again in Europe, with the final missions that will jolt them between the Czech Republic and Siberia. The pace is very fast, the events overlap one another, each with direct consequences both on the gigantic pitched battles in European cities (Paris, Hamburg, Berlin) and on the ~silent~ operations of Task Force 141. In this perspective, the developers they were good at not repeating the mistake made previously, that is, throwing us into battle without a necessary ~preparatory~ narrative outline, with the sole purpose of stunning us thanks to a bombastic staging of modern warfare. However, we are very far from the desire to tell a Black Ops story, there are no cutscenes, there is no time to stop and ~see~ what happens or has happened between one mission and another, and when the twists come they give the impression of not being a mere deus ex machina, but well placed in a plot that ends without too much forcing, closing the circle opened in 2007. The seventeen missions that make up the campaign are as varied as they are memorable. Certainly there is no shortage of ~normal~ phases or moments (especially when spaces shrink and everything becomes a long track within which to shoot pigeon), but more generally the staging and the quality of the scripts literally explode in the larger spaces, where it was possible to put all the usual cinematic mastery of the Infinity Ward guys together with Sledgehammer Games into polygons and textures. And this despite a graphics engine that has now definitely reached its sunset, which does not exalt in terms of detail and effects, but which still manages to make credible phases in which one wonders how it is possible to keep the frame rate anchored to 60 frames, despite everything that happens on the screen. In short, the developers have been good at letting us see (or notice) only what they want, perhaps hiding from view a 2007-branded backdrop which is certainly present, but which is ultimately just background noise. There is really everything, nothing new and original of course, but the impression is that everything has been polished and corrected, iinserting it with the right timing and without overdoing it. There is no long and tedious final mission like the one with the boat of Modern Warfare 2 and the African ~similar favela~ are better made, with a better level design and without an annoying and invasive respawn. Nothing has been invented, there is also a ~disturbing~ part that it is possible to decide to skip in advance, but everything works very well, entertains and fascinates us until the end. Some moments will remain etched, such as the invasion of Hamburg, the taking of the launch codes from the Russian submarine in the bay of New York, the battle under the Eiffel tower or the amazing mission to protect the Russian president in full ~Air Force~ style One~. The list could still be very long, what is most liked is that each mission varies considerably during the same, perhaps stealth part, to go through vehicles, moments with high pyrotechnic content and hasty escapes. All grafted onto a type of gameplay that is what we all know, linear and highly scripted, but which manages in terms of level design to often offer rather open spaces where there is always an alternative way to get to the next checkpoint. We are obviously not talking about open maps to be navigated freely, but the search to move away, albeit in a ~superficial~ way, from the dreaded track to be followed slavishly, which as previously written is present only in some phases, is appreciable. In short, we liked the campaign a lot, perhaps a little too short and easy if played normally, perfectly recognizable in style, totally in keeping with the tradition of the saga, but decidedly better than that of the second chapter: more compact, better narrated and rhythm without annoying ups and downs. Xbox 360 goals Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 rewards the player with 50 objectives for a total of 1000 points. They are earned with the simple progression in the campaign and have a variable value depending on the difficulty level chosen. The Spec Ops give objectives upon the achievement of particular conditions, which are not always easy to implement. Greater satisfactions are obtained by completing the campaign in Hardened and Veteran (100 points) or by reaching the fifteenth wave in each single Survival mission (40 points) or by reaching the maximum number of stars, 48, in the Spec Ops missions (40 points) . Very special operations The game package also consists of sixteen Spec Ops to be played decisively online with a friend, given that you immediately notice that the difficulty is set upwards if you choose ~solo play~, but above all because many are structured so that the two players have different roles and actively cooperate to get to the end of the mission. They are of various types, from the classic stealth one in which you have to kill enemies simultaneously without triggering alarms and at the same time freeing hostages, to the one on moving vehicles, to the one in which a sniper from the roof of a skyscraper must protect his companion Juggernaut on the ground, using both his rifle and the Predator's missiles, up to the London mission in which one has to clean up offices while the other remotely controls armed turrets, being careful not to run into friendly fire. More generally, they take up the setting of the campaign, reinterpreting what was played with interesting reversals of perspective. Exemplary in this sense is the special operation set on the plane of the Russian president. At the same time it is also possible to play the sixteen Survival, which is a kind of cross between the horde mode and Counter-Strike. The mechanics are simple but highly addictive. Between one wave and another (the respawn of the opponents does not start from fixed points) it is possible to spend the money earned with the kills to buy new weapons, upgrades, ammunition, grenades and Kill Streaks, in short, everything necessary to defend against waves gradually more numerous and lethal, complete with helicopters, dogs, explosive soldiers and Juggernauts to complete the list of bad guys who want to kill us. Again, the difficulty level is set upwards: playing with a friend is the best way to get on with the waves. Survival is to all intents and purposes a gym for multiplayer, but the inclusion of the shop expands its ~tactical~ aspect if we can call it that, to encourage cooperation with your partner. For all those who were wondering Spec Ops and Survival do not share the same multiplayer progression system. The more you play and the more weapons you unlock, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the more points and stars you get. If everything worked more than excellentent in Modern Warfare 2, we can say the same now. The missions, with objectives and timed, are absolutely fun and in addition to being well thought out and varied, they are in all respects a valid alternative to the cooperative campaign, which is always missing. From this point of view, the various Spec Ops extrapolated from the single player perfectly capture its spirit and expand it to all intents and purposes, resulting in most of them perhaps even more original and demanding. Sometimes one gets the impression that they are almost ~cut scenes~, obviously not for the success of them, but for choices relating to the general balance. Challenging choices So far the only novelty of the game is the unprecedented Survival mode, with multiplayer, however, many others are added. We have already talked about it in depth on the occasion of the September reveal from CoD XP in Los Angeles, we can briefly say that Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games have completely rethought the distribution of Kill Streaks and the growth system of both the player and the weapons in use . The sum of this real reboot of the typical mechanics of the series has led the title to almost arrive at the inclusion of specific ~classes~, even if it is possible to tweak as always with the free choice of one's alter ego. First of all, the Kill Streaks are activated not only for killings, but also based on the objectives acquired with the system called Point Streak. The more bombs you defuse, the more flags you raise for example, the faster our kill salt counter. This is an effective way to help those who are not professional killers and who prefer a ~slower~ style of play than the hyper-frantic one practiced by most players. The most important thing we are asked before entering the game. In the usual customization menu we can decide between three types of ~assistance~, also called Strike Packages, or Assault, Support and Specialist. The first is fully dedicated to attack actions such as the Predator, the AC-130, precision bombing, the strafing run of a large group of helicopters and much more for a total of fifteen aids (with seventeen maximum kills per the Osprey Gunner). As per practice, with the player's death, the kill count is interrupted. Support on the other hand is dedicated to defense and therefore particularly useful in objective modes. Alongside UAVs and against UAVs we have the bulletproof vest, the SAM launcher, the automatic turret, which can also be controlled remotely, the EMP bomb but also a nice Stealth bombardment. In this case we have a total of twelve assists, with the last one, the Escort Airdrop, which is obtained with eighteen kills. Contrary to Onslaught, the player's death does not stop the killing run, consequently the highest Kill Streaks can be reached even by dying often, precisely for this reason Support is more defensive than offensive. What is certain is that if the team is well-knit, perhaps exploiting all the possibilities of level design, the lethal union between Support and Assault could unbalance the games a little, at least those in which veterans and noobs challenge each other. The many hours played together with European journalists starting from scratch did not show this problem, but it is possible to imagine that the entry into the game already in the shops for some time could exacerbate this criticality, which has always been present in the series. The third, Specialist, removes all assistance, both offensive and defensive, to enable three Perks to increase in kills which are added to the three by default and which remain until the player's death. It wasn't the most used Strike Package, the pyrotechnic charm of big explosions is undeniable, but by testing all twelve perks, nobody gave the idea of creating a sort of invincible ~Jedi class~. There are advantages, perhaps by enabling the new Perks such as those that make us invisible from above or from the various detectors (Blind Eye and Assassin) or the one that enables better aiming from a distance (Marksman), but they seem to be fairly balanced and well integrated in the context of typical Modern Warfare gameplay. The new additions don't stop there. The pair of developers have done well to avoid a Call of Duty that is always the same. In addition to Strike Packages and Point Streak we also find a new weapon progression system. As you level up, new weapons are unlocked, but only by using each individual gun is it possible to unlock optics, reticles and camouflages. In short, nothing is common, each add-on must be taken with the consistency of the game and with the overcoming of the many challenges weapon by weapon. Noteworthy is also the introduction of some real Perks to be activated to increase the effectiveness of the", "date": "2011-11-08", "grade": "9.2"}
