{"name": "Warriors Orochi 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warriors-orochi-2-recensione.html", "text": "Once upon a time Warriors Orochi, born from the mind of the developers Koei as a title that put together the characteristics of the much loved hack 'n slash Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors. The product released about a year ago unfortunately made us regret the originals that appeared in the previous generation of consoles (PlayStation 2 above all) not only due to the fact that the innovations brought were insufficient and the game was yet another clone, but above all because in Koei had failed to take advantage of Microsoft's new hardware. This sequel aims to improve on the above and take better advantage of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2. Story and gameplay The story of Warriors Orochi 2 is basically parallel to that narrated in the first chapter. The setting is historical as always, two different periods are mixed, the Chinese Three Kingdoms and the Japanese Sengoku period. In short, and in any case the plot is certainly not one of the strong points of the game, the demonic forces are terrorizing the area and the valiant warriors of the two peoples unite to destroy the evil. The difference is that in this case Orochi (the real emperor of evil) we do not meet him in almost the entire adventure since he was defeated during the previous episode. For those unfamiliar with the two series from which this new franchise kicks off, it is fair to point out that these are two titles that base their fortune on being set as a scrolling fighting game with some RPG elements. Warriors Orochi 2 turns out to be just like all previous hack 'n slash by Koei, with the inclusion of the ability to switch between three different characters in real time on the battlefield. It is certainly not new since Warriors Orochi foresaw the same opportunity. Once the team has been created, choosing from more than 90 characters, we will be able to start the real story which presents some alternative paths, however, guided by a common thread consisting of the main events. The plot includes 5 different plots, one for each of the Three Chinese Kingdoms, one for the Japanese Samurai and one on Orochi which is also the prequel to the previous episode. As mentioned, the gameplay offers nothing new, our team moves from one area of the battlefield to another, with our hero grappling with countless opponents and multiple clashes that usually lead to the boss who controls the territory. Once an army and its general have been defeated, you take possession of the area and then immediately move on to the conquest of the next one. During the battles that more than once will see us fight against real hordes of samurai and warriors we will be able to collect and use new weapons, shields, objects and potions. After each fight, our hero will become stronger and stronger and we will be able to make him develop his skills, thus learning new attack hits and new combos. Each character has a number of standard attacks and some special ones that offer a few brief moments of exaltation. A new type of attack will allow us to use all three characters together, but in essence it changes almost nothing and certainly not enough to write it down in the game's merit notes. Result? In addition to the Story mode there are 3 other possibilities: the Dream mode, the Free mode, the Tag Team and the Elimination Mode. In Dream mode we will be able to complete new scenarios different from those of the main adventure. In Free mode we will be able to fight in the unlocked scenarios with any of the over 90 characters available. In the last two, however, the game changes radically, actually becoming a real fighting game. It is now possible to play not only in co-op via split screen but also via Xbox Live and as it is known, playing in company makes everything more beautiful, and this is also the case with Warriors Orochi 2. Technically we are in the presence of a product that is largely insufficient, both the Xbox 360 version and the one dedicated to PlayStation 2 are particularly difficult to digest. We are in the presence of an old graphics engine that even on Xbox 360 clearly slows down during the split screen coop, poorly defined textures, only sufficient light effects and very sparse polygonal models make the overall picture really bland. Artificial intelligence is the one that, in truth, disappoints the most in this new Koei title since the enemy hordes seem paralyzed when they see us coming, waiting exclusively to be mowed down by the blows of our weapons, never presenting a real danger. Also from the point of view of the soundtrack there are no significant new entries, indeed many tracks are a mere reproposition of those of the first episodium. The voice acting is in English and there is no possibility of hearing the original Japanese voices. The new one-on-one Versus mode tries a bit to force the combat system into that of a traditional fighting game with at least questionable results. Xbox 360 - Goals The 1000 points available were divided into 27 goals this time. We will have to finish the game several times to get them all, we will have to complete all 5 different storylines, reach a certain character development, finish Dream mode and Survival mode. It will take time and a lot of patience.", "date": "2008-11-10", "grade": "4.8"}
