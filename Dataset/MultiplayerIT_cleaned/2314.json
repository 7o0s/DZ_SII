The work of Stas Shostak and Alexander Sitnikov presents itself as a soulslike and offers us the hard journey of a samurai in a classic feudal Japan. Unfortunately the Kami have not been generous with this work: here is our review of Katana Kata in the Nintendo Switch version. Katana Kata | Review Katana Kata: a souls-like with only bad ideas Katana Kata is a bad game, maybe even terrible. We don't even want to make you go to the end of this review to tell you that. None of this alleged soulslike went right and in all honesty this statement could be enough for you to decide to ignore it. However, let's try to understand what it is about. As we will soon understand, Katana Kata is a work based on pure gameplay: the narration is only a contextual justification. We are a young samurai, the only student of a master who has left behind a series of apprentices who have become evil. Our task is to leave and eliminate these ~traitors~. The premise is explained through a kind of movie with in-engine graphics with the directorial style of a kid and a fanfiction story writing quality of an eleven year old. You immediately perceive that aftertaste of an amateur work, almost of a listless school project. But let's ignore the narrative side, easily excusable, and see how the gameplay works. As mentioned, Katana Kata is presented by the creators as a soulslike. It is? While admitting that many games today exploit this title lightly, in the case of Katana Kata we believe it is nothing short of misleading. It's a soulslike in the sense that you fight in the third person and lose your progress inexorably. Too bad these aren't the real strengths of a soulslike. Katana Kata takes only the worst of souls-likes The basics of the combat system are all in all simple to understand: we have life points and stamina (~breath~, in this case) which is consumed by performing dodges and attacks. The latter are divided into strike from above and strike from below and can be used to make a parry (deflection of the enemy weapon) if used with the right timing with an enemy attack coming from the same direction. We then have a healing drink and a whetstone to restore the resistance of the weapon which can break and force us to fight with bare hands until a new weapon is recovered. Finally, there are the charged attacks that deal significant additional damage. On paper the Katana Kata system is not original but it is potentially enjoyable if well implemented. It is not. Let's ignore the frame rate for a moment, which on Nintendo Switch does not reach 30 FPS. We ignore the fact that the control system is lumbering and the sword-enemy interactions are terrible. We ignore the fact that character and enemy stats seem completely random, with common opponents being able to take 99.9% of your life points in one hit. We ignore the fact that the balance between healing and damage taken makes drinks useless. Katana Kata is absolutely unplayable also and above all for two design choices that are the result of technical incapacity or laziness or worrying ignorance. The camera, first of all. The distance is fixed but the environments are small: obviously this would cause vision blocking in most areas. The solution? Activate one of the worst transparency of polygons ever seen. It looks like the game is spraying out the polygons with Paint spray - that's the best way to get the idea. Not only is it terrible to look at, but it is also summarily applied to polygons beyond the character, practically creating graphics holes within a certain radius of our samurai. Let's move on to the second problem. The lock on system makes no sense. We can increase and decrease an area of ~attention~ of our samurai, who will automatically target the closest enemy, even those who are behind a wall and cannot be reached in any way. If there are more enemies, however, we will not be able to switch from one to the other in any way, but only activate / deactivate the lock on: playing without it, however, is impossible. The management of the ~attention~ area has no strategic applications and, as soon as we understand how it works, we will maximize it so as not to risk losing the lock as soon as we dodge too many away from the enemy. Let's add that bugs tend in some areas to make all polygons and textures disappear. Trying to hit an invisible enemy with an invisible character in an invisible room isn't exactly what you'd expect from a soulslike. The levels that make up the game are micro-areas with a row of rooms filled with enemies. As mentioned, the balance of stats is completely nonsensical and the only solution is to do enough damage to eliminate enemies in one or two hits. Starting a real duel, trying to parry or dodge + attack combo is always the worst choice. Katana Kata: The combat system doesn't work Then we come to another problem. After the first area (a not particularly complex undertaking, net of the technical problems and the senselessness of the lock-on and camera system), we will have leveled up at least three or four times and we will have increased our statistics (life, attack, speed of attack and dodge, stamina). At that point the experience points needed to level up will grow exponentially. We will therefore find ourselves fighting some enemies, obtaining a handful of PE, succumbing after having suffered two hits. At this juncture, the game allows us to have a second chance, facing a duel against a samurai who is practically our copy (he has our weapon and we also believe our statistics). In case of defeat, we permanently lose weapon and experience points, in case of victory we are brought back to the beginning of the level with regenerated life (but enemies reappear too). The solution is therefore to enter this death and resurrection loop to level up and realize that in the end little has changed, always hoping not to die against our clone, which can easily happen given the woody commands. Graphically, the title is also horrible, with a polygonal mass that you can count on the fingers of one hand. The game is literally annoying to the eyes due to a strange filter that we assume is supposed to reproduce an old film ~film effect~. Then there are whole environmental elements that appear at low resolution until we're a few steps away - not that they improve much after they've fully loaded.", "date": "2021-03-05", "grade": "4.0"}
