The goal that the developers have set themselves was to create an adventure capable of putting together a thick narrative, a multifaceted structure and a frenetic and spectacular combat system. Well, we can say with great confidence that Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore has achieved this goal, proving to be one of the best space shooters ever to appear on the App Store and (soon) Google Play, as well as a product capable of attracting the attention of fans of science fiction. Having abandoned the premium approach in favor of the now almost mandatory freemium model, the gaming experience presents the inevitable stakes regarding the speed of progression and access to all possible ships and weapons; however it must be recognized that the developers have been able to find sensible solutions, avoiding ~action points~ and such expedients to allow us to play for as long as we want, trying our hand at the most varied situations, whether they are main or secondary objectives. In the role of an inexperienced pilot, adrift in space following an attack, we are rescued by two ships working for a huge space station and there we meet officers who are in charge of offering various types of services. When the allied fleet is almost completely wiped out, however, our role becomes clear: by exploring the space sectors and completing numerous missions we will have to recover the data that will lead us to those responsible for the attack. Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore offers a particularly rich, robust and immersive experience Molasses galaxy The first stages of Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore are used as a tutorial with respect to the control system and the upgrade system, as well as the general structure of the missions. The space station from which we start is a hub from which to access various scenarios that are unlocked gradually and which must be explored in depth in search of extras or hidden enemies. Usually our task consists in escorting commercial ships defending them from the attack of pirates, but there are also other types of missions, for example the purely exploratory ones in which we are accompanied by a pod that signals the presence of objects to be recovered nearby. The interface that characterizes the upgrades is not very clear and it would probably have been possible to simplify it, however what matters is that with the materials and credits collected we will be able not only to upgrade our ship in a generic way (or buy a new one, but there you enter the terrain of freemium mechanisms) but also the weapons unlocked up to that moment, to be alternated in the middle of the action. The flight performance is good and the touch controls promptly indulge our wishes, allowing us to turn quickly to aim at any enemies (the fire is activated automatically when they are in the crosshairs), accelerate, slow down and perform evasive maneuvers using gestures. In truth, there is not much ~body~ in the frenetic dogfights that Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore offers from the first minutes, so this remains the limit of the Fishlabs production. A similar argument can be made for the technical realization, which moves between ups and downs: on the one hand it offers suggestive and rather vast spatial landscapes, on the other it sometimes indulges in some naivety.", "date": "2016-12-12", "grade": "8.5"}
