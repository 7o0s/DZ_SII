Let's talk about the Spiders action role-playing game, a fantasy adventure that we really appreciated (certainly more than the previous works of the French developers) and which is now reproducing in an Xbox Series X|S and PS5 version (the latter the one from us proven) via a free upgrade. Spiders has also released a Gold Edition (both on old gen and current gen), which is a complete version of the game that includes a DLC, The De Vespe Conspiracy, the latter also available for single purchase. So here is our review of GreedFall in the PS5 version and the DLC The De Vespe Conspiracy. Where were we GreedFall - a great action RPG Before launching into the analysis of the PS5 version of GreedFall and the DLC, let's do a quick summary of the base game. GreedFall, as mentioned, is an action RPG. We are the Legate De Sardet, cousin of Constantin, new governor of New Serene, city of the Congregation of Merchants of Teer Fradee, a distant island disputed by all world powers. The Old World we come from is affected by Malicore, an epidemic for which there is no cure. Our task as Legate will be to assist the new Governor, maintain diplomatic relations with the various factions of the island, create a bond with the natives and discover the cause of Malicore and find a cure. We will have a constantly expanding party on our side, with members from all the factions in the field. Each character has its own story and can influence the dialogues in the most important missions: bringing the island ally with you when you have to talk to one of the local tribes is, for example, an advantage. Each character falls into a fixed class (magic, physical or ranged, with some in between): our Legate, on the other hand, can be evolved freely. The game world is not open world: it is divided into a series of large but always closed and often semi-linear areas. The combat system is in real time, with the possibility of activating a tactical pause to select skills or items to use. For a more in-depth analysis, you can refer to our review of the original Greedfall. From PS4 and PS5 What interests us here is to understand the differences between the PS4 version and the PS5 version, as well as analyze the new DLC (in the next paragraph). GreedFall, we repeat, offers the upgrade to the new console in free format, with the sole exclusion of the PS Plus version. Anyone who has claimed the game only through the Sony subscription will not have access to the PS5 version. But what are the advantages? As typical for operations of this type, the transition to PS5 adds two graphics modes to the game that can be selected at any time from the pause menu. GreedFall offers a Quality mode, which prioritizes resolution up to 4K, and a Performance mode, which instead aims for 60 FPS. In our opinion, the most sensitive leap forward is the second one. GreedFall is a fairly frenetic game and most of the time we will find ourselves running left and right in the maps going from one fight to another. The increase in fluidity is extremely pleasant, while the increase in resolution is minimal and GreedFall doesn't offer particularly detailed graphics: a few more pixels doesn't make much difference. Beyond the performance and resolution changes, the PS5 version increases the loading distance of objects and passers-by. Highlights and shadows are also visible at a greater distance. It's a visible difference, as you can see in the two sample images below, but it doesn't massively change the experience in our opinion. As for the interior, however, there are practically no differences. As you can see from a couple of examples below, we took some screenshots in the same place and at the same time of day with both versions of GreedFall: in terms of visual quality, there are no real differences that the player will notice during a normal session. As far as loadouts are concerned, we tested the PS4 version played on PS5 via backwards compatibility and then repeated the same process with the native PS5 version. We went from around 21 seconds to around 18 seconds in our test. The native version is therefore faster, but this is a minimal difference. We also remember that GreedFall hides the loads in a very clever way: instead of making us wait in front of a screen, the characters are placed in a camp where it is possible to manage your equipment, sell and buy items and change party members, in the meantime the game load the new area in the background. The upgrade to PS5 is therefore minimal and we would have liked a native 4K with 60 FPS (and not an aut aut), but since it is a free addition we can also leave it alone. Gold Edition and The De Vespe Conspiracy The new enemies of The De Vespe Conspiracy However, GreedFall does not offer only the upgrade, but also a new DLC, on sale on both PS4 and PS5 for 6.99 euros, or included in the Gold Edition, also on sale on both PS4 and PS5. The Gold Edition is basically the base game plus DLC and nothing else. The De Vespe Conspiracy is a small additional mission, which is inserted in the middle of the game and is activated through a letter that we can retrieve in any of the game's fast travel camps. The DLC adds a new, actually uninteresting area. It is a wooded area with a rocky section created by a lava flow that occurred many years earlier. Stylistically it is pleasant and consistent with the rest of the game, but it doesn't offer anything particular or unique, even in terms of gameplay: in fact, there is a single cave that is actually a corridor that can be explored in 30 seconds, not a real dungeon. This area is home to a new type of enemy, leonine creatures present in four types (basic, fast, powerful and poisonous version) that add nothing different to all the others already present in the game. For the rest, we will have to face classic humans, identical to those we have faced for all 40 hours of play (or more). Sadly, the mission does not offer any bosses: a powerful new Guardian would certainly not have bothered us. The new area also features a handful of new weapons to be found within chests hidden around. Upon completing the storyline, you also get a De Vespe-themed armor set. All the items, however, are in line with what you will have already obtained towards the final stages of the game, if not even worse. GreedFall features many areas made up of forests and little else Even in narrative terms we cannot declare ourselves satisfied. The De Vespe Conspiracy is in fact a mission like many others. Everything revolves around the daughter of the De Vespes, a young widow who arrives on the island with a marriage contract which makes her the wife of Constantine and therefore co-governor of the city of the Congregation of Merchants. However, the De Vespes are one of our rival family and clearly something does not add up. We won't give spoilers, but we can say that the mission is solved in a couple of hours, making us go back and forth between the cities of the other factions in search of secrets and spies. The young De Vespe is an interesting character at first glance, but she doesn't evolve in any way and the whole story unwinds at too high a speed. There's not even time to worry about what's happening that we've already solved the situation: a couple of fights here and there, collecting some evidence and everything is resolved in a rather anti-climatic way. The real problem with The De Vespe Conspiracy is that it is a mission like many others: well constructed and linked to the rest of the game plot, but once completed it gets lost in the pile and is forgotten. Returning to GreedFall for just this couple of hours of play doesn't make much sense. We therefore advise against the single purchase and, consequently, the Gold Edition (whose only novelty is the DLC). It makes much more sense to find a discounted standard PS4 version of the game and get the free PS5 upgrade; unless you want to support the developers (who are working on a new game, Steelrising) with a full price purchase, of course.", "date": "2021-07-05", "grade": "8.0"}
