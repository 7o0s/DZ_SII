{"name": "Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness-2.html", "text": "The Angel of Darkness Lara didn't die, she miraculously escaped the collapse of the Pyramid of Cheops and she took a well-deserved rest, far from conspiracies, intrigues and narrowly avoided ends of the world. Now she has received a call from her friend and mentor Werner, the same one who had seen her apparently die, shortly after being freed from Anubis' possession, and she immediately rushed to him, to find him in a state of panic and terror as he had never seen it. And he doesn't have time to ask for explanations that the old archaeologist is killed by a barrage of bullets: Lara, in a confused state, is accused of the murder and the game begins with her desperate escape from the scene of the crime and the discovery of the Obscura Paintings, mysterious paintings from the 18th century linked to the Esoteric Arts... As is clear, the plot of The Angel of Darkness is a pleasant common thread that links the levels of the game, intricate enough to interest the spectator/player, elaborated around to a character, Lara Croft, who abandons the role of a mere sex bomb to take on more defined contours and a more interesting background than the one provided by the film with Jolie. The Dark Game If this is a nightmare, I want to wake up. This is not Tomb Raider. This is a third-person adventure that apes the mechanics of Tomb Raider, enriching it, so to speak, with more than questionable ideas. Lara Croft gains ~experience~ by performing certain tasks: she moves a boulder and her legs get stronger, allowing her to jump farther. His arms become stronger by hanging from ledges. The sadness for this abstruse leveling-up increases by experiencing it. But not only of this is made The Angel of Darkness. Oh no. The Angel of Darkness is characterized by that entertainment that made the history of the saga. Lara Croft moves in polygonal environments of considerable size and variety, solves puzzles (all the same) looking for keys and acting on levers and buttons, kills enemies with gunshots or karate (an absolute novelty in the series). The problem is not so much doing it, the problem is HOW to do it. The control system in The Angel of Darkness is frustrating, unmanageable, unsustainable: controlling Lara is torture, dying trying is pure tragedy. Eidos has well thought of replacing the already cumbersome movement system based on ~boxes~ and ~steps~ with a freer one that forces the player to make absurd rotations of the stick to orient Miss Croft and to walk continuously to avoid falling into ravines and chasms . If in the prequels jumping, somersaulting and floating from one polygon to another was satisfying and liberating, here it is impossible: the risk of going Game Over is very high for a matter of millimeters. And in combat, things are no better. The pointing system is the same as in the first five episodes, automatic and intuitive, but if the movement system is so unmanageable as to make any action difficult, it follows that the combat system itself pays the price: it is practically impossible to juggle multiple Enemies darting around as they fill themselves with lead for Thanksgiving, resulting in a massive headache and reloading your last saved game. What's more, the all-new melee combat feels like a last-minute implementation, haphazard and inconsistent as it is. Nonetheless, The Angel of Darkness presents some nice new features which give the production the little thickness necessary to recover it from the total catastrophe: the presence of a more complex and detailed plot has introduced a vaguely Role Playing component into the play structure which obliges players players to interact with secondary non-player characters in search of information or, alternatively, to solve quests that involve their support. This addition, however trivial and devoid of real depth, gives this Tomb Raider that extra depth that makes it at least superficially different and, in a certain sense, innovative compared to the first five chapters. Unfortunately, however, peeling off this mask of innovation, there is the emergence of now obsolete situations and sequences, made up of timed puzzles, enemies who attack en masse or objects to be found to proceed in the adventure which, however intriguing they may be old times, the game system, buggy and badly implemented, inevitably ruins transforming everything into a repetitive and monotonous frustration. The Dark Game II - Revenge Perhaps it is appropriate to begin the paragraph dedicated to technicalities with the only aspect that, in toto, saves itself from this disastrous panorama: music. Composed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the sound tracks in The Angel of Darkness are of the highest quality, always spot on, pressing, never banal or annoying, divinely accomplished. End of the positives. Among other things, since we are in the acoustic field, I think it is appropriate to point out the almost total absence of sound effects and the mediocrity of the dubbing. As for the visual aspect, well... those who wished for a total restyling and upgrading of the graphics shown through screenshots last year, will find themselves quite disappointed because, in some ways, The Angel of Darkness continues to look like a game of latest generation for PSOne. And that's not a good thing. Lara, although she shows a fairly high polygon count, is angular and woody, texturized just decently (especially as regards the face which, if compared to the polygonal models of the protagonists of Resident Evil Rebirth and Resident Evil Zero or even the Code Veronica, for don't talk about Jack in Silent Hill 2, he makes you smile with embarrassment) and animated at times in a bad way, especially during hand-to-hand combat where he demonstrates the grace of a hippopotamus from the Congo. The enemies fared worse: soldiers, dogs and creatures of all kinds demonstrate approximate modeling and texturing, almost as if they were not part of the same game. The same goes for Kurtis Trent, a mysterious adventurer of which he will take control for some stages, just long enough to transform The Angel of Darkness into a faded copy of Resident Evil. The visual horror doesn't end there: this new Tomb Raider is literally full of graphic bugs, so much so that at times they seem like part of the game itself. Seeing Lara's shadow suspended in mid-air as you climb a ladder, or mimicking a certain Solid Snake by leaning against the wall to sprint through them, finding yourself in the adjacent location or, even worse, in total darkness that forces upon reloading the file, it is certainly not a good show, nor does it contribute to the user's enjoyment, leaving him more perplexed than scandalized. On the other hand (and it is ironic to speak of positive opposites...), the three-dimensional settings demonstrate careful attention to design and modeling, resulting in convincing and pleasant, as in the case of Prague, perhaps the most successful location in the game. Otherwise, you can praise the well-crafted lighting effects but there's little else to prove that DVD is running on a PlayStation2... Comment Let's start from a simple assumption: anyone who complained about the approaching chapters 2, 3 and 5 of the Tomb Raider series of that mystical/archaeological component so dear to Indiana Jones' Spielberg can easily get up and sit down elsewhere, because The Angel of Darkness is the apex of that filing, so much so that at times one wonders if Lara Croft is really an archaeologist or perhaps a special agent of the CIA. Characterized by a decidedly noir plot, The Angel of Darkness would have all the trappings to glue the player to his seat for the approximately fifteen to twenty hours required to complete it, were it not for the fact that the game code literally crashes any expectation. The Angel of Darkness is monotonous, repetitive, even nonsense in certain passages (why should I waste time looking for a key if the door in question is then kicked down in the next cutscene?!), and if the fan can prepare himself psychologically to a situation of stasis that has been repeated since the second episode, he certainly cannot imagine what awaits him on a technical level. The Angel of Darkness is an incomplete game that perhaps deserved a few more months of programming and debugging before being launched on the market in scandalous conditions to say the least. Of course, it is a bizarre coincidence that the second film, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, comes out practically at the same time as the game but this policy could have worked once, certainly not in a 2003 where such commercial operations are found behind every corner... Ultimately, Lara Croft fans and suitors should add a point to the global evaluation, regarding the narrative background and the interest that the story arouses in the player; all the others, those for whom Lara Croft is an indifferent blow-up doll, stay away: the Dark Angel could really claim victims. Pros Nice storyline Nice soundtrack It's still Tomb Raider... Cons ... err, it's still Tomb Raider Unplayable Mediocre graphics Tomb Raider, year 1996: a thirty-year-old archaeologist,Lara Croft, face the mysteries of Atlantis. Tomb Raider II Dagger of Xian, year 1997: Lara Croft challenges a powerful Chinese sect to recover an ancient relic. Tomb Raider III Adventures of Lara Croft, year 1998: Lara Croft is on the trail of the fragments of a mysterious meteorite. Tomb Raider The Last Revelation, year 1999: Lara Croft against Anubis, for the salvation of the world at the cost of her own life. Tomb Raider Chronicles, year 2000: Lara's best friends remember the deceased archaeologist and her adventures. But can she really be dead? Could the simple collapse of a pyramid have killed one of the most important icons of this decade, a character who for better or for worse has upset the fantasies of programmers and the way of understanding video games and, above all, women in video games? Could the story of this Indiana Jones in a skirt, or rather, in shorts, be over? The answer is, of course, no. No for many reasons, but above all because Lara (and especially her sex appeal...) are an invaluable source of earnings. Lara Croft is not dead, therefore, but the video game does, it has been rotting since Tomb Raider II in a stasis caused by the lazy listlessness of a software house that has re-proposed, year after year, apparently more elaborate but totally identical adventures. With The Last Revelation something moves, Lara's adventure takes a step forward, but Chronicles definitively sinks a myth ruined by bussiness. And the poor film, however played by the good and beautiful Angelina Jolie, does not help to improve the fortunes of the series, by now appreciated only by its most ardent fans, who even manage to play the adventures of Lara on Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance, demonstrating a courage and an uncommon masochism. Lara died, therefore, not as a character but as a video game. Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness was kind of his resurrection. Widely anticipated at the very release of PlayStation2 in Europe, The Angel of Darkness promised a real revolution: initially conceived as an episodic adventure, in which the choices made in each episode would influence subsequent installments, the concept was then hijacked in the footsteps of the original series, producing an adventure that is less dispersive and more focused on the narrative plot. The premises were all there. Then the first photos froze the users, showing a mediocre technical realization, backward at the PSOne era, not at all at the levels of the PlayStation2 software. And it's been three years since that first announcement, two since the first photos, one since the first playable demo: now The Angel of Darkness is here.
