{"name": "Infernax", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/infernax-recensione.html", "text": "There are several reasons that justify the widespread return to the 8-bit style in many modern indie productions, which sometimes converge on particularly successful games and are able to make perfect sense of this search for classic stylistic features, as we see in this Infernax review. The titles of the NES era and its surroundings began to expand the medium in new directions, managing to codify some gameplay elements into real genres which then laid the foundations for the entire panorama, without however forgetting that they were essentially games: technically still immature, stylistically primordial but endowed with an imposing charisma and often with a disturbing rate of challenge. Berzerk Studios' work exudes passion and respect for 8-bit action games, so much so that it is not so much a mannered imitation of certain styles of the past, but rather a new game coming directly from the videogame years 80-90 and it is not a trivial matter. The choice of pixelated graphics, the ferocious difficulty and the Castlevania 2-style gameplay are not only used here to tickle the nostalgic cravings of ~hardcore~ players, but they are well-honed and best-used tools to build a solid and engaging 2D action. equipped with a remarkable level of challenge. In this sense, Infernax is in line with few other similar titles: Shovel Knight and Cyber Shadow are perhaps the closest ones, not for nothing both coming from Yacht Club (but from different developers), therefore games that exploit well-established constructs not as a simple trendy stylistic code, but to propose new gameplay perfectly in line with those classic, sanguine and meaningful forms. An epic story of blood Infernax, a screenshot from the game showing an open world As often happens to the most violent action games, Infernax also takes us to an era in which arduous and bloody challenges were the order of the day: the Middle Ages. In this dark fantasy retelling of the historical period in question, Duke Alcedor returns home from the Crusades, tired of the blood and violence on the battlefield, to find himself facing an even more bloody challenge: his country has been overrun by creatures abominable and aggressive, which force him to immediately return to action to save the inhabitants and try to restore a semblance of peace and normality to the world, in which an ancient and terrible evil seems to have found a way to dominate humanity. Not exactly original story, we agree, but it's precisely what you need to know to start hitting around and also justify a quantity of blood and gory scenes - only partially mitigated by the ~ancient~ graphic style - that burst from the first screens. Impossible not to think of Castlevania even when looking at atmospheres and characterization, but there is also a lot of Ninja Gaiden and other action platformers typical of the NES era in this title, which however also manages to insert some elements capable of giving a certain originality to the whole . One of these characteristics are the choices entrusted to the player, which determine moral implications and even partially modify the course of the story, making it reach different endings. Infernax, an image from the game with one of the choices with moral implications We already see one of these moments a few minutes after starting the game when, after a few screens, we are faced with a desperate man asking for help in an evident state of alteration, with the possibility of deciding whether to kill him or help him. The first choice concludes the meeting in a second, but probably leaves a negative impression on the bystanders, while the second has better moral implications, but forces a first, challenging, boss fight. It's just a first example of the choices we'll have to make later, within a narrative structure that's not exactly deep but still capable of giving a certain specific identity to the whole game. Action RPG ~metroidvania~, but not too much Infernax, a screenshot showing an interior Difficult not to use the overused term ~metroidvania~ to describe the gameplay of Infernax, especially for the presence of that typical branched map, which includes backtracking and the opening of new areas, to represent the direct connection with the hybrid genre in question. However, Infernax is more linked to the classic 2D action with RPG elements, for this reason it more closely resembles the first Castlevanias, such as the second and third chapters, to which it also binds for the dark fantasy aesthetics and violence. Armed with mace, shield and (later) spells, Alcedor must make his way fighting among many creatures, jumping between platforms and exploring the surroundings of the starting village, progressively expandingread the game map. The RPG elements emerge in the possibility of making the protagonist evolve by investing experience points and money earned by choosing between the three fundamental stats of strength, magic and vitality or by purchasing new equipment, thus obtaining a few more chances to survive and advance towards new objectives . Infernax, an action scene from the game Difficulty is a characterizing element of Infernax: even simply moving around the map is a challenge of considerable intensity, considering that the protagonist can suffer a very limited amount of damage and the chances of recovering energy are few, with the screen often overrun with sizable enemies and bosses. As tradition dictates, the map is littered with save points but this doesn't make the missions any less challenging, given that every single section is a real skill challenge. To make things easier, the developers have inserted a ~Casual~ mode next to the ~Classic~, which slightly simplifies the game by introducing more frequent saves and the possibility of keeping part of the money and experience gained even after a death, but however, the challenge remains very selective. Style and level design Infernax, a screenshot taken from inside a dungeon The other fundamental element of Infernax, which contributes to building its image as a ~brutal~ action game, is precisely the style adopted, which goes well with the high-profile difficulty. The graphics obviously recall the titles of the NES era and the developers have played well with the new possibilities offered by modern platforms to build a game with a classic look but with a certain aesthetic sense. The sprites therefore seem to have come out of 8-bit, but the richness of the animations betrays the modern era in which they were conceived, however giving rise to a coherent and well-constructed mix. It must also be noted that the high rate of violence present on the screen, between monstrous aberrations, disturbing situations and bloodshed, is somehow counterbalanced by a certain self-deprecating spirit that emerges at times, avoiding that everything is taken too seriously A game of this type is largely based on level design and, even on this aspect, Infernax does not betray expectations. The map is less complex and articulated than those of other pure metroidvanias, also because the protagonist focuses less on the evolution of new skills to open up further paths, but some passages remain linked to the progression of the character above all through the acquisition of new spells and also the split between ~overworld~ and dungeon allows for some variety in scenarios and action. The quests usually require us to reach certain points on the map, allowing us to open new areas to explore, but once these are reached, further sections open up within real dungeons, which usually end with a challenging boss fight . Also in this sense the RPG vein emerges with a certain clarity, helping to enrich the action platform structure which, for the rest, remains quite close to the traditional canons of the genre.", "date": "2022-03-15", "grade": "8.0"}
