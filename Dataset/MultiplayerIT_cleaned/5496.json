In fact, the tenth chapter in the remastered, remixed and ribboned version also arrives on Steam, including the sequel Final Fantasy X-2, all in a convenient download of over 30 GB: those who don't have a fast connection must arm themselves with patience because, like we'll see in the body of the review, it's worth it. After crossing all Sony consoles, Final Fantasy comes to PC in a definitive anthology Lots of stuff But let's clarify a bit: released respectively in 2001 and 2003 for PlayStation 2, the two ~volumes~ of Square Enix's fantasy saga had already been revised and corrected in the release for PlayStation 3 and Vita towards the end of 2013. On that occasion, both had been brought together in a single compilation (at least in the international editions) in which the attention had focused mainly on the technical aspect. The graphics for the home machine had been brought to HD-Ready with anti-aliasing (or Full HD without) and even the cutscenes had been converted from 4:3 to 16:9 format thanks to the work of Chinese software house Virtuos, supervised by the parent company. The textures of the main characters had been updated to make them more defined, and there was also a work of embellishment on the shadows and special effects. From a content point of view, however, there was nothing really striking, given that what would now be called DLC had already been released previously in Japan; however, they have been wisely included in the definitive collection. The most significant innovations basically concern the film in CGI Eternal Calm, which connects Final Fantasy X to X-2, guaranteeing a narrative continuum; then there is the additional level, also for X-2, called Last Mission, a sort of roguelike set in a tower. At the end of the credits there is then the audio-drama Will, that is a dialogue between two unpublished characters, Chuami and Kurgum, which takes place while the artwork of the two episodes scrolls on the screen and which tells us how the world has evolved of Spira one year after the conclusion of the second chapter. It should be highlighted again how the Final Fantasy X-2 remaster is based on the international version of the game, therefore with some options that were not available for the western market at the time of the original publication dated, as mentioned, 2003: we are talking about the Creature Creator that allows to capture non-player characters or monsters and use them within the party, some new outfits and other side missions. Sometimes it's better not to remix Even the soundtrack was the subject of a remix by two of the three main authors: unfortunately the most important one is missing, namely the essential Nobuo Uematsu, and the result was what many had ended up regretting the original one . Fortunately, all 120 tracks from Final Fantasy X have been included for the PC release, so you can switch between soundtracks at any time. That of Final Fantasy X-2 however has not been subject to changes. Last year the PlayStation 4 version arrived which ~theoretically~ should have exploited the greater computational power of the most recent Sony console for what is the definitive edition of this masterpiece. The conditional is however a must because the frame rate, probably one of the most criticized aspects of the ~improved~ versions, had once again remained anchored to the 30 frames per second that characterized the production of the beginning of the millennium, while undergoing a further session from 'beautician had been the secondary characters and some scenarios guilty (or deliberately) neglected in the remaster for PlayStation 3; further improvements thanks to an AA filter finally available also for 1080p and small tweaks also for the cinematic sequences; otherwise there was no other news to highlight. Ten steps to the rise We then come to the present day and the awaited Steam release, which was rumored just over a year ago. It is in fact a conversion of the one for PlayStation 4, with the addition of very small options which, if on the one hand they certainly won't persuade former owners to put their hands on their wallet again, on the other hand they prove to be very attractive for those who have never taken familiarity with Tidus, Rikku and the others, as evidenced by the over 100,000 copies sold in the first week of its launch. The launcher allows you to immediately select which titleor boot, including the aforementioned Eternal Calm and Last Mission extras. Once the game has been launched, you must then choose which soundtrack to use and whether to adopt the standard or the advanced Spherography. This is the characteristic growth system of the characters introduced in Final Fantasy X and unfortunately no longer taken up in the following chapters: in the standard one the development takes place in a more guided way and practically following the natural inspiration of the protagonist, while in the advanced one you can decide to change its specialization. From a technical point of view there are practically no differences with the PlayStation 4 version: obviously the graphics, although restored, are affected by the weight of the years, but the work done by the new textures and by the ~enhanced~ special effects manages to make the title while maintaining system requirements accessible to most users, including those with notebooks with integrated graphics. In fact, even for them there will be no problem in keeping the execution speed anchored to 30 frames per second. Those hoping for the fateful doubling of frames unfortunately have to deal with an engine designed for a system from the early 2000s that is extremely difficult to update: luckily the code seems to be quite ~moddable~, as demonstrated by the project of a super fan. As far as the substance is concerned, however, the considerations already formulated in recent months by Massimo and Antonio who had dealt with the previous Remasters and whose more in-depth judgments we refer to, obviously remain unchanged. The gameplay of what is considered the last true Final Fantasy (the eleventh and fourteenth ones explored the MMORPG terrain, while Final Fantasy XII, not yet ported to PC, and the entire Final Fantasy XIII saga, called Fabula Nova Crystallis, some stylistic features have considerably changed) resists the passage of time without being affected by rust. The world of Spira is extremely evocative, the script (especially that of the progenitor) robust and the characters, as always, super empathic; all topped off with extremely ~catchy~ mini-games (present in massive doses in the second chapter). The combat system (we are still talking about Final Fantasy X) is stainless and replaces the well-known ATB with a more tactical CTB in which it is possible, among other things, to change the duelists during battles, while Final Fantasy X-2 introduces the concept of costumes (which will then be taken up by Lightning Returns) for which, depending on the clothing worn, the skills also change. The result is excellent and will keep both the more experienced users and those novices glued to the monitor with this saga. Also present in the Steam release are ~boosters~ that we naturally recommend ignoring.", "date": "2016-05-23", "grade": "8.5"}
