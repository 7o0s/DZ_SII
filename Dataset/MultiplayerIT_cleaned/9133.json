{"name": "Trappole vegane", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91695-to-fu-the-trials-of-chi-trappole-vegane.html", "text": "Tested version: iPhone Born in the offices of the British team HotGen, the little protagonist of To-Fu: The Trials of Chi looks like Meat Boy's unfortunate cousin: Edmund McMillen's creature is as succulent as a rare steak, while little To-Fu is a tasteless cube of soybeans; Meat Boy jumps, runs and climbs from wall to wall, but the only action To-Fu can do is stick to a surface; Meat Boy has a girlfriend waiting for him at the end of each level, but the only prize for To-Fu solitaire is a skimpy fortune cookie. Yet both share the same goal: to overcome dozens and dozens of levels full of traps and deadly quills using patience and reflexes as the only weapons at your disposal. Sure, with the lively and athletic Meat Boy it was easy, but how will you fare in the new HotGen game? To-FFFUUUUUU Although the almond-shaped eyes and the hachimaki on the forehead can be misleading, the protagonist of The Trials of Chi is unable to perform any particular acrobatics, and the only way to move him from one point to another is to stretch him with a finger and throw it elsewhere, in a way not too different from what we saw in Angry Birds. Thus, jumping from one surface to another, the player must reach the other end of the level by overcoming various types of obstacles: from the now obsolete and omnipresent spikes to laser beams, from sharp blades to slippery walls. The difficulty curve takes time to steepen, and indeed the first half of the more than 100 levels available (here called 'trials') manages to be all too easy. Only in the most advanced scenarios is a remarkable timing and in rare cases excessive precision required, while the impossibility of moving the camera away by pinching the screen often represents a handicap: even if it widens slightly by touching To-Fu, it is never possible to having an overall view of the scenario and, especially in the levels to be solved with a single and elaborate chain effect, moving the camera continuously is cumbersome and not very intuitive. An hour or two should be enough to complete the game, but to add a little spice and entice the player to repeat the same test several times, HotGen has decided to insert a medal system similar to that seen in Continuity 2 : the first is obtained simply by reaching the fortune cookie, the second requires the collection of all the Chi spheres scattered around the scenario, while the third, perhaps the most interesting, challenges the player to complete the level using the least number of moves possible. Not infrequently these last two medals conflict with each other and it is not possible to take both of them in the same test, an idea that according to the developers should have doubled the longevity of the game, but which then ends up discouraging a part of the players who would like to finish the whole title at 100%. In particular, collecting all the Chi spheres in the longer or more complicated levels proves to be such a tedious, demanding and frustrating process that it convinces most to ignore them and go straight to the next test. The second medal, on the other hand, is more successful, in which each level turns into a real puzzle to be solved, adding a pleasant layer of complexity and replayability to the experience. And, if the medals weren't enough to lengthen the broth, know that the last major update introduced a series of unlockable achievements on Game Center, ranging from simply progressing through the levels to completing real side missions within certain evidence. It is also pleasing to note the care that the development team has placed in the graphic creation of To-Fu, more than evident in the funny animations of the protagonist, in the pleasant color palette or in the shadow effect that is created when the small cube of tofu is backlit, while each level ends with an explosion of confetti and sugared almonds pinata-like from the fortune cookie.
