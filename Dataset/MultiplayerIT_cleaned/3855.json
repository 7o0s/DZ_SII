{"name": "The Eternal Castle Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-eternal-castle-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "The Eternal Castle Remastered is the remastered edition of a 1987 game for MS-DOS that never existed, but whose developers have scattered traces around the net, such as a fake page in the Internet Archive dedicated to the original game, decorated complete with bogus nostalgic reviews. Also note the date: had it been released in 1987, The Eternal Castle would have even anticipated its main sources of inspiration, namely Prince of Persia (1989) and Another World (1991). In short, it would have been the first 2D action with modern cinematic animations, the true heir of Karateka, the forerunner of everything that would have followed those experiences. Let's be clear: this is an excellent marketing operation. The truth is that currently it doesn't take much to discover that The Eternal Castle is a 2019 game and that it doesn't remaster anything at all, although from what we understand some have fallen into the trap and told it as a remake. After all, to understand the trick, just read the credits, where the masters Eric Chahi, Jordan Mechner, Ron Gilbert and the animator Richard Williams are passed off as the developers of the original title (it is obviously a tribute). Even better: to discover the secret, just take a look at what is written in the press kit, where Eternal Castle is openly spoken of as the dream game of the developers, the one they would have liked to play when they were kids. Retro style Having clarified the point, however fundamental, The Eternal Castle Remastered does everything to present itself as a game from the 80s. Just look at a few screenshots to see the CGA-like graphics, with the cyan, magenta, white and black background color palette used, typical of 80's MS-Dos videogames, for most of the adventure, the palette changed to red instead of magenta to give variety to the levels, and the red, yellow, green palette with black background used in the final level. The use of color palettes that are so pleasant today gives the title an enviable stylistic strength, also fueled by the already told myth of the discovery of a forgotten game. The same work of aging of the graphics has also been done with the game mechanics, which without too many mysteries imitate those of Prince of Persia and Another World, titles that we continue to mention not by chance. Many will find the control system a bit too slippery by modern standards, but we think The Eternal Castle's target audience, basically adults who lived through the 80s and early 90s videogames, will have no major problems get used to it. We also believe that more modernly designed controls would have broken the nostalgia spell, counter-productive to the whole experience. Game mechanics But what game is The Eternal Castle Remastered? As already mentioned, we are talking about a 2D action in which the protagonist's goal is to find a lost companion, who has descended on a post-apocalyptic planet Earth completely in the grip of violence and madness, in search of resources. Our character can walk, run, jump and fight, with his bare hands or with one of the many weapons found in the game. The gameplay consists of platform phases, which require you to make very precise leaps, fight phases, against humans and monsters, and exploration phases, in which you have to solve small puzzles. The hand-to-hand combat system is the one that offers the most complications. Apparently based on pressing a single key, it actually involves the use of a large number of moves that can be more or less useful depending on the situation. Unfortunately, confusion often reigns during the clashes and the absence of a tutorial makes it difficult to discover some of the potential of the system itself, which emerges only by replaying (or by consulting the guide written by the developers on Steam). For firearms the situation is better, since they are much simpler to use and do not include large variations. To be honest, we confess that we managed to finish The Eternal Castle for the first time without being aware of the entire combat system, which moreover becomes more complicated by collecting bonuses that give additional powers, such as that of stealth. Unfortunately, these too are not explained and you have to find out for yourself how they work. Gameplay and conclusions The Eternal Castle Remastered consists of a total of five levels. After passing the introductory level, it is possible to choose in which order to face the next three levels, all with different environments, by selecting them from the map of a spaceship that we are proI'm going to reactivate. In case situations are too difficult, it is possible to go back to the map and select another destination. The many checkpoints scattered throughout the levels make it easy to repeat them; doing so can serve to collect additional power-ups, which make life a lot easier. For example, we have abandoned the fight with a boss (there are at the end of each scheme), returning only after being well equipped. By changing approach, a victory that seemed impossible to us has thus become a piece of cake. From a structural point of view, The Eternal Castle turned out to be a much more modern title than it initially seemed. However its real strength is all in the graphic style, accompanied by a truly excellent soundtrack. Seeing these seemingly primitive graphics being animated with such care is incredible and it is to the point that some flaws almost become a strength. For example, creating the lighting system does not always work very well, due to the limited graphics palette, just as some scenarios can lack legibility, again for the same reason. Fortunately, the very concept of the game leads to being tolerant of these problems, which do not compromise the experience but, on the contrary, contribute to fueling the myth and deception of really being faced with a remake of a 1987 game. gets carried away, the whole construct ends up collapsing and seeming much more limited than it actually is.", "date": "2019-01-19", "grade": "8.0"}
