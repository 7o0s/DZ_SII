Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. The shoot'em up genre has found a more than appropriate place on mobile devices, as demonstrated by the reductions of Cave-branded coin-ops. The portable context, the now excellent technical capabilities of today's terminals and the responsiveness of touch controls have in short shown to marry very well with the dynamics that characterize the genre, even in its ~bullet hell~ style variations. In the case of Sky Force 2014, however, we are faced with a ~remastered~ edition of a title that was in turn born on mobile, albeit during a different era from the current one. A product that was then enthusiastically received by the international press, and that the Polish developers of Infinite Dreams thought fit to redesign to transform it into an excellent freemium title for iOS and Android; primarily capable of best interpreting its free nature, with a single currency (the stars) to be earned by eliminating enemies and to be used to upgrade the ship through a particularly solid and gradual upgrade system. The experience can therefore be enjoyed completely free of charge, provided you commit yourself and have a little patience, because the balancing of the difficulty implies that in the new stages the opponents are more numerous and tough, as well as equipped with greater firepower. Otherwise it is possible to put your wallet in hand and indulge in some in-app purchases to do it faster, for example the score multiplier, the elimination of advertising (far from invasive, to tell the truth), the reset of the lives (there are ten at the start and they recharge over time, normally) or packs of stars to make the main gun more effective or unlock the side guns, missiles, lasers, bombs, shields and so on. Pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly and draw the picture of a production with an excellent design, structurally rich and full of references - as well as novelties - compared to the original episode. Sky Force 2014 has all it takes to conquer shoot'em up enthusiasts Hell and heaven The many enemies that alternate on the screen, the bullets dodged by a whisker, the bosses, the explosive situations and the whole achievement system make Sky Force 2014 a real videogame drug, even more so if you are a fan of shoot and run vertical scroll. The options allow you to choose between two different touch controls, with your finger directly on the spacecraft or the traditional ~screen relative~ connotation (in our opinion the best), and it is precisely at this juncture that we found the only lack of the game. In titles such as Bug Princess, in fact, a small portion in the lower part of the screen is assigned to the touch of the fingers and intercepts the smallest movements to allow the shuttle to be moved along the entire scenario without ever lifting the fingertip, which instead does not happen here . Indeed, more often than not you have to lift and reposition your finger, however forced to cover part of the screen, perhaps hiding incoming shots. Precisely this lack prevents the game from establishing itself in an absolute way among mobile shooters, but in our opinion it is the only defect within a framework of excellence. The fluid and detailed graphics move many objects at the same time without affecting the frame rate, giving us fairly varied but above all well-differentiated environments in terms of the threats present. The sound takes up the music of the 2004 original, winking at the coin-ops of the 90s and creating melodies that remain in the head, while on the structural front the ~prize~ connotation makes the eight levels current (to which adds the weekly tournament) that are particularly difficult to complete. In short, the experience will keep you busy for quite some time and will bring out the best of your skills, spurring you to get that extra point to beat a friend's high score or unlock a new scenario.", "date": "2014-08-23", "grade": "8.5"}
