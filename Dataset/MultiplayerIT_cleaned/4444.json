In terms of freemium mechanisms Wargaming probably has nothing to learn from anyone, after all the extraordinary success of its titles speaks for itself; but it was important to adapt the controls, interface and online infrastructure so that they could give their best even in an impromptu context, often made up of quick and occasional games. Objective achieved at the time and again today with World of Warships Blitz, practically a naval version of the same experience, characterized by simulative ambitions mixed with great basic accessibility, this time also implemented on a structural level. In fact, unlike its ~little cousin on tracks~, the new mobile game of the Russian team takes us by the hand through a series of small tutorials to make us assimilate the ship's movement controls, weapon management and the philosophy behind the game. which rests on the solid foundations of a rich and multifaceted progression system between achievements and research & development, thanks to the lack of any limitation and something like a hundred different unlockable warships, each equipped with its own equipment and unique characteristics. A lot of trouble During the early stages of the game with World of Warships Blitz you will find yourself facing cooperative missions but also seven-against-seven battles within various scenarios, all more or less different and equipped with characteristics that allow you to take measures against your opponents , take cover behind large rocks in case of need and reach the score required for victory within a few minutes. The key to success is of course experience, as you need to understand the delicate timing that accompanies the maneuvers of all ships on the battlefield, as well as the mechanisms that regulate fire on distant and/or moving targets, until the correct reading of the radars. Concepts that become clearer as you level up, unlocking at a certain point even a set of interesting single player missions that add numbers and depth to the game. However, the core of the experience remains online, and in this sense the work done by the developers appears commendable: accessing a game takes only a few seconds, and during our tests we have never come across problems related to excessive latency or sudden disconnections. A solidity, the one guaranteed by World of Warships Blitz, built thanks to a careful and aware use of soft launch, which led within a few weeks to the birth of a vast and passionate community. To appreciate a simulation of this kind, however, one must clearly have a passion for warships and be prepared for methodical and thoughtful gameplay, which often revolves around very slow maneuvers, which clash with the quick intuitions needed to put score a hit before the enemy. In short, we are faced with a product with a potentially much smaller audience than that of World of Tanks Blitz, despite this, on the one hand the touch of class of the Italian dubbing for the tutorials surprises, on the other a technical realization that may not spectacular but consistent and functional to the action, with an excellent reproduction of the ships and a good rendering of the water; all in support of a well thought out interface, readable and pleasant to look at.", "date": "2018-01-27", "grade": "8.0"}
