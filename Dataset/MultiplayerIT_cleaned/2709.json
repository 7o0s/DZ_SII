Surely the title that every fan of the genre has been waiting with trepidation and with the hope of seeing significant changes compared to the previous edition. Let's say that the expectations have not been fully met, but there is something to talk about as we will see in the review of MXGP 2020 on PS5. Gameplay and technique Let's start immediately by saying that the solid gameplay base of MXGP 2019 has remained unchanged, both for better and for worse. The idea of inserting the movement of the body by the developers is the strong point of the experience, thus giving the opportunity to better set curves, bumps and jumps during the races. The feeling with the bikes is on a good level and finally you can see the ruts from the passage of the vehicles on the track, a not negligible detail given that where before we could have cornered in peace, perhaps on the following lap, also thanks to the rain, we will have to be more careful how to set the trajectory in order not to end up unseated. Finally, the dosage of accelerator and brake will prove to be crucial in order to be able to cut certain curves or not lose too much ground with jumps. The first of the novelties of this edition, also thanks to the PS5 SSD, is the possibility of rewinding for a few seconds at any time of the race. This can be exploited after falls or wrong turns, but it can lend a hand (perhaps too much actually) to avoid overtaking or to try to avoid speed bumps and opponents. All this is activated by pressing the R1 back button, reversing the flow of time until necessary, and then restarting it by pressing the X button. Remaining in the field of novelty, another innovation is the one linked exquisitely to DualSense and its Adaptive Triggers. Never as on this occasion have the sensations and feeling with the bikes and the race ground been perceptible. Every single bump, every single over-rev and ~puff~ of the engine are returned in a decidedly pleasant and realistic way by the pad. Obviously this massive use of scooters makes it easier to download than other games, but an average game session is fully satisfied by the internal battery of the Dualsense. A note, more personal, is that using this function extensively, in the long run a little effort is perceived. Oh yes, R2 and L2 are almost always reactive to stress and you need to exert a different pressure to counter them. Everyone can obviously choose the preferred feedback rate. In terms of graphics we are obviously on another level compared to previous productions with plays of light, reflections and details of the tracks that are really well made. Unfortunately there are congenital defects to the series such as the audience and the stands that seem to come from another generation, and we are unable to explain why our good Milestones still fail to make everything more alive and believable. The lack of any commentary or background music is also very much felt, which would certainly have given that little sprint to the production. It goes without saying that all the circuits are reproduced with the utmost fidelity, perfectly restoring the sensations and immersion typical of each of them, as per the tradition of the developers. Game mode In terms of content, the new Milestone title does its homework, unfortunately, not meeting the needs of the community. Alongside the main mode, the career, in which we will be able to both impersonate an existing motorcyclist and create a personalized one (not even much later, as we will see) to lead him to win the title, we will find the classic modes such as Time attack, Championship and Grand prix. In the first one we will have at our disposal one of the 23 official circuits between those of the world championship and those outside the world championship circuit, as well as the tracks created by us and by the community through the editor which we will talk about later, to be tackled without a number of laps pre-established, trying to do the best time possible. In the Championship we will face circuits in the order we prefer competing with the AI to win the title and in the Grand Prix mode instead we will simply have to compete in any race among those made available. Then we have the Playground mode, now present permanently within the series, a sort of sandbox in which to win various challenges, including timed and checkpoint laps. This mode is perhaps the one that should be enhanced more, deepened and enlarged since it is still fun to play, even if the map is not the maximum size.We then come, as mentioned before, to the track editor. We will be able to choose between different morphologies on which to set our routes and thus be able to choose from the plethora of different settings between curves, straight lines, jumps, bumps and different finish lines. There are two possible views with which to set up the construction of the track: the bird's eye view, therefore from above, and the free view. Well, this view is the one we advise you to use, to avoid finding yourself on a circuit with curves on gradients or too steep climbs due to the geography of the terrain. Once the circuit has been completed and validated, we will be able to name it and share it online, making it available to everyone for the methods that support it. Then we come to online multiplayer which unfortunately it was not possible to try for obvious reasons but which we will return to analyze as soon as the community is populated and lobbies will be available. The last mode is the one dedicated to customizing our rider/motorcycle duo. Here we really have licensed content for all tastes and any official brand, even if to be meticulous certain brands could unbutton themselves a little more and offer some model of clothing or further mechanical part, but in any case we cannot complain in terms of content . What is missing, however, is an editor of the physique of our avatar.", "date": "2021-01-14", "grade": "7.0"}
