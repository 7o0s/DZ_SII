{"name": "Back 4 Blood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/back-4-blood-recensione.html", "text": "We approached the Back 4 Blood review a little hesitant, to be honest. The feeling we experienced during the beta of the new zombie-based cooperative shooter developed by Turtle Rock Studios was in fact that of a product unable to offer anything new, despite the fact that thirteen years have passed since the release of the original Left 4 Dead. Fortunately, the full version of the game turned out to be much more multifaceted and interesting than the preliminary tests, both in terms of the gameplay and its strategic implications, and in terms of the variety of situations staged during the campaign; which by far does not last very long, but which in fact must be completed three times, one for each level of difficulty, and is able to offer an ever-changing experience. History Back 4 Blood, the protagonists in the introductory sequence The story of Back 4 Blood revolves around the classic post-apocalyptic scenario where the world has been destroyed and the population decimated by an unexpected and ferocious invasion of zombies. In this case, the person responsible for the infection is a parasite called, not surprisingly, the Devil's Worm, but among the survivors there are people who discover that they are immune to the infestation and decide to react resolutely, taking up arms and trying to clean up the streets. from the undead. These are the Exterminators: a team that in the game is made up of eight rather different characters, each equipped with specific equipment (although variable during the game) and peculiar abilities that make them much more than a simple skins. Under the orders of an army officer at the head of the resistance, the protagonists of Back 4 Blood accept the important task of defeating the Infested and investigating a weapon that could change the tide of the battle. Personages Back 4 Blood, the character selection screen As mentioned, the eight characters that we will be able to use in Back 4 Blood are not simple skins, but have characteristics that make them unique and that we will be able to clearly perceive during the game, especially at higher difficulty levels. Evangelo, for example, is a chatty but quick-tempered young man who can regenerate stamina more quickly and help increase the speed of the entire team, as well as independently free himself from the grip of special enemies. Walker is instead a silent man, of action, very precise with a rifle, capable of inflicting additional damage and slightly improving the health of the team, while Holly is a tough and resolute girl who wields a Harley Quinn-style mace by default, she is more resistant than average to damage and its presence improves the vigor of the group. And if you need a mother figure, it's certainly not Ma, an elderly but badass Exterminator with an instant revive bonus and an extra life for the team. Doc stands as the traditional support unit as he can bandage wounded comrades once per mission, improves the effectiveness of healing by 20% and also adds a resistance bonus for the whole group. Hoffman, for his part, is a middle-aged conspiracy theorist who, however, spent his time at the shooting range and has managed to survive so far: he can count on an additional slot and increases the ammunition for his friends too. Finally, there are Jim and Karlee, respectively a very precise hunter, very quick to aim, and a punk able to perceive dangers in advance, which once added to the team improves the speed of use for all characters. Each of the Exterminators can carry two weapons, one main and one secondary, which can be upgraded by grafting extensions to be found around or purchased in safe rooms, as well as three types of objects including bombs, medical kits and extra tools. Structure Back 4 Blood, the team explores a forest in search of the next refuge Back 4 Blood offers a fairly full-bodied campaign, consisting of four acts each divided into a variable number of stages with the exception of the last, which is practically a single, long boss fight. You can try your hand at a quick game or create a new session, even private, by selecting the difficulty level from the three available: Recruit, Veteran and Nightmare, which see the progressive increase of the Infested and their resistance to blows, friendly fire more harmful and a greater incidence of Corruption Cards (we will talk about it in the next paragraph). The game unlocks checkpoints at each completed stage, thus allowing us to start from there rather than always having to start over. However, the progression between the levels is linked to the degree of challenge, and it is no mystery that the developers have focused with conviction on the replayability of the campaign.a, which we will have to aim to complete three times, one for each level of difficulty, and which in general will offer ever-changing situations thanks to the random mechanisms and modifiers that will come into action from time to time. Back 4 Blood, a rooftop fight against a wave of zombies just starting It is also possible to play in single player, with the bots who will take care of controlling our companions (an eventuality that also occurs when human participants are missing in a cooperative game), but without obtaining rewards. It is a choice that has caused discussion and we imagine it will be questioned shortly to avoid controversy, but which underlines once again how Back 4 Blood has been designed exclusively for co-op. Tackling the game alone will prevent you from enjoying fully of the many facets of this experience and we must also consider that in the more advanced stages the contribution of the bots will prove to be rather limited, preventing you from successfully completing the missions. Then, inevitably, there is the downside represented by users who do not play for the team, go ahead and end up killed or blocked, grab coins and objects and then abandon you when it's more beautiful. Back 4 Blood, the Infested placement phase in Swarm mode The only way to remedy similar situations is to get organized together with friends: a rule that applies to all games with a cooperative component and which becomes fundamental when you decide to try the higher difficulty levels, because without careful collaboration will end up dead in no time. Fortunately, the free game on Xbox Game Pass and cross-play are two factors of great importance to ensure that the servers are always well populated and you can also connect with friends who have a different platform than ours.In Back 4 Blood there is also a competitive option, the Swarm mode, which in a very similar way to Left 4 Dead 2 (here the review) puts us in turn in command of the Exterminators or the Infested, in the context of matches in which he wins the team that manages to survive the longest. Frankly, it didn't convince us: fighting as the villains requires a lot of trial and error and there is some concern about the balance (see the permanent monster upgrade system) which often makes the games frustrating. In short, we would have preferred that these resources were used to enrich the campaign rather than intercepting a need that other titles satisfy in a much better way. Gameplay Back 4 Blood, thousands of corpses piled up in one of the last levels of the campaign In short, Back 4 Blood is a title that focuses on the replayability of the campaign but not as an end in itself, given that the developers have included characters with peculiar abilities and a large amount of weapons including pistols, shotguns, shotguns assault, sniper rifles, machine guns, maces and bombs. In addition to the normal zombies, there are also nine special enemies and two different bosses, including the huge Orc, to spice up the situation. It is clear and evident that the mechanics are the same as Left 4 Dead and who has spent hundreds of hours on the shooter produced by Valve he could feel an inevitable deja-vu, maybe even a little tiredness. At the same time, however, it has been literally years since a large number of players were desperately looking for such an experience, so much so that they rewarded a product like World War Z (here the review) despite its many limitations. Back 4 Blood, the traditional safe room door to the new level Controller (or mouse and keyboard) in hand, Back 4 Blood's gameplay is exactly as we expected: we start from the inevitable safe room and, in an attempt to reach the next one, we travel along a path full of undead, perhaps with a few items to find along the way. The scenarios express a certain degree of variety and some original ideas in the final stages of the campaign, but the fights are the masters and the gunplay seemed very solid to us, with an excellent enhancement of the weapons even in the context of an arcade approach. Trying your hand at Turtle Rock Studios' new creature is therefore like finding an old friend who, however, in the meantime went to the gym and pumped up quite a bit, offering us substantially richer content: double the playable characters compared to Left 4 Dead and with an effective distinction, more than double the special Infested (some simple clones of the various Boomers, Spitters and so on, others fresher and more interesting), the bosses that arrive by surprise, the houses to explore in search of ammunitionni and objects, the hordes that leave randomly and, above all, the cards. Back 4 Blood, Holly with an alternate costume in the customization screen At first we don't pay much attention to it, but the deck that we are given the opportunity to create and that we will be able to enrich by unlocking the structures of the military base that acts as a hub between one game and another, substantially influences the experience going to add important bonuses for our Exterminator or the entire team, with the possibility of calibrating fishing in order to coordinate with the progress of the stages and therefore find the most useful cards to face certain situations, also with an eye to to team balancing. We will also have to take into account the fact that while we are playing there is a virtual game master who will try to make us happy and who has his own malus deck to activate according to our behavior: fog, poison, new armor and more can become part of the game, making our lives more difficult. However, we too will have a role in this sense with the selection of Corruption Cards, some of which increase the challenge by granting us greater rewards in case of success. Graphics and sound Back 4 Blood, a wide valley to explore The graphics of Back 4 Blood arise as a synthesis between the need to focus on 60 fps both on PC (at least) and on consoles, easily managing hundreds of enemies simultaneously on the screen, with a netcode that is as solid and reliable as possible and the dutiful technical upgrade compared to the previous works of Turtle Rock Studios. A successful synthesis, it must be said, and with very few blunders, including a decidedly old-gen water creation, some bot wrapping and some interpenetration. The characters in the game are well characterized and enjoy a good set of animations, as well as special enemies. The zombies that are sent against us in enormous quantities are instead linked to geometries necessarily simpler and in practice there are no dismemberments as happens in Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (here the review), but the scenarios appear quite large and some of them also inspired from a visual point of view, capable of going beyond the stereotype of the American horror movie. Back 4 Blood, the inevitable corridor that is often filled with zombies On PC we were able to play at 2160p with all presets set to the highest setting, Epic, achieving a stable 60 frames per second once an AI-based upscaling technology such as DLSS or Super Resolution was activated. In truth, it was the latter that convinced us the most, thanks to the possibility of using the highest quality without incurring small stutters as happens with the corresponding NVIDIA feature. Back 4 Blood's sound can count on an essential soundtrack but capable of take action at the right time to adequately accompany the most frenetic situations. Finally, the game boasts an excellent dubbing in Italian, very well interpreted and with a truly convincing cast, as per tradition for Warner Bros. productions.", "date": "2021-10-11", "grade": "8.0"}
