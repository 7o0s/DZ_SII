This game setting so simple and immediate, indeed introduced for the first time by Micromachines V3 in the distant 1997, has now been re-proposed in an almost unchanged way for Wrecked - Revenge Revisited which since its first announcement has been presented as the spiritual successor of that Mashed above. An eccentric racing game full of destruction and over the top situations that seems perfect for digital distribution on the Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network channels. Powder fire Taking advantage of this well-known setting in the Supersonic Software studios, Wrecked offers an easy-to-master driving experience, with cars all the same in terms of performance that behave almost as if they were radio-controlled cars rather than real racing cars on the winding circuits. characterized by a very high ability to drift and resort to driving aids such as the inevitable turbo and providential emergency braking in challenges with a high risk of explosion, although their execution with the pad is not the most intuitive he soon gets used to using it on the most useful occasions. Added to this is also the ability of the vehicles to move laterally by acting on the right analog stick, a suitable solution to correct our driving trajectories on the fly or to send an opponent off the road with a classic but still effective counter. Adding more dynamism to the races is the camera which shoots the game action from above with zoom and panoramic shots that are never the same for each lap. However, it must be said that the excessive mobility of the direction can lead to disorientation of the player which is sometimes the cause of inexorable going off the road or failed perfect cornering entries with the consequent and frustrating obligation to repeat the match. Just the single game mode allows you to rattle off the heterogeneous eccentricity of the Wrecked gameplay, through twenty-four challenges divided into four different types. We go from ordinary timed challenges where you race against the ghosts of other cars to more demanding races where the elimination of your opponents through various weapons to collect along the way will be the master. Far more unusual and peculiar are those skill challenges that ask the player to make laps trying to collect as many coins as possible along the way or even to race dragging a large caravan behind him which will influence the behavior of the car with its heavy mass weighing on the rear, up to having to drive at full speed with the accelerator blocked at maximum or even with a bomb tied above the roof ready to explode at the slightest contact. As you can understand the challenges in single all enjoy a commendable differentiation, a pity however that completing them all will not require more than three hours, provided you settle for a few too many bronze trophies, while the players who want to reach perfection by conquering all the golds will have to consider sweating the proverbial seven shirts in long trial end error sessions that well characterize a distinctly arcade gameplay like this. Xbox 360 goals Of the canonical 200 points, 110 are unlockable in single-player challenges, provided you get all the gold. Three objectives are dedicated to multiplayer for a total of 45 points, while two are secret achievements. Under the hood The lack of substance is also evident with regard to the tracks, only six although all well made and characterized by different and evocative settings: you go from desert areas to abandoned highways in the middle of the jungle passing through snow-covered and icy circuits that make it particularly difficult to control the car, which gets progressively dirty with water, sand or snow based on the type of terrain on which we are driving. In particular, it is worth noting the return of the classic Mashed track, Polar Wharf, here renamed Ice Bridge for the occasion, a very short elevated course that goes perfectly for battles with friends. To remedy the problem of the few tracks, a DLC is already available to download but honestly we would have preferred to have a more substantial number of tracks without having to be forced to pay further. More complete is the garage section, where it is possible to get lostanalyze the aesthetics of your car, thanks to the credits obtained by winning challenges and competing online. In addition to the different hull models and the various paint colors, it is possible to choose from numerous sets of stickers to show them off in multiplayer races. Just the multiplayer is necessarily the backbone of Wrecked with the ability to compete both online and locally. In both cases, in addition to a quick game with pre-set parameters, it is possible to build the competition from scratch with the parameters that suit us best, choosing the track, rules and weapons to use. There are two distinctive features of the multiplayer mode, the first consists of a demarcation line that runs at a given distance from the leading car, after which any car that has accumulated an excessive gap from the first is instantly eliminated from the race. this solution forces all players to keep themselves in the tussle and make the most of the available armaments characterized by machine guns, missiles but also mines and explosive drones that roam the course. In the event of premature elimination from the race, the second feature that makes the challenges of Wrecked unique enters the picture, i.e. the possibility for players to continue to influence the outcome of the race by harassing the cars still in play with aerial attacks chosen before start of the competition. Certainly, given the particular gameplay that pushes to have all the cars on the screen at the same time, the game gives its best in local multiplayer sessions, so as to be able to make the most of competitiveness by leveraging the fun given by eliminating the cars of the friends.
