Strengthened by a couple of really interesting innovations, above all the introduction of the Ambition mode, Dynasty Warriors 8 put very respectable numbers on the plate, with as many as seventy-seven different characters and four single player campaigns dedicated to the various factions in the field, to the full advantage of the duration of the experience. No revolution, mind you: the game kept the original formula intact and therefore presented itself as an ~ignorant~ action game, in which we were basically asked to always do the same things: access a map, eliminate the enemy army commanders inside the ~hot spots~ and then conquer the territory and then move on to the next mission; all by endlessly repeating the set of moves available to our warrior, mowing down dozens and dozens of opponents thanks to combos that are as powerful as they are spectacular. As per tradition for the franchise, the special edition Xtreme Legends arrives a few months later, which in this case also coincides with the debut on next gen. The situation is therefore the following: Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends is available on PlayStation 3, a stand-alone expansion that allows us to access extra content compared to the smooth edition and possibly import the save; on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita instead we have Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition, which presents the standard episode and the expansion in a single solution. We tried all three versions, and here's how it fared. Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends debuts on PS4 with an extended edition, rich but devoid of real news Here comes a new challenger In addition to the ~old~ single player campaigns dedicated to the Wei, Wu, Shu and Jin factions, Xtreme Legends introduces the Lu Bu campaign, in which we will be able to control this very powerful warrior, equipped with a decidedly unique and striking fighting style , who favors large weapons such as spears, axes, and two-handed greatswords. With a view to a great freedom in the selection of weapons (primary and secondary, alternated by pressing the right back button) and an online cooperative multiplayer for the moment short of users (of necessity: the game will only be released in a few day) there is no shortage of alternative modes, which return from the standard edition of Dynasty Warriors 8: the Free Mode, which allows you to tackle any available stage, also for the purpose of leveling up the characters (the level cap has been increased from 99 to 150, to by the way) and enjoys some changes in the interface, as well as the ability to continue the game to game over; the Ambition Mode, the great novelty of the eighth chapter, with a management structure and shorter missions, designed to obtain the objects necessary for the construction of a splendid castle, even worthy of the Emperor; the Challenge Mode, now equipped with an online ranking and characterized by five types of challenge (Rampage, a sort of time attack; Bridge Melee, in which the goal is to throw enemies off a bridge; Speed Run, in which you have to reach areas on the map quickly; Arena, a variation of the traditional Boss Rush; Inferno, another time attack with a mandatory number of wins). In short, fans of the series will have bread for their teeth, and those who have not had the opportunity to try their hand at the standard version of Dynasty Warriors 8 will be able to count on dozens of hours of entertainment in this case. Playstation 4 trophies Unlocking the forty-four Trophies present in the PlayStation 4 version of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends requires a lot of time and effort, since you have to complete all the missions present in the game, even at the unprecedented Ultimate difficulty level, complete the Ambition mode and put score a large number of kills in battle. substance and form As for the gameplay, beyond a couple of minor changes there is really nothing that diversifies the experience of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends compared to previous episodes. The characters now have a second special attack and it is possible to manually or automatically set the execution of the Storm Rush, the devastating flurry of blows that starts in certain situations, but the combat system appears unchanged, some problems remain in the management of the view and, above all, the sensation of the impact of the blows - that is the factor that most of all makes the difference between a quality fighting game and a poor one - is not yet at the level of Sengoku Basara, much more convincing at this juncture. There is for surea technical discourse to make, given the debut on PlayStation 4: the next gen version of the game boasts a substantially higher definition than that for PlayStation 3, even if the polygonal models of the characters remain the same. Work has been done on optimizing the textures which makes all surfaces more pleasant and sharper, whether it is elements of the scenario, the armor of the characters or their clothes, and this is particularly noticeable during the cutscenes. And when you dive into the heat of battle, the frame rate on the new Sony console is a bit erratic but never drops below thirty frames per second, while the number of characters on the screen is much higher than what is available on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, therefore with a practically absent pop-up effect of enemies. While waiting for a chapter created specifically for next-gen platforms, the results are, in short, discrete, even if the blur effect on the scenarios is truly horrible and not dissimilar from the ~fog~ that instead afflicts the other editions. A note in particular for the game on PlayStation Vita, which uses a cross-save system to allow synchronized saving of the game with the PlayStation 4 version, but suffers from very great difficulties in terms of frame rates, such as to completely ruin the experience , which once deprived of its traditional fluidity becomes really difficult to digest. A patch that fixes the problem has already been released in Japan and we hope it gets to us quickly too, because without the update it would be really hard to recommend the portable edition.", "date": "2014-03-31", "grade": "7.0"}
