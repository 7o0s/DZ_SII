After the top view, horizontal scrolling and three-quarter solutions, for Matterfall the developers wanted to explore the Contra-style action shooter mechanisms, putting us in the shoes of a cunning warrior who, with her big arm cannon, shoots a bit the verse to Samus Aran. The plot of the game, which is introduced by a voice in Italian, tells of an explosive situation that arose when human beings tried to carry out advanced research on one of their colonies, showing their side to the rise of a formidable enemy. The protagonist of Matterfall must therefore resolve the situation, with a view to a campaign consisting of nine fairly long levels and three challenging bosses. Run, jump, shoot The very first stages of the game act as a tutorial with respect to mechanisms that we will be called upon to master as we pass from one stage to another, and which involve a certain degree of coordination, especially in the more advanced stages. The setting is in fact that of a twin stick shooter, with the analog sticks that allow you to move the character and activate its fire, determining its trajectory, while the R1 and L1 backbones allow you to take a leap (even double) and make a jump respectively. special dash that sends enemies into stasis, blocking them for a few moments and making them much less resistant to our attacks. The same shot allows you to pass through most of the bullets unscathed, which transforms it into a fundamental maneuver in the economy of the gameplay, something more complex and more important than a simple projection to use to lengthen the jumps. The use of the secondary weapon is assigned to the R2 trigger, which can be selected from a list of devices (by pressing the Triangle key) that are unlocked during the campaign, alternating between active and passive functions: on the one hand, grenades, homing missiles, loaded shots and etc; on the other hand, an upgrade for the main fire, the ability to deal damage with dash or increase its range, etc. Finally, the L2 trigger activates a matter generator that we can use both to free the inevitable captive human beings, to be found around the stages, and above all to solidify platforms on which to jump, perhaps on the fly. Moreover, the shot allows you to cross these platforms, all of which are blue, introducing a very interesting facet: this type of barrier blocks enemy projectiles but not ours. Furthermore, once the relative indicator has been loaded, we will be able to press the Square button to activate the Overcharge, a sort of bullet time to take advantage of to clean up the screen from opponents or quickly concentrate fire against a boss's weak point. Faster and faster! Matterfall's control system cannot be customized, but in truth it appears well organized and it would be difficult to imagine more effective solutions, even and especially when the action gets really frenetic. There are situations in which our character is literally surrounded by hostile units and their barrage, almost like in a bullet hell, and in this situation the only way to avoid damage is to take advantage of the shot with the right timing and a certain degree of accuracy. Sometimes the destruction of various enemies causes ~bombs~ to appear in mid-air that we can activate using the matter generator, in an orgy of voxels that disintegrate on the screen, as has become tradition for Housemarque. Scrolling sometimes changes direction, there are variations on the theme of zero gravity, indestructible turrets that force you to move in a certain way to avoid bullets, as well as various types of opponents, all of a mechanical nature: from annoying spiders that leap big to humanoids that project jets of lava at us, from large armored monsters to robots that charge with their heads down, passing through many types of flying drones. The three bosses complete the picture effectively, although during our test we were unable to defeat the last one, damned difficult: a huge sentient excavator who creates distance between us and his weak point by spewing fireballs and rocks, while various minions keep attacking us. We found the first two much less problematic, respectively a giant insect and a sort of cocoon from which appendages emerge that open fire, to be destroyed as quickly as possible.Playstation 4 trophies Part of the thirty-four Matterfall Trophies is unlocked simply by completing the game on various difficulty levels, but several achievements must be obtained by completing specific actions: keeping the Overload active for ten seconds, passing certain points without taking damage, saving all civilians , collect all secret stashes and so on. Short but not too much Matterfall is substantially longer than Nex Machina, but still belongs to that circle of Housemarque productions that can be completed within a few hours, depending on the number of times a game over occurs and you have to start over from the last checkpoint. From this point of view, the experience is not punitive and the three degrees of difficulty (which become four once the campaign is completed) allow you to approach the game in a different, more or less relaxed way, although enemies already release vital energy at the normal level in abundance. So let's not talk about a frustrating shooter (apart from, if you like, the last boss), equipped with the inevitable leaderboard to compare your score with that of your friends and rather large scenarios, which hide various secrets and collectibles; first of all, the prisoners we have already mentioned, who once freed often give us new secondary weapons. The variations on the theme and the level design in general are of excellent quality, in short, and it's a shame that we haven't gone a little further with the campaign. As long as it lasts, the journey offered by Matterfall is still very pleasant to see and hear: the electronic soundtrack accompanies the action in an almost perfect way, while in the whirlwind of bullets, jumps and projections it is really difficult to understand that the graphics are not it goes beyond 1080p on PlayStation 4 Pro, favoring a frame rate that never budges from sixty frames per second. Of course, the protagonist's appearance could have been a little more refined and less generic, but that's okay too.", "date": "2017-08-15", "grade": "8.0"}
