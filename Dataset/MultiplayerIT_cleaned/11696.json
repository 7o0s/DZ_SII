{"name": "Cerebral Challenge vol. 2: Anti Stress", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cerebral-challenge-vol-2-anti-stress.html", "text": "With the creation of the first Cerebral Challenge, Gameloft wanted to have its say in the ~brain trainer~ genre, thus going to support all those smaller developers who based their production on this type of applications. The release of this ~volume 2~ does nothing but optimize the structure of the original title, adding a certain number of tests as well as a particular emphasis on the control of mental stress, which is measured hand in hand with the capabilities of our brain and represented graphically through projections that can be checked and compared from day to day. From the start screen we can access the daily test or simple training, useful for understanding how many and which tests will have to be faced, as well as how they work. The test can be performed from a purely mental point of view or for stress; in both cases, we will have a certain amount of time to deal with it, at the end of which we will be shown a diagram with the results. Let's say that the structure is the classic one for this kind of software: there is a (large) series of applications that must be addressed in sequence, trying to respond quickly to each question, without making mistakes. In one of the tests we will have to quickly identify the ball that bounces the most on the screen and type the corresponding number, in another we will have to memorize words to then recognize one in a list. You will also have to understand which path a frog will follow taking every detour of the path, or even perform arithmetic operations applied to figures. Cerebral Challenge Vol. 2 surprises for the quantity of tests available, really numerous, but leaves something to be desired for the variety of the same: it will happen to quickly find oneself faced with questions that have already been answered, thus distorting the final results. We are dealing with a product with a flexible character, however, which does not rigidly limit us to carrying out a single test a day, but rather gives us the possibility of doing it as often as we wish. In terms of technical implementation, this new Gameloft title defends itself well: the graphical interface, which is the most important thing in this kind of application, is well done, clear and legible. The tests themselves are characterized by bright colors and a nice appearance, with some less successful episodes which however do not affect the general quality. The sound has the merit of accompanying the action with some good quality music, which is not too noticeable and therefore plays the background role well without disturbing. Finally, the control system very often calls into question the numeric keyboard in its entirety (you have to type numbers, in fact) or the joystick, with an always prompt response to input, without any problems whatsoever. PRO Technically well done A large number of tests It also measures your stress level AGAINST Some subdued graphic solutions Not very many questions Far from original", "date": "2008-01-02", "grade": "S.V."}
