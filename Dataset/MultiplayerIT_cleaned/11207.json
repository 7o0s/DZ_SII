The tested version is the PlayStation 3 version. Fire and flames Even the technical sector is not without defects, with many lights and shadows. If the explosions are particularly appreciable, full of special effects with lots of heat that makes the protagonist spin, and the modeling and textures applied on these, the construction of the environments, cities, hills or ports, is of less impact. The detail drops drastically, everything gives the impression of being the same, with the result that it seems to always be fighting in the same place. The destructibility of the environments is very appreciable, given the vast arsenal available, but in fact we notice some small imperfections, such as the grenades and bombs that leave no craters, but small mounds of earth that remind us that something has moved the ground recent. The applied physics is quite good, with the cars and military vehicles reacting realistically to the roughness of the terrain or to the obstacles that appear in front of them such as pedestrians, crates or barricades, while several times the Havoc engine has gone into crisis, as when an RPG shot in the nose of a jeep no less than 3 meters he threw it in the air, and after circling and bouncing a couple of times it fell back to the ground, in perfect shape, as if it had just left the dealership, complete with driver and passenger alive and well and with weapons in hand. The general feeling is that the game technically lacked an additional cleanup job, with some things being very well done and others only halfway done. Comment Mercenaries 2: World in Flames is a very strange title, because despite not caring about the many refinements proposed in a title like GTA, it succeeds in its main purpose, which is to entertain, even if to do so it lowers its demands a lot, becoming in fact a shooter, rather than a classic free roam full of things to do. Many may not appreciate it, also by virtue of a graphic design full of ups and downs and plagued by bugs, but whoever manages to immerse themselves perfectly in this context, in the role of one of the three mercenaries ready for anything and with an easy nuclear bomb, will be able have a lot of fun, despite (practically) all the same missions and a deficient artificial intelligence. As a couple online, the fun is guaranteed, an endless carnival of explosions and bombings, with sporadic problems of lag. Pros Mass Destruction Lots of weapons and vehicles Very fun co-op mode Cons Missions all very similar Bad A.I. and bugs present Technical sector with ups and downs Three mercenaries looking for a mission As previously written in the preview, the cold 38 parallel in Korea is abandoned for warm and sunny Venezuela. Between coups d'tat and double-crossing, the story follows the vicissitudes of the protagonist and his run-up to the center of power, or that Solano who betrayed us (and unpaid!) in the prologue, becoming the object of our revenge. After choosing from one of three selectable characters, or the Swede with Mohican hair Mattias Nilson, graced by more energy and a higher regeneration rate of the same; Chris Jacobs who represents the ~heaviest~ character of the lot, being able to take more hits and above all being able to carry more ammunition and Jennifer Mui, the fastest and fastest armed oriental weapon in the world, you immediately immerse yourself in the city life of Maracaibo, of war in all respects, theater of clashes between the warring factions. The factions, five in all, represent a sort of mission vending machine, with the only limitation that working for one will deny us the support of another, thus cutting the available resources and fast transport zones from one side to the other. other of the map. It's all very simple, killing, even casually, a soldier of a faction, we will have against all his companions. It will then simply be enough to kill someone from the opposing faction to go back to being friends as before. The missions are not the emblem of variety, even if the first ones that become available can pleasantly surprise, such as the unforgettable recovery of the ~Devastator~ and that of the rifles victim of our sports guide. The others, escort, delivery or hit man, can mostly be completed by simply exploiting the arsenal that the game makes available to us. Not just rifles and hand grenades, but more generally everything that has an engine, from cars to trucks, through light armored vehicles and motorboats. Maximum devastation is obtained when, after completing questionable quick time evensts, you can do whatever you want in tanks and helicopters. If even this seems little to us, in Mercenaries 2 we can also resort to air attacks, upon payment of the petrol necessary to make the bomber take off. With Cruise missiles, smart bombs or cluster bombs we can change the war zone at will, given the almost total destructibility of the environments, and above all kill all the enemies present in a base in one fell swoop. And if there is a budding Dr. Strangelove among the readers, he will find the use of nuclear bombs decidedly interesting, which make Solano's Venezuela even hotter and sunnier. Air support also comes to the rescue to transport vehicles directly to the battlefield, whether they are armored vehicles or machines, consequently increasing, when possible, the already high rate of destruction of the battlefield. Those who expect a certain lack of funds in advanced missions can sleep peacefully since around Venezuela it is possible to collect many crates full of ammunition, petrol, money or free ready-to-use airstrikes. A shower of lead Just the air support, indeed the way it is possible to call it, lets us know one of the first critical points of the game. In practice, you have to stop and choose with the directional cross which type of help you want to activate. Easy to say, absolutely uncomfortable to do given that in the middle of a firefight, being impaled, even if only for a few seconds, to throw the beacon in the release area represents a nice way to start the mission over. This problem, due to a bad choice in terms of gameplay, is compensated by an equally questionable artificial intelligence of the opponents. Since our mercenary cannot go into cover, but only duck when aiming, even the enemy soldiers have chosen to put it on fair play, deciding to get shot in the open by shooting, weapons in hand, as in the old fps. As if that weren't enough, they get lost behind, or inside, the walls, or do nothing to organize a noteworthy assault, perhaps not noticing the Swedish mercenary with the Mohawk who is freezing them from behind from barely half a meter away. Or how can we not mention the pedestrians who throw themselves in full self-destructive frenzy under the cars, causing a $5,000 collateral damage? Another couple of unpleasant things, which are noticed by playing, are the bad balance of firearms, compared to the power of one's fists. More generally, rifles, not pump-action rifles, but actual assault rifles, are not very accurate, and are therefore only useful from a short distance. If you shoot from more than ten meters you see the bullets magically surround the target, with a very low percentage of hits. Obviously, even the opposing soldiers are equipped with the same rifles, all loaded with tracers then, consequently you can see and avoid the bullets as if we were in the bullet time of the Matrix. An explosive couple If the lead of our AK 47 Kalashnikov is not enough and you don't want to wait for our bomber friend, you can rely on our steel knuckles, which in fact knock the opponent out with one blow. In light of this, a winning tactic, but above all a quick one to carry out the missions of assaulting enemy forts is to force entry by entering at full throttle with a car, stop in front of the objective and knock him out with a precise uppercut . Mission Accomplished, zero bullets fired, a nice nest egg cashed, immediately running to the base to rest and drink margaritas! Despite these defects and very similar missions, you can have a lot of fun, as long as you choose to play in the name of maximum devastation, making a mockery of the alliance system and having fun on board the many means available. Venezuela therefore becomes an immense playground, where we can do and undo everything as we please, where we can roam aimlessly through the cities, where without remorse we can raze entire neighborhoods to the ground, steal helicopters and more generally do whatever we would like to do in GTA without the harassment of the heels police. The cooperative mode, in which you can freely enter and leave the game, if played from this point of view is certainly a further plus to the Pandemic game. Death from above, in the form of a tank meekly descending from a helicopter, or a cruise missile destroying an entire city block, simply doubles, and to make things even easier, in the event of the untimely death of one of the mercenaries, the one still standing can bring him back to life, ready to unleash, upon payment of hard cash or wellzina, a nice punitive nuclear holocaust. This possibility of instant healing in the field is particularly welcome given that, if you don't have advanced bases near the area of operations to be used to ~teleport~ quickly via helicopter, you have to put up with long wanderings around the map, which is decidedly long and boring in solo games.", "date": "2008-09-10", "grade": null}
