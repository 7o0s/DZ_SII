Of these, a couple are of interest to us for this article: developers give their best towards the end of a console's life cycle; Naughty Dog are among the best in the world videogame scene. It is easy to imagine, therefore, how The Last of Us has managed to obtain a myriad of awards and why it is considered by many to be one of the best titles ever of the previous generation. In a historical period in which the new consoles are still struggling to get going and the re-editions seem to meet the favor of the public, this title could not be missing, especially since according to Sony many PlayStation 4 owners come from other platforms and therefore have no played the original version. Hence the decision to publish The Last of Us Remastered, to which Naughty Dog have dedicated over six months to give full justice to the world and story that revolve around the title, both in terms of aesthetics and offer. This reissue has an attractive price that has been adjusted downwards after player feedback, amounting to 45, and includes all patches and content produced to date: the single player expansion Left Behind, which we reviewed at this address, the eight additional multiplayer maps of the ~Forsaken Territories~ DLC and the Realism bundle, the new difficulty level of the same name, the ~Making of~ of the game, the comments of the producers and the photo mode. Furthermore, all weapons or cosmetic modifications purchased on PlayStation 3 are also available in the PlayStation 4 version, at no additional cost. We have analyzed in detail the PlayStation 4 edition of The Last of Us, power of the next-gen Days go by, quality remains To find out what we think in detail about the original title and its gameplay, we invite you to read our dedicated review; in Remastered we played several hours with the Survivor difficulty level, the maximum before the last patch and which includes fewer resources, more difficult enemies and the absence of the Listening mode, which allowed you to ~see~ enemies even through walls thanks the noise they made. One year later The Last of Us hasn't aged a day, and remains a decisive step forward for Naughty Dog in terms of maturity, with an adult and uncompromising narrative, flanked by full-bodied, bloody, engaging gameplay. The ideal mix of cinema and video games, where the gameplay is not sacrificed, but blends perfectly with the interlude sequences, the dialogues of the protagonists and all the events that always keep the tension high. The game alternates strenuous moments with others of exploration in breathtaking decadent scenarios, has a good longevity (which can even reach 15 hours the first time) and variety of settings, offers some truly touching moments and gives an ending that is anything but discounted. Left Behind instead tells a side of Ellie's story, how she grew up and how she discovered she was so important; it does it in a wonderful way like the original title, and overshadows the gameplay component which, although reduced, presents a summary of the original title with the small novelty of being able to exploit the infected to one's advantage. Thanks to the latest DLC it is also possible to select the Realism mode, which additionally disables the interface that illustrates the type of weapon selected and the shots available, has even tougher enemies and offers bare-bones resources: in this configuration you it has maximum satisfaction but also frustration in having to repeat the most difficult pieces, but perhaps it is also the one where The Last of Us expresses its maximum survival potential, within which every action must be weighted down to the smallest detail. In the PlayStation 4 version, pressing the touch pad has the function of the Select key and allows you to call up the menu for crafting and for Joel's enhancement; aiming and shooting have been accommodated on the DualShock 4 triggers, much better than the previous model, with the possibility in any case of associating them with L1 and R1. The noise of turning on / off the flashlight comes out of the speaker, as well as the audio recordings featured in The Left Behind; the improved ergonomics of the PlayStation 4 pad gives a pinch of extra skill in both single and multiplayer sessions. The experience we had with The Last of Us Remastered was ultimately the same exceptional as the original title, with all the content available, its resounding highs but also with some lows, headed by the ~stupidityartificial~ linked to Joel's supporting characters. Where in fact the protagonist we control moves in an absolutely silent way so as not to be discovered by the Clickers or Runners, the supporting characters emit sounds, run from one cover to another or enter the line of sight of the enemies ... who ignore them beautifully. All stealth management seems to be concentrated only on the main protagonist, and if most of the time it doesn't bother you because maybe the supporting actors stay quiet behind you and engage in battle only when you are discovered, occasionally this thing is annoyingly noticeable. Playstation 4 trophies The Last of Us Remastered offers a large amount of trophies to unlock from scratch, resulting from the sum of all the contents present. Platinum is obtained after unlocking the 23 trophies of the main game, identical to those of the original title. We then have 10 from Left Behind and 14 from the two multiplayer DLCs included (8 of these have been made easier) and 2 to finish the title in Realism and Realism+ modes. Remastered, remastered everywhere! We have reached the crucial element that could make those who have already played the original title incline or not to buy: the technical sector of The Last of Us Remastered. The PlayStation 3 version was equipped with excellent graphics in relation to the other titles available on the console, also and above all due to a sublime artistic system and an obsessive attention to detail; it suffered a bit in terms of graphic cleanliness and frame rate stability, which dropped below 30 frames per second in the most graphically complex moments. The starting points for Remastered were precisely the resolution of these last two problems, and on PlayStation 4 the adventure of Joel and Ellie can boast 1080p and 60 frames per second. But what is the result? A significant improvement even for an untrained eye: the definition of the settings is of a completely different kind than that of the PlayStation 3, and this is especially noticeable on the ~articulated~ elements such as foliage, shadows, and complex objects. When the image is still the difference is embarrassing, and even in movement the shimmering (elements in the distance that seem to move and flash) is much reduced compared to the original title, even if present on some objects. The clearly superior fluidity is unsettling at first, but you quickly get used to it and then never go back: the control system responds better, the flow of the scenario is more enjoyable, in general the title is more pleasant to watch and play . Many will wonder if the 60 frames per second are fixed or not; based on our experience, 99% (95, 90? Hurray for the percentages!) of the time we could say yes: in some situations completely disconnected from the complexity of the scene, perhaps with the camera pointed downwards and on a hedge, we warned of stuttering, i.e. microshots that seem more to be connected to some bug or problem with v-sync than anything else, perhaps fixable with a patch. Analysis with more in-depth technical tools will confirm or not our hypothesis and the percentage of drops on the total, nothing in any way that affects the overall experience or undermines the renewed fluidity of the title. To please the most demanding fans afraid of a refresh rate (in their way of speaking) too much to have a cinematic experience, Naughty Dog has introduced an option to lock the frame rate at 30 frames per second; as a bonus due to the fact that doing so freed up some resources, the definition of the shadows is still superior to the already excellent ones of the ~unlocked~ title. From our point of view, the choice between these two configurations leans largely in favor of the latter: in a few sessions you get used to it and as mentioned, the overall impact and the control system benefit from it. In any case, the enhancement work did not stop at 1080p and 60 frames per second: the loadings between interlude sequences and gameplay sections were almost zeroed, the polygonal complexity of objects and characters in the distance (the so-called LOD) it is better and scales better when approached; the resolution of the textures, quadrupled on paper and the main cause of the 50GB installation, allows you to show off even more impressive details, to the point that some glimpses still manage to surprise despite perhaps having already been appreciated on PlayStation 3. The polygonal models of Joel, Ellie and the other supporting characters have undergone a refinement and an increase in detail, now it is possible to see new elements on the clothes and above all on the faces, and as you can seeand from the screenshots we made first hand, some times they are impressive. The cutscenes remain a cut above, but also because they have been equally refined: in some close-ups the detail of the characters is truly incredible. Accomplices various exploration sections present to break the tension, not infrequently one is enchanted by the scenery and settings at sunset, in broad daylight or at night, made even softer by the greater definition and by the lighting system in the same way revised for the occasion: The Last of Us Remastered does justice to the artistic beauty of the original title, and the improvement is noticeable in almost all the graphic elements present on the screen. The Naughty Dogs have also indulged in the sound sector, in the menus it is in fact possible to see new options linked to the type of stereo system being used: the number of channels, the arrangement of the satellites, the dynamic range and the azimuth value, in very simple terms the angular origin of the sound. Using the automatic setup of our 7.1 Home Theater system we felt a higher quality of sound and effects than in The Last of Us, with the correct placement of for example the rain that beats on the cars near the protagonist or the voices of the characters, and less voice sampling and clarity issues when teammates speak in the distance. The dubbing is obviously the same valid as the original title - even if we would have liked Joel with a more hoarse and full-bodied voice - the soundtrack remains the exceptional one by Gustavo Santaolalla, which has the only ~defect~ imposed to be an accompaniment rather than an unforgettable protagonist . We left the photo mode for last, which in reality represents an extremely pleasant bonus for a good portion of PlayStation owners, after the excellent possibilities offered by the one present in inFAMOUS: Second Son. In The Last of Us Remastered it is activated by pressing the L3 key, and allows you to operate on parameters such as the positioning of the camera and the breadth of the view, the depth of field, the presence of a frame and a series of preset filters. Compared to the Sucker Punch title there are a series of additional controls such as the vignette mode and the one to add a grain in such a way as to have a cinematic look; it is also possible to choose the intensity of application, even for the same filters, on a scale ranging from 1 to 100. We haven't really dabbled with this feature yet, as it's available as a patch starting today, but we won't miss the chance to shower you with lots of cool artistic screenshots like we did with inFAMOUS: Second Son, and maybe run a contest within our PlayStation Zone section.", "date": "2014-07-28", "grade": "9.5"}
