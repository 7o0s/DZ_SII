{"name": "Those Who Remain", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/those-who-remain-recensione.html", "text": "To understand the vote at the bottom of the review and why Those Who Remain fails to say anything relevant in the context of the horror genre, just examine its control system and some basic mechanics. When a pursuing monster, or stalker, if you prefer, one of those who actively seek the protagonist around the map and chase him when identified, appears on the scene for the first time, we find ourselves outside a building, behind some objects that they provide us with adequate coverage (cars, nerds and more). The monster projects a beam of light that represents its gaze, as well as, in terms of game mechanics, the visual cone, that is, the one in which we must avoid entering, on pain of being seen. The initial impression is quite disturbing and, when the monster looks in our direction, we naturally duck down to hide better... too bad it's not possible to do so. Before moving we would like to look out of our hiding place to identify where the creature is, but we cannot do this either. These are two details that seem irrelevant, but which give a good idea of how the developers have given little consideration to the idea of creating tension in the player, giving him the tools to represent it on the screen so as to accentuate it. In a horror we know that it could be completely useless to curl up in a corner to defend ourselves from danger, but at the same time doing so projects us more into the action because it makes our weakness manifest, while increasing our emotional involvement. It also increases the possibilities of indirect interaction with the setting, making even the lowest objects possible hiding places, albeit temporary. In Those Who Remain none of this happens. When enemies spot us we are forced to stand like stockfish, or to run away, but if we are cornered and have no possibility of escape, we cannot express our fear in any way. Gameplay Another unsuccessful mechanic is that of the gray areas full of enemies that basically kill us on touch. At first, seeing yourself surrounded by menacing shapes has a certain effect, but once you understand the trick, you get used to it soon and the occasional deaths due to trespassing in the dark become just a nuisance. The mechanic is sometimes used to create quite successful puzzles, but on other occasions the developers have decided that it was right to exploit it to kill the player without warning, for example by suddenly turning off a light ... so as to remind him that he is inside to a mediocre horror game, evidently. These shortcomings create a profound sense of detachment from what is happening on the screen, a detachment that is detrimental not only to the engagement, but also to the general atmosphere, since it ends up distinguishing all too clearly moments of real danger from those in which instead we are not risking anything. When the fear of opening every door disappears, as for example it happened in Amnesia: The Dark Descent or in Outlast, the assumption that supports the genre also disappears, which unfortunately many still conceive as that of ugly monsters, poor lighting and decadent places, when in reality these elements become only folklore if deprived of a deeper reasoning on all those mechanics that determine the gameplay. In short, having understood the trick, the whole construct ends up collapsing miserably and an interesting story is not enough to fix it. History Truly the story of Those Who Remain is the only reason to go forward in the game and finish it. The adventure begins with Edward, the protagonist who goes to a motel to break up with his mistress, but finds it completely empty. Someone even steals his car, forcing him to return to Dormont, his hometown, on foot and completely alone. Soon, however, the aforementioned black shapes stand in his way who, more threatening than the dark, can't wait to kill him. How are they there? What happened to Dormont to attract so much horror? What is Edward's role in the events that unleashed the creatures? Answering these and other questions is the only interesting element of the game. In reality, the guys at Camel 101, the development studio, have tried to create more varied and profound situations, adding a parallel dimension to the gameplay in which the most relevant elements of the narrative are introduced, as well as some of the best puzzles, which require perform certain actions in one dimension to change the other, so you can advance. It is here that Edward will become aware of what has happened and will understand what he must do. It is sempre here that he will make some decisive choices, which will lead to one of the possible endings (it takes between 6 and 8 hours to finish it). The chases deserve a separate mention, sometimes frustrating and not very successful. It's unclear why so many continue to be made in horror titles, as they are rarely effective. Too bad for the presence of some ingenuity, probably due to the desire of the developers to represent their vision of the world as completely as possible. The problem is that some situations in Those Who Remain end up being too phoney, while others are cloying, despite the fact that some themes are really interesting and rare for the world of video games. The writing in general is very immature and too conditioned by some easily recognizable rhetorical models. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view Those Who Remain is not surprising. Let's say he does his thing, despite an anonymous artistic direction and some problems with the lighting system, which creates some glitches from time to time. We are aware that it wasn't a team of hundreds of people who made it, but it would have been better to abandon the realistic style to try something more suited to the resources available. The soundtrack is better, which is not surprising for its originality but at least does its thing and helps to create that minimum of tension that makes the action more enjoyable.", "date": "2020-06-02", "grade": "5.0"}
