{"name": "Battaglie dei Pirati", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battaglie-dei-pirati.html", "text": "Those who know Digital Chocolate productions know well that they are often ~ultra arcade~ titles, which make simplicity and immediacy their strengths but at the same time manage to offer an unexpected depth. Examples abound, and one is better than the other. Battaglie dei Pirati (Italian translation of the original ~Pirate Ship Battles~), in this sense, breaks tradition a bit: it is not a puzzle game, nor a classic action game, but a real own reinterpretation of the naval battle with a series of side additions. In the role of the valiant Prince of Pirates, we will leave for ports and fortresses to conquer, facing all the enemies that we will find on our path and that sometimes, faced with a defeat, will choose to follow us and thus multiply the units belonging to the our fleet. From the start screen you can try your hand at a quick game, with multiplayer (to be played on a single mobile phone) or with the ~campaign~ mode. The first two options confront us only with the combat phase of Battaglie dei Pirati, or the one that takes up the classic naval battle by adding the possibility of using special weapons as well as more shots for each round. The clashes take place in this way: once you have placed the ships on your board, you move on to hitting the opponent's board in an attempt to damage his ships until they sink. The differences compared to the game we all know are basically two: firstly, the number of shots at our disposal for each round is directly proportional to the ships in our possession, therefore if we have the entire fleet we will be able to make three attempts, otherwise these will go down to two or one; secondly, each shot fired will help fill a bar located at the bottom of the screen and which, once full, allows us to take advantage of a special attack that can be selected from a list. These are maneuvers that touch several boxes at the same time and which therefore give us a greater probability of pecking an enemy ship. In the ~campaign~ mode, however, we will not spend time just fighting, indeed even the clashes can be simulated in an instant with only a slight penalty relating to the ~morale~ of the sailors. At each turn, we will be able to move our ships in various directions through a nautical map that provides for the presence of numerous ports and strongholds to conquer, as well as enemies to defeat. We can win a battle but end up with the fleet decimated, in which case the money earned through conquered ports will allow us to buy back the lost ships, to restore our power. The technical realization of the game is decent, with a good design for the characters and an always readable interface. The use of colors is excellent, as per tradition for Digital Chocolate, while even on the combat phases (which, as already mentioned, take up the classic naval battle) a ~modernization~ work has been done capable of making everything pleasant for the view. Clearly we are not dealing with a product with who knows what visual impact, but in relation to the genre to which it belongs, the result is very good. Finally, the sound consists of a series of fairly good quality MIDI music.
