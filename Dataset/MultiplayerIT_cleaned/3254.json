Now, if these days you have the opportunity to buy The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics, this happens because last August 2019 Netflix proposed a new TV series, the prequel to that 1982 Dark Crystal co-directed by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, a fantastic film that has carved out (especially later) a large circle of fans. With our review we will mainly aim towards two objectives: to make you understand where The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics is placed within its multimedia universe (keep in mind that it is addressed to everyone: newcomers and longtime fans); in addition, evaluate the goodness of this turn-based strategy in RPG sauce taken by itself. Make yourself comfortable: we're going to beat up some Skeksis. Plot and narrative context The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics features a main campaign, an adventure that faithfully retraces all the events seen in last summer's Netflix TV series, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. All of this will already be known to longtime fans and new viewers, but it's worth introducing the fantasy world in question and its storyline without running into dangerous spoilers. The world of Thra is steeped in magic, and inhabited by fantastic creatures: the two main species that coexist there are the Gelflings and the Skeksis (the latter in no uncertain terms the bad guys of the situation, a population that arrived later). Since the dawn of time, Aughra and the Crystal of Truth have been protecting the world of Thra: but the Skeksis, as good villains, have the brilliant idea of taking possession of the Crystal for their shady purposes (obtaining eternal life); to the detriment of the Gelfling among other things, killed without any scruple by the invaders. Hence begins the classic story of heroism to save the world: some Gelflings give life to an improvised resistance, led by Aughra. The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics then guides the player through the first Netflix television season: from the awareness of the ~betrayal~ of the Skeksis to the awakening of Aughra, and then gradually in the various events that see the good oppose the empire of the invaders in an attempt to save their world. It is a narrative context that is ideally placed between The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance and The Dark Crystal (film of the 80s), also with the shooting of several playable characters from the latter. Certainly a title that cannot be missed by lovers of the fantasy world in general, and of the one imagined by Frank Oz and Jim Henson in particular. The main adventure will occupy you for several hours of play (at least ten) and has different levels of difficulty, to adapt to the needs of even the little ones; the Italian language is present at least in the texts on the screen. Gameplay The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics features gameplay focused mainly on turn-based strategy (Tactic, in fact). Each level consists of a fight to be completed in various ways: all the characters present, heroes and enemies, move on a chessboard divided into various boxes. Individual shifts allow the ~pawns~ to carry out basically three main actions: move (with a more or less wide freedom), attack or launch boosters (defensive and offensive). Alternatively, it is also possible to skip the turn, not without advantages: in fact, the next one will load more quickly, for that specific character. The general level of difficulty of the entire production is not too high: The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics is very understanding and helpful, especially towards newcomers (to have a real challenge you will have to set ~difficult~ from the main menu); furthermore, the individual levels will suggest to the player the most sensible and painless way to complete the mission. In some cases it will even be enough to run to the finish line, without the need to hurt enemies in particular (the latter are almost always either Skeksis or other hostile creatures from the world of Thra). The defects of The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics immediately catch the eye: in addition to the difficulty, which may not even be considered as such for some players, the decidedly small size of the various levels should be noted. Add a certain repetitiveness of the underlying mechanics, actions that are not particularly varied both from an offensive and a defensive point of view.o, and a sometimes soporific linearity both in the game worlds and in the continuation of the main adventure. From the latter point of view, however, the extreme fidelity to the Netflix TV series should be noted, which makes The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics an essential appointment for fans of the starting franchise. RPG component and technical sector If in the gameplay The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics immediately shows all its not too deep and perhaps too accessible strategic limits, the RPG component comes as a breath of fresh air to make everything more interesting. The 14 game characters present can be freely modified and upgraded from their respective menus: the player chooses their main and secondary class, selects up to three skills to bring to the battlefield (he can modify them between one level and another, based to different situations), equip main weapon, armor and trinket with various bonuses. These last items, if desired, can also be purchased in exchange for pearls from the in-game shop. The parameters we have talked about modify the heroes' stats, making them stronger and specializing them in certain tasks. The technical sector of The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics, unfortunately, certainly does not cry out for a miracle: it is indeed just enough. The developers have also tried to follow a fidelity to the original work in the artistic direction; but we have arrived at a style halfway between cartoonish and grotesque, among other things characterized by bare environments, few elements on the screen, polygonal models that can be decidedly improved and, in some cases, even grainy. It may also be that these problems are only present on the Nintendo Switch version, and that elsewhere The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics is more beautiful to see; in any case, it is evidently a production with a limited budget and on which few people worked, animated by good will.", "date": "2020-02-10", "grade": "S.V."}
