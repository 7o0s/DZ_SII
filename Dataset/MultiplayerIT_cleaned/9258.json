The decision to make a remake of a similar product is somewhat singular, not only for the many years that have passed, but above all for the seminal value of Doug Neubauer's work. Frankly, the previous attempt with Yar's Revenge, of which you can read our review at this address, was anything but exciting, let's see how the software house Incenerator Studios behaved in the reinterpretation of this sacred monster. For newbies we are talking about a space simulator with a simple nature, as it is totally focused on frenetic battles between vehicles capable of treading the most hidden corners of the galaxy. Once again we find ourselves facing the extremely dangerous Zylons aliens, but to do this we must board the latest war invention of the Atar military academy. Are you ready to exterminate them permanently? You will come back here Our ship is able to take on three different battle arrangements, which also change considerably in shape, to be adapted to game situations. The classic one has a considerable paraphernalia but exposes the side to damage, the tank set up is ideal for attacking at close range. In fact, the campaign offers missions that alternate the classic fights against enemy ships with others that require the destruction of certain objectives, the player has the right to choose them through a galactic map, which also offers the possibility of repeating them to improve scores. To this are added the canonical upgrades that can be purchased in the shop available between one mission and another, as well as our captain's logs, functional as the glue of the narrative. Once launched into space, we have 360-degree freedom of movement, shields wear out quickly, but there is a special station on the map that can recharge them, provided you reach it. The tutorial to introduce the game mechanics is far from exemplary, since it overlooks the different key mappings assigned to the vehicle's assets, with the result that the player is forced to discover them on his own. The objectives are indicated quite correctly, but even here there are moments of confusion and disorientation, also due to poorly readable theses and a lack of basic information. Xbox 360 goals Star Raiders offers the canonical 12 objectives of the Live Arcade products, for a total of 200 player points. Being almost all based on the main campaign, it will not be difficult to achieve most of them. Completing the game rewards you with a hefty 50 points. Good luck... I will suffer from nostalgia The technical realization is surprisingly good for a product intended for digital delivery, with an excellent polygonal load, various effects, a pleasant color palette and 30 frames always guaranteed on the screen. Less appreciable, however, is the prevailing mediocrity of the design, which to define as uninspired is an understatement, everything is characterized by an approximate style, starting from the almost illegible texts, unpleasant menus and poor illustrations in the narrative interludes. Defects that would also be tolerable in the light of a rocky gameplay, but unfortunately this is not the case with Star Raiders. The aerial clashes never fail to excite, and represent a large part of the package, the controls are cumbersome, and the unhealthy idea of guaranteeing infinite lives (the missions are timed) makes it completely useless to reach the charging station for shields. The climax is the enemy motherships, the frigates, which must be shot down by hitting certain key points. Unfortunately, this too turns out to be a very tedious practice. On the other hand, the missions are numerous and make up a decidedly long campaign, as long as you survive the most fearsome enemy of this game, boredom.", "date": "2011-05-27", "grade": "4.0"}
