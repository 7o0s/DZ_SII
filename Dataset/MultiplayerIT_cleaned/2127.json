{"name": "Crazy Factory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-factory.html", "text": "The world at my feet As mentioned, Crazy Factory offers the possibility to newly graduated theorists to immediately manage, thanks to improbable coincidences, a company of variable dimensions, and to practice directly in the field in the tough struggle for survival. Something very similar to Economic War, at least as a setting. And in fact, as in the aforementioned title, you will have to take care of all the steps necessary for domination over the competition, without neglecting the slightest detail and with a vigilant and attentive gaze 24 hours a day. The title offers the most varied possibilities for achieving our goal, many more than any of you could imagine; but first things first .. Meanwhile, the missions are different, and of increasing difficulty. After a very well done initial intro and choosing our battlefield, we will generally be assigned some rather dilapidated sheds, ruined equipment and a whole rather 'uncertain' structure. Once we have rolled up our sleeves, all we have to do is start renovating everything, hiring staff as if it rained, installing new equipment (it's truly a great satisfaction to see an old, semi-destroyed table magically changed into a brand new hyper-technological one within 1 click), setting up more or less lawful strategies, randomly accusing all the other companies on the market of the most varied crimes (ranging from espionage to sabotage, etc.) and promptly remedying the various problems which, believe me, will not be long in appearing . The world at my feet In reality, it is not that simple, because if you have followed my instructions to the letter you have probably already seen your accountant in tears and the very sad bankruptcy screen. Once you regain some sense, you will discover that the possibilities offered by the title in question are truly varied, and that the more you intensify your operations the better it will be, especially for your budget. I invite you to try and write down on paper a certain number of possible choices that a company captain may have to make during his working day. Even the most imaginative of you will hardly guess all those present in CF. Once the production process has been defined (done in great detail, perhaps even too much), it will be good to deal with advertising. renting an airship or projecting our advertising film even on the moon, depending on whether we want to impress the emotional population rather than the technology-loving one. You won't have time to see the first products leave your production chain that you will immediately suffer sabotage, or some competitor will accuse you of espionage or other similar atrocities. So let's report, or why not, let's turn to the mafia, let's create black funds or cancel our accounts fearing a tax inspection, which will be better anticipated by requesting us over our opponents. Going from the inevitable spy and the mafioso, to bribing distributors and spreading malicious rumors and arriving at protecting your own factories, both on site and in court, you will find that to get rid of the competition you will have to sweat a lot, even in the most easy. In any case, as in EW, the levels are not sequential but you can start any one immediately... All in all, a great game! Perhaps not a must-have game, my nice friend, but an excellently made title, without a doubt. Starting from excellent graphics, made in a semi-cartoon style and with great attention to detail. As always, the models of your employees (read Slaves) are hilarious, animated in a very nice way (the researcher who spends her free time killing flies & mosquitoes is memorable). The game presents, as always in MonteCristo titles, a great immediacy, thanks to a very clear and intuitive interface and a game system designed to not make you waste too much time in the Tutorial, which is also quite well made. Here, too, an eye was thrown on the network game, with additional missions that are certainly not bad. As mentioned, the interface is both pleasantly graphic and very intuitive, and as usual also the various indicative panels leave nothing to chance. Any type of data you need to plan your strategy or any settings you need to set to increase profits is present in the indicators panel, in the ledger, rather than in the Finance Panel or in the Mail. All in all, a great game! Butwhat is probably the best aspect of the game is the large number, I would say almost disproportionate, of actions that you can take to your advantage or to the detriment of someone else. Each employee and each workstation has a myriad of options, which in addition to those already mentioned above which are part of the normal company policy ('normal' always according to the less legal canons of the Montecristo developers :) ) range from the refresher course, to the dismissal/hiring, the recruitment and soliciting of other people's employees, the motivation of one's own work sectors, the optimization of the various budgets rather than of a particular product, ending up with the inevitable threats to competitors and similar-brutal actions. Many are the same employees, with often hilarious characteristics and therefore a wide choice. But what MonteCristo has surpassed itself in is certainly the management of the products, truly detailed and cared for down to the smallest detail. In fact, there are only 3 products that can be made, and this discouraged me a bit from the outset. But the various components that can be made for the futuristic Toilets, the Jet Skates and the Domestic Robots (well yes..these are the 3 magnificent products) are really very many and at the beginning they will probably even make you confused. Finally, even the multimedia has been taken care of well, with convincing and nice sound effects (let's leave out the music, rather banal as usual) and with excellent quality videos, despite their rather limited number (I think they do not exceed 3-4 ). Rich game I stick to it.. Stop there! In reality, CF doesn't have any major flaws, if not the congenital one of being a title that doesn't have excessive pretensions and doesn't pass the threshold of the 'good game'. In any case, there are some unconvincing aspects, and you'd better read these too, my naive and impulsive friend. excessive difficulty, especially at levels that are supposed to be little more than tutorials. For most of you, this could actually be considered an asset in terms of longevity (although not very high), but I am left with the feeling that the developers could have calibrated this aspect better. In particular, it's really easy to fail. At first it will be practically impossible that NOT happen, given the eagerness to renew equipment or hire employees with slightly more reassuring descriptions such as ~Marco Ferretti: Close to the Pensione~ or ~Roberta Luani: Nice but disorganized~; but even after the first phase, failing will always remain very easy, and above all, a rather immediate thing. You can hardly save the day once you get the first notice of impending bankruptcy. Rich game I stick to it.. Another rather disconcerting aspect is the impressive speed in which the news appear (generally in the Post Office), even in the case of a mission with very few rival companies. It's really hard to be able to 'respond' to every event generated by the system, given the frenzy of the thing. I agree that very often there are more notifications than actual events, but the feeling of often being at the mercy of events remains. We were talking about situations with a few rival companies well, this is the norm, since competitors never exceed 4-5 units. Given the power of the aforementioned, they could also be enough, but a few more would not have hurt, especially in the theoretically more difficult levels. Speaking of graphics, it's hard to find faults.. very clean and detailed, as already said before; perhaps more could have been done regarding the size of the maps, and ABOVE ALL, you should have, in my opinion, diversified the layout of the sheds you own. In fact, what changes at the beginning of each mission will be the level of equipment or employees to start with, but the graphics of the establishments (I repeat, of the establishments in general, not of the various machines) are the same; ditto with regard to the arrangement of the various work sectors. We are at the usual .. never decide eh? In reality, these are more trifles than anything else. It's hard to think that Crazy Factory will disappoint you, above all for the almost obsessive care with which it was made in detail, both graphic andco that by design. The only real flaw that can be found is the one already pointed out earlier, namely the fact that it is still a decidedly limited game, which will not take you more than a few weeks in the most optimistic view. However, if the genre is among your favorites, and you have enjoyed Economic War, you will be on the safe side with this title, which was certainly made in a more convincing way than its 'cousin'. Don't expect a game that will keep you glued to your pc 24 hours a day, but if you're looking for something nice and well done, you won't be disappointed.. and at worst, you'll have satisfied your basest financial shark instincts! Introduction We have not yet finished establishing criminal relationships and launching missiles left and right for the leadership of our state that from the friendly MonteCristo comes another management software that is on the same wavelength as Economic War, moving to a less 'global' sector but no less fascinating. CF poses a disturbing generational problem.. what will you do once you have your beautiful piece of paper (read Degree) and you will have to throw yourself headlong into the dark and mysterious world of work? Start buying this title, and practice..", "date": "2002-05-11", "grade": null}
