{"name": "Roundguard", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/roundguard-recensione.html", "text": "In trying our hand at the Roundguard review we could not help but think of the classic Peggle, the 2007 Popcap Games title to which this peculiar RPG puzzle is clearly and evidently inspired, while introducing a series of new and interesting elements. In fact, it starts from a dungeon crawler-style fantasy setting, with the possibility of choosing our hero among three different characters (a warrior, a thief and a sorceress) and then face a path full of pitfalls relying on a single life . The goal is of course to get as far forward as possible, but to do so we will have to assimilate the mechanics of a gameplay that is only apparently simple and hides an unsuspected strategic depth. You probably already know the formula, a sort of curious mix between Puzzle Bobble and pachinko, but instead of spheres there are projections of the selected fighter, launched from a catapult towards any enemies present within the scenario. The physical attack can inflict variable damage depending on the weapon equipped and the class it belongs to, with a whole series of variables that mix the cards on the table from time to time; but it is above all the special abilities that hold the court, which clearly differentiate the protagonists. The title is available on Apple Arcade, which as you know costs just 4.99 euros per month, but also on PC via Steam (16.99 euros) , Xbox One (19.99 euros) and Nintendo Switch (16.99 euros). In short, there is no doubt which version is more convenient, especially since on iOS it is also possible to play with a Bluetooth controller, if desired, and there are obviously no microtransactions or in-app purchases of any kind. Gameplay and structure Following the branches of a path made up of many possible crossroads that lead to facing different opponents and situations, the Roundguard campaign asks us, as mentioned, to ~bounce~ in the scenario and to be quite skilled, making the most of any resource in order to overcome levels generated randomly and complete the various acts of the story, all with a single life available. The starting skills weigh a lot on the probability of success, and from this point of view the sorceress is undoubtedly the best choice : she can immediately count on a special power that allows her to emit lightning according to precise trajectories and in this way damage targets that are far beyond her rebound capacity. The situation of the warrior is quite different, who can in practice rely solely on the direct impact and on the possibility of amplifying its effects; or that of the thief, who can change direction in mid-air but still within the limited scope of a single maneuver. In any case, all the characters along the way level up, improve their stats and possibly acquire new special abilities, however being able to equip only two of them. The result is a deep gameplay, absolutely non-trivial and able to offer a level of challenge unsuspected: the experience proves to be very stimulating, improving as you play and gain awareness of the best moves to be able to destroy enemies and at the same time collect resources useful for restoring health and mana, the latter essential for activating powers. The technical sector is probably the only thing we didn't appreciate very much: the design of the characters and enemies is very particular and does not give the idea of a great artistic maturity, but above all the choice to create a sort of window delimited by two big chunks dedicated to the interface looks like a waste of space outright. On the other hand, the music is nice, very functional to the action.", "date": "2020-03-26", "grade": "8.0"}
