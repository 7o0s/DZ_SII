Not for the hype, not for its amount of content, not for the legacy that name carries on it. The difficulty lies in putting on paper the many and conflicting sensations that the more than twenty-five hours of play put on the scales, a real jumble of pros and cons to make your wrists tremble. Let's start right away with the first one. The story, the narrative quality of an extremely ambitious and stratified project which, as we all know, is divided into four campaigns for seven characters, four storylines that meet from time to time, often showing important junctures from different points of view, and which converge towards the pyrotechnic, epic and ~multiple~ final. The usual conspiracy... The narrative arc is told through numerous corollary videos of the most important sequences, but only when the last campaign is completed, that of Ada (if possible the best in the game) will you finally have an intelligible picture of the events. The story is decidedly inflated and full of deus ex machina, with the gigantic scale of events that brings us right into the Call of Duty area. Everything revolves around the most classic of internal American conspiracies, the one that sees the death of the ~zombified~ President during the Tall Oaks bioterrorist attack (complete with an obvious scapegoat), and terrorist attacks abroad to create conditions in favor of US world hegemony. It goes without saying that everything will go wrong, secret organizations and mysterious agents of chaos will appear, and the threat of the C-Virus will become global, with the risk of hell on earth made of mutants, zombies and regenerating and bubbling creatures that they seem to come from Cronenberg's sick mind. In short, nothing new. We won't say anything else here, the risk of spoilers is very high, with all the characters busy chasing each other from one place to another to get to the end in China. The best part of it all is in the topical sequences where the other characters fight and battle with us, setting off the ultimate team ups. The solution from an iconic point of view is undoubtedly successful, the epic is guaranteed, but it gives rise to a problem. For long stretches, given the choice to field the same events from multiple points of view, the title literally makes us replay entire sequences already dealt with previously, especially the long phases of boss battles. In this sense, the internal back tracking of the same story is virtually absent, however replaced by this new typology, which makes everything stretched, repetitive and taken for long. There are obviously decided variations on the theme, especially in Ada's campaign, but when, for example, after having spent a long time fighting a monstrous mutate armed with a chainsaw, we have to go back to colliding with him again, only changing the setting, we undoubtedly turn up our noses, also because the sense of satisfaction for the previous feat is canceled by having to repeat it again. Playstation 3 trophies Resident Evil 6 rewards us with 50 trophies, obviously related not only to overcoming each single chapter and finishing the game at all difficulty levels, but above all to carrying out particular actions, such as for example rescuing your partner ten times or maybe doing dash ten enemies from elevated positions. In this sense, it is very challenging to maximize all the perks, collect all the emblems of the Simmons family, but it will undoubtedly be easier to use all the weapons in the game and eliminate ten enemies with each gun. Six characters in search of atmosphere But who are the protagonists of Resident Evil 6? Capcom has chosen an encyclopedic approach to choosing the actors of the game, trying to bring to light the different souls of the franchise. The couple Leon Kennedy - Helena Harper is the one to which the role of staging (quoting Capcom's words in the announcement) is assigned the most gothic horror part of Resident Evil 6, with the result, however, of expiring for long stretches in a uninspiring fan service with few ideas. The first four hours are a mix without particular flashes of the Resident Evil that was. There is everything: the silent corridors, the flashes that illuminate the environment, the city under siege, the catacombs, the cemetery, the underground temple, the collapses, the desperate escapes and the long swims in apnea. Stuff to send the most elderly fans into jujube soup, but the feeling is that everything is free and untied, and even more serious without a shred of atmosphere. Also because the shooter dynamics mixed with those of fighting games cancel out any fearful or terr ambitionshovering, and when you have to turn the nth lever, find the nth statuette or worse escape from a mutated shark by shooting at a gigantic bin with TNT written on it as if we were in a Wile Coyote cartoon, the slender survival horror scaffolding falls disastrously to the ground showing obvious limitations of writing. The developers have entrusted Chris Redfield - Piers Nivans with the task instead of exploring and expanding the now clear and in some ways complete third-person shooter nature of Resident Evil 6. The two members of the BSSA allow us to talk about the most successful component of the game, i.e. the revamped combat system. All the protagonists can finally move and shoot, making perfect use of the articulated weak points of the enemies. It's not just about hitting the generously marked foci of infection on their bodies, it's about unleashing the lead - melee combo. For example, by hitting an enemy's arm we can stun him briefly or make him spin for a moment and if we are close enough to kill him with a series of kicks and punches. We can also make instant kills thanks to the often very weak artificial intelligence of the enemies or perform lightning-fast counter-moves if you are quick to push the R1 key. Very cleverly Capcom has inserted a stamina bar that decreases rapidly to prevent the fights from becoming a sort of horror re-edition of a fighting game, so you always need to establish a strategy when you are outnumbered, keeping in mind that starting from normal difficulty level ammunition is scarce (watch out when you die, you start again with what you had in your pocket at the time of your departure!) which from a survival horror point of view is perfectly understandable, less so when it is now clear to be dropped in a finished third-person shooter, complete with cumbersome cover and surrounded by dozens of enemies. The solution is therefore only, to start running like madmen through the levels in search of ammunition crates, but this highlights another critical issue. The generous models of the protagonists occupy a very large portion of the screen as the camera is too low on the scene. In fact, the point of view is constantly in crisis by hiding the opponent's attacks, and if we add to this a level design that for a long time leads us to fight in the narrow spaces of the labyrinthine Chinese buildings there is a real risk of suffering blows after blows because you literally don't have the big picture of the situation. Without forgetting a marked ~woodiness~ of the characters, as agile in kicking enemies as they are awkward in extricating themselves from the most crowded situations. To remedy this situation it is possible to perform the so-called Quick Shot with firearms, an automatic shot towards the closest enemy, however at the cost of part of the stamina, in short, better not to abuse it. With great joy, the situation changes when the environments expand, in this sense the second part of the adventure is less plagued by this problem, but more often than not nothing can be done. And if this happens against the numerous and complex bosses, well, there's little to add. Call of Evil During the campaigns, hidden in the chests or after killing particularly difficult creatures, the game makes us collect pawns of various values which represent the hard cash to be spent to increase the characteristics of the various characters. The choice is very wide and involves all the key sectors of the gameplay. Increased damage resistance, more melee strength, more chances for enemies to drop ammo, oversized magazines, double rations of grass from the companion, and much more. Initially we start with only a slot for three perks, but with the progression in the campaigns we are given the opportunity to unlock seven more, for a total of twenty-four perks, to be ~turned on~ and ~turned off~ depending on the character you are playing. impersonating. The choice must be careful since the upgrade of a single perk costs a lot, so be careful how to spend the accumulated points. The reckoning The third campaign, that of the couple Jake - Sherry Birkin is made on purpose to enhance the combat system, also because the enigmatic Jake in addition to the lead can count on extra physical attacks, intended as a real secondary weapon to be selected in the inventory. It's not about simple kicks and punches, but about extra finishing moves and charged shots, and more generally the character has a more durable stamina which therefore favors melee. Here too the focus is that of the shooter, but the possibility of varying the attack dynamics more effectively limanor undoubtedly the chronic repetitiveness of the game. Up to the exciting finale in which the character's nature is exploited properly, if possible in the best successful battle of the title. Here too, however, the problems are always the same, but thanks to a character that is significantly different from the others, even from a characterization point of view, his story is the one that reaches the end with fewer hitches and that manages to entertain better than the tired fan Leon's service and Chris' troubled shooter. The last story, that of Ada Wong, throws into the mix two components that make the general tone of Resident Evil 6 take a leap in quality. We are certainly not talking about solutions and gimmicks that make the title an all-round masterpiece, but which certainly work better and make everything more compact and exciting. We are talking about a stealth component that finally goes beyond the instant kills of the other protagonists, necessary to make up for the constant numerical inferiority in which the protagonist finds herself, especially in the very early stages, and a couple of puzzles that take us back in time, nothing so tearing your clothes off is understood, but that at least I'm not the usual find the key or compose the emblem, situations that are present in any case and reiterated in the three campaigns. In addition, his crossbow with normal or explosive darts allows us to play the shooter phases in the best possible way, thus being able to take advantage of the variety of situations that can be triggered. As previously written, Ada's vicissitudes allow us to finally have a complete picture of the story, not without small winks to the fans who finally work and are not cloying. Some sections are frankly avoidable, especially towards the end, but in general it is the best balanced campaign, shorter and with less dilated times. The flaws don't end there though. The forced repetitiveness is paired with the exhausting and continuous use of quick time events. If this solution were relative to the moments in which one is grabbed by the enemies or to turn the anachronistic cranks again, there would be nothing wrong, but entire sections, even the most important, critical and delicate ones, force us to suffer whole minutes in which either raping the left stick or rhythmically pressing L1 and R1 with the only result of destroying any pathos. All repeated over and over again and in all sorts of ways, staging some of the most comically involuntary situations in recent years. It is possible to limit the invasiveness of the quick time events by lowering the difficulty level to a minimum and making them little more than automatic, but this involves a total imbalance of the game dynamics, with reduced damage and profusion of bullets. A pity therefore that there is not something intermediate, also because Resident Evil 6 allows us to deeply customize the gameplay when entering the game with numerous variations. Like at the cinema Where the game literally explodes, and in this the franchise has really accustomed us well is in the boss fights. The gigantic mutated Ustanak that we have seen recently, the one with the mechanical arm and the bandage on his face is just the appetizer of the abundant menu prepared by Capcom. They are huge, and by huge we often mean as tall as buildings, all with different attack patterns and different mutations and transformations to punctuate the fight. The developers have done everything to try to make the long battles as varied as possible, dividing them into several stages, even changing the areas of the clashes. Undoubtedly very exciting, with Chris' grueling and truly epic finale and that of the aforementioned Jake as the high point of Capcom's effort. Obviously, given the interlocking structure of the four stories, they are far too spread out within the campaigns, almost a sort of ~boss rush~, losing a little their being the ~special~ dramatic peak in the game economy, but more generally represent the best the series has offered so far. And above all they are also well thought out and structured in the staging of the battle: it is not just a question of hitting clearly visible weak points, their ~choreographies~ are undoubtedly a flagship of the production. In short, the real fault of this Resident Evil 6, leaving aside the survival / action dispute, lies in wanting to do a little bit of everything, without ultimately doing practically nothing in an exceptional way so as to detach itself from the competition that inspired it. Resident Evil 6 loses the connotations of a seminal franchise to transform itself into a pure shooter that stumbles over the basic cornerstones of the typical mechanics of the genre, seasoning everything with the typical stylistic features of the saga, while remaining in a l", "date": "2012-10-01", "grade": "8.0"}
