{"name": "Scribblenauts Unlimited", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/114292-scribblenauts-unlimited-una-parola-ci-salvera.html", "text": "Once upon a time there were two lovers, Edgar and Julie, who decided to settle in the countryside and start a very large family. Forty-two children were born from this union, and each of them was gifted with a magical object. What Maxwell received, we know, was a very special notebook, which allowed its owner to create any object that came to his mind simply by writing its name. Well, these many brothers grew up to be naughty and mischievous, and they decided to use their abilities selfishly. Even Maxwell began playing bad jokes using his notebook, and one day he fed an old beggar a rotten apple. The elder went into a rage and placed a curse on the boy's sister Lily: if Maxwell had not completed a certain number of good deeds, collecting starite fragments as a reward, Lily would have turned into a stone statue . This is the incipit of Scribblenauts Unlimited, which marks the debut of the 5TH Cell series on home consoles thanks to the Wii U version. It took some time for the game to enjoy a European distribution, given the huge localization work necessary to translate the many terms that now make up the vocabulary to which the protagonist's notebook refers, but now we are there and we can verify how many and what novelties await us, as well as if the experience can really be defined as ~unlimited~. What is the second screen? Tell the truth: how many times have you dreamed of a title like Scribblenauts Unlimited, which allows you to give vent to your imagination and create a monster, a giant robot, an attack helicopter or many other things from nothing and use them in order to solve the puzzles that are proposed to us from time to time? The potential of the series is practically boundless, yet since the inception the boys of 5TH Cell have not been able to keep these wonderful promises, now running into a control system that is not up to par, now in a fluctuating interpretation of the puzzles. Can the Wii U version guarantee a course change? Well, certainly the first impact leaves a bit dumbfounded. The developers found themselves for the first time dealing with two distinct and separate screens, specifically that of the TV and that of the GamePad, and were unable to exploit this configuration to their advantage. If in fact it is possible to control the character in the traditional way and make him explore the scenario, every time we use the notebook we have to move our gaze to the controller display, which reproduces in practice the exact same graphics. In short, you can play very well without looking at the TV but you absolutely cannot do the opposite, which will lead us to switch to the ~TV off~ option after only a few minutes and enjoy the game as if we were using, once again, a portable console. An inconvenience that could have been avoided simply by displaying only the keyboard in ~normal~ mode on the GamePad, for example. Thankfully, the show is anything but unpleasant, thanks to high definition, a vibrant use of color, the now unique style of the franchise and a nice soundtrack. A world to explore The structure of Scribblenauts Unlimited sees us collect starite fragments in various stages, each with a large number of puzzles to solve, for a total of about four hundred small missions. Every time we exceed a certain amount of fragments, we can access new areas through a map similar to that of the classic Super Mario World, which can be recalled at any time. It is an approach that guarantees incredible speed to the action, allowing us to try our hand at some puzzles in a given level, then quickly move on to other ones, even and above all when perhaps we are stuck with a puzzle and cannot understand what the game want us to do. This element, certainly known to those who have already tried the previous episodes of Scribblenauts, inevitably ends up limiting the enjoyment of the experience, as the problems do not necessarily have to be solved with logic, but by trying to get into the head of whoever created them. A few small examples: during one of the first missions we found ourselves having to assist a doctor who had to repair some mannequins. We gave him a wrench, then a screwdriver, but the right item was actuallymedicines. Yes, a mannequin that heals with medicines: how could we not think about it? The puzzle solving system, as per tradition, releases rather clear suggestions after a certain number of minutes on how to proceed, thereforeu and actually staying still will be difficult; all the more reason given that, interpretations aside, the level of challenge is quite low. Monsters, zombies, Mario and Zelda Each zone unlocked in the game presents not only individual people in difficulty, but also relatively broader ~thematic~ quests, in which we will find ourselves assisting patients in a hospital, defending a fire station from zombie attack or solving dilemmas of a group of vampires, ghosts and werewolves. As we know, the WIi U version of Scribblenauts Unlimited includes the exclusive possibility of recalling the most famous Nintendo characters, which according to the characteristics we can use to save ourselves in some situations. This is a pleasant extra for fans of Mario, Link and Princess Zelda, but it is clear that it is nothing more than that. The object editor is different, which for the first time in the series allows us to combine pre-existing characters and materials to create something new, which can also be shared with the community with a view to solving particularly obscure puzzles. The options in this regard are numerous: not only sizes, colors and shapes can be determined, but also behavioral routines. It is a pity that this feature in the end is not very interesting for the purpose of advancing in the adventure, or that it has not been done in such a way as to make it indispensable in some situations, clearly supporting such eventualities with appropriate indications (which, on the other hand, are absent).", "date": "2013-02-04", "grade": "7.0"}
