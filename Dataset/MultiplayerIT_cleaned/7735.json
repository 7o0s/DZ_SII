Completely in Japanese, you didn't understand anything about the plot and to decipher the complicated menus you helped yourself with the first guides on the net and the katakana dictionary. However, they had an irresistible charm for those who had grown up on Japanese bread and robots: seeing one's favorites fight, albeit in a super deformed version, was real fun and the elaborate sequences of their special shots were seen every time with a sinking heart. Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, some Super Robot Wars in the West have also arrived and these crossovers have been seen more and more often. What does all this have to do with Project X Zone? Well, first of all it's developed by Banpresto in tandem with Monolith Soft, and then it's a crazy crossover just like Super Robot Wars. But is it also a good game? Previously on Fringe... In reality, Project X Zone is a direct sequel to Namco X Capcom, a very similar strategy released in 2005 for PlayStation 2 and never landed in the West, perhaps also due to the cold reception received even at home. Project X Zone tries to remedy all the mistakes of its predecessor, on which it does not rely too much: there are new characters introduced in Namco X Capcom, like Reiji and Xiaomu, and some make more or less vague references to the adventures they spent together, but with all the crossovers that have taken place in recent years - just think of Marvel Vs Capcom or Street Fighter X Tekken - one could easily pretend that the meetings took place there and greetings. In reality, justifying the absurd plot of Project X Zone makes no sense, and neither do its own writers: the basic idea is that a company of mysterious villains is weakening the fabric of reality by crossing completely random the various parallel universes of Capcom, SEGA, Banpresto and Namco Bandai. Our heroes meet in these moments of contact and begin a reluctant journey from one universe to another in an attempt to put an end to all this chaos. The story is told entirely through the dialogues between the characters, sometimes recited in Japanese and sometimes not, but still written completely in English: the quality of the localization, for those who understand the Bard's language, is exceptional. The translators had a blast peppering every dialogue or interaction with puns, jokes, references and quotes from this or that game, many of which only avid fans of the franchises involved will guess. The exchanges between the characters, although often far too long-winded, always prove irresistible, and a discreet glossary allows us to delve into the history and meaning of terms, places and characters with whom we are not familiar. Playing Project X Zone for the story, however, would be very wrong: the plot is ridiculous, a simple pretext to lead the player through forty missions in which he will be able to control more and more characters, witnessing absolutely improbable interactions between one fight and another. Thankfully, there's also more than solid gameplay to counterbalance the hilarious nonsense of the plot. Battles in the multiverse On the surface, Project X Zone may look very similar to Intelligent Systems' recent masterpiece, Fire Emblem: Awakening. On an isometric map divided into boxes, the sprites representing our pairs of units move and when an enemy enters their range of action, it is possible to attack him. The couples are fixed and predefined: Ryu will always fight together with Ken, Megaman X will always fight with Zero, Frank West and Hsien-Ko are inseparable and so on. Each pair can be associated with a third support unit of your choice: the latter gives various bonuses and expands the list of skills that can be used on the field, practically the ~spells~ of the game. Each pair can also be equipped with up to two accessories that will modify their parameters, perhaps increasing their life points or attack power. If so far it doesn't seem like anything particularly different from any turn-based strategy game, it's because we haven't talked about the combat system yet. Once we have chosen the enemy to attack, the game will display a two-dimensional battlefield where our characters will face the enemy. The fight is fully interactive: the player presses the A key in combinationand with the d-pad to carry out different sequences of attacks. Each combination corresponds to a different one, which perhaps repeats the most famous combos or special attacks of the characters concerned. Now comes the fun part, because in essence Project X Zone is played like a kind of fighting game: the sprites of the characters and enemies have a real ~hitbox~ and you have to learn the animations well if you want to hit the helpless enemy a moment before hits the ground, dealing critical damage and increasing your Cross Power, or XP, faster. The latter is the strategic heart of Project X Zone: everything revolves around it. Reached 100% it is possible to download it entirely by hurling a spectacular cinematic attack at the enemy, or you can keep it because at the end of the battle it also represents the bonus in experience points earned by our unit. On top of that, normal hits and critical hits do not increase its value above 100%: this is where support units and pairs in our range come into play when attacking an enemy. By pressing the back buttons it is possible to summon these extra characters into battle, whose intervention will ~lock~ the enemy in mid-air for a short period of time, during which it is possible to increase the indicator up to 150%. Ironically, Skills also consume small portions of the XP bar, as well as our reactions when the enemy attacks our units, such as defending and counterattacking. Within a few missions, Cross Power management becomes absolutely crucial. You have to decide whether to consume it to inflict a lot of damage to the miniboss of the moment to reduce his huge amount of life points, or keep it to increase the level faster or parry the attack of a particularly ferocious enemy. Soon, even the layout of the units takes on great importance, especially in the maps littered with chests and optional mini-bosses. In short, there is no shortage of complexity. The 3D effect Except for the fully polygonal maps, Project X Zone is an entirely two-dimensional game that uses the stereoscopic effect to bring out the illustrations of the characters during dialogues or cinematic attacks. On a practical level it is useless, in short, and from a visual point of view it is not always effective: it is pleasant and nothing more. Who goes slow... Project X Zone is a very long adventure: up to forty or fifty hours of play are needed to complete the forty missions, because already from the tenth one onwards you face battles that can last even more than two hours, in which dozens of and dozens of enemies, mini-bosses and final bosses. A practical quick save function allows us to interrupt the game at any time, but it must be admitted that the concentration required for the fights, and the intrinsic repetitiveness of the gameplay itself, tend to make longer game sessions rather exhausting. In this sense, Project X Zone is bloody fun, but it can also be a bit boring, especially when it seems to us that we have completed a mission only to see the bad guy on duty summon another twenty enemies armed to the teeth and with somewhat questionable artificial intelligence. This is not a really demanding challenge, although the advanced missions can give you a bit of a hard time if you don't think well about positioning and consumption of Cross Power; more than anything else, Project X Zone inherits the more predictable enemy tactics from Super Robot Wars, such as enemies not moving until you get close enough or eliminate all those of lower rank. Fortunately, the title signed by Banpresto and Monolith Software remains a feast for the eyes and ears from the first to the last minute: there are countless remixes of the most famous songs belonging to the various franchises, and the Japanese dubbing translates into a cacophony of howls and sound bites that enhance every fight or special attack. The care taken in the creation of the sprites and their very fluid animations, or in that of the locations extrapolated from the original titles, are commendable. Project X Zone may appear antiquated when compared to the fully polygonal battles of Fire Emblem: Awakening, but its a 2D that is not easy to forget. Project X Zone is a strategic RPG that will delight the most ardent fans of the franchises involved", "date": "2013-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
