As far as the Sony platform is concerned, nothing can be said from a numerical point of view, but among the various Arizona Sunshine, Farpoint and company, until today a representative in a multiplayer key was missing: the experiences that we were able to live were in fact all confined to our living room, with no great possibility of crossing the domestic boundaries. For this reason, although the name of First Contact Entertainment was unknown to most, when Firewall Zero Hour was announced at PlayStation Experience 2017, a spark of hope lit in the eyes of many PlayStation VR owners. As we later learned, the development team behind Firewall Zero Hour can actually be considered trustworthy, given the curriculum of many of its members linked to past leading projects in Treyarch and Activision Blizzard. In short, there seem to be enough elements to hope for the best: we just have to see in our review if Firewall Zero Hour manages to keep its promises once the headset is worn. The modalities: a lot online and a little offline Since our previous encounter with Firewall Zero Hour, we have not hesitated to compare this game to Rainbow Six Siege. In fact, the work of First Contact Entertainment shares with the famous Ubisoft title not only the type of setting and general idea of gameplay, but in its small way it also has the ambition to become an online reference point as a tactical shooter. All with due proportions, given that Firewall Zero Hour is aimed at owners of PlayStation VR and therefore at an installed base of three million units, far from the figures available to Rainbow Six Siege itself between PC and console. Even if some may turn up their noses, for this reason the developers' decision to focus at least from the outset on Contracts, the only main method with which to collect all Firewall Zero Hour owners, seems sensible. The basic concept sees two teams of four players, divided between attack and defense: whoever takes care of the first must reach one of the two firewalls present in the map to identify the position of the final objective (a PC from which to transmit data), while the second must prevent this from happening. The match can also end with the elimination of all attackers, forced to be particularly careful by the absence of respawns during the match. If the mode is unique, thankfully the maps are different: nine in total, equally divided between the Middle East, the United Kingdom and Russia. Their environments quite recall those of Rainbow Six Siege, while not sharing their depth in terms of elements that can be destroyed. Allowing too much in this sense could perhaps have been counterproductive, given the need to deal with the limits currently imposed by virtual reality in terms of movement. The offline component is reduced to a short tutorial dedicated to the commands, and a training mode in which you face waves of bots: thanks to the lack of intelligence of the latter, after an initial half hour of acclimatization you will find yourself in the online mode, where Firewall Zero Hour can be enjoyed at its best. The gameplay: bullets ever so real The moment Firewall Zero Hour opens up a whole new world to PlayStation VR wearers is when the first online match begins. The so-called ~wow effect~ is not long in coming right from the start, especially if you have an Aim Controller which for obvious reasons is the reference peripheral for those who want to play Firewall Zero Hour. Provided you have enough space in the gaming position, freedom of movement is an additional factor of involvement. In a short time you realize how everything that was reproduced without virtual reality with the push of a button now becomes real: you therefore find yourself really leaning out from a corner to look into a room, ducking down to seek cover or raising the weapon for blind shooting. In such a situation, even the bullets flying over our heads seem more real, fueling a sense of tension never experienced with normal games. Going back to the controller, if you only have a DualShock 4 (PlayStation Move is not supported) don't despair: the game is still enjoyable even without the Aim Controller, provided you accept the idea of putting a joypad in front of your nose to shoot. What you really can't do without is the intration with the other players, necessary to be able to coordinate in both phases of the game: the presence of headset and microphone as standard in PlayStation VR encourages their use, but be aware that if you are shy and unaccustomed to communication Firewall Zero Hour may not do it for you. However, the community of players is well disposed towards novices, who, with exceptions, are properly supported in the initial stages. Also because once you're dead, you still have a way of being useful to the rest of the team, with the ability to check some cameras, thus obtaining information on the passage of your opponents in particular places on the map. Considering the various waiting times between matchmaking and the start of the game, we would have liked to see longer matches, as at least for now they are limited to just one round. It is good to remember at this point that the game offers twelve different types of mercenaries (six at the beginning), each of which has a particular ability: by accumulating experience it is possible to unlock the rest of the group and new weapons, but keep in mind that if you want get everything and immediately you will have to spend some extra time in Firewall Zero Hour. Playstation 4 trophies Firewall Zero Hour has a total of twenty-seven Trophies, of which six Gold, ten Silver and ten Bronze together with the inevitable Platinum. To get them all you have to get busy both alone and in the company of other players, performing feats such as reaching five hundred headshots (!) and unlocking all the weapons in the game. Graphics and Sound: One of the best on PlayStation VR The main merit that must be recognized to First Contact Entertainment is that of having set up a gaming experience that is credible in virtual reality, to the point of making the player forget the most common problems that concern it. Such a goal can only be achieved by paying particular attention to the technical aspects: Firewall Zero Hour therefore combines a flawless control system with high-level graphics, at least by the standards of PlayStation VR. Going around the maps it is possible to appreciate the attention paid by the developers to the details, noting even in those with richer environments the absence of excessive aliasing which distinguishes some similar titles. Net of some animation due to the movements of the controller, the models of the characters are also of good quality, with a management of the physics that prevents their penetration when passing through a narrow place such as a door. The sound does its job, allowing the player to strain to hear footsteps and gunshots in the headphones realizing their proximity. Upon completion we find a dubbing entirely in Italian as well as all the texts present in Firewall Zero Hour, even if to communicate with all the players it is still necessary to know a minimum of English.", "date": "2018-09-13", "grade": "8.2"}
