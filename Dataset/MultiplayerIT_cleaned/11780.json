The direction is emotionally engaging, with a typical Hollywood film choreography: the music is pressing, the events and the conflict with it. The incipit of the story, the drama of a woman left alone at home waiting for her husband in the war, serves to amalgamate and make the clashes in the skies that we are about to fight credible. The Japanese are masters at making every event spectacular, and the dramatic exaggeration contributes to our ego identification with the pilot we will play throughout the conflict. The graphics sector is top-notch, absolutely next-gen Take my breath away The graphics sector is top notch, absolutely next-gen, with very well made polygonal models, effects and above all an extremely realistic and spot on color palette. The ground is no longer pixilated and poorly defined as in previous editions, but is photographed directly from satellite images: from above the effect is wonderful, even if obviously when you get to a few meters above the ground the image loses definition. The cities are full of palaces, houses, constructions and bridges that stretch as far as the eye can see, with extremely high-quality textures and a convincing HDR on the horizon: the scenography is always excellent and well-constructed, designed to excite and create a frame fulfilling in every level. Even the music deserves applause, reminiscent in style and sound of Metal Gears Solid 2 composed by Harry Gregson Williams, are very well performed and orchestrated. The sound sector is also well done, but on the other hand Namco has an almost infinite database of sound effects after five chapters of Ace Combat. Ace Combat 6 is set in an imaginary near future, where a nation called Estovakia, which not too vaguely resembles today's Russia, has fallen under strict military control and threatens to invade the peaceful neighbors of the Republic of Emmeria, which vaguely refers to the United States. We are a fighter pilot of this great nation and our mission will be to counter the enemy advance and take back the reins of democracy. In a nutshell, the incipit is what is repeated in almost all Ace Combat, from time immemorial, and serves to justify the war we are about to fight, to give it a moral, an identity, a meaning. The story is also quite articulated: to be an air fighter game Namco has taken care of every aspect, trying to create a truly complete package from all points of view. Starting to play, you can choose between a more Arcade control system, ie immediate, or simulative, with slightly more complex and advanced commands. The first solution is certainly preferable for those approaching this series for the first time, it allows you to immediately fly any fighter without too much difficulty, and it is also very fun and rewarding. The game mechanics of Ace Combat have been the same for years now, so those who have followed this game through its previous episodes on Playstation will be tempted to start immediately with the simulation controls. Each aircraft has its own precise handling, speed and movements Ace Combat 6, unlike the ~old~ Over G-Fighter that appeared more than a year ago on Xbox 360, is more docile to handle and less demanding, compared to the Taito title which was decidedly less tameable. The simulation of the reactions of the aircraft is well done, and the difference between a Mirage, an F16 and an F14 is felt on the skin, as soon as the pad is held. Each aircraft has its own precise handling, speed and movement. Final Evolution One of the strengths of this Ace Combat is represented precisely by what was the weakness of the last chapters: the level design. In Fires of Liberation one immediately feels catapulted into a huge battlefield, and the war is palpable and real as never before. The levels are very well diversified, there is not even one similar to the other and you go from the classic city to the rocky mountains, passing through the tundra, the snow or beautiful sunsets over the ocean. You can appreciate some of the most beautiful panoramas ever seen in a video game, breathtaking glimpses, with a horizon of unprecedented depth, details everywhere but above all warm and true lights. The missions are decidedly long and demanding, and the system automatically saves in certain ~mid-points~ between one level and another: in the more advanced levels it is not uncommon to have to start fighting again from one of these save points, and the desire to have more becomes more and more intense when we find ourselves having to start over a mission that lasted a good half hour.In Fires of Liberation one immediately feels catapulted into a huge battlefield, and the war is palpable and real Final Evolution Namco's game is finished in every remote corner, there are no obvious glitches, pop-ups or failures of the graphics engine, which is always efficient. We are obviously talking about an evolution, not a revolution. In fact, this seems to be the keyword to describe the sixth chapter of Ace Combat: every aspect of the previous chapters has been perfected, improved and brought to the next-gen, starting from the graphics, passing through the attention to detail and history, up to online multiplayer , now inevitable on Xbox 360. The only factor that has remained unchanged is the gameplay, always very similar every year. But after all, it is precisely the aspect that made Ace Combat successful. Comment Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation succeeds in rejuvenating a series that has reached its umpteenth appearance on consoles thanks to two main factors. It is the first next-gen chapter, with a first-rate graphic sector: skies, environments and planes enjoy a definition and detail never seen in a game of the genre. Secondly, the online multiplayer is fresh, new and tremendously addictive, while maintaining a gameplay unchanged for years, known and tamed by all. Ace Combat 6 is a complete video game, well built, technically excellent but above all fun, a quality that is not insignificant. Pros Great graphics Online multiplayer Level design Cons No joystick in Italy Autosaves The gameplay hasn't changed for years Multiplayer Online and co-op Ace Combat 6 allows up to 16 friends to engage in thrilling online aerial battles  with Xbox Live support, of course. Wearing headphones has never been so realistic: it is done just as if we were on board a fighter. There are missions to be tackled with a friend in co-op, interesting but decidedly negligible, to be done essentially to unlock some objectives, but the real gist of the multiplayer is the team ~Battle Match~, up to 8 against 8. You choose a faction, the map, and you start knocking down enemy after enemy: once hit you restart from a respawn point decided by the CPU and continue the war. Each kill obtained earns us points, and at the end of the pre-established time, obviously, whoever has accumulated the most wins. Ace Combat 6 lets up to 16 of your friends compete in thrilling online aerial battles Initially there is some difficulty in ~understanding~ how to move and how to face 8 enemies. The story mode has accustomed us to an enemy AI managed by the CPU which, despite being good, is obviously not comparable to the human one, infinitely more acute and tactical. The gameplay of Ace Combat thus totally changes: for most of the time, online, you have to try to avoid enemy missiles that are chasing you from behind, adopting advanced ~dogfight~ techniques that over time we will learn to master and refine. The multiplayer is a continuous defense-attack, tremendously reasoned and tactical, but above all satisfying and fun. A sore point for Italian fans, however, comes from Atari, distributor of the game, which has not confirmed the release of the bundle with the stick in our country, officially for reasons of too high costs for our market. The peripheral, already a dowry to American users, is certainly not perfect due to the lack of some important movements for an aircraft game such as ~twist~, but perhaps it would also have been appreciated by some Italian players. Xbox 360 - Goals There are 49 achievements to unlock in Ace Combat 6, 5 of which are secret. As the story progresses we will be able to get very few points, 10 for each level, with a final bonus for completing the game. Most of the objectives are to be unlocked by obtaining aircraft and liveries, performing particular maneuvers but above all by playing online in multiplayer and co-op. Destroying enemy planes and winning games is essential to get the fateful 1000 points, never as difficult and long as in this game to unlock completely.", "date": "2007-11-29", "grade": null}
