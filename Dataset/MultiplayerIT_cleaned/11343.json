{"name": "Battlefield: Bad Company - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlefield-bad-company-recensione.html", "text": "What a story guys! Marlow ends up in the Bad Company, a group of four soldiers whose sole task is to be cannon fodder, open the flank of enemy troops at any cost, and allow the advance of regular American troops. The opponents appear to be Russians, in fact, it soon turns out that our heroes are fighting a group of ruthless mercenaries, whose leader pays the troops in gold bars. Once officially abandoned by the regular army, due to an event that we are not here to tell you about, the four fellow soldiers have nothing to do but save their pens and bring home as much gold as possible. The search for gold is actually a rather functional pretext to push the player to explore every corner of the maps which are the largest ever seen in a single player game of this type on consoles. Each level is set in a truly immense area that must be explored by zone according to the missions to be accomplished. An indicator tells us where the main objectives to be achieved are, but how and when are the total prerogative of the player, always remaining within the limits of the area open from time to time for the single mission. Means are back, of course, from tanks to heavy tracks, from boats to helicopters, even passing through the electric cars that inhabit golf courses all over the world. The initial hilly ups and downs of the first setting gives way to canyons, rivers and mountains on which you are free to follow your own path, knocking down houses and trees, in search of weapons, ammunition and, of course, gold. One often feels completely in control of the situation, able to trace trajectories and strategies, having the backdrop and being able to bend it to one's creativity with the regret of a rather questionable choice in terms of game design. In fact, when we die, the enemies we have already killed do not return, allowing us, except in cases in which we risk running out of ammunition (which we have to sweat to have, in several cases), to throw ourselves headlong, killing everyone little by little. without forgetting that Marlow can heal himself at regular intervals, using the special kit which restores his vital energy and which never runs out. So much so that we strongly recommend playing Bad Company on the highest difficulty level, also to fully enjoy the discreet Artificial Intelligence of the terrorists which, except for rare skids, really allows you to put your strategic skills to the test. The game ends in about ten hours at a basic level and, also given the presence in the story of the four soldiers, it is not clear why the programmer team did not incorporate the 4-player coop, which would have been an icing on a cake already very delicious. The big network The flagship of Battlefield has always been the online game and this time up to 24 players can challenge each other divided into two teams of 12: one that defends four bases, each with a pair of gold boxes; the other who desperately tries to destroy them. The eight maps are very large, and as pairs of crates are destroyed at defense bases, they open up to more terrain, revealing a new defensive base and new geography. The attacking team has an indicator that decreases each time one of its members dies, until the turn ends either with the destruction of all 8 crates or with the victory of the defending team, by dint of killing the attackers. The Dice confirm a truly questionable choice for the final version of the game. Teams of 12 players are automatically divided into 3 sub-teams of 4 soldiers, sub-teams that cannot communicate with each other in any way. Therefore, quite often you will find yourself aboard a chariot piloted by one of your companions, with whom, however, there is no way to speak, to decide a strategy or to signal the presence of an enemy, because he is part of a other sub team. In Bad Company there were all the elements to worry his majesty Call of Duty 4, taking advantage of the unique characteristics of this new chapter, especially in terms of group strategy. This choice, in fact, limits a little, and precisely in its most important aspect, the possibilities of what is still a game that can be as exciting as few others, also due to the excellent career progression system of your persistent avatar , which rises through the military ranks after each game, unlocking weapons and accessories. The possibility of taking photos by pressing the directional cross upwards is nice, photos that are immediately uploaded to the Electronic Arts servers. Watch out for the lag, however, since the operation saturates the outgoing bandwidth, causing obvious slowdownswith moments of panic and subsequent certain death. So try not to abuse it. The big network (almost) total destruction. The settings of BFBC are really convincing, either for the excellent use of the lights, or for the design of the maps which alternate phases of furious struggle with others in which you find yourself at sunset at the wheel of the most diverse vehicles enjoying the panoramas and buildings or rubble. The sensation of freedom is great, on condition that you fly over some structure that occasionally does not react as it should to the impact of bombs and missiles (not exploding, perhaps), and to overcome the discovery that, given the breadth of the scenarios and the great interactivity, the interiors of the thousand houses are all practically bare of furniture and almost all with the same textures for wallpaper and wooden surfaces. Seeing the thousand particles into which bricks and walls crash gives a real pleasure of war, with which it is right to spend several moments of pure play, without slowdowns of any kind and with only some problems of vertical synchrony of the image in the most chaotic moments . But these are truly negligible events, for a game that certainly has a great impact, also due to the detail with which the soldier models that accompany us throughout the game are made. The same level of quality can be found for the audio, powerful and precise, with the subwoofer of the system that places important blows at every wall that shatters or container that crashes. Without forgetting the soundtrack, all orchestrated and with a couple of original themes of excellent quality, and the complete localization in Italian that manages to restore the picaresque irony that pervades all the dialogues of our four anti-heroes who in the lead, rather than salvation of the world, have gold and sport fishing. Comment After the graphic and emotional orgies of titles such as Mass Effect and Metal Gear Solid 4, here is the nextgen on consoles changes the rules of the game, removing one of the few certainties of an fps player: the safety of an indestructible shelter. What you get is a frenetic title with an excellent level design, a good single player mode and an online sector which, while not perfect, will give many joys to those players who want to try something different from the usual suspects, plus the thousand strategic possibilities offered by the interactivity that allows the DICE engine. Had there been the cooperative mode and a more ~mean~ system to manage the player's death during the campaign, we would have found a real jewel in our hands. As it stands, however, Battlefield: Bad Company is an exhilarating game, which we recommend you play both online and offline, regardless of which platform you own. Pros Total Destruction Level Map Design Vehicles, Weapons, and Multiplayer Longevity Cons Single Game Respawn System No Chat for All Online Squad Members No Co-op Xbox 360 - Goals Depending on whether you play it on Normal or Hard, you can finish BFBC with around 350, or just over 420 of the 1000 target points. To get the full score, in addition to finding all the hidden weapons and all the gold, you must necessarily finish the game at least twice, since finishing it directly on Hard does not automatically unlock even the objectives of the levels finished on the Normal level. Then, of course, you have to play on the net, and it takes some time there.", "date": "2008-06-23", "grade": null}
