If the goal was to keep close to long-time enthusiasts but at the same time fish with both hands from a sector yet to be discovered, that of the so-called ~casual gamer~, the DS has achieved it in full. This does not mean that everything went smoothly from the start, but on balance the promises have been largely kept: the dual-screen console guarantees alternative entertainment to ~classic~ video games, with a series of titles that exploit the its input devices. And if so far there has been a lack of a game with a musical background that is as fun as it is out of the ordinary, here comes Rhythm Paradise to fill this void with a load of style, humor and ideas. It is a collection of fifty minigames, all based on rhythm, which incorporates the graphic style of the various Wario Wares and on which Nintendo is betting a lot for 2009. You must have seen the commercial with Beyonce, right? Stage that passes you Right from the start screen, Rhythm Paradise tries to ~educate~ us on the basic actions, i.e. tapping the stylus on the touch screen and quickly drawing lines. That's all you need to play: this type of input is used in various combinations, but always relying on the rhythm to indicate when to press. Each of the minigames can be completed to varying degrees of accuracy, but enough performance is enough to unlock the next one. The games are enclosed within a navigable structure, made up of rows of five icons that culminate in a ~remix~, or in a special challenge that ~synthesises~ the previous four. As mentioned above, Rhythm Paradise has a lot to do with the tradition of ~casual games~ dedicated to Wario as regards the approach to minigames. In fact, they are all characterized by particular stylistic choices, with unlikely characters who produce absurd expressions as soon as we happen to make a few mistakes. There are many examples: in the ~Glee Club~ minigame we take on the role of a member of a decidedly unconventional singing trio, who accompanies background music with his own voice. Our character ~sings~ when we remove the stylus from the touch screen, while it produces a ~high-pitched~ when we draw a rapid upward line. We have to support the interventions of our two companions to know when to make our own, following the rhythm of the piece and trying to be as precise as possible. In the ~Fan Club~ minigame we are instead part of the audience that attends the performance of a young pop star, an audience made up exclusively of monkeys, and we have to accompany the song by clapping and jumping at the right moment. Both the song and the expressions of the monkeys are irresistible. In ~Moai Doo-Wop~ we will instead control one of the statues of Easter Island, in this case a ~female~ statue that must accurately reproduce the sounds emitted by her ~boyfriend~. Long tapping on the touch screen results in the emission of a sound that fades away when we lift the stylus, while a quick tap triggers an equally rapid vocal ~hit~. The pursuit of perfection If to unlock a new minigame it is enough to complete the previous one with sufficient precision, this does not mean that the game will allow us to settle for a mediocre performance. From time to time we will be pushed to obtain ~perfects~ in certain challenges to earn tokens useful for unlocking extras that are as nice as, frankly, useless: a telephone keypad, the trick of a business card slammed into its little box, etc. Certainly these are supplements in line with the philosophy of Rhythm Paradise, which given the strength of its numbers does not need to seek further longevity outside its ~nominal~ minigames. And if bizarre characters count within them, machines play a role of primary importance in the same way: in ~Built to Scale~ we control a device that shoots metal bars for the construction of bolts, and for the coupling to go well Finally you have to draw lines on the touch screen following the rhythm of the music. In the ~Fillbots~ minigame, however, we drive the supply pump of a robot factory, which must hook its targets along an assembly line and fill them to the brim with the greatest possible precision. Finally, in ~Shoot-'Em-Up~, we take command of a spaceship that must eliminate its space enemies by opening fire according to a sequence that reproduces the appearance of the targets on the screen. Minigames are dindeed many, it is possible to replay them for the simple sake of earning a ~perfect~ and the sympathy they give off is prodigious. The most interesting thing, however, is that the quality level of all the applications is very similar, leveled, without the usual contrast between ups and downs that ends up making us fall in love with certain games but at the same time make us hate others. Technical realization Given the juxtaposition with Wario Ware, it is clear that one should not expect technical virtuosity from Rhythm Paradise, but rather an exercise in style of unparalleled effectiveness. The particularity of the characters, their funny expressions, the choice of colors and the design all row in the direction of originality, with extraordinary results. So if it is true that the Nintendo graphics have not spent sleepless nights chasing the stability of the frame rate or the possibility of adding more polygons on the screen, it is equally true that their talent makes up for any shortcoming: the visual impact of the game strikes and amazes as much if not more than a show of strength based on mere technique. From this point of view, not all minigames deserve the same way, but the average is decidedly positive. The sound sector is immediately brilliant in its simplicity, with extremely effective songs that enter the head after a few seconds. All this is crowned by a very precise control system, which rarely disappoints and which always puts us in the position to achieve perfect performance.", "date": "2009-05-13", "grade": "8.5"}
