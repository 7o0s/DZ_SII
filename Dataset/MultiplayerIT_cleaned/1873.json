{"name": "Spyro: Enter The Dragonfly", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spyro-enter-the-dragonfly.html", "text": "What happened this time? Spyro's new adventure begins during the annual Dragon Festival, where in the ~Dragonfly Ceremony~, all young dragons receive their very own dragonfly. Everything goes well until the arrival of our old enemy Ripto, who, in order to seize the power of the dragons, imprisons the master dragons in ice and steals the dragonflies to then scatter them in the various realms of the Dragon World. At this point begins the adventure of little Spyro, who, to restore order and thwart Ripto's plans, will have to free the master dragons from the ice and find all the stolen dragonflies. Don't worry though, Spyro won't be alone: he will be able to count on the help of his old friends Hunter (master of weapons), Bianca (experienced sorceress), the Fairy Zoe (rescue worker) and Sparx (Spyro's dragonfly who miraculously escaped the raid of Ripto). Your companions will be of help on more than one occasion and will give indications on the use of certain spells and on how to perform certain actions, Sparx will also recover gems or objects that come within range. Playability, Graphics and Sound The incarnation of Spyro on Ps2 proposes the same structure of the titles that appeared on Psx. Unfortunately, the game structure is all too similar to the previous chapters: here too your little dragon will have to explore the colorful realms of the World of Dragons, recovering objects and gems that he will need to get information and advance in the following levels. This time our Spyro, in addition to breathing fire, will be able to freeze, give off electric shocks and use a particular breath made of bubbles, with which he will be able to capture the scattered dragonflies. To have all the breaths, it will be necessary to recover the Dragon Runes and bring them to the statue of the Dragon god, who will grant the power corresponding to the Rune given to him. As already mentioned, you will not be alone: your friends will give you many useful information and in particular Sparx will follow you until the end of the adventure. Spyro's state of health is made up of four lives made up of four energy points, which, if damaged, can be restored with special objects. To continue helping you, Sparx will also need to feed, by eating the butterflies you can get for him by attacking certain enemies. The strong point of the game consists of the many mini-games and the many side challenges in which you can try your hand. In fact, these are numerous, varied and fun: sometimes we will even be able to drive vehicles such as planes, spaceships, tanks and submarines, or even carry out races against time or target shooting. Your progress can be saved in two ways: manually, using the appropriate menu, or automatically, being ~electrocuted~ from time to time by the ~good~ Fairy Zoe. Technically speaking, there are some shortcomings which, on a system like Ps2, stand out: the uploads are very long, so much so that sometimes you wonder if your Ps2 is blocked or is working. Another point that leaves us perplexed is the new graphics engine, which, even if overall it moves the world in a discreet way, is not up to the level of other Platforms for Ps2. The overall result is not unpleasant, far from it, the game environments are in fact huge, varied and characterized by the usual colorful fairy-tale style. The problem lies in the fact that the game locations are poor in details, and, apart from some very nice special effects (such as moving water and some types of breath), everything is a bit sparse. The shots are manageable with the pad, and, even if they are sometimes inaccurate, overall they are certainly not an obvious defect. The fact is that from a graphic point of view, those who have played the last chapter of Spyro for Psx will seem to have the same slightly enhanced product at hand. Moving on to the control system, it should be noted that unfortunately the response of the pad is not always adequate, thus making the execution of some actions complicated. Certain combinations, in particular the ~jump~, are very difficult to manage and highlight the imperfect calibration of the controller. As for the sound, it must be said that it is always pleasant and appropriate for the game situations, although the Italian dubbing is not very appropriate, especially in the choice of voices, which make certain ~robotic~ and banal characters appear. Concluding The Spyro series on Ps2 could have debuted with a more refined and convincing title. After playing games like ~Jak and Dexter: Percursor Legacy~, it's hard to settle for much lesser products. For this reason, ~Spyro: Enter the Dragon Fly~ may not appeal to all Platfo loversrm, but we are sure that, for fans of the series, the over 25 levels present will guarantee hours and hours of fun. Pros Very varied, colorful and suggestive environments Many fun Mini-Games and Side Challenges Cons Game environments lacking in detail Imprecise control system Very similar to the last title of the series released for psx Under whose turn it is! It happens more and more often that many developers, instead of racking their brains to invent new characters, prefer to focus on sequels of famous games, which, many times, are bought not for their actual quality, but for the popularity of the series to which they belong. This time it's up to Spyro, certainly one of the platformers most loved by the owners of the old Psx. Spyro has always stood out for its simple and intuitive game structure, mainly attracting the attention of a relatively young audience and becoming one of the most loved titles by female gamers. With ~Spyro: Enter The Dragonfly~, Universal Intercative brings the series to Ps2, it remains to be seen whether the peculiar characteristics of the series have remained unchanged.", "date": "2002-12-16", "grade": null}
