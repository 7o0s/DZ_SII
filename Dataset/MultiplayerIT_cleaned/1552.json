{"name": "Midnight Club II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-club-ii.html", "text": "The Midnight Club The plot of Midnight Club II (henceforth MCII) turns out to be as simple as it is banal. The world's most fearless and thrill-seeking pilots use to challenge each other on the night streets of the cities of Los Angeles, Tokyo and Paris. The drivers belonging to this particular group, called the Midnight Club, roam around at night in search of an ever new challenger: the stake is the booklet of your car. Also in this case therefore, as in GTA3, the player will be called to break the rules (this time only the road rules however) in a probably recreated world where freedom of action always manages to play a very particular role. Albeit with due proportions, it will really seem like you are wandering around the streets of Los Angeles or those of Paris. In the first case, for example, the Downtown area with its tall skyscrapers or the Beverly Hills area with its luxurious trendy clubs will be easily recognizable. Wandering around Paris, on the other hand, it won't be difficult to skid right under the Arc de Triomphe or see the imposing presence of the Tour Effeil in the distance. Drive freely The graphics engine is the same used for GTA3 (ok, it's the last time I mention it again. Maybe) or rather the appreciated Renderware which, for the occasion, has been refurbished a little above all thanks to the introduction of useless but always effective reflection effects. Overall we can say that the general graphic effect is of a good level, the textures are very accurate and generally the quality and detail vary from good to excellent. The three-dimensional models of cars, although at first glance they appear very beautiful, after a short time you get used to them, they risk being quite monotonous and, above all, ~simple~. Furthermore, as in other titles of the genre, we will be dealing with invented models and only inspired by reality. However, the thing is not so tragic as, after all, with a little imagination we will always be able to think of the corresponding real model. Furthermore, thanks to the peculiarity of the graphics engine used, during our tours around the city we will enjoy a truly remarkable freedom of play, at least for this type of game. No set routes, no streets with all the inexplicably dead intersections, no unexpected dead ends. Obviously the limits to the explorable area exist but often we will not even notice them. Furthermore, all the graphics manage to move smoothly and quickly even on non-high-end models and, thanks to the numerous customization options, it will still be possible to play it even on not very recent systems. Merit of the origins on consoles and the fact that all our races will be set in nocturnal or at most twilight landscapes, in this way what is usually referred to as the ~fog effect~ (i.e. limited visual distance) in this case is cleverly masked with the ~real~ conditions of visibility in those hours. Almost diabolical. The joy of running The game is clearly an arcade with no simulation ambitions: so forget driving experiences even minimally comparable to those of the old but always fascinating ~Need For Speed: Porche Unleashed~ or even a more recent ~TOCA - Race Driver~. Here it will be possible to take sharp bends simply by touching the brake and, as if that weren't enough, as you progress in the game you will be able to unlock particular Bonuses such as the ~Turbo Scia~ or the ~Sgommata~. But this does not necessarily represent a defect, on the contrary, the game is adrenaline-pumping and fun right from the start thanks to this feature. However, a simplistic driving model does not equate to a simple game. On the contrary. In career mode, after the first simple races, our opponents will turn out to be increasingly aggressive and infallible. As you progress through the game, the number of attempts to win a challenge will increase almost exponentially, however the frustration effect will always be quite low. This is thanks to the fact that, in the end, the secret to victory lies in knowing your car and, above all, the area of the city where the route described by the various checkpoints takes place. In short, nothing is impossible. Higher and higher In this kind of game, variety is half the success. MCII does not excel in this aspect but still manages to defend itself well. The conquest of each new car is divided, almost alwaysand, in three distinct phases. The first consists in taking on the challenge: we will have to stroll through the streets of the city and, once we have found our chosen one, play around lovingly. Once you manage to keep up with him, the real challenges will begin. The first usually consists of a ~free race~ where we will have to choose the most convenient route to reach a certain number of Check-Points. The second instead, the decisive one for conquering the opponent's car, will consist of a more banal race with a fixed and pre-established route. Once you have conquered a more powerful, agile or snappy car (or motorbike), you will go in search of a new opponent and so on until the end of the game. Comment Calling MCII the GTA3 of driving games isn't all that wrong. Maybe it's just misleading, as before our eyes we certainly don't have a masterpiece, rather an honest and decidedly enjoyable title. The graphics are spectacular and effective enough to be able to get noticed without too much effort. The graphics engine turns out to be quite light and fluid even on systems that are not of the latest generation. The driving model is fun: not at all realistic or believable, but a lot of fun. The same goes for the various power-ups that we will gradually earn during the game or for the various alternative game modes offered by the game (the ~Capture the flag~ mode is wonderful, especially in multiplayer). Rushing at full speed through the streets (or on the roofs) of Tokyo taking the punches, going around curves at incredible speeds and not caring about the traffic and pedestrians (who get right back on their feet even if they are run over) is certainly perhaps an ~empty~ experience but definitely rewarding. The mission editor included in the game allows you to seriously increase the longevity of the title, longevity which - I repeat - is also ensured by the possibility of playing this title in multiplayer mode. If you are tired of the usual FPS or the usual RTS for your LAN with friends Midnight Club could prove to be an excellent alternative, those who have played Re-Volt know, more or less, what I mean. In short, if you are looking for a good driving arcade and certainly not a simulator then you are on the right track, otherwise you risk finding yourself seriously wrong. Pros: Pleasant and fast graphics Immediate Fun in multiplayer Cons: Not suitable for those looking for even simulation ambitions Not real cars Career mode that could get boring quickly Steering wheel, shifter and mouse Although it does not represent one of those representative genres of the PC gaming platform, the genre of automotive arcades can include a certain tradition of a few but certainly unforgettable high notes. The older ones among you will surely remember the first, unforgettable, Test Drive of the now defunct Accolade. Since then, passing through titles such as ~Cars & Driver~ or the ~Need For Speed~ saga, a lot has been done but there is no doubt that, at least in recent years, a title that is up to the situation is missing, especially after the disappointment Hot Pursuit 2. So here, directly from the publisher of a certain highly decorated ~Grand Theft Auto 3~, also arriving on PC Midnight Club II. Series which, in spite of that ~II~, makes its debut in the golden world of Microsoft operating systems.", "date": "2003-08-30", "grade": null}
