Dr. Fetus Mean Meat Machine enters that universe with a mix of puzzle and lightness, a gameplay inspired by Tetris, but which transmits all the DNA of Super Meat Boy in its essence, entertaining and involving, creating a certain addiction. Colorful and bloody enough, the new Team Meat game is a successful experiment and, finally, far from a procedural logic that the writer just can't make his own: each level is designed and studied to be exactly that way, like mom he did it. Follow us in the review of Dr. Fetus Mean Meat Machine, one of the freshest and funniest titles of the semester. Four pieces of meat Dr. Fetus Mean Meat Machine is full of ideas, saws, traps that will always make you imagine a different strategy As expected, Dr. Fetus Mean Meat Machine doesn't have a real incipit: Dr Fetus wants to make a Meat Boy clone and needs to experiment a lot. The game catapults into gameplay in no time, teaching us the ropes and leaving us free to experiment with our own style. We like to go fast and the game responds very well to our stimuli: dropping blocks of colored meat is a pleasure, avoiding traps is fun and the levels are completed rather quickly. The formula works precisely because it is very fast and easy to read: by combining four pieces of the same color, a bar on the left is filled which, when a precise volume is determined, activates a condition on the screen. A trap, an obstacle, a chainsaw that between the top and bottom of the screen and that will force the player to make discrete numbers to ring his own combinations, dying and dying. The game incorporates a checkpoint system that sends you back to a specific point in the level, providing a very Super Meat Boy feel, grabbing the player and constantly challenging them to try again. With a simple but ingenious idea, McMillen and team have created a real drug in the shape of a video game. Traps everywhere Dr. Fetus Mean Meat Machine is long, full of specially designed and non-procedural levels Advancing is a pleasure: not so much for the huge amount of incremental levels and challenges, but precisely for wanting to challenge the authorial madness of the team: chainsaws, ghosts, traps, giant worms, buttons to press, lava tanks, electric shocks, even bosses. You got it right: bosses! Each idea has a precise mechanics, but the execution is up to the player: the game design is superfine, the amount of variables that put a spanner in the works is remarkable and in all this, the only great truth is that the blocks of meat they will drop to the bottom, the rest is up to you. If you're good, a chain of successes will make you invincible for a few seconds, but the help ends there: Dr Fetus Mean Meat Machine is the ideal transposition of Super Meat Boy made into a puzzle game, dragging along the difficulty, the and the daring misadventures of innocent blocks of flesh. Technically we are dealing with a fresh and colorful product, but it is the sound accompaniment that gives great satisfaction, constantly pressing the progress with very healthy speed metal and sometimes upsetting for the absolute quality of the music. The only flaw, net of the difficulty which is actually a good thing, is the absence of multiplayer: a pity, it would have been fun to clash with friends in the midst of the most intriguing levels.", "date": "2023-06-27", "grade": "8.5"}
