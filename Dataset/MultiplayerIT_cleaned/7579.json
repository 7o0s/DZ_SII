The problem wasn't judging the game, which to be clear is fabulous, but figuring out what to tell and how, without a team of ninjas hired by Nintendo breaking into the apartment, eliminating me and my family, before deleting the entire neighborhood with an antimatter bomb. In short, if you want to know how many new pokmon there are, this is the wrong place. If you want to know which monsters can mega evolve, in addition to those already confirmed by Nintendo itself, we have to disappoint you. Want to know what happens after defeating the eighth gym leader? Sorry, we'll talk about it after October 12th. The veto imposed by the publisher on this information has been strict and may even appear a hair exaggerated, but in some ways it is understandable: this is the very first Pokmon to be released simultaneously all over the world, and therefore Nintendo has been adamant in wanting that Europeans, Americans and Japanese huddled in an embrace of mutual ignorance and curiosity. One thing, however, we can tell you: Pokmon X and Y is Game Freak's masterpiece. The new generation of Pokmon is a great new starting point for all fans, old and new Welcome to Kalos Nintendo had two goals to achieve with Pokmon X and Y, and for us it has achieved them in full: first, to bring back into the fold the old fans who, for one reason or another, had departed from the franchise in the last years; second, to attract new players who have never picked up a Pokball before. The best way to get closer to the finish line, to begin with, was to give the graphics a good refresh. If you ask any Pokmon enthusiast, he will surely answer that he hasn't spent hundreds of hours training his little monsters for graphics; however, at the gates of 2014, on a system that runs titles of the caliber of Resident Evil Revelations or Luigi's Mansion 2 with ease, the cosmetics of the latest generation of Pokmon, however well-finished and colorful, were no longer eligible. So here is a massive use of the three dimensions and the computing capacity of Nintendo 3DS, pushed to its limits at certain times. Traveling through Kalos, the new region, is simply a pleasure: the new dynamic camera follows the movements of the player - male or female, to choose, and discreetly customizable in the color of the complexion, eyes and hair as well as in the clothes worn - in an isometric view, as per tradition, but does not disdain sudden movements capable of revealing enchanting panoramas or, obliquely, to hide secrets and alternative passages by playing on perspective. The level of detail is amazing: having abandoned the rather questionable solution of the seasons, Game Freak has opted for an independent day / night cycle that alters the color palette of the environment and makes exploration even more engaging. The reflection of the sun glides on the grass that sways in the wind, the water sparkles by projecting plays of light that skilfully convey the idea of the movement of the waves, the street lamps turn on in the evening and turn off in the morning: the region of Kalos it is alive, and we roam from one path to another, immersing ourselves once again in the clichs of the series, from forests to caves, passing through grasslands, mountains and desert territories. Among the cities, usually proposed as the typical agglomeration of houses, Pokmon Centers and gyms, Luminopoli definitely stands out, the capital of Kalos full of places to visit and activities to undertake, proposed completely in three dimensions while we visit it with the camera following from near our alter ego. The real blow to the heart, needless to say, are the fights: there Game Freak, with the help of the developer Creatures Inc., really changed the cards on the table. The two-dimensional sprites with tight animations are a distant memory, supplanted by a wonderful cel shading that makes the clashes not too different from a real cartoon. Very rich in animations that are rarely generic, the little monsters move and fight with impressive fluidity and naturalness, and some somewhat spartan special attacks are soon compensated by others that are decidedly more spectacular and pyrotechnic. Even in this case, the camera does not rest: while the pokmon fight or the player reflects on the next order to give to his monster, the camera rotates around the arena, framing the pokmon from close up, from a distance, from behind, from the side. .. A direction that was a little sketchy at times, but which he exaltedat the scene, detaching almost completely from the fixed view behind our pokmon to which we were used to. In short, a real feast for the eyes, which makes us forgive a slight dirt in terms of aliasing without even thinking twice. All of this is naturally embraced by an excellent soundtrack as usual, which includes brand new songs and others optimally remixed for the occasion. Dulcis in fundo: aware of the fans' desire to hear the ~voices~ of pokmon as in cartoons, and of the impossibility of satisfying them due to the linguistic discrepancy in the names of creatures internationally, Game Freak has given a voice to its mascot universally recognized. Pikachu now speaks, and there's not much more to add. The 3D effect The integration of stereoscopy deserves a separate discussion a little longer than usual, because it has left us a bit dumbfounded and confused. In short, the 3D effect is not always ~available~: during explorations it was almost never applied, with the exception of some dungeons where it is possible to enjoy it, and even in fights it is not always possible to activate it. It is usually automatically blocked during two-on-two or one-on-swarm battles, at the developer's discretion, and there's little you can do about it. On the gameplay, of course, the 3D effect has no effect in the most absolute way: it makes those areas and those fights in which it is possible to activate it spectacular, but on Nintendo 3DS we have seen better anyway. The problem, if anything, is the conspicuous drop in frame rate that occurs when it is active during fights, especially if they involve particularly elaborate special moves or creatures full of animations. A clash between two Vivillons, with their wings flapping frantically spreading a glittering powder all around, literally kills the frame rate, even slowing down the interaction with the lower screen and the opening/closing of the menus, so much so that we were often forced to turn it off. What is the reason for these technical problems is not very clear; it is probable that Game Freak did not have the time to optimize the final result, even if the more mischievous ones are more inclined to affirm that, with the Nintendo 2DS upon us, the Kyoto company has begun to neglect the flagship feature of the handheld. Be that as it may, this defect does not affect our evaluation of the game in the slightest: if the stereoscopic effect represents added value for you, feel free to subtract a few cents from the final vote. Team that wins... we change, but not too much We were saying that Nintendo was intent on impressing two very specific types of gamers: the old fans  and all the others. To achieve this, one of the best things he did, besides modernizing the look of the game, was just NOT changing the basic structure of the game, limiting himself to modifying quite a bit here and there, but without changing anything. Yes, of course the adventure begins as a young coach who has recently moved to the peaceful Borgo Bozzetto. The small differences begin to be noticed almost immediately, especially in the development of the main plot that will accompany him in the canonical journey in search of the pokmon to be recorded in the PokDex and the gym leaders to be defeated to earn their medals and their respect. The protagonist is not alone: four friends accompany him on the journey, who give a little color to a story that Game Freak has already told us many times. Among them there is of course the ~rival~, the character who chooses his first pokmon of opposite element to ours, but which in this case - twist! - is a kind of sentimental interest, with a relationship that as the hours go by becomes something more than a simple friendship. The group of friends will be charged by Professor Platan to discover the secrets of the phenomenon known as Mega Evolution, but their mission will be thwarted, as usual, by the plans of an ambiguous association known as Team Flare. There is also the traditional ~villain~ who plots (not really) in the shadows and some interesting twists: it is a simple story, far from the complications of the most popular fantasy jRPGs, but told in a more modern way than what has already been seen in Pokmon Black and White, who had already made some progress in that sense. The main goal, in the end, is always the same: to catch them all. From this point of view, we return to the philosophy behind this sixth generation, and therefore the most die-hard fans could be a little disappointed by a slightly lower number of unpublished creatures than usual; on the other hand, the variety of capturable creatures offered already in the very first bars of the game will delight both the nnew and old coaches. Creatures belonging to all regions and all types are mixed in the paths, and already at the third gym we find ourselves with a PokDex that has at least one hundred registrations and a great possibility of choice and composition of our team. Satisfying everyone's tastes is certainly not possible, but we liked almost all of the new pokmon, both in their basic forms - often truly adorable - and in their evolutions. As you know, Game Freak has also done a painstaking balancing act, introducing a new type of pokmon, Goblin, which especially counteracts Dragon-type creatures. Many old pokmon, such as Mr. Mime or Ralts, now completely or partially fall into this category, and thanks to new abilities and special moves - often belonging to completely new combinations of types - Game Freak has given a nice refresh to a combat system which always appears simple, at a superficial glance, but which hides an incredible and, perhaps, now even incomparable complexity. The difficulty curve in the progression has been masterfully balanced, thanks also to small adjustments such as the Share Experience, which can be acquired at the beginning of the game and has now become a basic tool that can be activated at will, capable of attributing experience points to all the pokmon in the team . As a result, the ~grinding~ has practically disappeared: the pokmon in the team grow quickly, and you never have the feeling of being slowed down or of being faced with insurmountable obstacles. The Mega Evolutions close the circle, which frankly we expected a little too extreme, but which instead turned out to be excellently balanced and similar to simple additional evolutions: the choice of mega evolving especially the ~old~ pokmon left us a bit perplexed , but on the other hand we come back to the idea of attracting fans of the past. Be that as it may, the Mega Evolutions are an interesting novelty that Game Freak seems to want to explore in depth even in the next generations, perhaps instead of the ~legendary~ pokmon which in the latest versions had begun to become a bit too many. Everything and more We mentioned the Share Experience tool which, as it was redesigned and proposed so early in the game, already represents a ~novelty~ and an example that gives an idea of how Game Freak designed Pokmon X and Y. Another example? Skates and bicycle: the former are obtained practically immediately, and allow you to move even faster than running, except when moving in tall grass, seasoning our movements with small stunts to unlock, with the possibility of switching on to areas otherwise precluded. The bicycle is even faster, but easier to use, and almost represents a tribute to tradition. You move quickly right away, in short; some Hidden Machines (such as Forza, Volo or Surf) are given to us much earlier than in the past, so that we can use them to unlock new areas or solve simple puzzles; the tool shop and dressing room are integrated into the Pokmon Center, just a few steps away from the nurse. In short, the so-called ~quality of life~ has made great strides, and saving the game in a single flat second is a real relief: it seems silly, but for a veteran of the series it is almost the Holy Grail, believe it. There is a frame of refinements and modernizations that does not flatten the experience, but rather enhances it, making it more lively, flowing, within everyone's reach. The lower screen of the console offers various screens, embodying the infamous HoloVox, practically the most popular tablet of Kalos: it allows you to receive the holographic calls of the other characters, but also to access various game modes that really surprised us for the variety and the care taken in their design. Pokmon Me and You, for example, which allows you to ~pamper~ your pokmon as if you were playing Nintendogs, caressing and feeding them to increase your friendship level; In addition, it also offers a series of intuitive mini-games of increasing difficulty with which to kill time between fights. Virtual Super Training (S.A.V.) is another interesting mini-game divided into two parts: a kind of shooter in which you have to hit a huge pokmon-shaped ball, touching the touch screen in precise points, and a kind of secondary mode that allows you to put a pokmon to train against bags, increasing the parameters we prefer while we do other things. Neither Pokmon You and Me nor the S.A.V. they are fundamental in the progression, but they will delight all those coaches who want to maximize the development of their team", "date": "2013-10-04", "grade": "9.6"}
