{"name": "Family Ski & Snowboard - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/family-ski-snowboard-recensione.html", "text": "Introduced to the public at the Tokyo Game Show 2008, Family Ski & Snowboard (abandoning the uselessly redundant title Family Ski: World Ski & Snowboard) was certainly not among the most anticipated titles of the season for Wii: however, many were waiting for the product Namco Bandai, if only to determine if he could put some good insights from the prequel into practice more solidly. Balance Board on the feet, let's now verify whether or not there has been this phantom evolution. Sunday skier Just like the previous episode, Family Ski & Snowboard adopts a very soft approach to the discipline, offering casual users of the Nintendo console the opportunity to ski for the simple sake of doing it or to try their hand at competitions always in the name of absolute accessibility . Leaving aside the area that was the setting for the previous edition, the Namco Bandai product allows you to slide down the gentle slopes of the Jamboree Snow Resort or to face the perils - so to speak - of Monte Angrio, both available in day or night versions. Where the first setting does not differ particularly from that of the prequel in terms of content (with the exception of the presence of sections dedicated to freestyle and the demolition of many of the invisible barriers that delimited the slopes), the second opens up new opportunities, allowing you to explore its asperities almost freely and to produce vertiginous jumps, during which to chain the various tricks available. However, the main new entry of the title is represented by the possibility of putting on a snowboard instead of ordinary skis: using the Balance Board, without which Family Ski & Snowboard loses much of its appeal, you must therefore position yourself transversally with respect to the TV, leaning forward to gain speed and sideways to change direction, while quickly bending the knees allows you to jump. In principle, the use of the Remote and Nunchuck combo in combination with the Balance Board has undergone few but important variations, mainly concerning the execution of the aforementioned jumps and the creation of stunts, to be performed by moving the two controllers: for the rest, Remote and Nunchuck are also used to push yourself from a standstill or get up after a fall, while we find the analog stick to control braking, the C key to go to the snowplow and the two triggers useful for tightening the curves. Different but not too much The introduction of snowboards in this second chapter appears more as a stylistic choice rather than a firm intention to expand the gameplay in a new direction: if we exclude the need to put the Balance Board in a transverse direction using the board, the differences between skis and snowboarding are almost nil. Surely the choice of developers was dictated by the intention not to complicate things too much, but a little more differentiation would certainly have helped. Alpine rescue At least on paper, the playful offer of Family Ski & Snowboard is decidedly better than that of the last episode: in addition to the already known personalization section of one's alter-ego under a whole series of aesthetic aspects, the Namco Bandai title offers a wide range of modes. There is the ski school which serves as a tutorial, two distinct sections intended for one and the other setting, a multiplayer component aimed at a maximum of four users via split-screen and a part entirely reserved for competitions, divided by specialty . Unfortunately, for each item on the list there are several things that don't work properly: the tutorial is unnecessarily verbose, the two ski resorts lack really stimulating gameplay elements, the split-screen isn't particularly powerful and the competitions offer a level of really laughable challenge. Of course we are not talking about a product intended for hardcore gamers - on the contrary - but above all in the light of the experience gained with the first Family Ski, it would have been reasonable to expect some progress in this respect. Unless wandering on the slopes, moving from one chairlift to another, looking for some secrets, having a certain number of souvenir photos taken and tackling some trivial quests is exhilarating, Family Ski & Snowboard is not exactly an exciting game, but rather a pleasant experience to enjoy from time to time. Even on the multiplayer front, not much progress has been made compared to the improvable prequel: the split screen appears slightly more stable in terms of frame rate, but at the same time there are many titles for the Nintendo console (primarily the immortal Wii Sports) with decisive fun factorssignificantly higher. The only ten months of interval between the two releases of the franchise are evidently also reflected in the technical realization, substantially indistinguishable: although visually pleasing, Family Ski & Snowboard pales in comparison to recent productions such as the good Shaun White Snowboarding. Comment Namco Bandai's second ski product for Wii could not have a more eloquent title: Family Ski & Snowboard is exactly what the name suggests, or Family Ski with the added possibility of using the board, using a slightly modified control system. Despite the inclusion of two different areas and a variety of competitions, the game still suffers from a chronic lack of challenge and stimuli, losing the opportunity to make the coveted leap in quality: however, it still remains a recommended choice for casual gamers looking for an easy skiing ~simulation~.
