{"name": "Demon Chaos - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/demon-chaos-recensione.html", "text": "The dark period On a narrative level, the Japanese Middle Ages have always been at the center of plots that see ancient magic, demonic creatures and legendary warriors intertwine. Demon Chaos is no exception: the war between the various lords of Japan unleashes chaos, and the chaos only strengthens the previously imprisoned hordes of demons. With a myriad of evil creatures on the battlefields, war goes beyond human boundaries and becomes a matter of good and evil. But how will men be able to defend themselves from demons? A young priestess and a supernatural warrior with the face of a wolf will come to their aid. And it is precisely him that we will control in the game, moving around a map and unleashing our power against thousands of opponents... literally. The initial screen allows us to try our hand at timed challenges in which we need to eliminate as many opponents as possible, or with the Story Mode, in which we will face a series of stages interspersed with animated sequences that tell the story behind Demons Chaos. Before launching into battle, we will be able to check the map of the level and the various objectives located on it, then prepare the warrior by selecting a weapon from those available. In this game, the equipped weapon acts as a regulator for the characteristics of our wolf warrior, in the sense that using a short sword will give us a low destructive potential but will allow us to move quickly, vice versa a huge ax will kill of enemies in one fell swoop but it will noticeably slow down our movements on the ground. Hunting for demons Checked the map and selected the weapon, all we have to do is take the field. The initial dialogues will immediately clarify the situation and will outline the objectives to be achieved to complete the stage, which most of the time translate into the systematic elimination of all enemies and the protection of the girl-priestess and of the characters to whom from time to time time we help. On the battlefield, our warrior becomes a point of reference and a true leader, so much so that we can order allied troops to follow us or to act autonomously, to advance or stop as needed. The bulk of the work, however, will be up to us: using a series of combos, we will have to mow down evil creatures of all sizes, sometimes even arranging bosses and paying close attention to the map on the screen, which shows us the position of the opponents and the areas sensitive. The control system basically sees three buttons assigned to the attack (normal shot, ~accessory~ shot and flaming attack), which must be combined to create offensive sequences of incredible power, always quite spectacular and effective to the point that we will be able to kill hundreds of enemies at once. The X button adds a pinch of strategy to the sequence, since it will allow us to create a series of ~columns~ (of various kinds: curative, offensive, defensive, etc.) or to give orders to the troops. Finally, the back keys are used to unleash the anger of our warrior when the appropriate bar is full, to bring the view closer or further away as well as order or not the allies to follow us. Technical realization Already the first game with Demon Chaos clarifies any doubts about what the developers wanted to get from the game: a show that is difficult to match in quantitative terms, with thousands of characters moving around the battlefield. To obtain this result without compromising the frame rate and without the appearance of pop-up effects, one has naturally come down to compromises for what is the level of detail. In fact, apart from the wolf-warrior and the main characters, there are few polygonal models worthy of the name, and everything is displayed in low resolution. This translates into what appears to be a battle of colored balls in overhead shots, really ungenerous compared to the sequences in which our alter ego makes his way through the enemy ranks with combos and mercilessly disintegrates any opponent. A ~glow~ effect with a controversial effect has been added to all the graphics, which for some features seems to add something to the final result, for others it is terribly monotonous and artificial. Finally, the animated sequences have ups and downs: at the beginning they are excellent (especially the anime-style one), then they drop quite dramatically. And the sound? Naturally it is composed of music that recalls the Japanese tradition, of good quality but which fails to involve too much or create a particular atmosphere. Overall, the effects are good and functional to the action. The game boasts a trtranslation of the texts on the screen in Italian, while the voices are in Japanese. Comment Demon Chaos is a particular video game, certainly arcade in gameplay while boasting some vague strategic elements; but above all it is an exercise in technique, a product that Genki intended to amaze everyone with the number of polygons that can be moved without the graphics engine having any hesitations. In this sense, the goal is halfway reached: certainly record figures for PS2 are reached between allies and enemies on the screen, but obtaining these numbers has implied a huge loss of detail. For example, Capcom's Devil Kings manages to be fluid and detailed while presenting frenetic battles, which in that case involve only dozens of warriors but which in fact are more worthy of attention than a clash between thousands and thousands of dots. Playability is also of a controversial nature, which despite the large number of weapons soon becomes monotonous in the continuous re-proposition of clashes that have nothing technical and which rather turn out to be cumbersome at times. Pros: Outstanding graphics for ~quantity~ Spectacular combat sequences Some strategic elements Cons: Poor level of detail Fights confusing and imprecise Repetitive Released in Japan at the end of 2005, Ikusa Gami finally arrives in Italy with the title of Demon Chaos. While the reasons for this delay remain obscure, the spectacular action game developed by Genki promises to be talked about for more than one reason.", "date": "2007-05-30", "grade": null}
