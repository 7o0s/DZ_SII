{"name": "Downwell", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/downwell-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "That of Downwell and his creator, the solitary Ojiro ~Moppin~ Fumoto, is a story from another time with an unexpected ending. As expected, the success of the game on mobile platforms aroused the curiosity of a giant like Nintendo, who hired Fumoto according to the classic plot of stories on professional affirmation, only that the ending was then distorted because the developer, like a new Ulysses driven by the hunger for new, more eventful and risky experiences, has decided to leave the company and go back to being a full-blown indie. In this whole matter, the Nintendo Switch version of Downwell therefore takes on the flavor of a greeting and thanks from Fumoto for his brief experience in the Kyoto company and apparently there could be no better attestation of esteem and respect, as we see in this review. The strange shooter maintains all its charge of freshness on the Nintendo console, given by a particular amalgam of two opposing elements such as originality and belonging to a classic genre: the premise is in fact new and the mechanics of the game, although based on a historical pillar of the video game such as the 2D shooter, it presents peculiar variations that make it unique. The story, if it can be defined as such, tells of the curious Welltaro, a guy who one night decides he wants to explore the secrets of a deep well. Being a provident type, given the probable presence of threats, he decides to equip himself with a pair of gunboots on his feet, or boots capable of shooting, launching himself with this formidable weapon in a seemingly endless crazy descent. Not quite the usual story about the last spaceships launched in defense of humanity against alien armies, therefore, but even in this descent into the depths of a well we can see a remarkable epic. The man in the boots Welltaro's particular footwear provides the basis for the entire gameplay of Downwell, which takes the form of a continuous fall into the well with the possibility of shooting enemies in a vertical line below the feet, but with some very specific rules to follow: it is possible to fire and hang momentarily in the air by pressing and holding a button, but the ammo is counted and depletes quickly, with the need to reload simply by putting one's feet on something. The possibility of moving left, right and jumping introduces the minimum rudiments of platforming, with the occasional presence of some side openings that allow you to reach alternative rooms containing bonuses or shops for the purchase of power-ups in exchange for the crystals that you collect fighting, but the movement is mostly vertical and most of the time in free fall. This introduces a series of specific difficulties on which the mechanics of the game are based, namely the need to hit and dodge obstacles, reacting with timing to the speed that characterizes the action. The first few minutes of the game can be shocking: the scenario flows at impressive speed and the amount of elements to keep an eye on soon becomes disturbing, with the need to see in a fraction of a second the right direction to take and recognize the different types of enemies to figure out which ones to shoot at and which ones can be eliminated by jumping over them. This alternation between different types of attack is essential because it allows you to reload the ammunition (touching the ground or enemies with your feet) while still continuing to hit the enemies and thus ringing combined attacks that keep the multipliers active, in a continuous progression of power and speed of attack. 'action. Added to this are the power-ups that we can collect during the levels or in the interludes between one level and another, or buy in the shops that occasionally appear on the sides of the well, which make the fire of the boots evolve and specialize in various ways (laser, multi-fire, support pod, and more). Trichromatic minimalism Downwell is a roguelike, in the sense that every death makes us start from the beginning, with the path that changes, recomposing each time in a procedural way. This feature is supported by the general simplicity of the structure of the levels, which vary above all in the arrangement of platforms, side outlets and in the composition of enemies and obstacles, but in fact every descent into the well is a different experience. Lingering items refer to ~styles~ that are unlocked after achieving certain objectives and can be set at the start of the game. These allow you to use modifiers that introduce or affect certain aspects of the game, going dto aesthetic elements such as color variations to mechanics that modify gameplay such as different falling speeds, weapon evolution or initial energy amounts (getting shops out of the way, to balance). The result is a good amount of possible variations on the theme that expand as the game progresses, giving an excellent incentive to achieve the objectives. The minimalist graphic style is somewhat reminiscent of the era of 8-bit home computers, especially the ZX Spectrum titles given the limited chromatic variation that distinguished them and which however led to a strongly characterized appearance. In this case, the marked contrast between white, black and red (with possible modifications applicable through styles) also has the function of making what is happening on the screen clearly visible, given the very fast reaction times required to stay alive in the game. The Nintendo Switch version has some particularly positive elements on its side, which justify a possible return to the game even if it has already been experimented elsewhere: the control system compared to the mobile edition is obviously more comfortable and responsive but above all the TATE mode, which rotates the screen 90 degrees. In this way it is possible to take advantage of all the screen space to view the game vertically, with a solution that probably represents the best way ever to play Downwell, as long as you have the possibility to support the console safely (or use some particular accessory to do so).", "date": "2019-02-10", "grade": "9.0"}
