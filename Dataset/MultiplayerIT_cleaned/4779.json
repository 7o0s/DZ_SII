Thanks to technological progress, it is no longer even necessary to face long sessions sitting at the desk and in front of the PC screen: as we see in this review of Football Manager 2023 Touch, Sports Interactive and Sega have now cleared the art of football team management football also on the move. Sega's particular strategy with its managerial title tends to confuse ideas a bit: in addition to the standard Football Manager 2023, of which you can read the review at this address, there is a Football Manager 2023 Mobile which is more specifically aimed at the classic mobile segment, but we also find an intermediate solution and closer to the classic setting with Football Manager 2023 Touch. An undoubtedly somewhat confusing situation, but which could still successfully offer the managerial to new audiences, as already successfully tested through the previous chapters. In this case we are dealing with the latter, which presents itself as a rather faithful adaptation of the classic approach to touch screen platforms, therefore with a slight simplification of the interface and mechanics to be enjoyed best on devices with smaller screens and touch control system. The middle ground chosen is particularly convincing because, despite some simplifications and a not always optimal response to input via the touch screen, it still aims to offer the most complete experience possible, without free-to-play ~traps~. For the occasion, Football Manager 2023 Touch arrives directly within the Apple Arcade catalog, demonstrating the great attention of the service to the completeness and variety of the offer. It is already an excellent sign even without going into its mechanics in depth, because we know well how inclusion in the catalog already presupposes an offer in all respects ~premium~, far from the typical settings of free-to-play and the like. The coach in the touch screen Football Manager 2023 Touch offers the 3D match engine also seen in the main version The structure and a large part of the contents are substantially the same as in the main version, so we refer you to the Football Manager 2023 review to find out in detail how the game works and the main innovations introduced in this edition. In fact, also in this case we are faced with a seasonal update of the software already seen last year, with various improvements and evolutions which, however, do not change the original experience that much. A rather striking novelty is the presence of official licenses for European competitions, so in addition to the individual national leagues we can access completely realistic versions of the Champions League, Europe and Conference League complete with logos, names and official organization. Considering that the mobile version could not count on the rich panorama of mods available to the PC one, this change has great importance with regard to Football Manager 2023 Touch, which can now count on official names and also graphics in line with the competitions in question . At the start it is possible to choose between the Career mode, which offers the most classic experience of the series, with the possibility of choosing a team to manage it in every aspect through various seasons, the ~Create a club~ mode which allows you to build a new team starting from scratch and the Challenge mode, which puts us in front of missions to be carried out trying to achieve the set objectives. Football Manager 2023 Touch, a screenshot on module management For the moment, the Versus mode that was typical of the mobile version is missing, but should be introduced later in the next period, according to reports from the developers. In general, between the interface and game mechanics, Football Manager 2023 Touch fully corresponds to the console version, or rather to the PC version with some adaptations applied to the interface, therefore it is not really a watered down version but the experience in large part complete with this year's manager. The interface is very elegant and, unlike what was seen in previous editions, it seems almost ~native~ especially when using an iPad, while some elements are necessarily cut off on the smaller screens of the iPhone. There is some problem registering touch inputs, however it could also be due to some lag that can emerge on devices.older laptops. A very appreciable feature is the cross-play between Apple devices associated with the same Apple Arcade account: saves and progress can be transferred at any time from iPhone to iPad up to Mac, thus allowing ~seamless~ use from one location to another. 'other. News and evolutions Football Manager 2023 Touch, a screenshot of the interface The innovations introduced in the 2023 edition, as happens from year to year, are not very flashy, yet they manage to blend organically with the entire game system by now settled, going to enrich and perfect this simulation more and more without upsetting or revolutionizing anything but implementing a slow evolution. The Data Center was already an important feature in the last edition and, in this one, it naturally finds more space within the simulation, but to this is also added the Team Plan, which allows for long-term planning of the organization of the club, from future signings to managing grafts over a period of time wider than a single season. Other novelties concern relations with the fans, in the sense of a dynamic overview of the reactions of the public to the progress of the team, in a meaningful way with the objectives and history of the club, as well as improvements in the management of scouting and the dynamic timeline of the manager, which shows career milestones and significant moments. The match engine is also displayed in 3D on portable devices, making the representation of the match a little more realistic even if we are far from the levels reached by the most popular football simulations. The technical realization of the visible remnants of the match is not exactly a spectacular element, but it is still something marginal in the world of Football Manager, while the management of artificial intelligence does not seem to have made particular progress compared to the previous edition, where, however, he was already doing quite well. In the match, the greater possibilities for interaction with the team through communications from the sidelines and the use of the tablet for data collection further complete the picture of an ever deeper and more realistic simulation, year after year.", "date": "2022-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
