{"name": "Aces & Adventures", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aces-adventures-recensione.html", "text": "Card games have been part of human culture for at least twelve hundred years and over the centuries, in all parts of the world, multiple variations of these have been born and evolved. With the arrival of digital, human creativity has just exploded, giving birth to always interesting variations and genres. Now, Aces & Adventures is added to this list. Developed by Triple.B.Titles and available from February 23, 2023 on PC via Steam, Aces & Adventures blends poker and a classic deckbuilding game with a fantasy-edged narrative campaign. We analyze all the details of Aces & Adventures in our review. Poker and Magic A classic battle screen from Aces & Adventures Let's get straight to the point and see how Aces & Adventures works. For each game we will have two decks of cards: a fixed one, based on the poker cards with the four suits, and one determined by the abilities of our character (which we will talk about a little below). Skill cards allow you to perform particular actions, such as canceling enemy offensives, activating shields, summoning allies, adding upgrades to our hero or weakening enemies. Poker cards, on the other hand, are spent on activating skills and on fighting. To attack we must choose a combination of valid cards according to the rules of poker, i.e. high card, pair, three of a kind, straight, flush and so on. The number of cards used determines how much damage is dealt. Of course, you can also defend against enemy card combinations, using the same number of cards. Enemies only draw cards when attacking or defending, so obviously we don't know if they'll have a valid hand to defeat us. We must also be very careful because a failed attack turns the damage back on us and, in the same way, if we defend ourselves successfully, we reflect the damage on the opponent. Also for this reason, with certain characters and certain combinations of cards it is much more useful not to attack in our turn and to keep a good combination of cards for the defense phase, so as not to suffer damage and rather inflict it. The game system is therefore a mix of strategy, good deck building and luck. You can have devastating abilities, but if these require cards of suits you don't currently have in your hand, there isn't much chance of winning. However, luck can be bent to our will as between one battle and another we will also have the possibility of obtaining equipment that activates unique abilities, such as the possibility of changing the suit of the cards, enhancing the damage inflicted or canceling the damage suffered by using certain combinations. It is on these occasions that Ace & Adventures becomes much more fun, as the strategic possibilities available to us expand. The deck creation menu is quite simple to use in Aces & Adventures Of course, the enemy must also be taken into account in all of this. The creatures we're going to face always have abilities, such as the ability to attack twice, get bonuses based on our cards or based on the suits they use in the offensive phase. The effects are really many and continue to change the cards a bit (intended joke). The bosses are on average the most interesting, as they are often able to summon allies, impose depowering and or in any case put us in more difficulty. Overall, Aces & Adventures has a simple game system to approach but quite varied and dynamic in the long run. This is also why the first hours of the game are the flattest, because we still don't have a powerful deck and the enemies themselves are very simple. Luckily after progressing a bit in the game you reach the right mix of strategy and luck. One hero, five faces, two modes The five characters of Aces & Adventures, very different from each other Aces & Adventures welcomes us into the game by introducing us to the basic mode: a narrative adventure, divided into thirteen acts. We are a magical sapling born from the remains of a long deceased warrior and whose forms we assume in order to set off on an adventure. The plot is told through cards, which appear above the battlefield showing us a small (and well done) drawing and a short narration that tells us where we are, where we are going and who we are facing. The truth, however, is that everything is always very rushed and minute by minute we are sent left and right. Settings, creatures and plot focus heavily on variety, but struggle to be cohesive and above all interesting. Not bad, however, because those looking for deckbuilding rarely do it to be enchanted by the plot. The thirteen acts of the plot of Aces & Adventures are represented by as many decks The gameplay is what really matters and Aces & Adventures also offers great variety in this sense. There are five characters to choose from, all with their own unique cards, which push you to play very differently, focusing on defense, direct attack or skills depending on the uniqueness of the character. By playing, new cards and levels are obtained, which can be spent on a character of our choice to unlock additional abilities, such as the mulligan, more life points and more. Each character has a good amount of cards and after 15 hours we were still discovering new and rare ones. What matters is that they are all very useful, especially if you understand how to exploit them in synergy. It's up to the player to test and, with 5 different characters, we tell you right away that it takes dozens of hours to discover every secret of Aces & Adventures and complete every mode with every hero. The sapling causes cards to ~bloom~ for each level assigned to an Aces & Adventures character To give you a point of reference, it took us seven hours to complete the narrative campaign once, but at that point our journey had only just begun. In addition to having to delve into other characters, additional difficulty levels are unlocked for the campaign which make the creatures we have already faced more powerful but also assign them other abilities so as to make the clash a little more interesting. To all this, however, is added the second mode of Aces & Adventures, a sort of roguelike. Also divided into several levels of difficulty, this component asks us to face a long sequence of clashes, choosing our path within a map with multiple directions. Think for example of Slay the Spire, or look at the image below to get a quick idea. The roguelike mode of Aces & Adventures offers this path: it's fixed, but creatures and events change every time In addition to having no story, this mode is longer than a single act of the campaign. The latter take between ten and twenty minutes and when you move on to the next you lose power-ups and items, but you are also healed. The ~roguelike~ mode, on the other hand, is as long as three or four narrative acts: you therefore have to survive longer. This mode is therefore designed for those who have already completed the story, have already upgraded the characters and obtained a few high-level cards. After playing the campaign and the roguelike version, maybe even on multiple difficulty levels, what's left to do is fully power up the characters. During the acts the Aces & Adventures character ranks up and gains an additional ability Here is the least interesting part of Aces & Adventures. The first 30 levels of each hero rewards with 30 power-ups, so it's satisfying and useful to ~farm levels~. Afterwards, however, the game asks you to start over and get the 30 levels again, keeping the powers already obtained but without getting any more until you reach the 30th level again. This last phase will be boring for many and could lead to not completing the game 100%. Finally, we point out that the game is translated into Italian but it seems to be an automatic translation, which on several occasions leaves something to be desired. We quickly switched to English, but we know that for some players, Italian is a must. The team reports that they are still working on our language (along with various others) - hopefully they can offer a quality translation going forward.", "date": "2023-02-23", "grade": "7.5"}
