{"name": "Spaceland", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spaceland-la-recensione.html", "text": "The writer is a great fan of the XCOM series, and for this reason he did not hesitate to apply for the review of Spaceland, the new Tortuga Team title available on Apple Arcade which inherits most of its mechanics from the famous strategic saga. As it is easy to imagine, we are obviously talking about a reduction in a simplistic and even a little naive key that absolutely cannot fight on equal terms with the contents and complexity of the franchise now in the hands of Firaxis: however, it is an interesting product, not only because he plays a role that is not very common in the mobile sector, but above all because he does it with full knowledge of the facts, even if he misses the target in some respects. So let's find out what the characteristics of this Spaceland are. Touch strategy It must be admitted that Spaceland does not present itself in the best way, putting production values on the plate that are anything but exciting. The main screen is of rare poverty, the design of the protagonists leaves much to be desired and the plot is very banal and moreover narrated in a completely insipid way, topped off only by some gross translation errors in the localized Italian version object of our test. In short, there would seem to be all the conditions to be able to decree the premature rejection of the Tortuga Team product, and instead Spaceland puts it into the right gear just when you go down on the battlefield. The game setting is the one made famous by XCOM, effectively declined in the mobile version: the user therefore has the task of commanding the party members on maps framed by an isometric view, moving them one at a time with a system of boxes and points action that will be immediately familiar to anyone who has had contact with the Firaxis series and the like. Each character therefore has a value that indicates how many squares he can cover and how many and which moves he can make in each round: once his group's options are exhausted, the ball passes to the aliens controlled by artificial intelligence and so on until the end of the level, which it generally requires eliminating all enemies or reaching the exit safely. Tortuga Team has been skilful in preparing a streamlined and efficient interface, made to be usable even on smaller iPhones in screen size: a series of simple icons allows you to quickly select the desired character and make him perform the related actions ( each of the seven heroes has unique abilities in addition to the standard moves), while a different coloring of the boxes during movement makes it immediately clear what can be done without the need for many indicators or text windows. The downside is that anyone used to more structured products will immediately feel the lack of some more information, relating for example to the success rates of attacks or to the health and movement range of enemies; moreover, the touch controls bring with them that minimum factor of inaccuracy (also thanks to very minute graphics that do not include a zoom function) which can lead to selecting one box instead of another, nullifying a character's turn and making risk the success of the mission. Despite innocuous appearances, Spaceland does not pull its leg back when it comes to difficulty level: it is true that the stages are designed to be completed within 10-15 minutes, but the absence of a save system or checkpoints and a challenge rate capable of sudden surges make it a title that can also bring a little frustration when you find yourself forced to start over perhaps for a small wrong choice. The game also encourages the user to complete the scenarios in the best possible way, with a reward system that awards coins and circuits based on one's performance: the former are used to manufacture new weapons and armor for the protagonists, while the latter allow enhance each party member's unique abilities. Net of some sins of naivety - which can however be solved with updates that would seem to have already been put in the pipeline by the developers - Spaceland therefore behaves fairly well in terms of gameplay, offering a fairly full-bodied and stimulating adventure. Even technically there is nothing particular to object to the work of Tortuga Team, which presents a functional and pleasant audiovisual sector: a pity instead that the staging of the plot and characters is so lazy and uninspired, resulting in the end more a nuisance than an added value to the progress of the campaign.", "date": "2019-10-07", "grade": "7.4"}
