He talks about it with great participation, emphasizing the genius of some found, such as a detective novel in which the detective fails to solve the case, with the only reader being able to do so thanks to a revealing clue, or as a novel made up of other novels which if read in the right order lose part of their meaning. Too bad that Herbert Quain never actually existed and that he too is a literary invention of Borges, who attributed to him some of his ideas for novels that he never wanted to write. The ~Examination of the work of Herbert Quain~, this is the title of the Argentine author's story, has a lot to do, at least ideally, with the new video game by Davey Wreden, former author of ~The Stanley Parable~. In fact, The Beginner's Guide begins with Wreden himself who presents himself to the player as the narrative voice of the entire adventure, in which he will ask us to try to understand the work of another developer, a certain Coda, very prolific between 2008 and 2011 , of which he is a great friend and admirer. His goal seems to be to make us understand the deepest motivations of this author of very short experimental video games, underlining the recurring themes and providing interpretations on the design choices made. Soon, however, we find ourselves lost in a mental labyrinth in which we gamers are the witnesses of the dialogue between Wreden and Coda, i.e. between the user, who is also the author, and the author, who was created by what pretends to be the user. And our role? The Beginner's Guide is another masterpiece from the author of The Stanley Parable? It all starts with Counter Strike At this point it is urgent to warn you that in order to be able to speak worthily of The Beginner's Guide it is impossible not to make direct reference to some passages of the plot, also because from the point of view of the mechanics there is little to say, given that it is a walking simulator that it ends in about an hour and a half. If you don't want advances on the story or, more simply, you are not interested in the genre, stop here, in both cases you have already made your choice. Maybe read back after playing it, so you can comment on it with us. The first Coda game presented to us is a map for Counter Strike. It's through that that Wreden met him. In this phase we can only go around the map listening to the words of the developer, who introduces us to his fictitious character and his ideas on game design. The map is really strange, with elements that appear to be randomly placed and obviously unfinished. But this is not the point. Wreden presents us with a creative and experimental Coda, a lover of daring architecture, who already in the next game tries out alternative design solutions, forcing us to walk backwards to get to the end of the map. We are at the beginning of a journey, in which the themes that will soon become central are just mentioned. Here Coda is still in a research phase that ignores what will become his greatest problem: communication. From 2008 to 2011 The Beginner's Guide tells of prototypes built between 2008 and 2011 with the Source graphics engine from Valve. For this reason Wreden did not overemphasize the visual aspect, which he wanted as bare as prototypes usually are. It should be noted that in the game there is a technical evolution of Coda's works, which coincides with the worsening of his personal crisis and with the increase in development times. Fictions What does it mean to communicate? How does a video game communicate its ideas to the player? Through the texts? Through the movies? Or through a complex series of cultural and ideological references inherent in its mechanics? Fascinated by a bug, Coda begins to rethink the nature of his games. Wreden presents us with great clarity this passage from which the mechanics begin to become central in the creation of the meaning of the developer's works, simultaneously guiding us in an increasingly destructive isolation process. For example, what appears to be a simple puzzle to open two doors becomes the metaphor of the desire to guarantee the player a moment of stasis and reflection, but also a transition point from which there is no going back. Coda's ever-increasing closure towards the world is expressed with videogame allegories, which make explicit its difficulty in communicating with others. In one particular sequence the player is on a theater stage and has to talk to a girl choosing which phrases to use. Looks like un very normal multiple choice dialogue of any video game, except that in this case there is no right choice. In other words, we are not given any chance to resolve the situation, but only to observe part of Coda's drama unfolding, who will express his desperation in a series of bars that will close behind him as he leaves the stage along an apparently endless. The entire The Beginner's Guide is full of similar metaphors, which soon forces us to understand the double role assumed by Wreden, made explicit by a final level that is a masterpiece of sense: a dark tower in which the developer has distributed unsolvable puzzles that they should prevent the player from reaching it. It is at this point that reflection turns and turns directly to us players: what are our limits? How far can we go in claims? When is it necessary to know how to stop, letting go of the obscure object of our desire? Only once we have truly understood the ending can we answer the question left open at the beginning of the article: what is our role? Our role We are to Wreden what Wreden is to Coda. The Beginner's Guide is in fact the sequel to The Stanley Parable, that is, it is the story of the emotional implications that the relationship with the public has produced in Wreden/Coda after the success of his game, a success that has put him in the spotlight of those who I am in constant search of messianic revelations. It is the story of a blockage due to a misunderstood love, more like a form of pathological morbidity; a kind of psychoanalytic session in which Wreden tries to open up by putting himself naked in the way he does best: through video games. It is also a scathing critique of the consensus society, where all we seek seems to be others' 'likes', i.e. global approval. A desperately conformist society in which we do everything to attract attention, as if we were spoiled children, sucking a sense of life altered and comforting from works of fantasy which we substitute for our lives. The only solution that The Beginner's Guide offers us is in a certain sense silence. It is the search for that bug capable of breaking the system and making us see the entire construct from above, placing us out of the game, thus revealing its labyrinthine, defective and profoundly human nature, right there where we go looking for and, indeed, demanding, a perfection that does not exist.", "date": "2015-10-02", "grade": "8.8"}
