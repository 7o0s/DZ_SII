{"name": "Il re del torneo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/113732-tekken-tag-tournament-2-il-re-del-torneo.html", "text": "It's unusual to find yourself reviewing a title almost two months after its release on the Italian market, but you know how the circuits in the sector work. Passion never dies but time remains the worst tyrant in history, and priority is assigned to the quickest. It takes a lot of effort from a publisher to deliver their titles with precise timeliness and when this doesn't happen you risk getting cold soup, as in this case. Nothing to complain, mind you, if there is quality that remains even a few dozen days after its release. So much so that, taking it philosophically, analyzing face up simplifies life as it allows you to enjoy all the patches that are generally distributed in the following weeks. Too bad that, in this specific case, the updates have been few and not very incisive. Observing the title in retrospect, one could certainly ask for some more decisive code intervention, which would optimize the experience and smooth out the technical flaws that will be analyzed later, but patience is the virtue of the strong. And fans of Nintendo machines have plenty of patience if they have managed to wait 17 years to see an official Tekken on a Made in Kyoto fixed console, and in this new world there could be no better first step. With an episode qualitatively far ahead of that Tekken 6 which created little pride in the competition, Nintendo finally enters the Iron Fist Tournament to show the teeth of its high definition and this time, finally, in a fight on equal terms. Eye that sees Disputes on computational power aside, equating the Wii U Edition of TTT2 to its September counterparts might seem almost simple laziness of analysis, however it is the pure truth. Namco-Bandai joins the group of all those third parties who have chosen to enrich the Wii U software library without making technical improvements to the visual offer. The narrow time window that distances the two versions and the evident desire not to invest in making the graphics sector worthy of a next-gen console paint this iteration of the famous fighting game with deja-vu. What once again gives hope to the faithful of the Kyoto house in these first days of life of Wii U is invariably related to the forced CPU-centric structure of the Namco title, daughter of the current generation, common to almost all of the third-party titles presented . A choice not to the advantage of the hardware architecture of the Nintendo machine, which not without difficulty provides the same dynamism, frenzy and overall polygonal mass of the old-gen sisters but which unfortunately does not rise from that level by a comma. It is surprising how poorly optimized the loadings are, whether they are of a generic menu with an evident and annoying input-lag or whether it is the waiting time that divides the choice of character from the match, just as a video rendering that does not always live up to expectations is baffled next-gen. The dynamic frame buffer applied by the Namco graphic engine provides a resolution generally fixed at 720p, from which moments of Tag congestion must be excluded, where the single motion blur filter used (contrary to the double managed by the Sony and Microsoft counterparts) masks badly a flow of pixels that touches the lows of 700x720, all of course to keep the number of frames anchored at 60. If we add the choice of the team to eliminate some elements of the scenery and simplify others, it is clear how the commitment to characterize the Wii U Edition has been lavished on other items. The result, it is emphasized to avoid misunderstandings, is always very pleasant and TTT2 Wii U Edition still remains, due to the completeness of the offer and variety, the definitive version of the Namco home fighting game. Nonetheless, given the Wii U-equipped bodywork and very limited use of the Gamepad - therefore inexpensive from a calculation point of view - it is legitimate to have a bad taste in the mouth for everything more than the first Tekken on a Nintendo fixed console could be. By fully supporting the off-screen game function, TTT2 Wii U Edition opens up the prospect of conducting game sessions directly on the Gamepad, in line with Nintendo's family-saving vision in case of massive use of the same TV. Relying on the high-performance Stereo speakers and the plethora of front and back buttons, playing Tekken on the move away from the console is enjoyable and initially almost entrancing. Do you want the new perception of novelty, do you want a type of experience that is now taking its first steps, the conclusion is that the play system of the fighting game also holds up well on the Gamepad, and it is certainly amany. What is sad is the almost uselessness of the additional screen if used as a second game window in the case of traditional use of the software. Everything is limited to the character selection phase, with a brief information summary on the highlighted protagonists, and to combat, with the usual four touch squares to assign moves to. Strictly speaking, you can also use the stylus and touch screen to draw patterns when customizing the character in the appropriate section, but it is certainly not the feature that will make the game fly off the shelves. The reason for such a basic and unstimulating use could be the impossibility, due to the software limitations currently in force on the Wii U, to challenge each other with two Gamepads and for this reason Namco may have chosen not to characterize the usefulness of the second screen too much, but perhaps the intent was only to not stress the Wii U CPU too much. Let's call them design choices. All the beauty of nostalgia Giving Caesar his due, it's time to show what really good Namco has managed to pull out of the hat. The thought naturally goes to the more substantial addition that characterizes this edition of TTT2, or the three additional modes. If the one relating to Tekken Supporters can be overlooked as betting the game's money on the characters and then obtaining rewards is a purely playful process for its own sake, the other two deserve a different mention. The Tekken Ball takes you back 14 years to that unforgettable Tekken 3 and its insanely innovative modes, one of which is precisely linked to the beach volleyball game with moves. The mechanics are simple: hitting the ball loads a bar that will do more or less damage when the opponent drops the ball on the ground or is not reactive in responding. Immediate and fun, Tekken Ball is a very unexpected and very welcome business card for anyone who wants something new (or at least left to rest for many years) on a modern fighting game, able to give hours of entertainment especially when confronted with a friend. The real innovation introduced concerns the Mushroom Battle, properly mushroom warfare, with clear references to the tradition of the Nintendo plumber. Competing in arenas full of fungi of various types, it is fun to organize strategies taking into account the disturbing element given by the four categories of mushrooms available, each with a characteristic. The standard mushroom makes you larger in size, the poisonous one smaller, the large one makes you giant and consequently difficult to command, while the golden one speeds up movement. We are not dealing with anything incredible, but it is undeniable how the two playful modes proposed fit well into a package that offers a complete roster of all 59 characters included from the beginning on the blu-ray game, many of which ~nintendized~ thanks to clothes that refer to the mascots of the most famous brands of the great N. With the ability to use all 4 Wii and Wii U controllers and the absence of an online pass, an ideal choice for enjoying a matchmaking service that remains very functional even in this version, the Wii U Edition certainly does not lack in quantity, guaranteeing prolonged and decidedly different game sessions compared to the rest of the offer.", "date": "2013-01-23", "grade": "8.6"}
