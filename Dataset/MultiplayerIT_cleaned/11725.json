{"name": "Mario Party DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-party-ds-recensione.html", "text": "There is no Nintendo game system that hasn't hosted at least one Mario Party in the last decade or so. The first episode for N64, published way back in 1999, seemed to promise a series of interesting experiments on the great hybridization potential between the video game, declined according to a conception of furious and original multiplayer mini-games, and the older board game, made up of boards and pawns, of dice rolls and running after stars on the board. Over the years, however, the series has fossilized on its original formula, offering episodes after episodes on an annual basis, each one different from the previous one only for slightly significant variations on the aesthetic theme, small cosmetic additions or a roster of mini-games on offer. Through the latest incarnations of Mario Party for Nintendo's flagship consoles (but there was also an overlooked Game Boy Advance episode) Hudson's team has attempted to incorporate novelties into the control system. First, using a microphone specially designed for GameCube and included in the game box. Next, attempting to refresh the formula through the innovative Nintendo Wii control system. Thus, now is the time to entrust the Nintendo DS microphone, stylus and touch screen with the task of instilling new life into a concept that, having started out as innovative, has become obsolete. Does Old Hen Sell Gold? The tried and tested Mario Party formula is well known. It is, for the few who have not yet known the series, the videogame reinterpretation of a very traditional game of the goose. Players therefore roll the dice, take turns on a board, encounter bonuses and mishaps along the way, and the coins and stars collected along the way are played over a set number of ~rounds~. The novelty of the series was to merge the traditional board game with a series of mini-games of various types which, at the end of each round, lead up to four human players to give their best in formation, in three against one or all against all. The great variety of mini-games, all generally very short, but each of which characterized by a precise design or an original interactive idea, has always been the beating heart of each Mario Party episode. In fact, the challenges act as a frantic counterbalance to waiting for one's turn on the board, making the experience all the more fun the more appropriate the games are and the greater the number of players engaged in the challenges on the screen and in the squabbles between the seats. Does Old Hen Sell Gold? Mario Party DS is no exception, and respects the dictates of the series in an ultra-orthodox way with the exception of two aspects. The first is a labile narrative mcguffin, a pretext for a series of rendered screens of nice workmanship, which enrich a Story Mode designed to make solo play more attractive. Mario's clique has been dwarfed by Bowser, and the world appears gigantic, full of familiar objects now decidedly oversized and menacing. The boards and the game situations, as can be expected, are created starting from this starting point (giant vacuum cleaners suck up the player, the garden picture is populated by now enormous carnivorous plants, and so on). The graphic presentation, created in highly stylized 3D, recalls the style of previous Nintendo 64 adventures, but with greater fluidity, definition and attention to detail. In any case, we are far from the search for particular visual inventions, and close to classic and stylized themes and settings (the music room, the garden...), not even too much indebted to Mario's universe. Even the sound sector does not differ from the typical Hudsonian kit, alternating pleasant tunes with others that can get boring in the long run, integrating the canonical slogans and jokes of the Nintendo characters and proposing remixes and rearrangements of many typical themes (some, in the mini-games, very rhythmic and appetizing). From a purely playful point of view, there is no interest, as always, in approaching a title of this type to play alone: it's all about gathering as many friends as possible and giving each other a thrashing. From this point of view, Hudson has made no attempt to inject substantial innovations into the mechanics (after all, the different teams have never distinguished themselves in terms of innovation). The positive thing is that we have ensured that the multiplayer mode worked in the best way, providing the software with the possibility of allowing the game to be played simultaneously on three other DSs even if they do not have a cartridge. Thus, a single copy of the game is sufficient to be able to enjoy con four friends, at the cost of very short loading times. On the contrary, any type of online game mode is missing, which the developers must have decided not to propose, judging the online dimension as not essential for the franchise. Whether it's a choice or an oversight, it's actually a completely negligible absence. Anyone who knows the spirit of the series knows that this is based above all on the factor of human co-presence in multiplayer. In fact, we would not expect to have a lot of fun waiting online for interminable waits for one's turn, aggravated by the extra loading of the connection and perhaps without the pleasure of interacting satisfactorily with our challengers: the difference between this and a boring single player game with three controlled players from the computer it would fade completely. The second unique aspect of Mario Party is the introduction of stylus control and microphone interaction. The game is controlled either with the DS keys or via the touch screen, but most of the mini-games are specifically designed to take advantage of the latter. As always, not all gimmicks are equally spot on or exciting, but the tactile control is capable of making some game mechanics more intuitive, ~physical~ or original than in the past, much more than the one designed for Wii, which instead it proved to be imprecise, incomplete, sometimes exhausting. In the case of the microphone, this is not an absolute novelty, given that this had already been used in a previous episode for the GameCube. However, having set aside the idea of being able to issue vocal commands, we have returned to the fun but tiring ~puff~ commands used for mini-games in which you are literally breathless by blowing out candles, pushing obstacles away, and so on. . As always, there are many mini-games - about seventy - and they include challenges that alternate physical resistance with the stylus, precision, quick reflexes, rhythm, driving bizarre vehicles or the simple fun of basketball challenges with lots of of blows to get the ball back. Some of the most successful games - for example, the spotlight on dance, in which you have to assume the correct pose when the music stops - are very intriguing, others a little less. Practice makes losers In terms of presentation, Mario Party does everything to offer all possible variations on the main theme of the main mode, and in trying paths that do not contemplate it at the base. It is as always possible to access the mini-games already unlocked during the mode on the board. But it is also possible to enjoy a series of competitive puzzle games based on Puyo Puyo, Tetris or Tetris Attack, face a second player to compete for the highest percentage of colored boxes on a playing field in a limited number of launches, or undertake a team encirclement contest in which one team escapes and one attempts to lock up the other. There is no shortage of extras, in the form of different endings for each character, bonuses and goodies to unlock and view in a Gallery. Then there are various tournament modes in which the individual mini-games become stages of paths that... will not necessarily lead to victory for the most valid one. Because even this Mario Party, like all the previous ones, is not exactly a meritocratic game, and often entrusts the fate of the game to turnarounds, disproportionate bonuses and sudden bad luck. Like past episodes, the DS is also a title that in its standard version, the Party mode, forcibly puts all players on an equal footing, continuously leveling the hierarchies with random shots and swapping positions, coins, stars. To look for a certain performative dimension, in which the best prevail, or strategic, in which it is not only fate that counts, it is necessary to turn to the extra modalities, moreover without necessarily finding it. The strong point of the game, the chaotic pleasure of challenging so many players, finds its overturning in the absence of a depth now completely lost along the way. Comment Mario Party on DS has original aspects, but basically has the typical flaws and strengths of every single episode of the series. The shortcomings include the usual unattractiveness of the single player mode, and the chronic lack of effort to offer something really new. The merits include many very entertaining mini-games and a good job of adapting the touch screen and microphone interface of the Nintendo DS. A novelty, sure, but entirely dictated by the technology itself. Taking advantage of the new Nintendo portable could also have meant groped solutionsthe alternatives, perhaps to make the basic game mechanics less plastered, in single or multiplayer. Yet once again we still have to be satisfied with the endless turn-based game sessions, interspersed with superfluous informative dialogues, provided that some wireless communication bug (rare, but inexorable) does not force us to restart a board after ~only~ nine out of ten rounds. As always there's plenty to get your hands on, because the amount of game modes and multiplayer gimmicks is able to solve the evening of a team of close-knit players. But this cannot make us forget that we are faced with the usual, sterile annual update - this time in DS sauce - to which we are all too accustomed. As always now, there is a lack of that pinch of depth, of innovation, of more variety that the series seems to beg for, but in which neither Hudson nor Nintendo seem to have the slightest intention of investing. Pros Multiplayer in four with a single cartridge Numerous extra modes to simple boards The stylus brings variety to the gaming experience Cons Absolutely nothing really new Not very exciting in single player despite the extras Few too many disconnections in wireless", "date": "2007-12-18", "grade": null}
