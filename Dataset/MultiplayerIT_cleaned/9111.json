However, it is Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern of the so-called ~silver age~, the most famous one, also the protagonist of the film played by Ryan Reynolds and out in cinemas these days. The multiplatform tie-in could not be missing, which in the Wii version was entrusted to the hands of Griptonite Games, the team behind Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines for PSP as well as a long series of portable reductions also for Nintendo DS. On the flagship console of the Kyoto house, Green Lantern: The Rise of the Manhunters therefore presents itself as a completely different game compared to what is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, a two-dimensional action game which unfortunately does not strike either for the quality of the gameplay or for the technical realization, reverse of poor level. But let's proceed in order. As in the Marvel superhero tie-ins produced by SEGA, the plot does not follow that of the film but uses the same characters. We thus find ourselves in the role of Hal Jordan as he travels to the planet Oa, with the aim of completing his training together with the other members of the Green Lantern Corps. However, a sudden event ruins Jordan's plans: an ancient army of robotic soldiers, the Manhunters, has returned from the abyss in which the Guardians had relegated them and now threatens to destroy the entire universe. Using our Ring of Power, we will therefore have to go to different planets (Earth included) to eliminate any possible threat and restore order. Rogue fantasy If you know the Green Lantern character, you know how his powers work. In practice everything depends on a very powerful ring, which allows the wearer to use his willpower not only to hurl energy shots and fly, but also and above all to create any object out of nothing. In the game this particular ability is managed progressively, i.e. we will be able to create certain objects (an anvil, an anchor, a missile) within the fights only after having ~scanned~ them, according to dynamics that aim at the exploration of the scenarios and even to the replayability of the stages. Each eliminated opponent also translates into a certain number of experience points, which we can spend to enhance the attacks available to us and the character's degree of resistance. In any case, our Green Lantern's repertoire proves to be relatively rich right from the start: using the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote and pressing the B trigger we can fire shots of energy, while by pressing the A button the superhero will hit the enemy by delivering ring-powered punches. To these maneuvers will be added the ability to use energy objects to further weaken the defenses of the Manhunters. Although horizontal scrolling and certain solutions are reminiscent of platformers, Hal Jordan is also able to move in any direction thanks to the ability to fly, all by simply moving the analog stick placed on the Nunchuk. Finally, the C and Z buttons allow us to create an energy barrier to protect ourselves from attacks and a chain with which to temporarily block opponents. Meh During the game there are numerous skills and attacks that we can acquire but the goal of making the action more varied by the developers unfortunately turns out to be far from being achieved. Basically, the problem is balancing. Within each scenario we have to move and reach ~hot~ areas, to collect objects or destroy something, and along the way we find ourselves facing Manhunter at will, strengthened by an infinite respawn. What should be the strength of the Griptonite Games title, or the fight, however, turns out to be an element without a bite and very repetitive. At some point it will even be spontaneous to escape from each new clash to quickly get to the point of the map that interests us. This certainly cannot be considered a merit of the game, on the contrary. Added to this is a mediocre technical realization, in some situations so simplistic as to remember the times of the PSone. We are well aware that the Wii is not the most powerful console on the market, but this can in no way justify such work, and the fact that we have made an ~alternative~ version of Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters for the Nintendo platform doesn't mean you have to aim that low for this version.", "date": "2011-09-05", "grade": "4.0"}
