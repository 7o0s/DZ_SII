It is clear to all that DICE has built its most ambitious title with the architecture of a high-end PC as a basis, staging battles on a very large scale, graced everything with a Frostbyte 2 that flexes its muscles in every single frame sent on screen, and scalability, both visual and gameplay, is the sector that has seen the greatest changes. The Battlefield 3 game offer is made up of the single player campaign, a real novelty for the franchise, six cooperative missions and obviously the multiplayer, the true heart of the product. Without too many words it is possible to state immediately that the campaign and co-op are not up to the competitive part of the game, but represent the weakest part of the package and that, contrary to the PC counterpart, they partially lose the thrust of a amazing cosmetics that covers the narrative flaws and actual gameplay. Cleanliness and realism The short campaign, about 5 hours at a normal level, is pure political fiction against the backdrop of (probable) World War III and narrates, based on a game of puzzles and flashbacks, the story of Marine Blackburn, who as a simple soldier will find himself accounts with decisions that will decide the fate of millions of people. DICE instead of choosing a ~linear~ setting in staging the battlefield, has decided to mix the cards on the table, starting from the last moments of the game and going back to tell the action through multiple points of view, which often they almost converge as we already saw in Danger Close's Medal of Honor. As written in the PC review, the campaign has only a few moments of great exhilaration, and it wearily sails to the end without really thrilling the player. In short, there have not been great steps forward compared to what was played in Bad Company 2: linearity and scripting are the stylistic hallmark of the game. In short, the pace is bland, realism and spectacularity do not seem to have found a good meeting point. To this then there are sections on decidedly subdued vehicles, with the negative vertex of bombing missions in which one does nothing but keep targets on the ground or in the air aimed, without even having piloted the plane since one is in the cloths of the armorer of an F-18. On the other hand, the second part of the tank mission is good, in which DICE makes us experience the entrance to Tehran by re-enacting the American capture of Baghdad in 2003, between ambushes from overpasses and car bombs ~to be defused~. Impossible not to mention the flaws of artificial intelligence often guided by invisible directives that lead enemies not to see us even if you pass by them, not to try to avoid a grenade or to always pass from the same point. Fortunately, in some situations the enemy's crossfire can be really lethal, but there are too few moments built with care and too many that expose the defects of the behavioral routines that reveal all too obvious scripting. One thing we would like to underline. In the PC review we underlined how the very high graphic level compensated (in part) for the structural deficiencies of the campaign and coop. In this case the thrust of the graphics is decidedly less strong, although in any case the cosmetics are undoubtedly impactful, even if the game is less flashy. The frame rate is indeed fixed at 30 FPS, but the definition of the textures is rather fluctuating with many elements, not only in the background, which appear less refined and clean than others. It can be safely said that in terms of general cleanliness Battlefield 3 for consoles is not a spotless title, with numerous and frequent pop-in and pop-up problems affecting the more distant elements. Mind you, the title is very nice to look at and plays on equal terms with the contemporary triple A, but the power of the graphics engine is simply too much for the old home consoles. From this point of view, the real protagonist of the game, or the lighting system, comes out resized, but still quite present in every situation. Our advice to get all the information on the campaign is to read the PC review, where we have gutted it in every single feature. DICE has also included a cooperative mode, six missions similar to Spec Ops di Modern Warfare, for up to two players online only. Neither split screen, nor bot in short. Our test left us with positive sensations: the variety of missions is appreciable, in some ways ~superior~ to that of the campaign and more similar to multiplayer. A good extra but certainly not the highlight of the menu offered by DICE. Ultimately nothing to tear your clothes off about (with the same artificial intelligence problems as the campaign), but not even a game mode hastily inserted as an extra designed for the competition. Playstation 3 trophies Battlefield 3 offers the player 39 trophies, of which 28 are bronze, 6 silver, 4 gold and the classic platinum. Most of the trophies are earned with the simple progression in the campaign, although there are some that are obtained by doing particular actions such as the one called ~Practice makes perfect~. Several trophies can also be taken home with the cooperative, completing the missions within certain parameters, not just temporal, while the golden trophies commit us to finishing the campaign and coop at the highest level of difficulty, to unlock all the ribbons and reach the level cap in multiplayer. The cavalry arrives From an online point of view, the true heart of the DICE project, the novelties are many and are not limited only to the inclusion of the planes, present in Battlefield 2, but not included in Bad Company 2, a more direct comparison at least in a strictly temporal perspective. The first change is the classes, different, or rather redesigned than those of Bad Company. Suffice it to say that the attacker will have duties as a doctor, releasing medikits or reviving his companions on the ground, in short, no ad hoc class. Those who look after their team will always find themselves in the heart of the action. Also very interesting is the machine gun's tripod, useful for suppressing enemies, or the sniper with his high-tech gadgets to signal the progress or position of enemies on the map. These novelties that have been included in the title in the name of maniacal balancing and which enhance teamwork and reasoned cooperation to arrive at the final victory. From this point of view, the deathmatch definitively loses importance compared to the Corsa and Conquest game modes, remaining only a useful addition as training for the heart of the game. Speaking of the means, those made available by DICE are really many and all to be ~developed~, as if they were simple firearms, aircraft included, the real spearhead of the game. Alongside attack and transport helicopters, we can sit in the narrow cockpit of the F-18 and that of the A-10 and of course their Russian counterparts, namely the Flanker and Frogfoot, to seek air supremacy with the first and launch fearsome CAS, also called ground attacks, with the second. The first impact with jets is unsettling, they are so difficult to fly being very sensitive, but you just need to have (a lot of) experience to become protagonists on the scene, changing the course of an attack or a defense. And, even more importantly, in maps where they are not provided, it is almost difficult not to look obsessively at the sky, looking for help or afraid to listen to the dull roar of the on-board cannon. We should also mention the vast number of unlockable items and upgrades, from optics to new weapons, passing through specializations and advanced gadgets. In fact, Battlefield 3 really allows us to tailor our style of play, perfectly balancing every single change to the equipment of our alter ego. But what were the changes made by DICE when moving from the PC to the console online scaffolding? The first, and the most immediately noticeable, is the reduction in the maximum number of players, from 64 to 24, which weighs heavily on the overcrowding of players on larger maps such as Caspian Border or Operation Firestorm, which in fact are, if not play with teamplay in mind that is too dispersive. To overcome this problem, the developers have managed to bring the respawn points closer to the action, ~compacting~ the maps in this perspective and reducing the conquest points from five to three. These changes that do not weigh too much on the development of the game, but which are symptomatic of the limits reached by home consoles. For an exhaustive description of the maps, one by one, we invite you to go back to reading the long paragraph written on the occasion of the PC review.", "date": "2011-10-28", "grade": "8.8"}
