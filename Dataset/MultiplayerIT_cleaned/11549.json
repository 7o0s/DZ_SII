{"name": "Ghost Recon 2: Advanced Warfighter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-2-advanced-warfighter.html", "text": "Everything can be said about Gameloft but not that it doesn't feel comfortable developing 2D mobile games, and this Ghost Recon 2: Advanced Warfighter is no exception, starting with an undoubtedly good level of graphic design: the scenarios, well defined and quite detailed, they are framed from a bird's eye view, while the sprites are rather generously sized and properly animated. In short, everything falls perfectly within the Gameloft quality standards, without acute details or demerits. An evaluation that could easily be extended to the gameplay of the product, certainly enjoyable although far from being original or particularly profound. As in the original for Xbox 360, but here the user takes on the role of Captain Mitchell, leader of the Ghost special team, who is given 72 hours to destroy a fringe of Mexican extremists intent on crossing the border and massacring American civilians. For this mobile version, Gameloft has preferred to abandon the aspects relating to team management, leaving all the tasks in the hands of Mitchell alone: the only (sporadic) appearances of fellow soldiers controlled by the CPU are little more than a formality, and have no effect on the progress of the game. The control system is decidedly simple and functional, with eight keys intended for movement in as many directions, the '5' delegated to fire and the '#' used to throw grenades. The heart of the experience is obviously represented by the shootings, which however are covered by a thin layer of tactics: it is therefore necessary to move from one cover to another and take out the enemies in the most stealth possible way, given that a head-on approach it only leads to a premature game over. Both the aiming and the exploitation of the shelters are managed automatically, so the user just has to identify the correct places to lurk and shoot at the targets with the right timing. The variety that such a playful structure actually lacks is partly compensated for by quite diversified scenarios and some sections on board a tank that break the canonical game action. Amusing even if a little repetitive, Ghost Recon 2: Advanced Warfighter can be frustrating at times, on some occasions in which the identification of cover points is particularly difficult and one is forced to start over from the checkpoint, but in general it is a more than decent action game.
