In fact, at the time, Geometry Wars contributed greatly to defining the contours of the twin stick shooter genre, which then literally exploded with a flood of more or less similar productions. Now that the market is undoubtedly less crowded, it is therefore decidedly pleasant to make a sort of return to origins by getting your hands on the iOS version of the last chapter, created by that Lucid Games team in which a large part of the Bizarre staff has converged. Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions on iOS is an excellent version of one of the best twin stick shooters And war it is Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions on iOS is a direct port, and this - considering the quality of the original - is undoubtedly a positive aspect. Although it is certainly not a technically very complex product, the large amount of moving elements on the screen and the excellent fluidity fixed at 60 fps represent essential elements of the experience that have also been perfectly maintained on Apple devices. The particle and light effects, together with the futuristic graphic style surrounded by acid colors and wireframe lines, consequently return a truly pleasant aesthetic component, with a remarkable and well-defined characterization. All this is then completed by the electronic music soundtrack, absolutely top notch and perfectly themed. A glance is therefore enough to understand that we are faced with a Geometry Wars, so to speak. Yet the British team, although forced by the strict limits imposed by the frenetic and immediate gameplay of this type of product, has managed to insert some new elements all the same. In fact, in this case, in Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions the levels are no longer made up only of flat two-dimensional planes, but some of them take place above a sort of small planets of cubic, spherical, cylindrical shapes and with a whole series of variations on the theme such as to guarantee a certain freshness of the experience. All this while remaining faithful to the spirit of the series, which requires maximum concentration to be able to stay alive as long as possible, making space between ever-increasing waves of enemies. Furthermore, the latter present differentiated behavioral patterns such as to impose different approaches and strategies: there may be those who attack frontally, others who follow elusive movements, others faster. The player's task is therefore to learn the moves of the enemies and memorize the succession of waves, in such a way as to maximize their score. The new Adventure mode also allows you to tackle the levels one after the other, in a structured succession that brings with it objectives and bosses to defeat. Also interesting is the growth and development of your ship, which can count on support drones and special abilities to be obtained along the progression. However, focusing on this version for Apple devices, it is worth noting that the only ~cuts~ are related to the multiplayer mode and the additional content brought to the console by the latest update, which also added the word ~Evolved~ to the subtitle. Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions on iPhone and iPad is a version that therefore does not compromise, even as regards the most important element, namely playability: controlling the shuttle using the virtual sticks is in fact an exercise that is not only natural, but one that suffers very little awe of the classic analog stick pad. In any case, the support for MFi controllers leaves the possibility for purists to perfectly replicate the gaming experience on consoles. However, where this version of Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions enjoys an undoubted advantage is in the price factor: at 4.99 the iOS edition practically stops at a third of the amount requested on other platforms, thus undoubtedly making it a highly attractive purchase for fans of the genre.", "date": "2015-06-10", "grade": "9.0"}
