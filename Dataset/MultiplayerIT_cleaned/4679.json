{"name": "Evil West", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-west-recensione.html", "text": "Someone in Flying Wild Hog must have really liked God of War a lot, to the point of wanting to recreate that same system (complete with a clear homage, see the opening sequences of the boxes) in the context of an action that nonetheless has a decidedly different setting compared to the mythological lore of the adventure of Kratos and Atreus. In fact, the game projects us into an alternative, dark far west, threatened by the forces of evil. An America on the brink of the abyss, if it weren't for the Rentier Institute and its brave hunters: special agents armed to the teeth and equipped with a special steel glove that allows them to hit the snouts of vampires, werewolves like a mallet , trolls and undead. The premises are captivating: all, none excluded; but was the Polish team able to implement them in the best way? We reveal it to you in the Evil West review. Story: between cowboys and monsters Evil West, Jesse Rentier and his battlemates Evil West is certainly not the first video game that imagines an alternative far west, populated by monsters and demonic creatures: the strategic Hard West did it very well, not long ago. The idea of the organization that deals with counteracting evil creatures, using a technology that is decidedly ahead of its time, is also very little original, but always able to fascinate and from this point of view the title of Flying Wild Hog is no exception. The character we control is Jesse Rentier, shrewd and rebellious son of the founder of the Rentier Institute: a man of few words and damn good at his job, which is to track down and kill monsters. In the initial stages of the campaign we find him on a mission together with his colleague and friend Edgar Gravenor: the two are intent on tracking down an old acquaintance of theirs, a vampire who apparently knows what is happening behind the scenes and what power is preparing to fall on the world. A particularly dangerous vampire, albeit with the appearance of a young girl, has in fact gathered an army and is preparing to launch a devastating attack, setting herself the headquarters of the Rentier Institute as her first target: without the hunters' guild it will only be a matter of time. before the United States falls under the blows of the creatures of the night, and it will be up to us to prevent this from happening. The story of Evil West turns out to be rather linear and with predictable narrative implications, but its biggest problem lies in the writing of the characters, which unfortunately do not enjoy sufficient characterization to make them stand out. The protagonist himself, thanks to a fairly generic design, looks no different than any other old-school video game hero: a pity, because the potential to do better was all there. Gameplay: western god of war Evil West, Jesse punches a zombie As mentioned at the beginning, Evil West clearly pays homage to God of War in terms of gameplay, using the same type of view and a layout of controls similar to the Santa Monica Studio title to deliver us a combat system that effectively arises as the 'most successful and valid aspect of this production, really rich and varied, as well as effective in making impacts well. Jesse can face his enemies by throwing powerful punches by repeatedly pressing the right backbone, or hold it down and act on the directions of the analog stick to perform devastating uppercuts with a lot of flying strikes, or even jump attacks. The character can instantly parry with the left lat or dodge with the X key while moving left or right. Evil West, the clash with a vampire boss The right trigger allows you to fire the revolver, the left one to aim to use the rifle (with a very aggressive automatic lock by default), while the square button activates the very powerful shotgun, which however requires long cooldown times: one of the many strategic elements of the Evil West combat system, which from this point of view proves to be truly multifaceted. Proceeding in the campaign we will obtain new instruments of death and destruction, also characterized however by a ~short magazine~ (but the ammunition is infinite, don't worry ) and recallable with the d-pad keys: a flamethrower, grenades, a Gatling gun. Then there's the Rentier Gauntlet, which can channel electrical energy and unleash it to attract enemies and punch them while they're immobilized, or dash at them and do the same. Evil West, the gauntlet allows you to electrify your enemies and cannonade them freely That's not all: a special indicator allows Jesse to perform spectacular special moves. One of them blocks tAll opponents on the screen with electricity, allowing us to hit them freely while the effect lasts, while the other gives us the ability to unleash a series of powerful attacks with lightning speed. The upgrade system further enriches this already wide repertoire, introducing several new maneuvers. In short, we really liked the fights of Evil West, also being able to count on an enviable variety of enemies: in addition to the basic creatures, the so-called ~sanguisugae~ , there are at least a dozen different bosses who are thrown against us with extreme violence in the final stages of the campaign, in groups of three or four at a time, giving life to truly visceral and demanding sequences, which on PS5 also make full use of the features of the DualSense controller, especially the adaptive triggers. Evil West, a shot from a distance with a shotgun Unfortunately, what surrounds the fights turns out to be mediocre, the son of a very dated conception of level design, which in fact abounds with more or less invisible barriers and pretends openings where instead the path that we find in the sixteen chapters of the campaign is always very linear. There are some simple environmental puzzles to solve, chests and money to be found, but all of the exploration is just filler. That said, the options support the base rig very well, giving us the ability to jump into the new game + once you get to the end of the campaign, which lasts about ten hours, or to face the levels by activating permanent death, therefore with a dry attempt. Finally, there is the online cooperative mode, which however does not have matchmaking, works only by invitation and moreover only stores the progress of the host: a pity. Technical realization: old west graphics Evil West, Jesse tries to warm up the atmosphere The announcement relating to resolution and frame rate of Evil West on the various consoles caused quite a discussion: in practice, the game boasts on PS5 and Xbox Series X the two classic graphics modes, one with an emphasis on resolution that runs at 4K and 30 fps, the other focused on performance which, however, goes down to 1080p to be able to offer 60 fps. Well, we have good and bad news: the first is that you will hardly notice the difference and therefore you can easily opt for 60 frames, which are really rocky apart from a single exception during the final showdown; the second is that you will hardly notice the difference because the technical sector of the game is basically old-gen. Evil West, the clash with a huge worm It's true: the developers have done an excellent job in terms of bestiary and the enemies are plentiful and well differentiated, but even here once you leave the field of interest of the fights you come across a myriad of highly dated solutions, with at times ridiculous (see splashes of water and flames) and, in general, the sensation of being faced with a product from another era: not exactly that of the far west, but we understood each other. The sound seemed discreet as regards the dialogues in English (subtitled in Italian), recited with sufficient conviction even if inevitably weakened by the lack of originality of the characterizations, rather good in terms of audio effects but sometimes incomplete in terms of music, from which it was perhaps reasonable to expect something more.", "date": "2022-11-21", "grade": "7.0"}
