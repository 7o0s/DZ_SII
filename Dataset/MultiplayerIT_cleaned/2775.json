{"name": "A3: Still Alive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a3-still-alive-recensione.html", "text": "The review of A3: Still Alive is the story of a project in which two souls coexist: Netmarble's new mobile MMORPG tries on the one hand to innovate thanks to the introduction of an original battle royale mode for thirty players, on the other loses in the folds of an extremely generic artistic characterization and a bulimic and confusing gameplay. Set in a dark fantasy scenario, a world destined to be destroyed were it not for a handful of heroes who rise up against the invasion of a dark force, the game adopts the traditional freemium format on iOS and Android but without focusing too much on monetization: you can go on for hours without feeling the need to resort to microtransactions. Structure At the beginning of the game, A3: Still Alive asks us to choose the specialization of our avatar among five different classes: Berserker, the traditional well-balanced warrior; Templar, an unstoppable and resistant tank; Sorceress, capable of casting spells from a distance; Assassin, fast and elusive; or Archer, also specialized in shots from afar but fairly defenseless in close combat. However, these are not aesthetically pre-set characters, far from it: once the selection has been made, you switch to a surprisingly complete and detailed editor that allows you to change the fighter's appearance by alternating different armor, hairstyle, face and a whole series of details, from the size of the nose to the inclination of the eyebrows. In short, a rather complete set. Once the campaign has begun, we are faced with a very traditional structure for the MMORPG genre, especially on mobile, which however immediately appears tremendously chaotic and a little too devoted to automatisms. On the variety, then, there is something to discuss: generally the missions in which we will take part involve the elimination of a certain number of enemies, the collection of objects or the interaction with specific NPCs. However, there is the already announced novelty of the battle royale mode, which actually gives the experience an edge. Net of a few too many problems in the matchmaking phase (more than once we encountered unidentified connection errors, despite having a 100 Mbit fiber), the idea is interesting: thirty players who all start from the same level of strength, they must try to eliminate monsters to level up and then clash to determine a single final survivor across four sectors. Gameplay The big problem of A3: Still Alive therefore does not concern its playful offer, quite rich and full-bodied, nor the technical realization, which indeed with the maximum settings in terms of resolution and frame rate (which, however, tend to heat up a little too much the device) looks really convincing. No, the problem lies entirely in the gameplay, excessively frenetic and confusing. As mentioned at the beginning, in fact, the title of Netmarble Games immediately reveals itself to be literally bulimic in its eagerness to grind quests to make us level up, filling us with notifications on the screen for rewards and interactions, so much so that we don't even leave ourselves the time to equip an object we have just obtained and resorting too frequently to automatisms, which end up debasing and trivializing the experience excessively. In theory, the system is in fact valid, with an excellent touch control system and a set of skills each equipped with its own cooldown, which prove to be extremely effective and spectacular in battle. The fact is, however, that these clashes are thrown at us thinking of quantity rather than quality, reducing the artificial intelligence of the enemies to almost zero (only the bosses seem interested in facing us in a dignified way) and avoiding enhancing the individual clashes, even due to slippery and inconsistent impact rendering. It's a real shame, because pretty much everything else about the project feels quite remarkable. It would take very little to thin out the absurdly crowded interface of A3: Still Alive, give greater depth to the fights and perhaps completely eliminate the automatic mode, which at present only diminishes the excellent work done by the development team on the front of the numbers and pure technical quality.", "date": "2020-11-20", "grade": "6.8"}
