Once upon a time there was a survival horror series that needed to be rethought because, in the meantime, the scenario had profoundly changed; and so the developers of the Capcom house decided to switch to the first person view, changing the protagonist and atmospheres without however abandoning the typical formula of the franchise, which emerged overwhelmingly in the second part of the Resident Evil 7 biohazard campaign. Perhaps, however, they had exaggerated: the episode was too scary, so much so that those who had tried it in virtual reality on PlayStation VR had found themselves with big problems replacing the upholstery of the sofa, and so for the next chapter they would have had to change again, find a different balance between horror and action, perhaps inspired by something different from the by now inflated theme of zombies. So here is the idea of the remote Eastern European village where witches, vampires and werewolves move, which welcomes us after a shocking initial phase and which immediately establishes some very clear concepts: Ethan Winters is no longer the naive man he once was, he has undergone military training and knows how to defend himself. Even more so if the life of his daughter depends on his actions. Gameplay: A new and different Resident Evil Resident Evil Village will always see us wielding a weapon, or rather almost always. The prerogatives of Resident Evil Village immediately impact on the gameplay, which as mentioned is much more action-oriented than what was seen in the previous episode, which tried in the first half of the campaign to retrace the path of ~passive~ horror games, those in which one can only run or hide without a fight. Confused and wounded, Ethan almost immediately comes into possession of a knife and the dynamics of blocking, repelling and lunging are clarified within a few minutes, but it is decided to leave them available exclusively to users who will try to complete the game on the difficulty level highest among the three normally available, encountering inevitable problems of supply of weapons and ammunition. Resident Evil Village, the fight with a vile servant of Lady Dimitrescu. All the others will be able to rely more easily on the pistol and the shotgun, which quickly become part of the protagonist's inventory and allow you to eliminate the ferocious lycans relatively quickly, perhaps by shooting them down with a shot and finishing them off with small bullets caliber while they are still on the ground, then going to collect the objects left by their corpses. The fact that the basic opponents are basically werewolves translates into much more dynamic situations than traditional zombies. Usually stationed on the roofs of village houses, lycans attack when they hear us coming and move suddenly, making it difficult to get them in the sights for a headshot and quickly closing ranges. Resident Evil Village, some village survivors united in prayer. Of course, the greater focus on the fights and on the types of enemies present, quite numerous and varied between normal, ranged, armored, mini bosses and bosses proper, does not exclude the typical elements of Resident Evil from the picture, i.e. the puzzles based on keys , codes and objects to collect around in order to access previously sealed areas. Unfortunately, this component has been weakened: the developers have decided to use the traditional inventory only and exclusively for weapons, ammunition and medkits, inserting the raw materials for the new crafting system within virtually infinite slots and the aforementioned keys and items needed to solve the puzzles elsewhere yet. Resident Evil Village, a disturbing glimpse that we will find ourselves exploring. In short, you will hardly have space problems in Resident Evil Village, and you just need to use the coins collected around (but above all the jewels to sell to the mysterious Duke) to obtain the resources necessary for a timely extension of the ~suitcase~. So forget about running into those situations where perhaps you have to sacrifice a medical spray to make room for a crank linked to some mechanism. Likewise, the easy accessibility to the map and the indications present on points of interest, including any objective on duty, substantially reduce dead and eliminated timesaddress any doubts or perplexities about how to proceed in order to move forward in the campaign. An approach that, net of the numerous secrets to be discovered around the scenarios, also lends itself to speedruns. Structure: the Village and its four Lords Resident Evil Village, the merchant Duke in all his abundant glory. In short, a much more devoted approach to action and immediacy, which is also reflected in the structure of Resident Evil Village. Once you have overcome the initial stages and met the aforementioned Duke for the first time, masterfully voiced by Riccardo ~Joker~ Peroni, the scenario is in fact divided in a clear and sharp way, with the Village in the center of the map and the domain of the four Lords at its extremities. The first location is undoubtedly the most evocative and fascinating of all: the disquieting Dimitrescu Castle. The very tall, very powerful and busty Alcina Dimitrescu lives there together with her three daughters, ~stalkers~ in the most traditional sense of the term but managed in an interesting way, with some scripted phases which, however, prove to be fundamental for the unlocking of new sections of the building and the inevitable clashes with Ethan. Resident Evil Village, the Dimitrescu Castle undoubtedly represents the best and most articulated scenario. We are also talking about the scenario that most of all conveys the gothic atmospheres of which Village promotes compared to the previous Resident Evils, while the territories of the other Lords draw a little more on the tradition of the franchise. The Heisenberg factory, for example, is a maze of corridors and elevators that somewhat recall the more classic maps of the series. Of course, all these elements take a back seat when you face the second Lord of the Village, the mysterious Donna Beneviento. Inspired at least in name by the tradition of Benevento witches, the boss is actually a mad puppeteer who spreads hallucinogenic substances in his mansion, altering Ethan's perceptions. Resident Evil Village, a dark corridor in Donna Beneviento's ~passive~ phase. The result is a section that pays homage to Outlast-style survival horror, complete with the possibility of hiding under a bed while waiting for the monster on duty to make its rounds and you can run away with your back to it. However, the realization appears a little too hasty and drawn out, so much so that the completion times of this part are substantially lower than the Dimitrescu Castle or the Heisenberg factory. A very similar argument can be made about the phases in which we find ourselves to face the pathetic and deformed Moreau, which give life to sequences based on timing and then open up to a traditional boss fight against the backdrop of a small labyrinth to be traversed at speed. So let's say that the game tries to experiment and the desire to shuffle the cards to always keep engaging must be recognized, but there is no doubt that two out of four Lords have been managed in a less inspired way and it is obviously a pity. The PC version Resident Evil Village, the effects are also in the details. We know that Resident Evil Village runs very well on next-gen consoles, maintaining 4K at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X with ray tracing enabled but actually using a lower resolution - probably 1440p - in order to offer this kind of performance. Well, how does the PC version behave? Let's begin by saying that a direct comparison with Resident Evil 7 biohazard appears improper, both due to the presence of new and more sophisticated graphic effects, and above all due to the much broader and more open scenarios, which in the presence of fires, explosions and numerous enemies on the screen engage the hardware in a substantially greater way, giving rise to some uncertainty even on the most extreme configurations. Resident Evil Village, the clash with one of Lady Dimitrescu's daughters gives rise to some slowdowns. At this moment, DLSS 2.0 is not among the options, and this obviously represents a big problem for those who would like to get the most out of the experience but have a previous generation RTX video card and are unable to buy a 30 series due to the good known situation of the GPU market. However, the RE Engine is once again confirmed as versatile and well optimized, and in fact with an RTX 3070 it is possible to play at 4K (real) and 60 fps by setting all the effects to the maximum, including ray tracing, with the only caution not to overdo the memory assigned to the textures. By disabling vertical sync, the counter generally returns 70-75 frames per second, but there are situations in which there are quite evident slowdowns and the hope is that with a day one patch everything will be fixed. Resident Evil Fillage, Donna Beneviento's mansion from the outside. It goes without saying that by disabling ray tracing there is a substantial boost in performance, and this is even more true for those who still own an NVIDIA GTX or a previous generation Radeon. In short, the settings allow you to scale the graphics in order to obtain the best possible compromise in relation to the components. Specifically, from the options screen it is possible to change the resolution, frame rate, vertical synchrony, rendering and image quality (the traditional scaler), activate the FidelityFX CAS, choose the type of antialiasing, use the variable rate shading to decrease the computational load, set the quality of the textures and the relative filter, the meshes and the ray tracing, the reflections and the global illumination, ambient occlusion and light reflection, volumetric lights, shadows, and more. All these items have an impact on the video memory which is clearly represented on the same screen, so as to be able to check the weight of each individual setting and then experience it live, in search of the perfect combination for our system. However, there is no shortage of general presets that speed up the whole procedure, but which obviously don't go to great lengths and could push you to make excessive sacrifices. As for controls and accessibility, Resident Evil Village can obviously be played with a mouse and keyboard or with a any controller, and here too the options are not lacking: the keys can be remapped and the axes inverted, you can adjust the speed and acceleration of the pointer, as well as obviously the sensitivity, change the color of the aiming reticle and set the audio in order to change the language of the voices and activate any subtitles.", "date": "2021-05-09", "grade": "9.2"}
