Without having to develop an interface that provides for the movement of the character or complex scenarios, but rather simple backgrounds with possible targets to shoot at, it is clear how this type of product lends itself very well to rapid development while boasting, in its small way, some growth potential. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Sniper Fury, the new Gameloft title, which in the promotional images quite clearly mentions Sniper Elite III, just as it tries to mimic the look of the protagonist of ~American Sniper~ in the icon. Small expedients to which the French house has often accustomed us, and of which it is certainly not the only creator in the furniture sector, but which here, however, rest on anything but solid foundations. In the game we take on the role of an infallible sniper who is recruited by a government agency to eliminate dangerous targets around the world. Through four different scenarios (Murmansk, Shanghai, Jungle and Dubai - the latter not yet available), we will therefore have to grapple with short missions divided into categories, in order to earn the money and experience necessary to obtain certain upgrades and continue towards the next internship. Sniper Fury is an unsuccessful ~precision shooter~, too hasty in its mechanics Shooters The first problem with Sniper Fury is that by ~short missions~ we really mean operations that take place within a few seconds, in which therefore there is no room for anything other than the simple identification of targets and their neutralization; the second problem is that this practice gives very little satisfaction, moreover going to hinge on a freemium model which in terms of the energy of action appears relatively malleable, allowing even fairly long game sessions, but which from the second area places important constraints on progression, forcing a very long grind to raise the funds necessary to buy new weapons. To this is added the element of ~aid~, initially a radar and a handful of armor-piercing shells, which prove to be almost essential during some missions, but which are available in limited quantities and cannot be recharged unless you put your wallet in your hand. The sector parallel to the missions is interesting, with the organization of the traditional base and the assault on those of the other players to steal some gold from them, but in the end it is always the same sequence that is repeated again and again, without substantial differences, which quickly dwindles enthusiasm. The controls have an option to activate the 3D Touch, which allows you to zoom without acting on the on-screen regulator, but managing everything through the greater or lesser pressure of your fingers. This solution works very well when using assault rifles, less so when dealing with the sniper, for the simple reason that holding down the touch screen and simultaneously moving the crosshair is not easy, in fact it is rather bad. Technically, the work done by Gameloft is average, without high notes and indeed with ugly effects for the explosions, as well as little variety for the locations. The bullet times that start when you make the decisive shots could have lightened the situation a bit, but the death animations are too few to achieve the desired effect.", "date": "2015-12-09", "grade": "5.0"}
