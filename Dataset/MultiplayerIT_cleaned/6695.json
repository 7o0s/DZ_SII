A little less legitimate was to note how it arrived with not exactly ~commercial~ times, given that in fact just over four years have passed since we reviewed it on Xbox 360. Four years in which the isometric adventures of Lara Croft have seen unchanged the basic mechanics, or that practically perfect mix between shooter, platform and puzzle to solve, however grafted onto a cooperative, local and online, for up to four players. This choice expands the cooperative (but also competitive) dynamics of the game, all in the name of replayability and a real endgame to be explored. But let's go in order. Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris is a worthy successor to Guardian of Light Are you a God? If in Guardians of Light the adventures of Lara Croft made us take a dip into Aztec mythology, today instead we are grappling with a classic that cannot be more classic, but for this reason perhaps much stronger and more impactful. The title betrays the setting: we are in Egypt, grappling with the curse of a revived Set, who we must defeat to save the world, helped by archaeologist rival Carter Bell and by Horus and Isis. The story is small, a simple common thread that allows us to travel to this ~Valley of the Kings~ hidden in the sands of the desert, a perfect playground full of tombs, temples and secret areas to explore. In fact, this valley acts as a central hub through which Lara must move to reach the various tombs, where the parts of the body of Osiris are hidden, including canopic jars, thanks to which it will be possible to summon the goddess for the final battle with the evil Set . The beauty of this hub is that it is itself a ~level~, with its puzzles, its enemies, and its platforms to climb and jump. Without forgetting that we could dedicate ourselves to finding health and weapon upgrades, but also and above all finding and ~solving~ the challenge tombs, to get a generous extra gems. Gems are the currency of the game: they are found by breaking vases, lighting braziers and blowing up the appropriately marked paving areas. The enemies then release them (especially the well-crafted ~end of the grave~ bosses) and they must be spent to open the chests inside which there are rings and necklaces, of different value and rarity, and which can give important and tangible bonuses and malus to our statistics. That is, for example, increased damage, more health, expanded bomb radius, incendiary bullets after a ~series of kills~ and so on. The rarest and most expensive ~accessories~ come with bonuses only, while the cheap common ones come with both positive and negative characteristics. We must therefore make prudent choices that have a strong impact on our way of playing. Playstation 4 trophies Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris rewards the player with twelve trophies. All related to progression, main tombs and challenges included. Nothing transcendental. However, there are some secret trophies. We came and we saw and... Pad in hand, the dynamics are the ones we all know. The isometric view sends a game world to the screen in which action, puzzle solving and platforming coexist side by side, where weapons are used to kill enemies, but are also necessary to press switches and move gears. Just mention the mines to be placed on the ground that we can detonate when we want, an essential element of the whole gameplay. The puzzles more than the clashes are therefore the key element of the game, fun both when playing alone and when other friends join the game. In this case the arrangement of some elements of the scenario changes to meet a solution of the cooperative puzzle, just as the objects equipped by the characters change. Playing alone, in addition to the grappling hook, Lara also has the Osiris stirrup, which is used to move particular platforms but also to slow down the explosion of some ~bomb spheres~, to be placed and detonated as needed. Playing in two the bracket will pass to the other player, in order to divide the work. The other characters also have their main features. If Lara has the grappling hook, thanks to which she can ~hook~ the other companions to practically move them by weight (and not only this), the two gods awakened from their millennial sleep can summon a shield, a real protective bubble that also acts as from ~ladder~ to ensure that Croft and Carter can reach elevated areas. In short, the cooperative was thought out really well, like the puzzles thatthey are never frustrating and too brainy. It's simply a matter of moving rolling balls, placing explosive ones, rotating reflective mirrors or flipping switches. Nothing too complicated, but never trivial, ingenious and all in all decidedly rewarding. Getting stuck is hard; at most it can happen that you don't hit the right jump or you don't see some object. The fights are perhaps the least successful part of the game, but we're still not talking about something negative. They are not very frequent, much less very exciting. The game pushes the accelerator (thankfully) more on puzzles and exploration: not that little shooting is done, but the balance leans more on the other side, without forgetting that playing alone the game can be all too easy, even during the bosses. Bosses that still require the resolution of a small puzzle to be killed, it's not enough just to empty a sea of lead on them. In this sense, Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris must necessarily be played at least in pairs. In addition to the cooperative dynamics that are established between the players, the level of difficulty rises, with more numerous enemies and so on, making everything much more fun and challenging. Not that you always drive the beautiful archaeologist on autopilot alone, but only in rare cases are the enemies a tough nut to crack. Once you become proficient at placing mines it really gets easier. So easy that the exploration timer of only the main tombs, about ten, scored a total of just over three hours. From a minimum of five minutes to a maximum of thirty-five. Obviously we are talking about effective time, without counting the challenge tombs and the exploration of the hub-valley, but more generally we can say that if you go in a hurry, without wasting too much time, the impression is that it is possible to finish the I play even under five hours. Not exactly a high value. But it must be said that once Set is silenced forever the endgame opens. Here it is possible to return to previously visited tombs, to search for as many gems as possible and collectable skulls left unfinished. All in the name of online rankings, with requirements that vary from grave to grave. Without forgetting that in the valley we can activate obelisks to fight with a good number of enemies, in real hordes made up of the varied and well-crafted fauna that inhabits the area. We go from mummies equipped with different types of attack, from the bow with incendiary arrows to the research ones, passing through the killer cockroaches, without forgetting crocodiles armed with a spear or with a lightning attack. There is little to complain about from this point of view. It goes without saying that we too will be fully armed, with different types of rifles, machine guns, flamethrowers and rocket launchers. Finally, the weather also plays an important factor, but here we are in a dangerous spoiler zone. Visually speaking, the work done by the developers is undoubtedly commendable, especially on an artistic level, but it is equally true that the limits of a ~minor~ production are visible. The tombs are all well diversified from each other according to their ~theme~, in order to create very different environments full of details. Another plus of the game is the lighting system which, although not particularly refined, stages truly evocative settings. In terms of texture, the quality is fluctuating as is the polygonal count, not exactly exuberant. But without a doubt the impact is decidedly pleasant and effectively transports us to a mythical ancient Egypt. Then there are some sporadic drops in frame rates, nothing devastating anyway.", "date": "2014-12-08", "grade": "8.5"}
