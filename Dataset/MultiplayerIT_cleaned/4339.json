In reality, the title developed by Ubisoft Sofia, assisted by other studios within the French company, including that of Milan, proved to be much more than that ~stepchild~ that many feared. And today, which is re-proposed in a 1080p remastered edition complete with the various bonus contents released at the time (other additional contents are unlocked instead through the rewards of the Ubisoft Club) there is an opportunity for many enthusiasts to discover what the net of limited longevity and outdated mechanics, it is perhaps one of the most interesting chapters of the saga, at least from the point of view of the story. In fact, the episode offers for the first time a different perspective in the eternal struggle between Assassins and Templars, highlighting the reasons of those who for so many chapters represented only the enemy to be killed, and thus placing the gamer in the shoes of one of the latter, in a pleasant and particularly dark story written by Richard Farrese, whose only flaw is perhaps in not having dug even deeper into the protagonist's fought soul. Shay the Templar From this point of view, the game completes the history of the Kenways and that of the New World, setting itself between Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed III, with Assassins and Templars competing to take control of colonial America, on the background of the French and Indian wars, the first settlements and naval battles, in a mix of events and facts as always halfway between the historical and the fantastic. The protagonist of the adventure is Shay Patrick Cormac, a guy with a strong and rebellious nature who joins the Brotherhood of Assassins at a young age, but then abandons it after a particularly traumatic experience that pushes him to become their bitter enemy . And it is precisely his presence that makes the work ~original~, because if it is true that in Assassin's Creed III the gamer had already worn the clothes of a Templar, Haytham Kenway, here he does so for almost the entire adventure, not for a single portion, with all the implications of the case as regards the evolution of the plot and certain mechanics. In terms of playability, in fact, the title is stylistically anchored to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and therefore does not propose radical changes or the innovations seen in the more modern chapters. However, playing with the characteristics of the new character and his deployment, the developers have tried to vary the experience by reworking tasks, strategies and arsenal from this point of view. As a Templar, in fact, the player finds himself carrying out ~inverted~ tasks compared to those he used to do playing an Assassin, and therefore to protect some characters of the Order from the attacks of the Brotherhood, to eliminate the most important local adepts after having sneaked into their strongholds, or to carry out secondary missions with the constant threat of being hunted down and shot by surprise by one of the former comrades of the Creed. The latter in turn hunt down Shay, and it is not uncommon to have to deal with one of them who has emerged from the shadows while perhaps the protagonist is in turn lurking to ambush some objective. Playstation 4 trophies Assassin's Creed: Rogue Remastered offers players 47 Trophies to unlock, distributed throughout the adventure. They are divided into 30 bronze, 14 silver, two gold and one platinum and are obtained by completing particular moments in the story or by achieving some objective. In the North Atlantic seas To eliminate enemies, Shay has an arsenal that offers a greater range of alternatives than his illustrious predecessors, with various long-range firearms such as the multifunctional and silent air rifle, perfect for operating from the shadows. As if that weren't enough, he knows new moves that add to those learned when he was part of the Assassins, such as the ability to suffocate enemies with brutal and rapid hangings. Even in face-to-face and hand-to-hand battles, the protagonist is able to unleash a whole series of special techniques, which, combined with the paraphernalia in his possession, make him a real war machine. Even if the basic approach to fighting remains very similar to what was seen in the chapters of the past generationion of consoles, as demonstrated not only by the persistence of weapons such as swords and hidden blades, but also by opponents unable to offer an adequate level of challenge, having multiple solutions available remains an important aspect. Assassin's Creed: Rogue Remastered continues directly in the wake traced by the fourth chapter as well as regards the exploration and distribution of events in the game, harmonizing the action phases on the ground with those of navigation in a more organic way. Also in this episode there are in fact the missions on board a ship, on the seas and on the rivers, with some additions to the consolidated structure of Black Flag which includes assaults on forts (in this edition the bonus mission of The Siege of Fort de Sable) or other vessels to plunder and then resell or integrate into your fleet, to use them in a special minigame. Among the small novelties the risk that the gamer falls victim to a raid by the Assassins, or the possibility of interacting with portions of the surrounding environment, especially with the icebergs. In fact, these real mountains of floating ice can be strategically exploited as cover to avoid shelling or, by counterattacking, as a weapon: once torn to pieces by a couple of well-aimed cannon shots, the icebergs can cause an anomalous wave that hits the ships, destroying the smaller ones and making the larger ones unstable and therefore more vulnerable for a few moments. The perfect opportunity, therefore, to unleash the entire arsenal against them and sink them. A world to explore In this sense, the Morrigan, Cormac's ship, can count on a set of advanced gadgets, which allow him to be able to exploit a series of slightly more varied attack and defense solutions than in the past. In addition to the traditional primary and secondary guns, mortars and hooks for boarding enemy ships, for example, the Templars have prototypes at their disposal, such as the Puckle cannon transformed into a sort of devastating machine gun capable of tearing apart vessels in a few seconds, while to keep at a safe distance or even block potential pursuers, making them desist from the idea, together with the classic flammable barrels or mines, there is fuel oil to be released into the sea and set on fire. The terrestrial exploration phases are instead characterized by the presence of many locations where one can devote himself to many activities, including the traditional secondary missions we mentioned at the beginning, or those which include the looting of the forts' warehouses and supply fields, the exploitation of mainland income from outposts, restored buildings and hunting, and so on. And again, participate in special events and treasure hunts, from that of the Templars to that of the Vikings, up to the bonus mission of the original edition in search of Sir Gunn's armor, moving along extremely suggestive paths. In addition to the river valleys of the American continent and the New York area, the northern areas are particularly fascinating, which represent a characterizing element of a large part of the atmosphere of this chapter. Better than the original? The world of Assassin's Creed: Rogue Remastered appears alive and responsive, thanks to the excellent level design which, as written before, effectively intersperses settings on land and on the sea, and to a direction which, among other things, seems, in some moments, to want to guide hand the player so as not to make him lose even a moment of the flow of events that punctuate the adventure. From a visual point of view, the switch to a 1080p resolution seems to have benefited the work: the image is more defined, and based on the PC version of the original game, a handful of slightly more complex textures have been implemented to give more detail to characters and scenarios, which are also ~fuller~ given the presence of a greater number of natural elements to reinvigorate the vegetation and fauna of the areas. In general we see an improvement in the rendering of the environment, and even if the engine and graphic solutions are obviously not comparable to those of more recent productions such as Origins or even Unity, the game still knows how to return a good overview, offering glimpses quite successful environments, accomplices of good particle effects and a pleasant and improved management of lights and shadows, whose definition and resolution have been improved. The modeling of the characters is good, with an appreciable effort in facial acting, a little less certain animations, which in some cases seem a little limited. Moving on to the audio compartment, bThe Italian dubbing is good, well acted for large stretches of the adventure with the right interpretative tonality depending on the moment or the mood of the characters. In the same way, the soundtrack, curated by the composer Elitsa Alexandrova, is apt, boasting some sung tracks such as the splendid choral melody of the Agnus Dei. The music, which ranges from songs reminiscent of typical Irish ballads, to those of certain action films with a historical setting, then adequately accompany each single phase of the game.", "date": "2018-03-19", "grade": "7.5"}
