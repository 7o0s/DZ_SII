{"name": "Dark Chronicle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-chronicle-2.html", "text": "Dark Chronicles Dark Chronicle opens with a lightning-fast sequence, worthy of the most eventful exponent of the genre. A mysterious girl emerges from a room in what looks like a castle, being pursued by several enemies. Managed to come into possession of a weapon, she manages to defeat them in an interactive scene in which she will be at the player's command. Suddenly the screen fades out and the scene changes in favor of a boy named Max, who, although from a good family, prefers to spend his time in the company of an old inventor. In the evening he goes to the circus to see the show, but as in the most classic tradition, our protagonist witnesses a scene he shouldn't have attended, and is therefore forced to flee, chased by the owner of the circus. Fortunately a friend helps him to infiltrate the sewers, temporarily the only way out of the town, sewers that will be the first location of the game, short and easy to allow the gamer to become familiar with the game. The pivots of the structure of Dark Chronicle are therefore soon evident: The exploration of increasingly large dungeons full of opponents and useful items where the main objective will be to find the enemy who has the key to exit the plan, the combat system action-style, very similar to zelda, the level up of weapons as in the most classic of western RPGs. However, Max will not be the only character that we will have available, in fact we will be able to use a fully customizable Robot with pieces that can be created or purchased, and Monica, who will be selectable at will instead of the boy. Both characters possess distinctive characteristics, such as different combo systems, primary and secondary weapon types, special abilities (the robot in Max's case, monster transformations for Monica), and more. However, it will not always be possible to use characters, weapons, or skills, as the dungeon may have a seal that prohibits their use, making it even more complicated. Since there is no level up of any kind for the characters, the search for treasures containing defense and energy upgrades proves to be as fundamental as the growth of the weapon. Subject to the experience points left by the enemies, the weapon can also be upgraded with the use of crystals that give it elemental power, necessary to transform it into a superior model. Besides dungeons, the other essential mode is the georama system. Once the necessary information has been retrieved, it will be possible to build environments in a specially created section. It is interesting to note that although the story requires certain characteristics necessary to continue, the pattern to follow will still be quite free, and no one will prevent us from embellishing it as much as we want. NPCs play a fundamental role in the georama system, and we will often have to satisfy their requests to see them arrive in our villages. Once conquered, however, we will be amply rewarded by their skills which can be used in turn in the dungeons. However, the mini games are not inferior to the main modes, in fact they will range from a kind of golf with bizarre rules, to the capture and breeding of a large variety of fish, up to the invention system, which will allow us to create hundreds of different objects, such as weapons, pieces of our robot, and much more starting from simple images taken with the camera, which we will have to compose in the way we deem most appropriate. A few secrets and mini-quests complete the picture of a simply incredible longevity, while a conversion as usual imperfect and slower than the original and a sometimes inaccurate localization in Italian make some doubts about the validity of the European edition. Ars Technique It is difficult to imagine a technical sector worthy of such a well-finished structure, but Dark Cloud 2 amazes even in this respect, giving the player one of the most valuable aesthetics ever seen on Sony consoles. In particular, it manages to recreate almost perfectly a fantasy universe with the most diverse facets, varying without any problem from ice to fire, from water to earth, with also excellent reconstructions of the worlds we have just created. The wealth of details and details of the settings is truly impressive, while maintaining a high definition of textures and a significant amount of polygons on the screen. The same care is present on the front of the models of the protagonists and enemies, made with the now strange technique of cel shading. The effect is superior to other games that use it such as Wild Arms 3, much to renderere Dark Chronicle really similar to a cartoon, especially as regards the superb animations, always precise and believable. Also noteworthy are the special effects, such as the refraction of light in the environments, the various weapons and spells, the particle ones. The end result is decidedly impressive, and improves from chapter to chapter, reaching peaks of absolute excellence towards the end. The only defects are located in the presence of some slowdowns in the most agitated phases and in some negligible signs of pop-ups. The sound, on the other hand, is not up to the best audio compositions of the genre, but it makes itself heard with catchy tunes and very simple arrangements. <i>Comment</i> Dark Chronicle is a masterpiece in the old sense of the word. Therefore understood as a synonym of perfection, of rare technical and structural refinement and not as something abstract and open to daring interpretations. Level 5 redefined the Dungeon RPG genre, changing it from a repetitive sequence of fights to an infinite creative synthesis of different genres, all perfectly integrated with each other. In an era in which the video game is increasingly shorter and less original, Dark Cloud 2 seems in fact an anomaly, with a longevity capable of easily reaching one hundred hours without resorting to particular refinements, but focusing on its solid characteristics, which range from from the Georama System to the ingenious system of inventions, continuing for a multitude of mini-games comparable to the main sections par excellence of the Gameplay, a Battle and Character Evolution System carefully studied, ending with the technical realization, superb in every respect. The plot may also be narrated in a classic way and not present memorable traits, but it is still pleasant with various in-depth themes. The only real lack of Dk is the structure of the random dungeons, certainly the least refined component (but a common feature of the whole genre) of an exceptional title and which is fully worth the purchase. Pros: Technically excellent Various and fun structure Incredible longevity Cons: The genre in the long run could be tiring There has always been a small unwritten rule according to which the sequel will always be inferior to the original work. Perhaps it refers to the lack of motivation or inspiration after success, or perhaps to the frightening specter of self-quotation, sometimes responsible for titles that are too different from their debut. And in fact what has been said occurs with inexplicable frequency, with the necessary exceptions to confirm the validity of the theory. Dark Cloud 2 is one of these, even if it could have been predictable due to the lightness of its debut, the quintessence of the negative video game in almost all respects, excluding the Georama System, the now famous world construction system. It is in fact from the ashes of this original modality that Level 5 has created the sequel, updating it in an impressive way in every aspect and inserting several new and original ideas. However, the release in Japan and America was not greeted with particular enthusiasm by the public, little interested in anachronisms such as the Dungeon Rpg. For the European launch, Sony has therefore decided to keep the Japanese title, Dark Chronicle, nurturing the hope of reviving attention to the genre with a technically and structurally avant-garde exponent.", "date": "2003-09-25", "grade": null}
