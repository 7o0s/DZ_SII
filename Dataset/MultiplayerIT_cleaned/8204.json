{"name": "Deponia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110556-deponia-una-citta-da-rottamare.html", "text": "Deponia - which in the Italian retail version is called Fuga da Deponia - is the first chapter of a trilogy of adventures signed by the indefatigable Daedalic Entertainment, a European beacon for point-and-click enthusiasts. It is good that you know right away that the three adventures are not self-contained. This means that to fully enjoy this work you will have to play it from start to finish, unless you are satisfied with a cliffhanger that does not answer any questions and leaves everything in suspense. If you're turning up your nose, you're in good company, because we didn't like this choice either. But if nothing else it seems that the protagonist will go through different psychological evolutions from one episode to the next, thus compensating for what seems to be just a sinister commercial gimmick. Well, if you haven't escaped yet, then the time has come to get to know him, Rufus, a young self-centered and slacker hero with only one goal in life: to escape from Deponia, the city-dump, and reach Elysium, the elevated city where a unattainable elite lives sunk in luxuries. Doesn't this story remind you a bit of Alita the battle angel, Yukito Kishiro's manga? On the other hand, Deponia is full of quotes and makes no secret, for example, of its debts to the graphic adventures of LucasArts, one above all The Secret of Monkey Island. It is no coincidence that the demented humor is its stylistic feature, supported by a very pleasant comic style and suitable for the setting, halfway between the world at the end of the world and steampunk. But even the talkativeness and impulsiveness of Rufus closely resemble the personality of Guybrush Threepwood, although compared to the hero with the prominent tuft there are many differences in character and, at least in this first chapter, they do not speak in favor of the new hero of Deponia . Let's see why. Narcissus in the mirror Rufus hates all the inhabitants of Deponia, the city-dump, and they reciprocate him with indifference and sarcastic jokes. This also applies to what should be his best friend and ex-girlfriend, now simply soured roommate. The game attempts to instill depth and plausible motivation in the protagonist, but something is wrong. From the early stages we know that Rufus was abandoned by a father who thought only of himself, so it is understandable that the young man is looking for revenge, but the fact that in every dialogue he has to underline his selfishness weakens the possibility of making him appear to us friendly. On the other hand, the inhabitants of Deponia are so petty and gray that they form a community of selfish people in which Rufus does not seem at all the outcast they insist on making us believe. Something clears up in the finale, when the real villains enter the scene and Rufus comes face to face with himself. At that moment, the noble spirit of a knight of fortune, which has only been glimpsed in the story, emerges and gives us back a hero in conflict with his feelings, a character for whom we can finally care. The credit goes to Goal, a damsel rained down from Elysium during Rufus' first attempt to reach the celestial city, and who for the duration of this first adventure he will try to bring back in order to be able to transfer himself among the elect. Obviously things will not go the right way and dark plans will come to light, but all this is part of the somewhat trivial plot that we leave you to discover for yourself. Story and characters therefore need to be better defined in the next chapters. The supporting actors in particular are too numerous and play short parts, functional only to the game mechanics, without ever leaving a lasting trace behind them. The only common denominator is the ramshackle humor, in some cases even funny, but too eagerly sought after in every line of dialogue. The result is that you may feel the weight of all these jokes which, due to their abundance, also become predictable. On the other hand, there is one of Ron Gilbert. Escape from Deponia: the version for Italian-speaking adventurers Deponia is an adventure full of dialogues, and often the clues that are essential to solve the puzzles are hidden between the lines of the speech. That's why if you don't know English well you will struggle to complete the game. Luckily there is a beautifully dubbed and subtitled version in Italian released under the FX Interactive brand under the name Escape from Deponia. However, this is the boxed edition: on Steam and other digital delivery platforms the game is in fact in English. In all cases the price is the same, and it seems that the boxed edition takes up little space and doesn't mess around the house. It's not with common sense that we're leaving here Luckily Deponia si solves on the puzzle front. There are so many of them and they are subjected to us one after another without stopping. Usually you can carry out parallel tasks, so you don't always have to bump your head against the same obstacle. However, it must be said that most of the puzzles require bizarre combinations of objects. Again, as with demented humor, the game pushes the hand, so be prepared to imagine very imaginative solutions to the problems that you will face. It goes without saying that the less experienced will have to work harder than usual to get to the end of the adventure. However, there are some interesting mini-games, rather bizarre, but which can be skipped, letting the game solve them automatically. At least in this case Deponia extends a hand to those who haven't trained in the golden years of adventures, when commands were given by even choosing the verb to use. In its variety of situations Deponia still offers ten to fifteen hours of intense meditations and crazy gimmicks, enough to satisfy the most demanding. Unfortunately, the start is sluggish, as in the case of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, another adventure by Daedalic Entertainment, but then the plot picks up and the game begins to breathe with many more settings to visit. Evidently the Teutonic developers really like the long preambles. We'll have to get used to it. The environments, as you can see from the images, are instead pleasant and colorful, with characters quite characterized and in tune with the context. On the contrary, the animations are insufficient and drawn out, as indeed are the music, of which we no longer remember even one, with the exception of those that act as an interlude between one chapter and another, complete with a ballad interpreted by an improbable minstrel. But perhaps the real sore point of Deponia is that ending that concludes nothing and forces the player to buy the next two chapters to get - hopefully - to know the end of the story of Rufus and Goal.", "date": "2012-11-06", "grade": "7.3"}
