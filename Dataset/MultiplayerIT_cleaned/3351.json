{"name": "Yakuza 4 per PS4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-4-ps4-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Yakuza 4 is particularly interesting for the historical value that this episode had at its debut, in 2010 and a year later here. In fact, we are talking about the first chapter of the SEGA series equipped with a structure and a direction comparable to the latest releases, therefore characterized by a feeling and solutions close to those we have been used to for some time now, which inevitably are aged better than the ~old~ Yakuza 3. The reasons behind this substantial difference lie in the genesis of the project, the first actually developed for PlayStation 3, where the previous episode was probably born as a cross-gen production and brought with it all the limits, especially technical ones, resulting from this setting. It is also the first Yakuza in which different characters are controlled, four of them, absurdly leaving the historical protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu, in a somewhat secondary role compared to the charisma and peculiarities of the new entries. Story, setting and characters Second of the three remasters included in The Yakuza Remaster Collection, the collection available exclusively in digital format on PlayStation Store, Yakuza 4 boasts a campaign consisting of a total of sixteen chapters, to which is added a ~choral~ part at the end.As mentioned, the game alternates us in command of four different figures, each with an interesting background and a precise role within a story which, in the best tradition of the series, develops and grows like an exciting hard-style novel boiled. The story begins with Shun Akiyama, a man of very particular origins, a successful entrepreneur who moves through the streets of Kamurocho managing various clubs and trying, in his own way, to help people in need through his finance company. One day Shun comes into contact with a woman as fascinating as it is mysterious, who needs an exorbitant loan but cannot provide any guarantees or precise explanations as to why she needs this sum. The matter soon takes on disturbing connotations, involving the other protagonists in a precise order. It starts from Taiga Saejima, a close friend of Goro Majima, and continues with the policeman Masayoshi Tanimura, whose appearance and voice have changed from the original for reasons very similar to those that led to the replacement of one of the characters of Judgment: the actor retired after a history of drugs. These figures move within a story that soon turns out to be very demanding, and which eventually requires the intervention of Kazuma Kiryu, in a crescendo that fans of the franchise they will only find it exhilarating; once again told with the right timing and with an extraordinary ability to motivate the player, spurring him to face increasingly sneaky and dangerous enemies. The setting in this case is limited to the now well-known fictitious district of Kamurocho, which however appears decidedly revolutionized compared to the visual and interactive paucity of the aforementioned Yakuza 3. The streets are in fact fairly populated, there are no problems with visual distance and this manages to make the typical atmospheres of Yakuza much better, which with this fourth episode, however, does not reach that fullness and that detail capable of offering us a real interactive tour of the most controversial areas of Tokyo. However, new areas have been introduced which curiously have not found a place in the following chapters, see for example the metro station with its shopping arcade. Playstation 4 trophies The 48 Yakuza 4 Trophies are obtained by completing the various chapters of the campaign, but also by dedicating yourself to the rich collateral activities that have always characterized the franchise, including side missions and collectibles. Structure, gameplay and technical realization The introduction of the four protagonists in Yakuza 4 obviously opens up to a more varied experience, not only from a narrative point of view but also from a gameplay point of view.Each character has a different relationship with Kamurocho and his activities, for example Shun Akiyama runs a hostess club and therefore happens to go to these places to manage the girls who work there, hire new ones, improve their appearance and skills, and so on. Similarly, in the part with Taiga Saejima we will find ourselves having to train fighters who find themselves participating in a tournament, while in the role of Masayoshi Tanimura we will have the opportunity to restore order to the streets of the neighborhood. The combat system also changes accordingly, reflecting each character's style and proposing a different progression through unlockingof new moves, taunts, combos and very painful finishers that can be activated when the fury gauge is full. However, this aspect of the experience still lacks refinement compared to the last chapters, and so it happens that the action becomes rather repetitive, weighed down by the obligation to always carry out the same maneuvers to take out enemies who just don't want to stay on the ground Similarly, the subquests do not boast the complexity and craziness that can be found in the series later, proposing quite short and basic tasks, although numerous. On a technical level, as previously mentioned, the steps forward compared to Yakuza 3 are evident and substantial: Kamurocho is presented in this episode in good shape, the atmospheres are all there, there are plenty of people on the street (although, in terms of population and complexity, there is no comparison with the last episodes) and a good job has also been done on the front of the polygonal models, more varied and better made. The cutscenes boast excellent quality, within the limits of what a remaster, but otherwise still lacks that maniacal care that can be appreciated in Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza Kiwami 2 and obviously Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. It is not clear what resolution the game runs on PS4 Pro, but the frame rate remains anchored to 60 fps and this certainly contributes to increasing the enjoyment of the experience, in concert with a quality sound accompaniment.", "date": "2019-11-26", "grade": "7.7"}
