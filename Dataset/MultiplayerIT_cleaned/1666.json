{"name": "Indiana Jones e la Tomba dell'Imperatore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/indiana-jones-e-la-tomba-dellimperatore_b.html", "text": "...one for the story... As often happens in adventure games, initially we will not know what our goal will be and we will immediately be catapulted into action in search of a strange artifact that apparently has no connection with the emperor's tomb. However, once the first level is completed, a ~gentleman~, accompanied by a kind maiden, will come to visit us, and only then will we be informed of the discovery of the emperor's tomb. Our goal will be to find the artifacts that will allow us to reassemble the key to the tomb, thus allowing us to achieve the fame we seek so much. ....another for the gameplay.... Indiana Jones' gameplay combines the action style of titles such as blade or minority report with the more reflective one of the more classic tomb raiders. The controls will be immediately understandable and simple, also thanks to the complete tutorial that will be provided to us during the first level of the game. Indiana will be able to perform any type of movement, from shooting punches to slicing weeds with his machete. Like any self-respecting action, we will periodically meet opponents, who will not fail to threaten us, and we will have to impose ourselves on them with any means at our disposal. Indy will be able to use most of the objects in the game as weapons, from chairs to table legs that we will find in the stage. In addition to melee weapons we will also have pistols and machine guns available with which it will be much easier to defeat the Nazi ranks, fortunately the famous whip has also been maintained which will prove to be very useful for keeping opponents away or, if they were armed, to disarm them. An interesting feature is the possibility of distracting the crocodiles before throwing ourselves into the river so as to avoid being eaten. This simple trick will later prove indispensable in some points, in which it will allow us to evade insidious traps. The reflexive part already proves less satisfying, especially for anyone used to playing any of the Tomb Raider series titles, in this one we will simply limit ourselves to jumping from one side to another using ropes and a whip, or pulling some levers to open doors. Nothing challenging at all. It is also true, however, that many interesting scenes worthy of attention have been added. In some points it will be necessary to pass some traps (such as blades coming out of the wall, etc) and sometimes the camera will move upwards giving rise to a new mode in which the only objective will be to overcome these traps with the least amount of damage possible. Graphically speaking Graphically Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is nothing special, even if we always remain on more than acceptable levels. Derived directly from the Buffy The Vampire Slayer engine, unfortunately it still fails to reach the levels of both design and graphic complexity of the title dedicated to the vampire hunter. Definitely not up to the Xbox potential. The landscapes are done quite well and you don't have problems orienting yourself or discovering passages due to the graphics. An aspect worthy of note is represented by the entry of Indy into the water. Each time, before diving, Indy will take off his hat and then immediately put it back on once out of it. We will also be able to lose the hat during a fight that is too hard, but fortunately we will also have the possibility of looking for it and picking it up from the ground to place it on our head. sonorous The sound is done very well. The game is fully localized, both in speech and text and I must also say that Indy's voice is quite similar to that of Harrison Ford's real voice actor. The sounds of the landscape are also done well and the periodic phrases spoken by the Nazis about us are a welcome addition. Furthermore, whenever we arrive at an important point, Indy will give us vocal clues to more easily reach our destination. ...but you have to know how to use them More could have been done. This was my first thought after playing the title for a few hours. In fact, the game is interesting above all for the name it bears but it certainly fails to meet the user's expectations, at least not mine. While on the one hand the pure action part of the title is well done for those who are the stanscommon dards of a game of this type, the more reflective one is really disappointing for anyone who wants to try their hand at tricks or spend more than a few minutes on the ~puzzles~ (if they can be called that). I personally would have focused more on the reflexive apparatus making the game much more similar to the very famous Tomb Raiders in which the puzzles were the masters, rather than on a style where there are clearly more fights than the steps that require some reasoning to continue. Ultimately, the title is recommended for those who have found the action that is more directly connected to this very amusing, one of all Blade, because for this group of people it could be even more fun than these, as it does not offer only simple fisticuffs. Unfortunately the fights are almost the basis of the title and that is why, in the same way, I advise against it to those who prefer to think even for hours in front of an apparently insurmountable obstacle, but which once overcome the player is full of satisfaction. Pros: Completely localized Interesting story many blows ... Cons: ... but little reasoning risks becoming monotonous graphically not exciting Indy opens a million doors.... Indiana Jones is certainly one of the best characters born on the big screen, who has never seen at least one of his films? What is certain is that with such a famous character the foundations of the game are already created and to bring the title to success it would be enough to propose an engaging gameplay and story. We will see in the course of the review if these objectives have been completed or if we will still have to wait to play a title worthy of bearing the name of Indiana Jones.", "date": "2003-05-05", "grade": null}
