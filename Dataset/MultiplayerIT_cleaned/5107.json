Now, the very prolific British software house has decided to continue the adventure of its sausage dog, moving the setting from a world made of meat to one made entirely of sweets but without substantially changing the gameplay. Will it be enough to be able to talk about a new success? Silly Sausage: Doggy Dessert is a good sequel, but from Nitrome it was reasonable to expect something more Enlarge your sausage As per tradition, Nitrome wastes no time in introductory sequences and elaborate tutorials, and Silly Sausage: Doggy Dessert is no exception, immediately putting the player to work. The structure of the title has remained absolutely identical to that of its predecessor, and revolves entirely around the protagonist's ability to stretch at will until he reaches a solid surface on which to lean to thus bring his body back to its original dimensions. The sausage-dog moves in a very similar way to the snake of the classic Snake, with the exception of the fact that here it is also allowed to reverse and that coming into contact with one's tail does not involve game over (indeed, it makes its glorious return the trophy that is unlocked by bringing the protagonist to sniff his butt). The aim of the user is therefore to exploit these simple basic mechanics to get to the end of the single large level that makes up the adventure, using a checkpoint system that has now become a standard for various Nitrome products. In essence, kennels periodically appear from which you can start again in case of failure, provided that you are willing to spend a part of the diamonds collected along the way or to watch an advertisement. Just the commercials constitute a rather cumbersome presence in this Silly Sausage: Doggy Dessert, given that they must also be viewed forcibly to access the new challenge areas (in which the goal is to overcome various obstacles to reach a collectible before time runs out) and which often slip into the short dead times that separate the end of one attempt from the start of another. There is of course the usual option that allows you to remove them altogether by paying a one-time fee with real money, but the asking price of 3.99 appears rather high and not entirely justifiable. In addition to this aspect, Nitrome seems to have pushed the accelerator a little too much also as regards a difficulty rate characterized by a really steep curve: already in the very first bars, the level design throws particularly hard bones at the player, sons probably of the need to strengthen the longevity of the product but which can prove to be a double-edged sword for users with less propensity for trial and error. Beyond this, Silly Sausage: Doggy Dessert follows the manual of a good sequel to the letter, updating its technical appearance to current standards (without renouncing the pixel art style and chiptune music) and enriching its gameplay as much as enough to not feel like a real carbon copy of the first episode. Therefore, new obstacles to overcome and objects to exploit to one's advantage make their entrance, such as balls capable of breaking through wafer walls and cherry bombs to be pushed to the desired point before their detonation. These are small tricks that slightly diversify the experience but that don't change your opinion on Silly Sausage: Doggy Dessert, an undoubtedly well-done homework which, however, remains the same and which perhaps deserved an extra boost.", "date": "2016-12-30", "grade": "7.5"}
