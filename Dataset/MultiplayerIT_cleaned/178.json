{"name": "World Snooker Championship 2007  - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-snooker-championship-2007-recensione.html", "text": "A tutorial to learn For those who don't know the game of billiards very well, and we are sure there will be many, the developers have well thought out to include as a first option a tutorial that explains the rules of the various game modes and illustrates the use of the Xbox360 pad controls . Through a guided simulation it will be much easier to understand the development of the game and the various options available to us. We strongly recommend starting right here, as professional billiards often uses rules that are unknown to most, or that many leave out for convenience. In fact, during the game, making a mistake in a move or pocketing a wrong ball, the turn will pass to the opponent. The menu is very elegant and refined, and is represented by a three-dimensional billiard table which contains the various options in the form of game balls arranged in a circle. The various definitions are in English and the entire title is available only in this language A tutorial to learn After the very useful tutorial we can immerse ourselves in some ~Quick Play~ games, with our friends or alone. The various definitions are in English and the entire title can only be used in this language, thus making the tutorial superfluous for all those who don't know the Albion language: a real pity, not so much for the menus which are easy to understand, as for the rules of the game. The modes are numerous, and we start with the classic snooker, 3 ball pool, bar billiard (perhaps the best known), classic billiards and 8 ball pool. Snooker is the classic ~English billiards~, where it is played with 15 unnumbered balls, which are full and red (called reds), with six balls of other colors, also unnumbered (called colours) and with white ball. The aim is to pocket the marbles and score more points than the opponent: each colored ball has a different score, and the black one is left for last. 9 Ball Pools Billiards called ~9 Ball Pool~ and the variant ~8 Ball Pool~ are perhaps among the best known, at least in the non-professional field. In this case we do not use red balls but full and striped. The aim of the game is to pocket your group of balls, full (from 1 to 7) or striped (from 9 to 15), and then close with the black, the ~8 ball~, in a regular manner. If the player who performs the split manages to pocket one or more marbles (but not the 8 or the white one), he continues to play; otherwise, the turn passes to his opponent. In both cases, the game is still considered ~open~, i.e. the players still have to choose between the two groups of marbles. Billiards called ~9 Ball Pool~ and the variant ~8 Ball Pool~ are perhaps among the best known, at least in the non-professional field 9 Ball Pools The choice of the group of balls is not made on the opening shot, but only when the player regularly pockets the first after the split. In case a full and a striped are pocketed at the same time, the player can choose which group to play with. Pocketing the black ball first, with the table open, is considered a foul; in this case, the turn passes to the opponent with ball in hand. If the black ball is pocketed with an illegal shot, the game is considered closed and the player who made this shot loses. Once the groups have been chosen, it is considered a foul to hit an opponent's ball before one's own. In this case, each ball pocketed remains so and the turn passes to the opponent who can continue the game with ~ball in hand~. The Championship The feeling of the game is really excellent, thanks above all to the completeness of the controls on the pad which give the sensation of having full autonomy on the shots and on the general vision. You can rotate the virtual camera in any way and also have an excellent bird's eye view to understand trajectories and batting angles. The movement of the cue is relegated to the left analog, which virtually simulates the ~back and then forward~ movement of the wood hitting the ball. Depending on our speed of execution, the shot will be more or less powerful. The other analog is used to pan the camera left, right, up or down, and generally to keep an eye on the situation on the table. The feeling of the game is really good The Championship Once we become familiar with the main commands, we can start the fateful ~Championship~ mode, which will see us compete in the most important world competitions of this sport, against the most feared professionals on the planet. Before playing, we therefore access a powerful character editor that allows us to create a face we likento. The polygonal modeling is good, especially if we consider the game genre, and is comparable to that already appreciated in Top Spin 2, also on Xbox360. Having created our digital alter ego, we select the competitions we want to participate in and we start. The choice is vast: snooker and pool already seen previously, hybrid, golden cue and the trick shot which is a nice modality based on the skill in performing certain ~special shots~, almost impossible to say better. A role-playing game about billiards By winning competitions and races, as in any self-respecting sporting title, you earn something. In this case the points won will be useful for us to increase the technical characteristics of our character. Initially all the values tend to be very low, as the game continues they will rise as well as our ability. Snooker Championship is structured just like a role-playing game, with the leveling of the character and all his characteristics, including potting, positioning, tools, pressure, cue power and spin, i.e. power, lap, ability positioning, accuracy, etc. The title has 22 trophies to be played all over the world, through 33 game tables and related well-crafted locations. the points won will be useful to us in order to increase the technical characteristics of our character A role-playing game about billiards The players, all real thanks to the official licence, are as many as 160, to face, unlock and then use. It is also possible to buy new cues, there are 15 different types and each modifies, even if not in a really tangible way, the style of play. Snooker Championship therefore gives the feeling of being a truly solid and complete title, with attention to the smallest details and with a multitude of options and game modes. The music itself is well studied and adapts perfectly to the context, it is calm and relaxing and allows all the concentration necessary to study and face the various strokes that we will perform during the competition. Billiards is to all intents and purposes a sort of strategic chess, you study your opponent, his moves, his shots, and then you act accordingly: too high a pace would have made the game too frenetic compared to its nature. The competition widens Obviously Snooker Championship takes full advantage of the internet connection with Xbox Live. And since it is a ~turn-based~ game, it is not even affected by the possible lag problem, which is so annoying in some sports games. The competitions are fully playable online in ranked matches, which allow us to earn points and climb the world rankings, or in player matches with our favorite list friends. Sadly these modes don't contribute that much towards player points as they will mostly be unlocked during offline leagues. Snooker Championship takes full advantage of the internet connection with Xbox Live Goals 360 The SEGA title offers 1000 points, divided into 50 objectives: most of them will be unlocked by winning the various competitions around the world, others by completing all the modes, many others still by performing particular shots. The latter are the most unexpected objectives as they will often be unlocked ~unknowingly~ during normal game action, mostly being very difficult or lucky shots to execute. Other objectives will be very difficult to achieve, such as those that require you to pocket 2, 3 or 4 balls in one shot. Each goal ~gives~ an average of 10 points, not difficult to obtain but relatively few compared to the time taken to obtain them: to get to 1000 there will be a lot of sweat! Comment World Snooker Championship 2007 is undoubtedly a very special game. Definitely for enthusiasts, but for once open to all. The Sega title is well done, solid, very varied and above all long-lived. It lets itself be played with a disarming simplicity but is at the same time profound and engaging at all levels. The technical realization is excellent as well as the sound sector. There are many game modes and the excellent use of Xbox Live completes the very positive picture, obviously bearing in mind the lack of localization in Italian, which for many could be a significant obstacle to the enjoyment of the game. Pros: Lots of game modes Simple but deep Online mode Cons: Mainly for enthusiasts No Italian translation World Snooker Championship 2007 is available for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2. The version used for this review is the Xbox 360 version. In the vastness of sports games available on Xbox360, being able to choose between any type of competitive competition, one was still missing, professional billiards. World Snooker Championship is a saga now known among fans since its first appearances in 2002 on PlayStation2, PC and XB, with an episode on GameCube and a glorious past on Psx. The developers are the British Blade Interactive, responsible for the series since its inception and who in their life as a software house have practically only worked on this title, except for the publication of ~The Hustle~ on Xbox a few years ago. It is said that the brand is synonymous with guarantee, and the British are now well specialized in this type of simulations. Furthermore, the publication is by SEGA, which has followed the development of the title since its embryonic state. SEGA is moving very well in the field of distribution of sports titles, proof of which is also the very famous Football Manager which has oversold in the old continent. The conditions for an excellent sports simulation are therefore all there: let's discover together the first Next Gen chapter of the World Snooker Championship!", "date": "2007-01-09", "grade": null}
