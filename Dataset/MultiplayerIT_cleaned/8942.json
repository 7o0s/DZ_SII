It is no secret that the band from Los Angeles, formed among others by the histrionic Will.I.Am and the blonde Fergie, have revolutionized the concept of Hip Hop by opening it to electronic music and to rhythms very different from the canonical ones, clearing it from ~ghetto~ to the general public with songs that are also melodic and catchy, but above all danceable. This is exactly where Ubisoft has arrived: the two elements, essential in BEP's songs, are always linked and coexisting, effectively giving a very solid concept for the gameplay of a rhythm game based on singing and dancing at the same time. With their 56 million records sold, BEP and Ubisoft certainly have a huge fan base to draw from. Pump It! After the various dance games made in Konami, the two Dance Centrals, Ubisoft titles such as Michael Jackson and Just Dance 3, Xbox 360 users who already own a Kinect can have a vague idea of what awaits them with this brand new Black Eyed Peas experience. The gameplay is therefore always the same: go in time and ~copy~ the movements seen on the screen, trying to be as precise as possible. Each title, then, has its own peculiarities and some modifications of the basic ~recipe~. Those of BEP Experience are, very briefly, the possibility of singing and the presence of an avatar on the screen that reproduces our moves. As soon as the game disc is inserted into the Xbox 360 tray, the interface reveals its goodness even before having started the game itself, with colorful and pleasant graphics, but above all an enviable fluidity between the various game menus and the choice of modes and songs, thanks to an excellent detection of body movements: raising the right arm calls up the main menu, with the left you go back, scrolling with your hands you choose what to select, all accompanied always and in any case by a soundtrack that eliminates those annoying moments of waiting and boredom during loading between one selection and another, so that the feeling of ~party~ is always palpable and there are never empty moments. Black Eyed Peas Experience has two main modes. The first, called ~Dance Party~, allows you to throw yourself into the wildest dances without too many frills and options: you enter, choose a song and dance, obviously trying to get the best possible score. There are a train of songs including practically all the greatest hits of the band from the beginning to the last album. It starts from Shut Up, My Humps and Meet me half way passing through the more dance sounds like Boom Boom Pow, I Gotta Feeling, The Time (Dirty Bit) and Imma Be. Although the quantity of songs cannot compete with more accredited and famous games such as Just Dance and Dance Central 2, a fan of this genre and of the BEPs will certainly feel 100% satisfied, whereas, on the contrary, in generalist dance games he could find many unwelcome tracks. Trying the game, you immediately notice how the detection system turns out to be too permissive, even in the songs of greater difficulty. Even the game ~works~ even with a small table placed between the Kinect sensor and the player, a disturbing factor in many titles of the genre. But if on the one hand this could be appreciable, as the ~requirements~ of furniture to be able to play are at a minimum, from another point of view we wonder how much our movements are really detected and how much the CPU ~cheats~ on the moves wrong. Certainly BEP Experience, for this reason, turns out to be a dance game that is truly accessible to everyone, both from the point of view of the age target and of the ~space~ to play (we all know how demanding the Kinect camera is). In Black Eyed Peas Experience up to four people can play at the same time: two dancing and two others singing songs. The deluxe edition also includes a wireless microphone (as well as a T-Shirt), for those who don't have one or don't want to use the standard Xbox 360 microphone. The second game mode instead concerns a sort of single player ~campaign~. which sees us playing the role of a hypothetical fifth element of the group. After selecting an avatar that corresponds more or less to the one we would like to impersonate, you have access to an area called ~My Dancer~ in which we find the options to customize clothes and accessories through an editor, quite simple and limited in content , and an area where we can ~compose~ a data choreography being able to choose from all the moves that the game has in memory. In practice it is a question of choosing the various choreographies and inserting them in a timeline with the order we prefer: unfortunately it is not possible to create new moves, and it is a pity because the idea was good and certainly the potential of Kinect would have allowed it. Xbox 360 goals Like any canonical Xbox 360 game, BEP Experience is no exception and puts the canonical 1000 points on the plate to unlock, through 50 goals. Half of the points are obtained automatically and quite easily, simply by advancing in the career and completing all the various dances of the group members. To get the other half as well, you need to take a look at the achievements list and hit your chest by performing particular actions: look at the credits, play in 4, customize the avatar, create choreographies and so on. Nothing complex, in any case. Fergie in 3D is worth the purchase The story mode continues from song to song making us experience the ~group~ life as we were really a member of the band. The third-person view of our avatar facilitates the task of identifying ourselves and above all that of ~copying~ the movements of the choreography, even if in reality our digital alter-ego -doesn't- exactly make our moves (if we make a mistake, for example) . One of the novelties of the BEP Experience is the introduction of the concept of ~followers~, basically fan followers: the better we dance, the more fans will follow us, thus allowing us to unlock objectives, items, accessories, clothing and new challenges. There's also a coach who introduces us to new songs and lets us learn each new move, before performing the actual challenge. A sort of ~decompose~ mode already seen in Dance Central, in practice. For all those who are already accustomed to dancing with Michael Jackson's Experience and Just Dance 3, news: Black Eyed Peas Experience is a definite step forward in terms of style, characterization and graphics. The style is as realistic as the first Dance Central was (before the change with the second chapter...), reproducing the members of the group quite faithfully thanks to the Unreal Engine graphic engine (certainly not at its last step, but a version previous). However, the modeling does not make you cry out for a miracle, just as the video cleaning is not perfect given the numerous clearly visible ladders. In any case, with a fleeting glance, the glance has its effect. Without overdoing or surprising. What really matters are the animations, the real cornerstone of a dance game like Black Eyed Peas Experience: the movements of the avatars are well connected, fluid and pleasant to watch and reproduce, and this is what really matters. Ubisoft has obviously already announced that new contents and specially created DLCs will arrive soon, and certainly the next BEP singles will be immediately present on the Xbox 360 marketplace. The real limitation of this title, like any game based on a person or a group, it is the personal appreciation that each of us can give based on whether or not we love the protagonist group, also taking into account the fact that among dance games there are others which, if desired, offer deeper gameplay as regards detection of the movements of the dancers.", "date": "2011-11-15", "grade": "6.8"}
