{"name": "Reprobates: L'Isola dei Dannati - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/reprobates-lisola-dei-dannati-recensione.html", "text": "In the world of video games there is a lot of talk about narration, plot and how often technically excellent titles are penalized by stories of mediocre workmanship, which end up in some very abused clich (just think of Crysis, just to give a famous example). In recent times, narratologically speaking, the genre that most had the courage to experiment was that of graphic adventures. Probably, not being able to count on too high production values and given its nature, formally very rigid and difficult to renew, experimentation has become an obligation, a way to highlight the characteristics of a genre that many users, decidedly unaware, would like died together with Lucas' historical titles and which, on the other hand, looking closely, appears alive and vital, as well as full of interesting titles, of which Reprobates is a proud representative. The opening movie shows a fatal car accident, in which a train hits the protagonist's car full, who wakes up on an island with a mysterious bell tower and populated by other people, all victims of fatal accidents and all from from different eras and nations. What is going on? Is it a kind of purgatory (although it has been abolished)? Are you dead or what? Why do you fall asleep and have very vivid (and decidedly lethal) nightmares every time the bell rings three times? Why are there always new ~guests~ when you wake up while someone else has disappeared? An inner voice will have already suggested to you that to find out, all you have to do is play. That ugly mess of the mysterious island Reprobates is a graphic adventure with a very classic interface, in which the left mouse button is used to take, combine or use objects, the right button to examine them and the ~E~ key on the keyboard to highlight exits from a screen; nothing that any enthusiast doesn't already know perfectly and hasn't tried in some other adventure (variants aside, we can consider it a ~standard~ interface, a bit like the WASD keys for action games). The interface changes only during a subgame, which appears at certain times and is repeated several times during the adventure, in which you have to guide a sphere along a path in order to calm down the protagonist. they are all people with their own culture and history, they have different characters and, despite some forcing, they are plausible and very ~human~ That ugly mess of the mysterious island Graphically we are faced with a fluctuating job. While some scenarios are poor in detail, there are some quite confusing due to ~overcrowding~ that make it a bit of a pain to search for objects. For example, in one of the first dreams you have to take an iron bar well camouflaged with the background that does not immediately catch the eye. However, it must be said that in still other cases, we are faced with locations of great impact, well constructed and fascinating, albeit fixed. The qualitative swing is repeated for the characters who, despite the excellent visual characterization and the beautiful textures of the faces, have rather woody movements and lack of details especially in the limbs, which are very reminiscent of those already seen in titles from a few years ago . Fortunately, the technical problems fail to bury Reprobates which, after a somewhat slow start, takes flight and keeps you glued until the end thanks to many other qualities, including a thematic depth (you know that characteristic waved everywhere but which everyone regularly disinterests?) unusual for a video game. But let's proceed calmly. To each his own Once you have taken control of the character, you start wandering around the island looking for things to do and characters to talk to. The first dialogues do not reveal much, if not the confusion that reigns in all those who are sharing the protagonist's experience, but interesting details are immediately noticed. For example, each person has a place of origin and, while speaking in English (fortunately there are only subtitles in Italian), they maintain their local accent, including the protagonist. The best part, however, is the deeper than usual characterization that has been given to them: they are all people with their own culture and history, they have different characters and, despite some forcing, they are plausible and very ~human~ in the feelings that they manifest. It is not possible to describe them all, but it is good to give at least one example: a rather surly character, who mistreats everyone else, falls in love with an attractive and slightly uninhibited guest (fun fact: he is from Turin, speaks English with an extremely marked accent and believes she has ended up in a speciesand reality shows) who arrives on the island on the second day. The man manifests towards him an ambiguous transport, which develops in the various dialogue sequences and which is constructed in a decidedly credible way. Several others could be given examples, but we would risk going too far. What should be noted is that in Reprobates the characters are not just pieces of the macro puzzle that divides from the resolution of the overall puzzle, but they create interesting subplots, developed above all through dialogues, to be followed separately from the main plot. There are also direct references to reality, which further enrich the thickness of the human fauna that lives on the island. The indifferent The narrative richness is paid a little from the point of view of the puzzles. The need to have the player follow the various stories that surround the main one and the desire not to insert puzzles that are too alien outside the dream context, have somewhat limited the variety of the same, at least in the first days spent on the island, sacrificing and structuring them in a way that forces the player to constantly go back and forth between clearings. The situation improves in the aforementioned dream sequences, which are more linear and, as dreams, freer from the constraints of verisimilitude that the developers have evidently imposed on themselves for the sequences on the island. In the end, what matters most is the interest that the title manages to keep high from the beginning to the end. there is no shortage of traumatic moments and nude scenes, but without ever falling into the vulgar or gratuitous The indifferent Much of the charm of Reprobates is due to the choice to keep it on adult tones, both in dialogue and visually, without diverting it towards infantilism or, worse, towards adolescent themes (sorry, but friendship does not solve all problems) . There is no shortage of traumatic moments and nude scenes, but without ever falling into the vulgar or gratuitous and, indeed, all inserted in contexts that give them their logical consequentiality and their precise dignity in the narrative economy. To give a quick but indicative example, let's take the management of hygiene: two of the women, having to go to the bathroom, control access so as not to let anyone in (the characters live in metal bungalows without doors), while the less shy girl you take a shower without worrying about who comes in or who comes out. They seem like minor details and, in the second case, also rather itchy, but in reality they tell us something more about those characters, making them more ~real~ and taking them far beyond the good/evil dichotomy that characterizes most videogame characters. Not a little for a title that came out so quietly. Comment Reprobates is a gripping adventure that manages to keep the story going through its cauldron of subplots and well-developed characters. Too bad for the little defects, essentially of a technical nature, which will surely make more than one person turn up their noses.
