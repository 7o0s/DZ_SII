{"name": "Curse of the Sea Rats", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/curse-of-the-sea-rats-recensione.html", "text": "Perhaps the older of you will remember an old game developed by Monolith Productions, dating back to the late 90s and called Captain Claw. The player used a pirate cat, Claw, in a hostile environment full of anthropomorphic dogs in search of the Amulet of nine lives. An old-fashioned 2D platformer whose strong point was undoubtedly the charisma of the protagonist. Curse of the Sea Rats is not Captain Claw, but several times during the hours spent between the coasts or the green hills of this metroidvania, we hoped that at any moment our beloved Claw would come to revive the fate of this crew of anthropomorphic mice, much more fascinating than it is actually fun to impersonate them. We tell you why in our review of Curse of the Sea Rats. Beautiful and shiny Curse of the Sea Rats and its green Irish hills Curse of the Sea Rats is a project that at the time of the Kickstarter campaign had surprised with its very peculiar style, especially for the artistic direction, the care of the seabed and the characterization of its bizarre anthropomorphic animals. But unfortunately for the pirates protagonists of the adventure, all that glitters is not gold, and only some of these premises have been kept. Curse of the Sea Rats puts users in the role of one of four prisoners on an English ship returning from the American colonies. However, during the journey, thanks to the pirate witch Flora Burns, the vessel is shipwrecked on the coast of Ireland and you, now free prisoners, find yourself transformed into anthropomorphic mice. Without much anticipation, you will have to save the son of the admiral, discover the secret of the Amulet of the Eye of the Serpent, hunt Flora Burns and try to regain your original form. On paper, the premises are all there, and the game manages to make an excellent first impression, between jagged coasts, green hills, dark caves and the refined characterization of characters and enemies. Even the bosses, with their typical incomes, are never without character. Just think of the Panzo family, made up of son, daughter and mother who are viscerally linked to food and show themselves in all respects so extreme to the grotesque that they are likeable (if it weren't for the explicit Italian stereotype). Don't expect much from the writing: the narrative is very flat and monotonous, with no surprises until the final stages of the game. For most of the adventure you will look for Flora and the young man to save and you will be flooded with an unattractive humor, also thanks to the localization stumbles. Curse of the Sea Rats: A boss fight A beautiful world to explore therefore, but essentially not very complex. The metroidvania structure behind this platformer is evident but the map design is never ingenious, and the exploration of the scenarios never pushes to use gray matter. The lack of variety in the side missions that are obtained from the various characters does not help, and with one lucky exception everything takes place in a too linear and predictable way. Of course, this way it's more difficult to get lost and not know where to go, but the experience is decidedly flattened. A handsome man who doesn't dance Curse of the Sea Rats is playable in local coop with three other friends The game's pleasing presentation soon gives way to a bland experience full of issues that are largely related to the combat system. The setting of the clashes is classic and is based on three attacks, a key for defense / dodging, jumping and the possibility of using consumables. There is also a system of skills and improvements that declines the gameplay differently for each of the heroes. The result is a minestrone that tries to mix elements taken from Dark Souls and Hollow Knight with some vague inspiration from Castlevania. Where Curse of the Sea Rats goes wrong though is not in theory or intention, but in practice. The gameplay slips ruinously in fact in the feeling of the fights and in the balance of the difficulty. The first is sufficiently varied (between heroes specialized in short and long range) but is completely monotonous and unsatisfactory in the feedback of the blows struck. The second... it's a big problem. Unfortunately, the title has a very steep difficulty curve in the initial stages, with the first boss being so difficult that it forces you to go back and do a lot of training. However, once you get past the family of Italian mice, the game will collapse on itself, losing all that feeling of challenge. From that point forward the adventure becomes so simple as to be trivial. Curse of the Sea Rats: the fight with Panzo It doesn't help the choice of developmentactor to give Buffalo Calf, one of the four heroes, infinite bullets for his ranged weapons. So here it is enough to use that very character to annihilate any enemy from afar, thinking only of dodging in the phases against the bosses. If that weren't enough for you, and you were in trouble, you can always use its electrical power capable of stunning opponents long enough to disintegrate them. The character progression system adds variety between the various heroes, but Buffalo Calf is so much stronger than the others that one wonders why use another one when playing alone.", "date": "2023-04-10", "grade": "6.0"}
