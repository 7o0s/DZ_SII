{"name": "Platinum Sudoku - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/platinum-sudoku-recensione.html", "text": "The simple rules of Sudoku The rules of this original puzzle are now known to almost everyone, but for the record we will describe them briefly, they are very simple. The grid on which you play is 9 squares high and 9 wide, thus forming a large square that contains 9 others inside, each of them made up of 9 squares. Starting from a small number of digits present in the boxes, we must be able to complete them all assuming the right numbers through a few essential rules: two equal digits cannot be found at the same time on a horizontal or vertical line, and this cannot happen even within one of the 9 squares. Just like in crossword puzzles, you start with little, slowly, to then have an increasingly clear and ~flowing~ situation. The level of difficulty varies according to the amount of numbers initially present: the fewer there are, the more difficult it is to think of all the possible combinations and solutions. Graphics and interface The Ubisoft title appears immediately excellently made and finished. The background music is nice and pleasant, a rare commodity for such a puzzle. The menus are well designed with very pleasant pastel colors, as well as the background styles that you can choose for our grills. From the options it is possible to change and unlock a large number of elements: fonts for numbers, skins, game wallpapers and new soundtracks. All this allows excellent customization of the interface, and manages to create many possibilities to always have a different sudoku, at least from an artistic point of view. What leaves us most positively amazed is the game interface, made in an intelligent and practical way, even if the space could have been better exploited; the numbers are entered by touching the selected square once and then drawing the number by hand, just like Brain Training taught us to do. The detection is excellent and precise, it does not create errors or inaccuracies. What leaves you most positively amazed is the game interface, made in an intelligent and practical way Graphics and interface On the side of the grid there are icons that allow you to do some things: touching the eraser you erase the errors, with the draft mode you can insert a small memo next to the selected square, and if we find ourselves stuck and no longer know how proceed, here come the evergreen hints (not available in Pro modes). On the top of the screen, a matrix of numbers is always visible, showing us the statistics of how many times a specific number has already been written on the game dial. The bottom one therefore contains the grid and all the icons for the options, while the other contains the statistics: perhaps it would have been slightly better to make the most of the touch screen by delegating all interaction and statistics tasks to the lower display, with the game placed entirely above. Possibilities and extras Once the standard sudoku puzzles have been completed we can start playing with the random ones generated by the CPU in the ~20 million~ mode. Initially 95 puzzles are available for each of the five difficulties: easy, normal, difficult, pro and sudoku X. Before starting, if think you're out of practice, it's possible to refresh your memory with an exhaustive and fun tutorial, guided by a girl or a boy at our choice. Could a full-bodied multiplayer mode be missing? Of course not: with Platinum Sudoku it is possible to challenge a friend who has another cartridge through the local Wi-Fi connection.In the cooperative you collaborate by writing both numbers on the same file, while in the duel you challenge whoever completes the chosen pattern first. Gameloft has well thought of including a pleasant variant of sudoku in the cartridge: kakuro Possibilities and extras Browsing the menu we also find a nice ~Challenges~ item, which contains 6 mini-games of logic and mathematics; some are similar to what has already been seen in Brain Training, but are still very nice and fun (and must be unlocked by winning with sudoku!). Just to leave no stone unturned, Gameloft has well thought of including a pleasant variant of sudoku in the cartridge: kakuro. In this umpteenth Japanese puzzle we have to insert the missing digits in a filing cabinet in all respects similar to crossword puzzles. Each row has indicated a number in the first box, which must correspond to its total sum. Instead of the numbers for the definitions we therefore have others that show us the solution of the added figures, the only condition is the prohibition of putting two equal ones on the same row. Final comment Platinum Sudoku is certainly the most c versionocomplete and better made than the most famous Japanese game of recent years. It contains within it an incalculable number of grids, many ways of being able to change the graphics of the game interface to our liking, a pleasant and varied background music, as well as many extras such as kakuro and all the logic mini-games. For any puzzle lover you couldn't ask for more: Platinum Sudoku is definitive. Pros: Always new grids to do Intelligent and functional interface Style customization Many extras, including kakuro Cons: Not recommended for those who don't like puzzles The space of the two screens could be exploited a little better One of the summer games par excellence is back on DS: the Sudoku game that cheered us up under the umbrellas last summer is ready to peep out again on the double Nintendo screen. The name of this challenging game comes from the Japanese saying ~SUji wa DOKUshin kagiru~, which sounds more or less like ~the numbers are written only once~. The title, which is distributed in Italy by Ubisoft, was created by Gameloft, a software house specializing in video games on mobile phones and Java. Platinum Sudoku therefore makes us abandon the usual and ancient means of paper and pen to take up modern touchscreen technology: it seems to have been created on purpose for this kind of entertainment.", "date": "2007-06-05", "grade": null}
