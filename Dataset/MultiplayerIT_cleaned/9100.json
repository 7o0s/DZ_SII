The game worked like this: using a bird's-eye view that encompassed an entire racing circuit, you had to ~draw~ the trajectory that your car would follow with your finger, while simultaneously determining its acceleration based on how quickly you outlined curves and straights . Once this phase was over, the race started and the car moved following the path designed for it, with greater or lesser precision according to its specific characteristics: a vehicle with greater grip would have tackled the bends without problems, otherwise it would have risked the spin; a fast vehicle would have overtaken its opponents even in the face of a ~slow~ trajectory, while one with less acceleration would have required a more aggressive approach. Apparently extremely simple and immediate, therefore, DrawRace revealed after a few minutes a title full of content that was anything but trivial, in which the physics of the cars was an element to be taken into due consideration to prepare one's race strategy. The numerous game modes crowned it all, including online multiplayer, for an engaging and lasting experience at the price of a coffee. Racing Evolved DrawRace 2: Racing Evolved is sold at the usual price of 79 cents in the iPhone version, but the differences with the first episode immediately catch the eye and concern all sectors of the RedLynx title (and now produced by Chillingo). First of all the graphics, which have gone from an almost amateurish style to something decidedly more advanced, with three-dimensional cars and extremely detailed scenarios, which in some cases boast a dynamic view during the course of the races to further increase their spectacularity. Secondly, the quality of the interface and menus, which are much richer in content, given the presence of five different championships, each consisting of thirty-six races within twelve scenarios. The total, therefore, is a good one hundred and eighty challenges of increasing difficulty, a number which in itself guarantees a duration of the experience well above the average of video games available on the App Store, and which in any case is accompanied by multiplayer matches. In each scenario, our goal is to collect three gold tokens, and to achieve this we will have to win as many races against an increasing number of opponents (one, two or three), who become more and more aggressive. The entire structure of DrawRace 2: Racing Evolved is based on a very gradual and well thought out progression system, which allows us to unlock new races and new championships depending on the tokens in our possession, thus encouraging us to try again the races that went wrong for reach the number of coins necessary to continue. In terms of pure gameplay, the precision of the ~drawing~ has been improved, in particular with regard to the acceleration and deceleration phases (although these mechanics work much better on the iPad, due to the larger screen), and the 'new boost button, which loads as the seconds go by and allows us to get an extra cue when we deem it appropriate, for example if we have planned a slow trajectory but we realize that that portion of the track needs more speed .
