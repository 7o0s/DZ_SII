Titles such as The Pinball Arcade, Pinball FX and company in fact allow you to start playing without spending too many euros, indeed often completely free, with a set of basic tables: you can then buy others if necessary, selecting the ones you are at. interested in the paid updates provided by the developers from time to time. In this perspective, the guys from Zen Studios with their FX Pinball 2 have given life to a series of interesting collaborations, set up through licensing agreements that have seen pinball machines of all types arrive as DLC: from those dedicated to some football teams, including Roma and Juventus, to other themed ones of various genres, such as those with the Captain America and Street Fighter II Turbo licenses. The latest addition to the list is The Walking Dead, a pinball machine starring zombies which incorporates elements of Robert Kirkman's creature, among other things called into question for the creation of the table in question: despite the cumbersome presence of the comics and the series television, Zen Studios was inspired by the videogame work of Telltale Games, through which we got to know the moving story of little Clementine. In detail, the pinball machine is dedicated to the first season, released on various platforms during 2013 and followed, as you know, by season number two, which ended just recently. Telltale Games' The Walking Dead now has a dedicated pinball machine too, thanks to FX Pinball 2! Marbles and zombies For the benefit of those who, thanks to The Walking Dead Pinball, should approach Pinball FX 2 for the first time, we remind you that compared to other titles such as The Pinball Arcade (in which we find tables that really existed in the past) the effort of Zen Studios is characterized by the presence of less realistic dynamics, which make greater use of the possibilities offered by electronic entertainment. The pinball machine in question is no less, given that among its features we find the possibility of accessing sections within which to abandon the flaps and the marbles for a few moments, to shoot a series of zombies present on the screen, with lots of crosshair, naturally increasing your score. Another example is the moments in which the classic ball turns into a soccer ball, thus changing its physics. Fans of the first season of The Walking Dead will find most of the elements they got to know during the adventure, including some settings such as Savannah, Macon, the motel and Clementine's tree house, retracing the story of the survivors and the famous crossroads in front of which they find themselves along their path. In fact, the missions proposed by the pinball machine follow all five episodes of the first season, giving the player different tasks according to the choices he made during the start-up phase. To get additional points, the pinball machine creates situations where the player has to go looking for food or solve other problems that afflict the group: on some occasions you also have to make your way through an attack by a zombie horde, while in T he upper left corner of the table is a subsection with two additional flaps, controlled through the same keys as the main ones. A fifth wing is also positioned on the center-right part of the screen, and should be used mostly to hit the zombie that is in the center of the pinball machine, by breaking which you can activate the main missions. The only real flaw found playing The Walking Dead Pinball is paradoxically linked to the care taken by Zen Studios in its implementation, given that the surrounding elements of the pinball machine sometimes end up distracting from the actual game, especially through the cutscenes : Activating a main quest, for example, often triggers a small animation of Lee and Clemetine, following which the ball is launched from the bottom of the table towards the lower wings. It may happen that looking at the two characters again you are not ready to hit the ball, thus ending up losing it just after activating a mission with difficulty. Fortunately, with a few games you end up getting used to all of this, thus learning not to divert your attention too much. Lee's return Along with all the various parts of the storyline, The Walking Dead Pinball proposes, as already mentioned, also most of the graphic elements belonging to the first season of the Telltale Games video game. Clementine and Lee are in fact present on the sides of the table with their 3D models, identical to those seen in the adventure, and they react to what happens in the pinball machine through some ad hoc animations: from time to time we will see them, for example, being attacked by a zombie, or playing with a soccer ball. The close agreement with Telltale has given Zen Studios the possibility of using the voices of the original protagonists as well, thus adding further value to the pinball machine for fans of The Walking Dead, for whom this new table represents a tribute not to be missed. All right, we're always talking about a series of elements that are more of a side dish than a ~main course~, but fans of the videogame adventure will appreciate the various references to the first (wonderful) season inserted by the developers . For all these reasons, it is logical that The Walking Dead Pinball can especially attract those who have loved Telltale's work, also winking at fans of the comic series and the television series: the presence of Lee and the numerous references to his story give that right nostalgic touch, in a particularly successful moment in which the second season has also come to an end. Those unfamiliar with the world of The Walking Dead will probably not be so impressed, but they will still find themselves in front of an enjoyable and not very difficult table to master: given the expense required, it can in any case be worth it.", "date": "2014-09-10", "grade": null}
