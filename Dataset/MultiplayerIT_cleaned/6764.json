How else to explain that singular mass of emotions, hatred, frustration, desire to throw pads, consoles and televisions out of the window, united however with the irresistible frenzy of making just one more attempt, which is unleashed when for the umpteenth time we fail to arrange that damned brick properly or pull over the cursed colored gems as expected? Well, in France, and more precisely in the charming Montpellier, it seems that pain, pleasure and puzzle games must be understood a lot, if it is true that that is where Swing Swing Submarine is based, a small independent team made up of only five people, author of Blocks That Matter in 2011 and two years later of its sequel, the here present Tetrobot and Co., which abandoned the platform mechanics of its predecessor, made an excellent impression on PC and is now preparing to land on Wii U as an exclusive title for the eShop. Already popular on PC, an indie puzzle game all about blocks, riddles and fun is coming to Wii U! Exploring the robotic body The Tetrobots were the protagonists of Blocks That Matter, excellent digger and builder robots, which the promotional material compares in appearance to washing machines, even if they look so much like none other than the good old GameCube. But even Tetrobots break, and if a Tetrobot breaks then how can you play Blocks That Matter again? Maya too must have wondered, the young and intelligent owner of one of these robots, who invented the Psychobot to repair hers, a machine so tiny that it can be injected into the ~body~ of her big brother and start operating (from here then starts a sort of plot which represents, due to its banality and the way it is told, the only real flaw of the title. But who needs a plot in a puzzle game?). Only that the interiors of these automatons must have been designed by an engineer not in full possession of his faculties, resembling as they are real labyrinths, composed of different rooms connected to each other by different pipes. Basically each robot, which represents a game ~world~, is divided into five different levels to be tackled in sequence: reaching the exit of each level is not an impossible operation, given the natural ascent of the difficulty curve.The problems they arise when we see ourselves barred from accessing the next robot even though we have always found the exits of the levels of the previous one: in fact, to advance it is also necessary to collect a certain number of hidden memory blocks scattered in number of three in the various stages, and it is here comes the beauty. In fact, it is not the labyrinthine structure of the worlds that intimidates the player, always rather simplistic and linear, as much as the obstacles that you will inevitably face, even more so if you want to be a ~completist~ and collect all the memory blocks, and the mechanisms that they operate them, when not quite the lack of such mechanisms. They range from hermetically sealed gate valves, to electrified beams and laser beams, up to pipes missing some pieces, just to name a few of these obstacles, and the mechanisms, which are also various, range from simple levers to points where it is necessary to park the Psychobot himself, the harmless little slimes that are occasionally encountered throughout the levels, or, and here the donkey falls, a certain type of block. Yes, the blocks, the heart of the Tetrobot and Co. concept and the cross and delight of the unwary player. You should know that our little robot is able to incorporate and transport up to six objects, which will then basically be the missing pieces of the pipes above, and these famous blocks. There are different types: that of iron, that of wood, sand, ice, steam, slime, electrified, explosives and so on and so forth. There are two fundamental rules of this game of collecting and moving blocks: once Psychobot has collected them, he can only throw them horizontally, and two blocks of the same type exert a force of attraction on each other which keeps them tied even in beard to the law of gravity. But to these two rules are added numerous ~catches~ which are the specific properties of each block, for example the iron block is resistant to laser beams, while the wooden one catches fire, setting fire to any surrounding ones, or even that of sabbia heats up to such an extent that it becomes glass. And the nice thing is that while some of these properties are clearly indicated in the virtual manual, others are cryptically expressed in Facebook, the famous social network of blocks, which the game updates every time you come across a new type. Under the banner of not only do I create many, very different and difficult game situations for you, but I also tell you them in the form of a riddle! Player block And what do you have to do with these blocks in the end? A lot of things: from simply placing them where required to trigger a mechanism, to making a laser resistant block occlude one allowing you to pass or an explosive one to explode right where necessary, up to composing structures of various shapes and size. Add to all this that each robot has a particular structure and walls: smooth walls for the first Tetrobot, for example, but liquid walls for Watabot that Psychobot can cross if pushed by the appropriate ~launching cannons~ (also of different types, fixed and rolling), and still ~muddy~ walls for Puddinbot, which retain anything that comes into contact with them... In short, you understand: the game elements are so many and varied that trying to describe them all is absolutely impossible, and most importantly, they are always presented and used with skill and a remarkable sense of level design. You will never come across a situation totally the same as the previous ones, never in an illogical and meaningless puzzle, never in a challenge so easy as to be trivial or so frustrating that you think of abandoning it. Above all, playing Tetrobot and Co. many times you will have that typical stupid feeling that you get when the solution to a problem is so obvious that it is staggering how long it took you to find it, and this, we can say, is the number of great puzzles game. To the fifty ~normal~ levels are added some more difficult stages on average, the objective of which is to collect a key that you will need later, and the fearsome clashes with the ~bosses~, increased versions of the slimes mentioned, from obviously knocking down with blocks, by far the most complicated sections of all; and speaking of complications, another great merit of the game is that of being able to make you feel stupid and brilliant at the same time, in practically developing two parallel difficulty curves, one to take everything that can be taken, one simply to get to the end of the level, which touch , especially the first, absolutely diabolical peaks but which never demand an effort greater than the pleasure one feels in solving a puzzle, also by virtue of a practical ~rewind~ system of the moves that is well suited to the ~trial and error~ nature ~ of the concept. Without forgetting that the splendid level design means that while the first puzzles can be tackled individually from time to time, later you will get used to thinking of the level as a whole, with an action done in one point that determines a particular situation elsewhere, perhaps reachable with a teleportation a-la Portal. All this, on Wii U, to be tackled through three different control systems: the best, in the opinion of the writer, is the one that solves everything on the GamePad with stylus and touch screen, but control via the traditional pad, although slower and cumbersome, and above all the one available to WiiMote owners, allow you to enjoy the beautiful graphics of the game, clean, fluid, full of nice animations of the protagonist, in the splendor of HD on the 50-inch living room, together with the beautiful, very ambient soundtrack , one of the elements that contributes to not overfeeding (almost at all, to tell the truth), the frustration of spending an hour in front of the screen without really being able to understand how the hell one can ever position the cursed block where it is needed. In such situations, for example, the beautiful ~idle animation~ of Psychobot is triggered, which squeezes and sharpens its single eye just like the player is doing at the same time. And if you think I'm fooling you, yes, you're right, it is.", "date": "2014-11-13", "grade": "8.5"}
