{"name": "Star Wars: Lethal Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-lethal-alliance.html", "text": "The Strength of the Covenant Inserted between the facts narrated by the third and fourth episode of the film saga, Lethal Alliance features a Twi'lek mercenary named Rianna Saren as the protagonist. This, contacted by Kyle Katarn and Princess Leia, is hired by the Rebels in order to steal the imperial plans of the prototype of the Death Star. The story is absolutely not memorable, and indeed plays a secondary role, relegated to a few cutscenes and lines of dialogue. What matters most is the meeting, in the early stages of the game, between our heroine and the droid Zeeo, who decided to offer his help to Rianna after being saved by her. As can be seen from the title of the game, the leitmotif of Lethal Alliance lies precisely in the interaction between the two characters, who must necessarily collaborate to complete the most disparate tasks. Zeeo can be thrown against enemies to stun them, is capable of generating a shield to deflect enemy blows and helps Rianna to produce more effective and spectacular evasive moves and so on: not only that, the brave little robot proves to be indispensable for reaching otherwise inaccessible, being able to hang on walls or float for short distances. Controlled directly by the user, Rianna instead deals more with the warfare part, being able to fry enemies from a distance using four different weapons or by freezing them in close combat thanks to an energy blade. Peculiarities of Lethal Alliance is a subspecies of ~alliance indicator~, which grows every time the two protagonists collaborate in an offensive move and which should provide a sort of power-up once complete, but in reality its impact on the gameplay is almost nothing. This is certainly not the only oversight of the LucasArts product, however: in fact, the control system leaves much to be desired, mainly due to a cumbersome and poorly performing lock-on mechanism. But the game design of the title also has numerous flaws: the stages are rather flat, the enemies are essentially harmless and the actions to be performed are repetitive and unsatisfactory. Lethal Alliance is inspired only by some ancillary aspects of excellent products such as Prince of Persia (the slow motion and the spectacularization of the stunts) leaving out the most important and finally revealing itself as decidedly insipid. Mixed bags Paradoxically, the lack of care for some fundamental aspects of Lethal Alliance is contrasted by the goodness of certain side elements which in some way improve the fortunes of LucasArts production. In addition to the aforementioned Prince of Persia-esque touches, Lethal Alliance showcases some of the best on-rail sequences seen lately: these appear a handful of times throughout the adventure to break up the conventional gameplay, and see Rianna literally hanging from Zeeo while this flutters in the midst of all kinds of snares. In the aforementioned phases, the user's task is to help the Twi'lek mercenary to avoid the obstacles that are placed in front of her, in a decidedly frenetic and fun and also visually very satisfying context. It is a pity that these on-rail sections represent an exception on all fronts, including the audiovisual one: although globally discreet, Lethal Alliance cosmetics certainly do not represent the best of PSP production, and indeed show the side to numerous imperfections such as interpenetrations, crazy cameras and bugs of various kinds. But the fundamental problem of the LucasArts title lies in the absolute flatness of the technical sector in stylistic terms, with hackneyed settings, acid colors and a sound accompaniment that cannot be more banal and repetitive. This does not detract from Lethal Alliance the merit of showing fairly large and enemy-rich scenarios while maintaining a stable frame rate, but at the price of never arousing any emotion in the player. In addition to a story mode that is not too long in absolute terms but definitely sufficient for the mediocre rhythm of the playful action of Lethal Alliance, the package also offers an ad-hoc multiplayer mode, which is literally useless. In fact, why stuff it with options when the only activity allowed is a very boring one-on-one battle? Mysteries of the Force... Comment Star Wars Lethal Alliance is the classic product that could look good on paper but which in the end pays off considerably the inexperience of the developers in the realization of its key elements. Although technically acceptable and with some pleasant gameplay insights (the stunts and on-rail sections), Lethal Alliance suffers from a very inconvenient lock-on system and above all from a play structure that is too thin, which causes the game to expire several times. adventure in the boring. Pros Discrete graphics Well done on-rail sections Cons Gamepthin and banal lay Questionable control system Mediocre sound Definitely one of the most exploited licenses in the world of video games, that of Star Wars has been linked, over time, both to products of very high caliber and to much less valuable titles: for this reason, each new video game release of the famous franchise is always met with a mixture of hope and suspicion. And the rather quiet arrival of this new Lethal Alliance leaves much more room for the second than for the first...", "date": "2006-12-13", "grade": null}
