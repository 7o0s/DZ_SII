{"name": "Conquistatori indie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/119335-expeditions-conquistador-conquistatori-indie.html", "text": "A few months behind the schedule published on Kickstarter, where it slightly exceeded the pre-established $70,000, the debut work by Logic Artists, the Danish software house published by BitComposer, arrives on the virtual shelves of the main online stores. Initially developed as a demo for Windows platforms, and then migrated to the mobile versions of Microsoft's OS, where it can still be purchased for the paltry sum of 99 cents, it now lands for all desktop systems, including Linux and MacOs. It is an unprecedented union between Heroes Of Might & Magic and Baldur's Gate, set, as the title suggests, in the little-detailed period of the Spanish colonial expeditions in Central America, in this case in the two-year period between 1518 and 1520. Crew, boarding! The no-nonsense startup screen takes you straight to starting a new game. As a first step, you need to balance the characteristics of your conqueror, aware of the fact that he will never be used in battle in first person, but that his peculiarities will help change the behavior of his men. In this way, whoever decides to spend more points on Scouting will be able to cover a greater distance between one turn and another, whoever concentrates on Medicine will be able to heal wounded comrades more quickly and so on. The second and interesting step to take before landing on the game map concerns the choice of ten adventure companions who, like the characteristics of the main character, are divided into five groups: Scouts, Scholars, Warriors, Healers and Hunters. The composition of the group also modifies the profile of the conqueror: for example, those who have increased the Tactics item will benefit more from having a large number of warriors in their ranks; the same reasoning applies to the remaining aspects. Each character has a specific character profile, and it will be advisable to avoid enlisting personalities that are too different from each other, as, during the game, these could collide with each other, creating unpleasant situations such as mutinies or internal battles. In the same way, certain choices of the player could affect the followers, increasing or decreasing their dedication to the cause: for example, deciding to spare the savages who have looted the camp will bring discontent towards the racist and aggressive units, while it will thank those less inclined to combat and more open-minded. On closer inspection, it is therefore a very delicate phase of the game, certainly not duly investigated by the contextual guide which limits itself to giving some basic indications. Fortunately, the arduous task can be delegated to the processor, however losing a large part of the role-playing component of Expeditions. After a short and cheap animated introduction, created using a concept art slide, the time finally comes to take control of our army in the first of the two available campaigns: the second remains inaccessible as long as the previous one is not completed. At the port of Santo Domingo, a tutorial awaits us that allows us to become familiar with the basic mechanics of the game. The first few minutes are spent in dialogues: we will discover that the Spanish settlers on the island are being attacked by the indigenous tribes who are claiming their own spaces. It will be up to the conqueror to choose which side to side with: based on the decisions made, certain quests will be activated which will make the plot take a precise direction. The script is one of the strengths of the title: by exploiting a little-known historical context, it manages to capture the player's interest by inducing him to carefully ponder the choices of his own actions. Whoever has the most courage will win Sooner or later, however, it will be necessary to come to the hard way: the battlefield is presented in the timeless isometric view with the terrain divided into equally classic hexagons. In these phases Expeditions: Conquistador closely resembles countless turn-based strategies, from the more recent Fallen Enchantress and Might And Magic: Heroes VI, up to the historic Disciples and Steel Panthers. First of all it is necessary to choose the fearless ones to deploy, obviously paying attention to the characteristics of each one: the warriors have a high number of life points and powerful attacks, but are limited in their movements and can only hit opponents who are in adjacent hexagons ; the scouts are instead faster and are able to cover greater distances, but are more vulnerable and less effective; in short, according to the classic rule of the Chinese morra, each unit has its strengths and weaknessesand it's up to the player to appropriately deploy and exploit the forces at their disposal, considering that each of these gains experience and can be upgraded with stronger armor, more accurate rifles or sharper swords. If a man is shot down, he is not lost permanently: if the battle is still managed to conclude victoriously, the unfortunate person can be cared for to prepare him for action in the following rounds. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is good and takes advantage of some refined mechanics developed by the Logic Artists programmers, such as the possibility of not ending the movement points of the militia with the attack (for example, the riflemen will be able to move into shooting position and shoot and then take cover again behind a barricade), the passive attack encountered when passing next to an enemy-occupied square or the benefits obtained by surrounding an opponent. The battles are therefore demanding and long-lived from the first minutes of the game, also because the number of ~bad guys~ often exceeds that of their own troops, and require, as well as a certain attention from the player who cannot make use of the ~pilot automatic~ as in Heroes Of Might & Magic, a fair amount of free time. Wanting to criticize one of the most successful aspects of the entire production, one could complain, especially in the most demanding battles, of the excessive precision of the PC-controlled riflemen. Interesting first work, which does not hide the inexperience of the development team Let's set sail together on the Big Blue route The developers also wanted to give depth to the exploratory phase, opting for a turn-based mode that lends itself to various criticisms. This stratagem, which has the defect of breaking up the action excessively, was adopted to provide a deeper role-playing cut to the game. During the night camps we will often be approached by our men who will tell us about their past, ask for advice or show intolerance towards the decisions taken by the conqueror rather than towards the character of their fellow soldiers. These are pleasant moments in which it is possible to make decisions that will also have repercussions on the continuation of the adventure. In front of the camp hearth there is not space only for dialogues, as it is necessary to think about the health and safety of the crew. Through a management screen it will be necessary to decide which men to dedicate to hunting, which to patrol the base, which to collect medicinal herbs or to build barricades and other war weapons. It is important that no one lacks care or food, both the morale of the troops and their own lives would suffer: ignoring the state of health of a unit, which could also fall ill simply due to a sting from an insect encountered during the exploration of a forest, you risk losing it permanently. All these facets of micro-economics weigh down the game mechanics without significantly increasing their involvement, so much so as to persuade us to leave the task of managing ordinary administration right away to the CPU. There's a fully loaded vessel down there... On the aesthetic side, Expeditions: Conquistador struggles to mask its low-cost production nature: we have already talked about introductory films and dialogues which, although pleasant, show a few too many wrinkles. The same goes for the game engine (Logic Artists has relied on the versatile Unity, which we had already seen used in other independent productions such as Anna and Endless Space): the style of the map is a bit confusing although it cannot be said that graphic details abound; the battles then leave a bitter taste in the mouth as the models used for the construction of the units are too few and too simplistic, animated in a decidedly mediocre way. It would certainly have been appropriate to spend more energy at least for the creation of the main characters, at least to allow the player to become attached to his men, an aspect that is fundamental to say the least in an RPG. The soundtrack, entrusted to the Spanish artist Leonardo Badinella, and the audio effects in general, while adhering to the historical context, get boring in the long run. The competitive game has been implemented, albeit in a somewhat rudimentary way: it is possible to challenge an opponent in the historic hotseat mode or use the direct connection for remote challenges. On the technical front, we note the presence of some sporadic but annoying bugs which in the most extreme cases may require you to resume someone's gamehe turn first; a pity also the lack of support for cloud saves which would certainly be appreciable considering the admirable longevity of the campaigns. In fact, Logic Artists speaks of an abundant twenty hours to complete the conquest missions on Mexican soil, given that, based on our tests, we feel we can endorse. The treasure is no longer a mirage At this point it should be clear that it is not easy to express an unequivocal judgment on Expeditions: Conquistador. The (deliberately) classic-style gameplay is aimed at an audience that will not struggle to overlook small but avoidable flaws and a slightly too old-fashioned aesthetic system. Upon a more careful and detached analysis, the impression obtained is that the programmers wanted to put too much iron on the fire without being able to emphasize the valid starting ideas, in particular the exploratory phase, weighing them down with frills that are not always functional to the game mechanics which are consequently watered down and made less biting. Sins of youth which, however, do not prevent Expeditions: Conquistador from shining with its own light in the crowded panorama of indie games; we are also convinced that by working on this little rough gem it could in the future become a point of reference for fans of role-playing and strategy games.", "date": "2013-06-03", "grade": "7.2"}
