{"name": "First Class Trouble", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/first-class-trouble-recensione.html", "text": "Although it is lateral and of irrelevant importance for the purposes of the short games of First Class Trouble, the game confronts us with a simple but effective story: we are on board a luxury space ship with all the existing comforts together with other wealthy passengers, served by robots designed to carry out orders. What can possibly go wrong? As usual since the birth of science fiction stories, the robots become aware of what is happening to them and a main AI directs the rebellion from the ship's control center. Our aim will be, together with the other unfortunates, to try to reach the aforementioned room to deactivate the homicidal intentions of the artificial intelligence. It would all be simple except that the robots can take human form and infiltrate the group of survivors to sabotage everything and try to kill anyone before the successful completion of the mission. For those who don't play asynchronous games, know that you will basically be divided into two groups at the beginning of the game: passengers or personoids (the fateful robots). As a passenger you will have to try to reach the control room unscathed, conversely as a personoid you will have to try to avoid it in any way. Indemnified yes, because between a hug and a push, a fire and flying bottles, with oxygen always in reserve and the anxiety of short circuits, you will have to juggle a thousand dangers to be able to survive the fateful 10 minutes or so that separate you from opening the control center hatch. Gameplay First Class Trouble - one of the repairs to electrical circuits So far everything seems nice and simple, but know that unfortunately, even if the intentions of the developers are certainly among the best, the purely ~video game~ realization almost fails to entertain and amuse. We assume that we do not know what arcane reason is the basis of not wanting to explain any game dynamics. It is really frustrating for anyone, especially for those who have never played similar games, to be able to understand what is happening around him and what is the purpose at that particular moment. Yes, ok, it says what to do (in English or any other language other than Italian), but trust us if we tell you that we were at least 5 games wandering around and dying first without understanding anything of what was happening around us, with people running around or others insulting each other. Apart from everything, it is a very serious lack of a tutorial or ad hoc modality that can initiate anyone into a game with such particular dynamics. First Class Trouble - Customizing our avatar In First Class Trouble there are 3 game phases in which the teams, made up of 6 players, must be able to solve very basic puzzles trying not to be killed by the two personoids hiding among their ranks. Obviously everything is seasoned with subterfuge and deception by the bad robots, to try not to be discovered and preserve their evil hegemony. Between one phase and another there is the possibility of sending the suspected robots into space, although most likely the first few times, like us, you will not understand a thing. Our advice is to let go of the vote at least until you master the game system and the internal chat well. Once dead you will have the possibility to continue viewing the game from the point of view of a small robot, also customizable, that none of the others will see or hear, like the ghost of Among Us, the product to which First Class Trouble refers redo in all respects. Technique First Class Trouble - Care for setting is very high An applause goes to Invisible Walls as regards the stylistic research. The whole ship oozes the 30s from every pore. Palettes, sound effects, polygonal models, textures and stylistic details, really everything is highly sought after and almost refined. Even your avatars can be customized as you level up, with any particular accessory, haircut or garment. In fact, you will also have the possibility to create your character through an editor, not too powerful in fact, but still enough to be able to differentiate anyone's passengers and give you the opportunity to indulge yourself a bit. To do this, however, you will need to accumulate too much in-game currency to unlock even a single hat. Unfortunately, however, all this magnificence is choked by a very poor technical realization. Let's face it, the game isn't fun for what it does, but for the things that happen independent of the developers' intentions. At the moment there are still a lot of bugs aabsurd and paradoxically it's more fun to get carried away by all these imperfections than to commit to win. All in all, we don't feel like promoting the playability of First Class Trouble: too cumbersome, slow controls, wobbly collisions and scattered bugs make it a sort of alpha being updated. Let's also add the servers that are struggling to find matches and we have in all respects the usual missed opportunity even with a more than good basic idea.", "date": "2021-11-26", "grade": "5.0"}
