{"name": "MultiVersus: la recensione del picchiaduro free-to-play di Warner che ha battuto tutti i record", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/multiversus-recensione.html", "text": "Let's be honest: when the first images of MultiVersus appeared on the net, we were skeptical to say the least. Warner Bros.' fighting game felt like little more than a soulless clone of Super Smash Bros. and, despite the apparent importance of the licenses involved, it was hard to believe in a product capable of truly distinguishing itself in the panorama of fighting game, especially if we consider the flop of many other projects that started from markedly more technical and original foundations. Going forward, however, communication around the game began to become more crystalline and the videos of the developers, Player First Games, succeeded finally igniting in us a flame of hope that we didn't even think existed. Entire presentations dedicated to the online sector, with the confirmation of a cutting-edge netcode rollback, and the promise of a stable network ecosystem capable of supporting a thriving competitive environment for a long time; honest explanations related to monetization, capable of describing a system that is finally sensible and perfectly suited to the genre to which it belongs; and, finally, some nice gameplay demonstrations, in which we finally saw how MultiVersus was something more than a trivial copying of the works of Sakurai and his. In short, a minestrone of excellent intentions and hard work, capable of making us really want to try the game. Now that we have finally tested the game extensively, we and more than a ten million other players; so many as to decree its success practically immediately and to catapult it among the most played fighting games in history. How come this curious work has conquered such an audience? Is it really only related to its free-to-play nature, or is it the gameplay and the names involved that made it stand out? On the occasion of the official release of the first season (which also corresponds to the end of the beta, of course), today we try to answer these questions with an in-depth review of MultiVersus. Gameplay: More swish than smash MultiVersus: Yes, two-on-two battles can be confusing, but the interface helps Let's start with the first factor: the gameplay, usually the most important element in determining the value of a fighting game. As far as MultiVersus is concerned, in reality, we do not think this was the backbone capable of making the project explode among the masses. Yet it would be foolish to ignore the cleverness of Player First's approach to the ~accessibility problem~. Compared to other equally refined competing titles, in fact, this work starts from an extremely more flexible and stratified base for newbies of the genre, that of the Smash Bros.: a system which, if well thought out, is able to cover a huge range of players and interests, while maintaining skill barriers that are almost insurmountable for most users at high levels. MultiVersus avoids total copying, in favor of a fairly unique and detailed system, so as to distinguish itself significantly from the works of Sakurai (in general, not only from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate). If, in fact, on the one hand here too there are moves, directional specials for each character and a limited number of lives to be made to disappear by throwing them off the screen, on the other hand there is an enormously greater emphasis on aerial movement - with the ability to perform multi-directional double dashes and double jumps in the air during fights - where the whole experience is designed to be balanced more on two-on-two fights than single fights. In fact, most of the available fighters have at least one special support, usually capable of giving temporary defenses to their companions, enhancing their damage, ~armoring~ them or offering other bonuses, with large landslides in effectiveness based on the mode faced. To give a very simple example, Reindog, a furry quadruped created by the development team, is generally seen as not very efficient in one-on-one situations, but it is an almost obvious choice for expert teams, due to the very useful ability to recover the companions from a distance before they go off the screen and the advantages offered to his partners. MultiVersus: Finn vs. Bugs Bunny. Battle between recently nerfed dominators However, the differences are not all here and there is no shortage of advanced subtleties (albeit without particular exaggerations): movement on the ground boasts a certain inertia that allows you to use the sprint to perform jumps in fast approach, almost all normal attacks can be loaded and replace the classic ~Smash~, it is possible to choose passive skills in battle that give advantages to damage, defense or movement, and the offensive seems slightly more orientedate on true combos (thanks to some characters being able to cancel offensive moves with standing dodge). Overall? It's really a nice job, which while not reaching the technicalities of Ultimate does its duty, enjoys and works. If you want to find faults, the main one was quite excessive hitboxes during early access, but with the latest update various moves have been modified to be less usable and it is clear how Player First Games wants to keep them constantly updated and sub 'watch the competitive game to avoid excessive imbalances. And while we're talking about imbalances... Monetization and Structure: The Impossible Roster MultiVersus: the initial roster already boasts presences that cannot be underestimated Let's be serious: the game's roster is quite possibly the number one reason for its success. There are other products very close to Super Smash Bros. and free-to-play of value (Brawlhalla, to name one), yet we have never seen a phenomenon like MultiVersus in this extraordinarily competitive ecosystem. The Player First game, however, can count on Warner's extraordinary library of licenses and this guarantees it a list of fighters capable of breaking through the barriers of the casual audience with ease. The round of initial characters has an excellent mix, from DC pillars such as Superman and Batman, to characters loved by children such as Finn, Jake or Steven Universe, passing through Arya Stark, Shaggy, Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry or the Giant of Iron. Having Warners on its own is an inexhaustible source of interesting new additions, potentially coming from Lord of the Rings, a myriad of different films (even Mad Max and Godzilla are concrete possibilities, no kidding), and comic book history. The developers then did their best to make each fighter unique, offering everyone a decent list of specific skills (and time-based resources) capable of greatly diversifying everyone's approach to matches. Difficult to compete with so much goodness. Multiversus: In the Batcave it is easier to get knocked off the screen. Attention That said, the glue that really manages to keep all these elements stable in a single, very pleasant composition is none other than monetization, given that we are facing a free-to-play, listen, listen, for once not predatory. One of the primary doubts before the launch resided precisely in the internal store and in how the contents would be managed, but the development team was intelligent, deciding to apply the most appropriate formula ever to fighting games: that of games with the Dota 2 model No exaggerations, no brutal roster blocks, just a periodic rotation of free characters, an internal currency obtainable with human timing to unlock them, a fairly honest season pass and the obligation to spend money only for the most accurate aesthetic changes (and not even all). Not only that: all the characters can be tested in a training mode called Laboratory, so as to allow players to understand if they actually want to unlock any new entries or ignore them and wait for someone else. The formula just described is in our opinion a boon for the genre and potentially applicable to many other titles (even far more technical than this one). The only real problem? The content at the launch of these games and the actual ability of the team involved to churn out characters in a timely manner; both of which MultiVersus stumbles slightly. The future of fighting games? MultiVersus: dodging is key in this game, as there are no ~shields~ outside of a few specific defensive skills The first flaw to overcome are, in fact, the updates: the MultiVersus combat system favors the arrival of new characters within a limited time, due to the not excessive number of moves available to each one; however, the balance is quite another fish to fry and, if the first new addition, Lebron James, hasn't upset the balance too much, we suspect that in the future there may be significantly less balanced choices, or that the times between a warrior and the else may stretch more than expected. At the moment, however, this is a fake problem, given that the team seems to be very attentive to the landslides of the online game and to the will of the community, so much so that they have already implemented some significant interventions (such as the right adjustments to Finn's excessive power and Bugs Bunny, or the changes to a Taz who was starting to make online play unfunny for the abuse of a specific move). There is little to talk about when it comes to content unfortunately, because, as free-to-play in the beginning,MultiVersus is a completely competitive-oriented title with very little meat in the fire in terms of modes. Sure, online you can face one-on-one, two-on-two and a chaotic but hilarious free-for-all, but don't expect much else from Warner's title. If the world of online challenges doesn't intrigue you in the least, MultiVersus isn't for you. On the other hand, the quality of the arenas is good, well detailed and full of personality. MultiVersus: monetization is all managed around aesthetic changes, and not predatory. For once Obviously, if this is the underlying structure, the most important part remains the online stability, and we must say that ... in all honesty we expected better. In fact, MultiVersus boasts an excellent netcode rollback that is most of the time very stable and enjoyable, but, either due to the excessive number of players, or due to some server instability, we have recently seen various games suffer from strange latency or very dangerous ~teleports~ (the main fear of when there are connectivity issues with rollback). Of course, the online infrastructure remains solid (and head and shoulders above anything ever offered by Super Smash Bros. in this field), however we hope for a gradual disappearance of the hiccups encountered in recent days. Finally, the technical sector is not bad. The cartoonish style properly equalizes the characters, despite the diversity of styles a bit out of tune, and a good job has been done on the interface, properly customizable and clear enough to dampen the confusion that occasionally arises in 2 vs. 2. In short, it is impossible to look for a single element capable of explaining the number of players in MultiVersus: the work of Player First gets it right on a large list of things and gives the impression of doing it in a perfect transition moment for the genre.", "date": "2022-08-23", "grade": "8.0"}
