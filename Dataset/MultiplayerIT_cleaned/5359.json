{"name": "Congelamento imminente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/172208-near-death-congelamento-imminente.html", "text": "The survival genre is based on some precise and well-defined characteristics, around which all the others revolve: collection of resources, creation of infrastructure using blueprints, the need to satisfy some of the primary needs of the main character and so on. The most frequent criticisms of the by now very numerous representatives of the genre are known: the excessive repetitiveness and the absurd progression of some mechanics, which transform the player into a kind of industrial machine capable of destroying entire forests and digging massive mountains in a few minutes. Near Death, second work by the author of The Novelist, tries to exploit the concept of ~survival~ in a different way from the other exponents of the genre, even if starting from the same bases and even betraying on several occasions debts with The Long Dark, the title to which evidently the development team was heavily inspired. The idea is always that of the human being who fights against the hostile environment by exploiting the resources remedied in various ways, but here there is never dominion, that is, one struggles from start to finish and one never reaches the point of be able to feel safe. The starting scenario is quite typical: we are the survivors of a plane crash. Unfortunately we didn't end up in some forest or other luxuriant environment full of food and materials, but in Antarctica, where the cold can reach one hundred degrees below zero and even just thinking about staying too long outdoors is madness that can cost the freezing. In front of us there is an ice desert and a research base, called Sutro Station, which we must explore from top to bottom to be able to escape and, perhaps, find a way to get home. The night will last for months and we can't hope for dawn to come. We'll make it? We reviewed Near Death, a survival adventure from the author of The Novelist Extreme survival Near Death is a peculiar game. At times it seems to be faced more with a horror than a survival, even if there are no monsters. However, the risk of dying is concrete to the point of being the cornerstone of the entire gameplay. The Sutro base is made up of different environments detached from each other, which must be reached by venturing outside. The typical reaction induced by game design is haste. We are about to die and have few batteries to keep the flashlight going and little kerosene to fuel the portable stove with which we can warm ourselves when we risk freezing. Then outside we run following the indications of the signs that direct us towards the various sectors of the base and the lit lampposts that create ideal paths that help not to get lost. The rush remains even when you are in one of the interiors, which do not fully protect against the cold and which we must raid as quickly as possible. Indeed, some rooms have broken windows which let in the cold and snow, and which prevent you from heating up with the stove. Then, flashlight in hand, one quickly looks on the shelves, in the crates, in the drawers and in every possible nook and cranny in search of supplies and materials, necessary to make useful objects such as patches to repair windows to create closed environments, necessary to heat and to leave items, or like some warmer clothes to slow down freezing. Sometimes building serves to achieve some of the set goals. For example, on more than one occasion it is necessary to repair short-circuited generators (mandatory or optional) and to do this it is necessary to find the materials to create spare parts. In general, there aren't many feasible projects and some are optional, but they are exactly what is needed for the scenario in which we find ourselves, without drift or absurdity. Not all blueprints are available right away: most are obtained by reading the manuals scattered around the base. The friendly voice To direct us towards our goals, the developers have studied a simple and effective system. From time to time we must in fact communicate by telegraph with a second survivor who illustrates the situation and gives us missions, without ever going into too much detail (not even he knows what to do to save himself). The objectives, primary and secondary, are summarized in the menu, where there are also the projects, the transcripts of the dialogues and a map with a compass without indicators of any kind, but with all the names of the sectors of the base clearly legible. In short, we are the ones who have to explore the Sutro to find what we need, an operation made particularly onerous by the risk of freezing, which we have discussed extensively above. The plot itself is well written and functional, even if it's not great. Let's say it's a good motive egr move forward and get to the end of the game; end of the game that is not long in coming. Near Death can be completed in just over two hours, while completionists who want to unlock all the contents will take at least five, but having to replay it a second time (a third is unlikely). We imagine that for some it is a really tight time, but it must be said that they are two intense and well-studied hours, without fillers of any kind. Probably the developers could have stretched the stock a bit by exploiting the creation mechanics, but the risk was that of having to loosen the pace a lot, ending up softening the atmosphere as well. Almost dead From a technical point of view, Near Death does not make you cry out for a miracle, but intelligently exploits its resources to create a tense and at times memorable atmosphere. For example, the poor external visibility, combined with the freezing mechanics, create situations that can lead to panic. Imagine being alone in the freezing cold, with your vision blurring from being too cold and the closest structure tens of meters away. It is one of those cases in which the technical choices directly affect the gameplay, almost turning into game mechanics. The atmosphere is so well done that it overlooks some not very beautiful three-dimensional objects and environments that are sometimes a bit bare, completely lacking in a recognizable style. It must be said that as the game progresses, the situation improves and you find yourself in more well-kept and pleasant areas to visit. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is very beautiful, despite being quite derivative. Sounds that enrich the gameplay include the voice of the protagonist, which helps to understand when the situation is getting critical, or when he has warmed up enough, and a number of ambient sound effects that build a powerful texture in helping the player to immerse yourself in the action. The audio tracks of them are used in an unobtrusive way and never overlap what is the core of the gameplay.", "date": "2016-08-08", "grade": "8.0"}
