{"name": "Medieval Total War: Viking Invasion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medieval-total-war-viking-invasion.html", "text": "s%% Some historical information June 8, 793, in Lindisfarne, an island north-east of England, the monks were attending to their daily activities, taking care of the fields and livestock as they do every day. Around noon, sails were sighted offshore, but this did not arouse immediate suspicions: Lindisfarne was one of the most famous monasteries, one of the best known pilgrimage centers in all the British Isles and it was normal for unknown ships to dock, even from remote countries. But what the monks found before their eyes that day were not ordinary ships: they were drakkars loaded with armed men. It was a massacre, warriors armed with axes and swords descended screaming from the boats and, overwhelming everything that stood in front of them, they massacred many of the local inhabitants, others were horribly tortured and the women certainly suffered the worst fate. When the foreigners had finished loading the loot onto their ships they disappeared whence they had come. In this way the European civilizations met the Vikings and from that day all the northern countries had to deal with these powerful pirates, sons of an extremely poor and barbaric society as advanced in navigation and combat technologies. It took twenty years just for their origin to be discovered and then, after having cast their shadow over Europe for 200 years, thanks also to a constant work of evangelization, they were transformed to the point of building some of the cornerstones of Europe pre-Renaissance. (thanks to Carlo Sangalli from whom I ~raided~ this information) A few semi-serious notes But let's get back to us and the expansion for MTW. The best strategy of the past 2002 comes with a worthy expansion. Viking Invasion provides a whole new campaign to play, this time not grappling with the whole of Europe, but focusing solely on a map of England divided across all its various provinces. To contend for the domination of these lands (in fact it is not possible to play in any other way than with the aim of conquering everything) are eight brand new factions, all representing the various ethnic groups present on the British Isles at the time (Irish, Scots, Saxons, Picts, etc.) plus the Vikings. The available units are more or less the same as in the original game, except for the Vikings who sport several typical infantry units and a new artillery piece available exclusively for the original game's campaigns. Some innovations also concern the gameplay and in particular the sieges, one of the weakest points of the Total War series, to make attacks on castles a hair more exciting the ability for thrown weapons (catapults etc.) has been introduced. to load incendiary shells, and the defenders will welcome your men at the gates of the castles with a smile and a pot of boiling oil as a sign of undying friendship. The manual also speaks of new units assigned in the original game to independent troops, but which appear only at a later stage. Instead, what I found very nice is the possibility of replaying the old campaign with three new factions: Aragonese, Hungarians and Sicilians, a good excuse to take back the old map of Europe and try to conquer it with the new factions. But let's talk about us Going back to the brand new campaign, the first thing you'll notice is how the ~tech tree~ works. In short, you will notice how easier it is on average to set up an army in a short time, in exchange you will find yourself having to suffer a lot before the resources of your province bear fruit. In fact, this is especially noticeable while playing the campaign of the Vikings who profit more from looting than from building new structures. Another small note should also be placed on the calibration of the difficulty, certainly Creative Assembly has recreated a fitting historical scenario, so remember that the Vikings at the time of the first invasions had troops far superior to those of their opponents and moved them by sea with much more speed . The consequence is a very easy game if we decide to keep to our cuckolded friends, while if we ever had to line up to defend the English coasts, brute force alone would certainly not serve to stop the invaders: better to work with diplomacy. Diplomacy works quite well, personally I've never trusted the political relations apparatus in a pc game, the AI plots are sometimes so obscure that I don't think even my little athlon is familiar with them. The fact remains cHowever, the system is credible and is made a little less static than the original Medieval, by the fact that you move on a very small map. So contacts must be made immediately and political decisions should be chosen wisely, but quickly. The action is much more frenetic than in Medieval Total War, the battles follow one another rapidly and are generally of a smaller entity also due to the difficulty of having a truly impressive economic apparatus, as in the campaigns we already know, to support of huge armies. There is no more religion The Vikings recognize only one: their own. However in Britain Christianity is strongly felt and, although it is very difficult, even frozen pumpkins like the Viking ones could be converted into Papist pumpkins. In any case, you will find only two structures (or places of worship) to build for the Vikings and you will not have religious emissaries to send around, unlike the island populations, who will have, as usual, bishops, priests and all the necessary perfect altar boy. In short, perhaps this is the most subdued aspect in the expansion, certainly also to respect the reality of the historical period chosen and in the end that's okay, who has time to pray when I can raid villages and kidnap their young women to thicken my personal harem ? Maybe I'm getting a little confused... I am a Viking among Vikings Well yes I converted, I read the Edda (the sacred book of the Vikings), I wear a mouflon fur even with forty degrees, I smear myself with seal blubber and go around the house with a huge double ax that I sometimes use for 'oral hygiene, when dental floss is scarce and I take a shower with water now close to absolute zero. My life is never the same, one day I too will ascend to Valhalla and feast on the gods of the world. Schizophrenic crises aside Viking Invasion is a great expansion, I have a soft spot for ~thick~ titles and this kid has it in spades. The Creative Assemblies have done their usual great job, accurate and quantitatively satisfactory: not only have they given us a new campaign, but several reasons to replay the dear old European conquest. Of course, the technical realization now tastes a bit stale, but the crowd scenes, accompanied by the excellent audio tracks, are always a rewarding and exciting show together. In addition, small improvements such as the battle preparation screen (which allows you to organize the order of reinforcements and save on the fly before jumping into the fray) almost make you forget that even this time we don't have the possibility to play the entire campaign online. vabbeh it will mean that we will wait for Rome Total War for this. In any case Viking Invasion is a title to have absolutely if you already own a copy of Medieval Total War, or an excellent excuse to also buy the original game and give yourself months of fun with the biggest strategic title of recent years. Pros: 11 new game factions Very accurate in historical details Extremely long-lived The Vikings! Do you want to put? Cons: Uploads a bit long Dated graphics The minimum requirements on the box are absurd Hordaland 800 AD In this historical period, the new expansion of Activision for their highly praised Medieval Total War begins, dragging us through the icy Scandinavian and Danish lands in the midst of one of the most feared peoples of the entire Middle Ages: the Vikings. They were a real scourge for all the European coasts, as great navigators they piloted their drakkars up to the Mediterranean and, towards the west, up to the American coasts many centuries before Columbus or Magellan arrived there. But their fame was built chiefly on their fierce ferocity in battle and their indelicate inclination to plunder and pillage. For disintegrated England, abandoned by the Romans to its infighting and already contested by Saxons, Britons, Welsh and other handfuls of miscellaneous Celtic peoples, nothing was as woefully timely as the Viking invasion. Attracted by the treasures deposited in the monasteries of Northumberland and by the riches of the fertile southern lands of the Saxons, they swept the English coasts like a gust of icy north wind and it was not until 1066 that the English troops managed to inflict the defeat on them which caused them to withdraw from British lands. Practically a couple of days later the English (or it would be more correct to say the Saxons) found themselves in Hastings in front of the army of a certain William the Conquistor from this it can be deduced that the Viking horns brought a bit of bad luck to the English.", "date": "2003-06-17", "grade": null}
