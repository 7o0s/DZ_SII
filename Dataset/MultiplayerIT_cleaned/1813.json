{"name": "Big Mutha Truckers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/big-mutha-truckers.html", "text": "Rednecks Big Mutha Truckers, a trucking company that has been active for 30 years but certainly not famous for its efficiency, is about to lose its owner Ma Jackson, who, having reached retirement age, wants to choose one of her 4 children as successor, organizing a race: whoever manages to make the most money within 60 days by transporting goods for the county will inherit the package. And this is where you come in, my dears! In fact, in the role of one of the 4 babies you will have to travel as much road as possible, scraping together money within the set time limit, but don't think it will be that easy, since you will have to deal with policemen (and there are really hundreds of them patrolling every street good traffic performance, other than real life) scrupulous, vengeful motorcyclists (who, not content with shooting you, will also try to steal your trailer) and, obviously, with the most basic road rules to respect, in order not to transform the game in the usual Gran Turismo or, worse, in a Destruction Derby Accelerate, Steer, avoid the old lady As I have already said, BMT is a rather atypical racing game in which, in addition to earning money, you must respect the road rules in order not to run into penalties or accidents, under penalty of lowering your reputation or destroying the truck. Even though I am not a truck driver, the driving model seemed quite realistic to me, so much so that you will have a hard time at the beginning when you get used to keeping the vehicle on the road, downshifting and also managing the size of the large load you are carrying. behind, especially awkward in reverse, as it is separate from the drive. Furthermore, the roads in your county are not all distinguished by practicability, and more often than not the real problem will be not to steer too much so as not to fall into some precipice, except in some easily passable asphalted city areas. Of course, it's not that the protagonists detach themselves too much from the stereotypes to which Hazzard had accustomed us: But Jackson is a rough and fat ~woman~, Bobbie Sue the classic beauty of the moment (and here the comparison with her cousin Daisy from the show is almost unavoidable), while the 3 sons are dirty ~gentlemen~ and apparently devoid of intelligence - at least Bo and Luke were cleaner -, and the trucks themselves reflect their personality, both from an aesthetic point of view and in terms of road characteristics. Technically Not bad, not bad really. Undoubtedly we are not on the highest graphic levels of the Playstation 2, which has accustomed us to above-average standards in recent productions, but the graphics of BMT are fairly accurate. The American countryside, the desert and the urban center are quite well done and make the atmosphere good, thanks also to the growing traffic and above all to the game engine which always maintains fluidity at excellent levels. Regarding the sound, however, there is a separate discussion: as in GTA3 and its sequel Vice City you will have the opportunity to listen to music by choosing from some local radio stations and, so far, nothing wrong, except that these radios mainly broadcast country songs, yes suitable for the situation but perhaps not within everyone's musical tastes... In a nutshell, therefore, we are faced with a product that also defends itself from a technical point of view, despite a sound that can be liked or dislike and a graphic style which, however discreet, always has that somewhat rough trait suitable for representing the characters and settings. The flaws One question arises: the game can be as fun as you like, but how long will it last in the hands of the average gamer? You won't finish it in a very short time, since getting to 60 days of work won't be like drinking a glass of water, but I don't think everyone wants to play it all over again just to try to use the other trucks and to customize the vehicles with some new logos in Ma Jackson's garage. In short, the only outlet from the main mode is made up of some special missions with tasks that will vary from simple demolitions to speed races which, although not the best, you could play even just to discover some secrets (maybe like unlocking Evil Bob, the bad guy of the situation), although I think you will leave them after a while. The last and perhaps most serious problem related to longevity is represented by the lack of a multiplayer mode of any kind, which could certainly have lengthened the duration of a game of this genre, even if structured in a simple form of timed racing. Comment What is BMT ultimately like? Not a bad game, that's clear, but still a title that stands apart from the average at leastnot by idea and that you will have difficulty mastering at first. Despite shortcomings in longevity, we believe it could prove to be a good purchase, perhaps more suitable for lovers of racing games, open-air races and ... of Hazzard. Pros: Not a bad idea Four different characters You love the setting Cons:  or you hate it It doesn't offer many variations on the technically not excellent theme Almost exclusively country music Get ready to live an unusual experience, driving trucks among stalls, motorcyclists and country music at full speed! Hick State County, an imaginary town located in the deep south of the States where this game takes place, made me think a lot about Hazzard County. Do you want this to still be a driving game, albeit a bit particular, but the paradoxical setting, situations and characters seem taken hand in hand with the famous television series, also set in the south of the USA, with races at high speed in semi-desert areas.
