This is what Games Workshop did by creating the Blood Bowl board game, later transformed into a video game by Cyanide: taking a modern and beloved game like American football and placing it within an already solidly structured fantasy context like that of Warhammer and the like , in order to apply the rules of this world to a sport that is also well codified and certainly enjoyable. However, it is not a simple football game with the players replaced by the typical races of the field in question, rather a reinterpretation of the basic concepts of American sport, transformed into a real strategic one in which, in any case, it is to conquer the ~goal~ and win a game, although everything in between is very different from what we are used to seeing on a playing field. The board game has met with great success especially in North America, while in our area it is less known and appreciated, also due to the distance that normally separates us from American football, however the conversion into a video game is quite faithful even with several flaws that they undermine its use. The time that has passed since the release of the PC version has obviously not been used to improve the problems of the original, which recur punctually with some further and inexplicable restrictions, in particular as regards the possibility of managing and customizing the team, while greater attention seems to have been placed in the Campaign, marginal improvement over the core of the gameplay. Not that it's a bad game, in fact the positive sides of the PC version remain, in particular as regards the playability and enjoyment of the multiplayer, but we are certainly far from a perfect product. Reduced multiplayer Part of the multiplayer component that characterizes the PC version has been lost in this Xbox 360 version. The online sector allows here to organize quick or customized matches but the persistent apparatus seen in the Windows edition is missing, where it was possible to transport one's own team, with all the modifications and evolutions made, directly in multiplayer matches, becoming part of continuously updated leagues, statistics and overall data on the online gaming community (although some of these are present, linked to the gamertag). A real shame considering that the construction and evolution of the team represents a cornerstone of the entire gaming experience. Stadium violence Blood Bowl offers several modes for the single game, useful, in the end, to train for the much more convincing multiplayer aspect of the title. Whether you play a points tournament or a ~friendly~ match, you immediately get a taste of the good work done by the developers to recreate the atmospheres of the original game: the three-dimensional models are typically fantasy and parodistic at the same time (it's a scene to see a paladin in armor running with a ball in his hand dodging a troll with a baseball cap), completely in line with the miniatures of the game, and the rules are reproduced with the utmost fidelity and respect for the paper ones, at least in the turn-based mode. Yes, because Blood Bowl is, first of all, a turn-based game: a suitably ~grid~ field and players like pawns, who are given a series of actions to undertake (throw the ball, tackle, run) to then kick off the turn to enjoy the unfolding action via a freely rotatable and zoomable camera to your liking. The tactics inherent in the game of football is obviously useful to the cause, as well as the physicality of the sport which here takes on the connotations of real fights to the death according to the classic trappings of the fantasy role-playing game, with the outcome of the chosen actions which depends on the usual mix between the level of the various player stats (strength, agility, armor power) and a real roll of the dice with modifiers and variables applied. The result of this mix is essentially a sort of chess game played on a football field, seasoned with a decisive dose of violence. There is also a brand new mode, in real time, which in theory should serve to bring those who don't know the tabletop original closer to the title: although the idea of eliminating grids and rounds in favor of direct player control (however manageable in an ~indirect~ way through the use of the cursor) is potentially good, the realization leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, especiallyall in dealing with an artificial intelligence that proves unable to produce a significant challenge to the player, with simplistic tactics that are limited to beating as many enemy players as possible without taking into account that the goal is to conquer the opponent's meta and not cover the ground of corpses while an opponent runs quietly towards the opposite side of the field with the ball in hand. Checks Blood Bowl was born as a strategic game and as such has an interface that is not exactly simple and immediate. All controls pass through a pointer, obviously a natural choice for a game that can be managed via the mouse, but always a bit cumbersome when you find a controller in your hands and this Cyanide title is no exception. However, the commands are not excessive in quantitative terms and a complex tutorial is particularly useful for learning them gradually, however those who do not have at least a little patience could find the approach to the game frustrating. The fantasy manager The game strategies do not only pass through the statistics of each individual player, but we must also consider the equipment that each of these brings to the field. The preparation of the team therefore becomes very similar to the deployment of an army in battle, and we thus realize that we are faced with a truly traditional strategic one, apart from the setting and the objectives to be completed. Winning matches means earning money, both for players and for non-canonical ~game tools~ such as studded gloves, armor and hooked brass knuckles. Of course, with such tools in the hands (and paws) of burly orcs, hardy dwarves, and hissing lizardmen, they can cause some pretty serious injury, if not death, to some unfortunate champion. Patience, death is an acceptable eventuality and the world is full of promising young Blood Bowl players. For those who survive, however, there is an excellent system of skill points that can be used to enhance the characteristics of stadium veterans, in order to better evolve the team, as well as various possibilities to improve performance by investing money in hiring staff members ( healers to restore the injured and supporters such as cheerleaders or gangs capable of dragging the public's favor and unlocking additional skills) or even bribing players and referees to ensure more chances of success. Note how it is not possible to create teams with players made up of mixed races, thus exploiting the different characteristics of each one, which could have given a certain additional strategic depth, instead it is necessary to choose a single race characterizing the entire team. There are also the various ~random events~ of the board game, established by the roll of a virtual dice at the bottom of the screen: turnovers, stumbles, throwing objects from the stands and even pitch invasions are common in Blood Bowl. Xbox 360 goals There are not many objectives present: 39 achievements for a total of 1000 points, with the consequence of rather rich average prizes. In general, the objectives are linked to game performance and the results to be achieved in the various modes and games to be faced, both single and multiplayer. The complete collection is however quite challenging. Lights at the San Siro Graphically and technically speaking, not much can be said about Blood Bowl: the stadiums are characterized in a rather apt way, whether they are dug into the depths of the mountains of the dwarves, obtained from the lustral jungle or built in the midst of human cities. The three-dimensional models, both of the players and of the public, maintain a good visibility of the whole, cartoony at the right point and goliardic as one would expect from a product of this kind, although at high zoom levels one notices a certain repetitiveness of the textures and a paucity of details that is no longer so widespread today. Compared to the PC version, which already didn't particularly shine in this respect, there are no improvements in the Xbox 360 version, which indeed presents a certain paucity in particular as regards the player models, further penalized by a lower possibility of personalizing the appearance and the incomprehensible forcing of the only two colors to be able to show off on the pitch: red and blue. If in a classic strategy game the detail is often penalized in comparison with a good overall impression, due to obvious visualization needs, in this case we are dealing with a sort of sportsman, so attention to the players had to probably be held in higher consideration.However, the animations of the characters are good, while those of the side figures such as the cheerleaders and off-screen musicians are a bit jerky and repetitive. A special mention goes to the referee goblin: big nose and ears, striped shirt, crooked hat and whistle: the true legend of this game. The background sounds are nice and the commentator's voices are excellent, characterized by a good choice of jokes and comments, unfortunately only dubbed in English.", "date": "2009-12-11", "grade": "6.7"}
