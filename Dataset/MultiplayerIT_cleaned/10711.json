{"name": "Planet Zoo: North America Animal Pack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/planet-zoo-north-america-animal-pack-recensione.html", "text": "There are DLCs, sometimes whole games (but this is not the case) that are crystal clear right from the title, that is, they are almost self-explanatory, so much so that any enthusiast already knows whether or not he will buy it even just by reading the name. In recent years Frontier Developments has created its own large niche in the market thanks to management software that allows for a very high level of customization and that always offers new contents, all of which are however extremely sincere in terms of exposure, ie in marketing. Let's take the DLC of this review: Planet Zoo: North America Animal Pack. Isn't it already clear what it has to offer, even just by reading its title? The contents Moose are very beautiful animals, even just to look at Yes, Planet Zoo: North America Animal Pack does exactly what it promises: it adds eight North American animals to the already rich collection of the game. In total there is one animal for display and there are seven for habitat, to use the language of Planet Zoo. Obviously, specific objects have also been added to recreate the best environmental conditions to host them in your parks, as it should be it. So if you look forward to handling and caring for moose, cougars, California seals, American beavers, prairie dogs, North American alligators, arctic foxes and bullfrogs, you simply cannot pass up this DLC. Obviously in terms of gameplay and game mechanics nothing is changed and Planet Zoo remains the same even after installing the package. In general, the operations to be performed are always the same: study the animal to understand its needs and then create an enclosure full of things that can make it happy. The more comfortable the animals are, the more they will behave in a way that pleases park visitors. Of course each animal has unique characteristics, such as the arctic fox which, as the name suggests, wants a very cold environment to express itself at its best, while moose, to give another example, prefer fresh and wooded environments more. As always, Frontier has reproduced the different animals in a perfect way, recreating their appearance, studying their animations and adding specific ones when necessary not only for movements, but also for interactions with the environment. The only other content added by the Planet Zoo: North America Animal Pack is a timed scenario, Jameson's Park. Basically imagine having to manage a kind of Yellowstone National Park in miniature, recovering it from ruin, expanding it and making it profitable for your pockets. Obviously the entire scenario is designed to let you take advantage of the animals and objects added with the DLC, in ways not unlike those seen with other packages and with the base game. It's certainly a great way to leverage your purchase right away and see all it has to offer. You will spend a few hours there, but it will be well spent. Planet Zoo - Update 1.7 The launch of the Planet Zoo: North America Animal Pack DLC corresponds to the launch of the free update 1.7, which affects all owners of the base game. Among the various features added, a couple of new mapping tools, which allow you to create custom heightmaps to alter the starting grounds. Also added pre-generated terrain types to use as a base, so you no longer have to start with flat terrain. Also added some animations for some animals, as well as a new way for visitors to interact with them. For all the news, read the announcement post on Steam. Conclusions Arctic foxes love intense cold The substance of Planet Zoo: North America Animal Pack is the one valid for every DLC of the genre: do you like these animals and their biomes? Then buy the package, because it is a valuable addition to your zoo that will give you the right satisfaction. If, on the other hand, they don't tell you much, forget it and look elsewhere. By now the packages available for Planet Zoo are many and you will surely find something that is right for you among the others available, if you are among those who still do not disdain to play it. If you are looking for revolutions, however, look elsewhere.", "date": "2021-10-04", "grade": null}
