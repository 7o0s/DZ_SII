Aside from the obvious difference in spirit between buying the real pack or buying and selling cards, old-time romance, and the cold entry of a password to make the transition on the App Store, the micro-transaction system can show up decidedly more sneaky than one might hope. This is precisely the main weak point of BattleHand, a game that could aspire to very different results and that in any case deserves attention at least for the evident production effort that characterizes it, but is strongly limited by an imbalance that becomes evident only after a few hours of game and essentially forces you to spend, to use a lot of patience or simply to give up everything. The combat mechanics itself is well studied, with the classic use of attack and defense cards that are associated with the different characters that can be used in the party and their peculiarities in terms of role in combat and special abilities. The hybrid nature between RPG and card game allows you to develop the experience in a double track, with the separate evolution of the characters and cards: the former are strengthened as the levels increase, with the possibility of enlisting new companions more and more strong by raising the level of fame of the protagonists, while the cards can be enhanced by applying modifiers. It is true that the continuous supply of cards is guaranteed by the completion of the various quests, therefore the presence of an always well-stocked deck is not a problem, but we soon reach a level where the need for new boosts cannot be covered by the amount of gold earned by simply advancing in the Campaign or with a regular rhythm of battles. So the solution becomes the grinding in case you don't want to spend on microtransactions, only that this eventuality collides with the timer (in this case represented by the number of keys in possession) which forces you to the classic forced waits between a game and the other, with a strongly counterproductive effect on the pace of the game and on the addictive tendency of successive clashes. The fusion of RPG and card game works great in BattleHand, if you are patient Fairy-tale fantasy Among the developers of BattleHand there are some former Fable authors and their background emerges in the characterization imparted to the game: it is a particular fairytale-style fantasy that proposes the classic fight of good against evil in a rather comic and ironic setting. with a truly high-profile 3D graphic system, even considering what is normally seen in this videogame genre. The main screen allows you to follow the Campaign, carrying out various quests in sequence, dedicating ourselves to managing parties and cards or launching ourselves into multiplayer battles but the first option is probably the one that attracts the most, also given the care placed in the construction of the universe of game. We therefore find ourselves facing various fights using cards that correspond to spells, physical attacks and defensive maneuvers, associated with the special abilities of the various characters. The mechanics of the clashes takes up the classic ~rock-paper-scissors~ style chain but expanding the possible combinations with five basic elements, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Also this setting forces to evolve and keep leveled each of the characters that are gradually added to the party, so as not to create dangerous imbalances only on some elements, and this is another point that pushes towards grinding or towards in-app purchases . After all, the clashes are enjoyable, with an intuitive system that allows you to see the characteristics of the various usable cards at any time and an interface that simply requires you to swipe the cards over your enemies or your fighters to bring about the expected effect. The story intrigues at first thanks to its rather lively and light-hearted tone, only to later turn out to be little more than a mere frame for the mechanics of the card game, as expected; however, it manages not to sound derivative. Despite some crashes detected during testing, the excellent construction of scenarios and characters, with original and well-animated models, complete the picture of a mature product built with great care, which suggests excellent potential for the Another Place in team ammobile bit.", "date": "2016-01-15", "grade": "7.5"}
