{"name": "Metal Gear Solid 2 Substance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-gear-solid-2-substance-4.html", "text": "Infinite Ammo Substance appears about a year after Sons of liberty, and the prerogatives are certainly not those of giving a real sequel to the public. Kojima declares that he wants to create what Metal Gear Solid 2, inevitably, could not be. The thought immediately turns to the ~VR Missions~ edition that appeared in the Playstation One era, an upgrade of missions launched to satiate the cravings of players waiting for an official sequel. And Subastance, in fact, differs very little from all of this. From an exclusively playful point of view, in fact, Substance is the same game that appeared a year ago, enriched with a package of special missions that see us impersonate both Raiden and Snake. Perhaps to please those who would have preferred to play Snake throughout the adventure, a section has been introduced where it is possible to revisit the crucial moments of Sons of liberty with his character. The special missions are to be repeated at levels of increasing difficulty, and to be tackled in a mode equivalent to the very hard level of Mgs2, ergo, as soon as an enemy notices our presence, the game over is inexorable. The missions, abundant in quantity, are undoubtedly also qualitatively valid, and the player's brains will inevitably have to be squeezed to be able to complete them all, with the possibility of unlocking further extras. A revision in the control of the sword, always entrusted to the L2 key, would have been welcome; the fact of having to repeat the same mission 10 times (not always) with only marginal variations of the scenario and objectives can also be criticized. But they are defects that remain marginal, so much so that the Extra section, although it cannot be considered a separate game, does its duty very well, also considering the presence of the 2nd DVD, The Document Of Metal Gear Solid 2, which allows review, without the aid of audio, all the cut scenes of the original, artworks and polygonal models of characters, mechs and weapons. If it hadn't been so long since what is considered at this point as the ~first~ release of Metal Gear Solid 2, one could say that the work done by Konami has been excellent. However, after the amazing trailers edited by Kojima himself, which foreshadowed big revelations on the essence of Sons of liberty, for a long time at the center of apocalyptic discussions on forums around the world, something more concrete was expected. The product, packaged in this way, reveals its metallic nature even more: the additional missions take place in the ambiguity of the digital VR environment, in the chromatic coldness of its gray walls, which well convey the idea of alienation in the contrast between reality and simulation of this unique training camp. The presence of the Snake's Tales and the possibility of reviewing each cut scene, then, confirm what is the idea on which the Metal Gear Solid 2 concept is based, that is to say that the player is virtually in the hands of a designer, whose figure is getting closer and closer to that of the film director, who can at any moment distort our perspective in that perfect system which is the video game itself. The core of Substance, however, remains the loved - hated Metal Gear Solid 2. And the additions made end up being just a brilliant gimmick, rather than a true manifesto of its substance. Control system Substance doesn't change an iota to the gameplay of Sons of liberty, which in turn changed very little to the unforgettable Metal Gear Solid. The movements are obviously regulated with the left analog stick, while the right stick is used for missions with the sword (both sticks, within the dialogues via codec, allow you to zoom / rotate on the faces of the protagonists of the conversation). X is used to crouch down and possibly crawl, or to perform an acrobatic somersault while running, while the circle corresponds to hand-to-hand combat. L2/R2 give access to equipment, and the square, selecting a weapon, is responsible for firing. With L1 you access a static subjective view in which it is also possible to hold a weapon and shoot with precision at the desired target; always L1 (in combination with the left analog stick) allows you to change the framing within the cut scenes. Technique Substance also inherits the graphics engine from Sons Of liberty. And despite the time that has passed, the graphic impact of the title remains of the highest order. The polygonal complexity of the ship's environments is probably not primato, and occasionally you notice a few ladders here and there. The textures help to give a particularly realistic look to the title, although effects such as bump mapping or mip mapping are not applied. What impresses favorably, in addition to the polygonal models of the characters and their animations, is above all the obsessive attention to detail, which reaches up to the hard posters hanging in the lockers of the tanker soldiers, which have now made history. The title is then dotted with splendid FMVs made with the graphics engine of the title, in which Kojima is wasted in references to the classics of action films made in Hollywood. The superlative music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams deserves a separate mention, more appreciable in the cut scenes thanks to the support of Dolby Digital Audio 5.1, for those with an adequate system. Dialogue dubbing available only in English, subtitled in somewhat limping Italian. Sin. On the other hand, it is impossible to complain about the conversion work from NTSC/JAP to PAL format: although the 50Hz/60Hz selector is missing, it must be said that the code has certainly been optimized for the European version, which is not affected by obvious differences for regarding the game speed compared to the other versions. Comment We would like to recommend Substance only to the few who have not yet bought Sons of liberty and to collectors, who will be able to enjoy a beautiful Special Edition. The upgrade of missions and extra content is not enough to justify the purchase of a title which, in essence, is the same as its predecessor. This does not mean that Substance is a mediocre game: Metal Gear Solid 2 remains in our opinion one of the most interesting games on the shelves, and for those who have a Playstation 2 it is an almost obligatory purchase. This new edition simply seems to us, so to speak, superfluous. Pros +Many extra missions +Graphically still impactful +It's Metal Gear Solid 2 Cons -It's still Metal Gear Solid 2 -The new missions remain a mere extra Directed by Hideo Kojima. Edited by Hideo Kojima. Phrases that appear and disappear quickly in the advertising trailers, between the end credits. Unnoticed, they flow. But they contain much of the meaning of the Metal Gear Solid ~project~: it is simply a very subjective and experimental interpretation of the videogame medium of this young game designer. With this in mind, we will therefore try to analyze Substance, which opens the saga to the doors of multiplatform.", "date": "2003-04-19", "grade": null}
