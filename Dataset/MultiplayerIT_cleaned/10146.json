Version tested: Nintendo Wii. The recovery of classic styles and structures of the videogame past are one of the most interesting operations that have been seen in conjunction with the flourishing of modern digital delivery on consoles. On the other hand, the recognition of its own historicity complete with the ostentation of the specific value of certain products of the past, which in a mass market such as the videogame one represent relatively recent phenomena, also seem to want to express an artistic identity of the videogame product . The 8-bit graphics, to say, is no longer understood simply as a clumsy representation of reality imposed by the technological limits of past years, but becomes a real style, which can be codified and therefore appreciable even today, which rises to a iconic status in a period in which we are now accustomed to very high quality graphics and an extremely advanced and realistic representation of game worlds. This re-evaluation procedure finds a perfect place in digital delivery channels, where the limiting impositions in terms of size for the software, as well as the need to offer a more immediate and less pompous type of entertainment than that required nowadays to be part of the normal retail circuit, they have created fertile ground for these products with a nostalgic flavor but with an always fresh gameplay, paradoxically new compared to what home consoles have accustomed us to for a few years now. Obviously, those publishers who can count on their own history that has its roots in the last two or three decades of the videogame industry and on a quantity of famous series that can afford to be revived in classic form are the masters. Particularly active in this field are therefore Konami - with its ~Rebirth~ of Castlevania, Contra and Gradius - and Capcom, which having failed to find a place for Mega Man in the current ~next gen~ market, has well decided to do so go back to basics and release this Mega Man 10 packaged as a perfect 8-bit NES product. A new case for Mega Man The operation carried out by Capcom for Mega Man 10 is much deeper than that characteristic of the remakes: in fact, it is not a simple re-adaptation of an already released chapter of the series with the introduction of some graphic filters to update its cosmetics, but of a real new episode, immersed in the spirit and graphics typical of the years between the 80s and 90s, the golden age of 2D action games. From the first minutes of the game we are immersed in nostalgic recollection, with a static screen presentation that illustrates the simple story that forms the backdrop to this new adventure of the blue cyborg. The mysterious ~Roboenza~ virus is spreading throughout the world, a strange disease that seems to affect only robots, first rendering them incapacitated and then hostile towards humanity. The latter, whose society is now completely founded on the support of loyal robotic collaborators for any activity, is faced with the collapse and then on the verge of a full-scale war against the dissident machines. Only a scientist has been able to develop a machine capable of synthesizing the medicine that can solve this huge crisis, but the pieces of it have been stolen by a series of evil robotic bosses. Clearly, it is up to Mega Man to defeat these enemies one by one and recover the precious artifacts capable of restoring order to the world. The structure is therefore the traditional one: a platform action game in which the protagonist (selectable between Mega Man and Proto Man) has the ability to shoot and jump as well as use objects and secondary weapons if necessary. The aim is essentially to reach the various bosses and then destroy them through particularly difficult battles. Each ~villain~ is preceded by its own well-characterized level, with specific setting and enemies, each of which can be tackled in the order that best suits us. For the nostalgic It is not only the aesthetics and the game structure that refer to the typical canons of 2D action, but the level design itself seems to have been taken directly from an NES cartridge. Accustomed to the soft start characteristic of modern videogame productions, we find ourselves bewildered in front of Mega Man 10: the levels are a continuous succession of threats and the margin of error allowed is very limited, with the energy bar falling quickly at the slightest hit , wrong jump or attack not well set up. A hardcore challenge, therefore, as they say, suitable for those with intfiction of seriously engaging with the pad, without lapses in concentration, like in the old days. It is therefore clear how Capcom's operation goes beyond a simple pixel art revival, configuring itself as a tribute but also a real worthy sequel to the main series of Mega Man, brought to the screens in 2010 perhaps with the only really valid and credible method. It is clear that the aesthetic aspect - speaking of graphics and sound - may not please everyone, being basically a tribute to the 2D tradition and therefore winking above all at those who have experienced the evolution of the genre. These will certainly appreciate the poetry of the outline squared by the pixel and of the synthetic/redundant music, which can instead leave those who were born as gamers in the middle of the polygonal period indifferent (if not grinning). However, there is no doubt that behind this game there was a genuine and loving work on the part of the developers, a production that denotes an artistic sensibility and a particular foresight. Longevity is not the best given the relative brevity of the various levels, but with the difficulty that characterizes the game and the presence of online rankings and downloadable additional content, as well as the possibility of facing the story with two different protagonists and the presence of extra modes like the ~Challenges~ there is enough material to keep busy those who intend to undergo a challenge of the past. On the other hand the price - 1000 Nintendo Points - is not prohibitive.", "date": "2010-03-16", "grade": "8.3"}
