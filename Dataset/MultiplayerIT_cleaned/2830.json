{"name": "War Robots", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/war-robots-recensione.html", "text": "The review of War Robots allows us to verify the characteristics of the remaster carried out by Pixonic for its mech-based competitive shooter, available for some years now on the App Store and Google Play Store. A very successful title, which with this technical renewal operation seems to have been able to relaunch itself also in the rankings of freemium productions, and which over time has received numerous updates aimed at optimizing its basic mechanics, still very simple now. Gameplay On the gameplay front, War Robots actually offers a tremendously immediate experience but with its own strategic depth, dictated by the differences between the robots that we will be able to use (divided into four classes) to launch into classic three-on-three matches or territorial. Terribly slow, these vehicles cannot escape the crossfire of their opponents, unless they find cover, take advantage of depressions or resort to extra maneuvers such as jumping, available however only in the lightest models.The first games therefore prove to be a real own walk of health, putting us in front of opponents even less experienced than us or more likely to bots that have the only function of not making the initial impact with the game too rough for us. Once you have unlocked at least three mechs and made the necessary upgrades, however, the situation changes and the difficulty increases significantly. Checks The touch controls of War Robots are almost perfect: a virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen allows you to move the robot, while tapping on the right side of the display allows you to rotate the view freely. Then there are the attack manoeuvres, delegated to some icons located at the bottom right of the interface: a generic button activates all the weapons, but if you want you can use only one and save the ammunition of the others, which are infinite but require times of quite long loading. Running out of bullets or missiles, together with the slowness of movement, makes us completely defenseless against any counterattacks. The lack of real evasive possibilities, however, soon reveals the strong incidence of pay to win elements: in a direct battle whoever owns the most powerful vehicle wins, and it is clear that by paying you can get more in less time. Freemium model Which leads us to discuss the freemium model adopted by Pixonic for War Robot, which at first appears fairly permissive and seems to give generously virtual and real credits, but at a certain point, especially when it is necessary to provide for the growth of several mechs at the same time, it changes quite clearly. At that point the rewards become narrow and winning matches becomes complicated, while at the same time the pop-ups that invite us to buy this or that package become more insistent. Of course, it is always possible to watch short advertising trailers to double the prizes at the end of each game, but continuing to play for free while also remaining competitive appears unlikely in the long run. Technical realization In terms of technical realization, the remaster has certainly improved some aspects of War Robot, but the game still looks like an open construction site. In fact, the 60 fps mode is not yet available, and in the same way the scenarios make use of some rather showy low-definition textures. The polygonal models of the mechs, on the other hand, are really excellent: from a design point of view they do not invent anything new, clearly inspired by classics such as Mech Warrior and everything that revolves around this vein, but they are detailed and well animated. On the other hand, the sound sector is decidedly subdued: the robots do not emit sounds when walking, which is absurd, and the effects in general could have been better.", "date": "2020-10-30", "grade": "7.0"}
