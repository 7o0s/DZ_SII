{"name": "LEGO Bionicle Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-bionicle-challenge_a.html", "text": "For the uninitiated, Bionicle is a LEGO series born in the second half of the 90s, dedicated to teenagers and characterized by dark tones and a more marked complexity than traditional bricks. The main protagonists are some kind of cyborg warriors, who this LEGO Bionicle Challenge puts into competition in a series of speed races aimed at establishing who is the bravest of the inhabitants of Mata Nui. There are only three selectable characters, responding to the imaginative names of Kualus, Nuparu and Matau and equipped with a different balance of firepower, armor and tank capacity parameters. However, the presence of only three contenders is the only criticism of a certain importance that it is possible to move towards the Kiloo product, in fact one of the best racing games currently in circulation on mobile phones. As we mentioned, the races take place on the beauty of fifteen tracks set in a handful of different scenarios, with the three warriors running floating in mid-air: however, the player cannot limit himself to managing their movement, but must constantly keep an eye on the energy and fuel gauges. The latter wears out progressively, and must be fleshed out by passing over the appropriate yellow boxes (while the red ones allow a temporary boost), while the armor level drops every time you hit an opponent or an element of the scenario, or even when you suffer an attack. Kualus, Nuparu and Matau are in fact all equipped with a standard shot, and can take advantage of special weapons scattered randomly along each track: not only that, the tracks are also teeming with disturbing elements such as laser beams or flamethrowers, to be avoided or used against enemies. As can be seen, the LEGO Bionicle Challenge offer is quite rich, and the game is above all very fun and exciting: whether in Single Race or Tournament mode, the races are always exciting, when not exactly ruthless at the highest levels of difficulty. The control system is then very simple and extremely functional, and the on-screen character moves with excellent response and precision. Graphically, then, LEGO Bionicle Challenge is a little jewel, equipped with colorful and detailed scenarios and characters with attention to the smallest detail, especially as regards the very fluid animations. Notes of merit also go to the elegant design of the menus, the decidedly cool look of the on-screen indicators and the good quality of the sound effects. If you want to nitpick, one could say that the Tournament mode of the title is not particularly deep, but the sheer fun that comes from the races soon makes such a gap forget. PRO Fun and exciting High level of challenge Technically very good AGAINST Not overly long-lived Tournament mode a little superficial", "date": "2007-08-04", "grade": "S.V."}
