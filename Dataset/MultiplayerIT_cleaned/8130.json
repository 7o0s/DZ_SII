Impossible not to be tempted by the soft tones, the appropriate use of complementary colors, the stylization of the protagonist. All sensations that are reflected once the game has started: menus, characters and settings are the result of a commendable stylistic unity, which can only arise from a clear aesthetic vision of the whole. Everything is geometrized and segmented, from the trees to the protagonist, as if they were animated origami; the pastel colors, on the other hand, with little nuances, reinvigorate each other through valuable combinations. From that point of view there's really nothing wrong with it, it's one of the best looking games to see on WiiU, even if it doesn't put any strain on the hardware, and shows that since And yet it moves the Broken Rules, game developers, have made huge strides forward. The movements of the protagonists, anthropomorphic birds, are up to the rest: elegant and essential, graceful. And they are not simple animations to create, neither in a film nor, let alone, in a video game. Simply wonderful. In the blue painted blue The most surprising aspect however is the control system, truly majestic, and even more astonishing considering the small size, and limited funds, of the development team. It is not at all easy to realistically recreate the flight of animals, and in fact, few video games are notable from this point of view. Recently there has been the excellent example of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, but it is a three-dimensional title, more cartoonish (even in the movements), and with two notable differences: the use of the Wiimote, the ideal peripheral to this end, and the boast of being the most expensive Nintendo project in history. In a certain sense, Chasing Aurora manages to overcome the EAD gem in this area: it combines realism and simplicity of the control system like perhaps none before, relying on only three keys and, above all, on a top quality physics engine, at least in management of air currents. Thus the protagonists throw themselves into dives, glides, climbs and descents with the help of the simple analog stick, whose inclinations are masterfully poured onto the screen. To assist everything the right back, which favors the dives, and if desired also the left one, which helps to brake, but which can also be ignored. The doubt that these two buttons have been inserted by mere convention is legitimate, and the fact that (almost) all movements can be managed through the analog stick alone is another point in favor of the control system. The only essential button is A, which is used to flap the wings, and to take off after a break. Here too the mechanics have been managed with wisdom: pressing it repeatedly is almost useless, you have to adapt to the gusts of wind and the thrust received. The game Well, after so many compliments you may be wondering why such a low rating. The point is that all this, for the game that is Chasing Aurora, seems almost wasted: perhaps an experimental address would have been more welcome and suitable, perhaps some ~ambient~ glides between plains and woods, with Brian Eno-like music in the background - like the trailer of the rest hinted. And instead it is a sui generis arcade racing, but still traditional in its setting, in which the search for the record is fundamental. About twenty circuits of increasing difficulty, between woods and snow-capped mountains, in which you have to follow a track, without losing the intermediate gates, accumulating points, time and speed. When you enter the ~loop~ everything is quite fun, but the feeling that this work is harnessed by playful mechanics, and not exalted, never disappears. There are two quite incomprehensible decisions: the first is the absence of a score to reach to unlock the next area, given that you go from level to level at the simple end of time, even offering a bad performance. The second is the lack of an online ranking, essential for such a title, in which the score is everything: it seems that, at least this last part, will be resolved by a forthcoming patch. The multiplayer, touted as the core of the game, is actually not exciting: it is focused on the relationship between Gamepad and Wiimote, but the various modes are not exceptional. Hide and Seek is not very intuitive (it is too difficult to find the hidden character), and the most interesting section is certainly the ~hunting~ one, in which one of the birds, frozen, must reach and frost the others, simply by touching them. In their defence, the latter can free themselves, sfipraying to each other. Although this mode doesn't enhance the control system or the untapped potential of Chasing Aurora, it certainly guarantees a more frenetic and addictive experience than the others. To conclude, two other sore points, namely the almost non-existent musical accompaniment (relying only on sound effects would have made much more sense in an experimental game, we repeat), and the characters, who are beautiful and varied to look at, but excessively similar pads in hand.", "date": "2012-12-07", "grade": "6.5"}
