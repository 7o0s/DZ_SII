There wouldn't even be anything wrong, if it weren't for the fact that it has been happening a little too often for some time now, and then it becomes difficult to distinguish passionately developed, genuinely old-fashioned titles from those that follow fashion and have no clear how to balance the plunge into the past with the needs of the present. Citizens of Earth is a bit in the middle: the developer Eden Industries proposes his vision of an old-fashioned RPG by placing it in a modern context both in appearance and in narrative. The result is an imperfect title, but certainly hilarious. Citizens of Earth is a fun RPG but also a little too vintage in many respects Earthlings are easy Citizens of Earth's story would have been interesting too, if Eden Industries hadn't failed to script it properly. The problem, more than anything else, is precisely our alter ego, the vice president of the world: he is the absolute protagonist, recently elected and already forced to deal with what appears to be a conspiracy on a global scale. At the center of it all is the chain of bars Moonbucks and its ~house specialty~ which apparently is driving the whole world crazy, and in every sense, turning people and animals into mutant monsters. Our task, obviously, will be to get to the bottom of the matter and find those responsible for this chaos in order to bring them to justice. Unfortunately, however, the adventure rests almost entirely on the shoulders of the vice president: as a good head of state, he is always the one to conduct the dialogues and interact with the various characters, while the supporting actors, chosen by the player, have just a few generic jokes and zero personality. As a result, the story soon loses weight, supported for about twenty hours only by shrewd jokes and not too veiled satire. In this respect, Eden Industries has done a great job, ridiculing the clichs of politics and pop culture with quotes from movies, music, comics and video games: the vice president himself is practically a speck, a puppet / puppeteer who does not even fight personally, delegating every effort to his followers. The parodistic style of Citizens of Earth, on the other hand, is underlined by a cartoonish and very colorful graphic design: the sprites, funny specks, have been well animated, and the artistic direction needless to say marks the hand on their preponderant characteristics so that , despite their anonymity, appear immediately recognizable and distinct. It is a pity that various technical problems afflict the Eden Industries title, between too long and freeze loads, glitches of the nice soundtrack and decidedly not very intuitive menus. The worst thing, then, is the layout of the maps: detailed and vast, they are a real hell to explore since the minimap is almost useless and the player is left to himself at the mercy of clues and suggestions that defining vague is an understatement. Vice President Quest Even the special abilities of some followers fail to alleviate the harsh reality of exploration, not when our team wanders around a map full of enemies who run at us as soon as they see us. The fact that Citizens of Earth does not include the unpleasant random encounters does not make the density of monsters that fills each area and which interrupts our loitering with insistent frequency less frustrating and questionable. The fights, however, soon prove to be fast, fun and well structured. As we said, the vice president does not fight, and limits himself to commenting on the actions of our group and enemies as a battle log: each battle develops in turns, and Dragon Quest fans will immediately recognize the primary source of inspiration for Eden Industries. Fortunately, the developer has also put his own into it, developing a rather ingenious combat system: each character has a generous set of skills that generate or consume points and it is up to the player to balance their use between upgrades, depowering and attacks. The weakness system, however, is reminiscent of that of the Shin Megami Tensei: using an attack that exploits an enemy's vulnerability not only deals more damage, but also immediately regenerates an energy point. The same obviously applies to enemies, which will lead us to compose the party according to the appropriate schemes and synergies. The vice president can recruit about forty followers: some will joinyear to his cause of their own free will, others will have to be convinced by completing side missions or playing mini-games. The winning features of Citizens of Earth are certainly the variety of usable characters and the impressive number of skills they can employ, all perfectly themed: the athlete can power up before hitting, the pastry chef takes care of the group with his sweets, and so on saying. Some of them can also use their peculiar abilities outside of the clashes, with the pilot who can transport us from one map to another, for example, or the driver who can shuttle us faster through the various areas. In the end, recruiting and trying them all, even if they were pokmon, turns out to be the most fun aspect of the game, and the main incentive to complete it.", "date": "2015-02-03", "grade": "7.0"}
