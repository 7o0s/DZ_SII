{"name": "Nickelodeon: Tennis Estremo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nickelodeon-tennis-estremo-recensione.html", "text": "The arcade sports formula has gotten a bit lost in the mists of late, at least for those games that once had a permanent presence in console lineups like tennis, golf and the like, except of course for Nintendo's platforms. This title by Old Skull Games clearly looks to Mario Tennis, which also does a good job of imitating an excellent paradigm, as we see in this review of Nickelodeon: Extreme Tennis, released exclusively on Apple Arcade. Nickelodeon licenses have already been exploited for other titles released on Apple's subscription service, as we saw in the review of SpongeBob: Assault on the Patty, but perhaps never as thoroughly and in an interesting way as in this case, putting together a great number of characters from different series and making them collide in a tennis-based cross-over. The concept is very similar to that of Mario Tennis Aces, as well as the previous Nintendo series: it is a profoundly arcade reinterpretation of tennis, in which the basic principles of the sport in question are enriched by the use of special shots, bonuses and moves very unrealistic but able to stage very spectacular and fun matches. Furthermore, all characterized by the presence of characters taken from various Nickelodeon series such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, Hey Arnold, Garfield, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Rugrats and others, which adds important characterizations to the characters, each equipped with appropriate specific abilities that can be used as special moves once the baseline bars are charged and power-ups are collected. It's all decidedly less balanced and reasoned than the gameplay of Mario Tennis, but the charisma of the characters may be enough to attract the young audience, while the undeniable fun that comes from the classic mechanics of tennis can still appeal to everyone. Gameplay: cartoon tennis Spongebob and others compete in Nickelodeon: Extreme Tennis The game plays exactly as expected from the tennis games canon, with the basic gameplay obviously requiring you to win matches according to the general rules of the sport, but with the matches playing out in an absolutely insane way. On the other hand, we are dealing with matches between Spongebob and Michelangelo of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, just to give an example, it is very difficult to expect an accurate and realistic simulation. In short, it is a pure arcade, which simplifies the mechanics of the sport by limiting itself to requiring you to hit the ball with the right timing and give it a direction, focusing heavily on the use of special techniques to displace your opponents. It's all too simple: the limited amount of standard shots doesn't allow you to develop great strategies, with the pace of the game always remaining rather slow and weighed down by a certain cumbersomeness in the movements, but fortunately the special techniques manage to revive a little the action. Beyond the standard controls, which simply allow you to move around the field and hit the ball giving it minimal effect, these special moves for each character intervene to expand the possibilities of attack and defense: a bar that is charged simply by responding to the shots of the opponent allows you to make shots that immediately move us to the best position to launch an attack, but loaded to the maximum it unleashes the character's definitive move, which obviously varies depending on this (Spongebob creates a hamburger and throws it forcefully against the opponent , for example, or Michelangelo summons his companions to launch a deadly attack). In addition to these specific techniques, there is the possibility of activating additional power-ups by hitting question marks or other targets that appear on the field, applying extra effects to the ball or additional noise elements, all of which work well to add some variety to basic mechanics. Characters and evolutions The initial cast of Nickelodeon: Extreme Tennis There is also a certain evolution applied to the characters: by winning matches and completing the required objectives - which range from defeating opponents to using certain techniques or achieving particular performances - we can obtain new costumes and rackets but also real progress that accumulates as levels progress, increasing the players' base stats as well as new special techniques. In this way, the game also offers sensible incentives in the single player, since it leads us to a constant progression of the characters, while not witnessing a real story in the modein question. The initial cast includes 10 characters, but considering the amount of Nickelodeon series it can draw on, it is easy to expect a significant increase in the near future. From a technical point of view, Extreme Tennis Nickelodeon faces the same problems that characterize all productions of this type : having to put together a mixed cross-over that ranges between decidedly different series, it is necessary to find a sort of meeting point, in stylistic terms, in the graphic representation of characters and settings. In this respect, the graphics of Old Skull Games have done a good job, given that there is a good cohesion in the representation of the various tennis players without losing their original characteristics too much, even if certainly there are characters who came out better than others . Likewise, the settings are clean and interesting, ranging between decidedly different atmospheres and situations in order to always offer a certain incentive to continue.", "date": "2022-01-30", "grade": "6.8"}
