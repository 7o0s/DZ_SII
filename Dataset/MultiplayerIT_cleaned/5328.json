Their answer was Far Harbor, a DLC that - in addition to offering a new and extensive area to explore - managed the player's choices on a gray scale, abandoning the obvious solutions in favor of characters on the fine line between immorality and justice . After this exploit, however, the Fallout 4 community has only seen a mass of objects dedicated to the game's crafting system arriving, getting angry due to the absence of new enjoyable storylines and content capable of concretely improving the experience. Perhaps it is also for this general lowering of expectations that Nuka-World has not made much noise: it seemed to be a light-hearted and fun DLC, unable to offer the same emotions as the misty lands of its predecessor. Yet Bethesda has decided to keep the best for the finale, and to surprise everyone with an extra that doesn't care about the gray scales to offer the blackest black. Gentlemen, if you were rooting for Toecutter and Lord Humungus while watching Mad Max, this could be the expansion for you. The Nuka-World amusement park is only open for very bad people. Our review! You're a Raider now. Have fun Your alter ego's new adventure begins in a rather classic way: wandering around the Commonwealth you will hear a radio signal coming from Nuka-World, a gigantic amusement park founded by the inventor of Nuka-Cola which, in theory, should be uninhabited and in ruins . Approaching the shuttle station for the park, you will discover instead that Nuka-World is not only still very active, but that the ~management~ of its attractions is now the responsibility of some extremely dangerous gangs of raiders, who occasionally satiate their thirst for blood thanks to an event called ~Gauntlet~ during which the hapless visitors are killed in a path full of traps. For you, however, at this point, mines and turrets should be trifles; you will therefore find yourself challenging the fearsome gang leader and his armor in an arena, aided only by the advice of the mysterious Gage. And right here the surprises will begin: Gage is in fact the ~second~ of the boss, whose role will be kindly offered to you after his inevitable departure. You will therefore suddenly become the leader of three groups of raiders - each with their own customs and preferences - and you will have to complete a delicate operation to reconquer the areas of the park that the previous boss had not been able to recover. And there is no redemption in these teams of criminals, although you are still given the opportunity to contain their raids: they are madmen forged in blood and cruelty, aiming for enrichment or simple entertainment in the form of massacres and violence free. A nice change of perspective from the role of post-apocalyptic hero that many gamers like to play. Not a park like the others The position of ~baddest leader in the Commonwealth~ is undoubtedly a great prospect, but achieving it will not exactly be a walk in the park. In fact, Nuka-World not only offers an outlet for lovers of evil characters, but also one of the most complicated and extensive maps in the entire Bethesda title. Just think, there are even five areas to be reconquered, all unique and equipped with some internal storyline capable of making them interesting. They range from the simple reproduction of a western town invaded by giant worms, to a Ghoul-infested mini-park for children, where you will find a very particular landlord waiting for you. Let's avoid giving you any more spoilers, also because there are amusing quotes and really curious characters in this DLC; you just know that it will take you a long time to clean up all parts of Nuka-World from the various threats and later you will have to assign the conquered areas to the various gangs, being careful not to excessively favor a single one (or you could risk some revolt). Here also takes over the characterization of the raiders, who are finally not just cannon fodder, but characters with motivations - however infamous - and desires, despite being forced to be companions in a place that practically represents an impregnable fortress in the shattered world of Fallout. There's even another faction in the DLC, but it mostly felt like a piss off of a well-known religious sect and not a group you're pressured to collaborate with. Ah, the Nuka Park neighborhoods contain some of the most sadistic dungeons and most dangerous adversaries seen in Fallout 4, for those interestedto the pure playful aspect of the expansion. Monsters for the whole family On the other hand, it is useless to go around too much: the shootings in Fallout 4 are not exactly a marvel and Nuka-World can do nothing to make the game control system less wooden. The developers have therefore opted for another solution, which revolves completely around enemies and threats. In fact, in the game you will not only find yourself faced with large maps full of traps, but also enemies taken by weight from Automatron - far more varied than normal enemies and therefore vehemently reused - and new monstrosities never seen before, which add interesting twists to opponents seen before (like really aggressive mutant Deathclaws). Together with them, the DLC also contains numerous new objects and weapons including very special tools, new companions, direct links to the previous Fallout (to be exact, a questline linked to a specific character) and the usual inevitable plethora of objects for the crafting. None of these additions are the real icing on the cake though. The best gem of Nuka-World is in fact what happens after having brought all the gangs together and reconquered the entire playground; a particular event that allows you to completely change the balance of power in the entire Commonwealth. Many will have already guessed what we are talking about, but let's avoid going into detail, again so as not to spoil the twist. Just remember that... being bad sometimes gives great satisfaction.", "date": "2016-08-30", "grade": "8.2"}
