Tachyon Project, making its debut on PlayStation 4 after its debut on PC and Xbox One, takes up these mechanics but also the visual style close to the wireframe, while confining the action to a specific space instead of spacing wherever possible, which often leads to unpleasant appearance of opponents in our same position. We can therefore speak of a ~reduced~ version of the Lucid Games title, which also attempts the card of an accompanying plot accompanying a single player campaign consisting of ten levels organized in waves, which unfortunately is completed within three hours and without great difficulty. Tachyon Project is a ~compact~ twin stick shooter, with some good ideas but a bit too short We are Tachyon The ship that we see on the screen is actually a kind of computer virus, and the numerous enemies it has to face represent the defenses of various infrastructures that the protagonist of the game, a cunning hacker, has the task of violating to discover the truth about what is happened. Told by captions, the Tachyon Project plot appears completely irrelevant to the shooter experience itself, which in the advanced stages offers a good level of challenge but starts decidedly downhill, alternating fairly simple and banal missions. In practice, it is necessary from time to time to destroy a certain number of a specific type of opponents or to survive for a certain number of seconds, but we did not appreciate the fact that these indications continuously break the rhythm of the action. The score counter takes consecutive eliminations into account, with a good combo system, and it is interesting to note that there is no vital energy to look after, but time management that is influenced by our successes or by the damage that we eventually we suffer, until game over. There is certainly a good variety of hostile units: from various types of mines to enemies that move quickly in our direction, from armored opponents to particularly fire-resistant ~dragons~, and so on. There's no shortage of bosses either, which present the greatest degree of challenge, especially the last one, but they don't shine at all for their design. Playstation 4 trophies The fifteen Tachyon Project Trophies can be obtained by completing missions based solely on numbers, in this case destroying ever greater numbers of enemies and doing so using specific weapons. Shoot and spin The Tachyon Project control system naturally uses the two analog sticks, but also the controller's back buttons, responsible for activating two special weapons that can be selected from the menus between one mission and another, and which are unlocked gradually that we proceed in the countryside. A total of seven slots must be managed, between main weapons and passive skills, which allow our virus to move faster, resist a greater number of blows and attack using machine guns, missiles, lasers and small smart bombs. The latter represent the initial endowment, but in the end they prove to be the most useful tools to be able to pass the levels without too many problems. Having to undergo a simple cool down, it is enough to activate the bombs when the enemies get too close to clean up the area immediately surrounding the ship. Once the story mode is completed, a New Game + is unlocked which allows you to replay the levels at a higher difficulty but with the perks unlocked, in case you want to make a new round. From a technical point of view, as mentioned at the beginning, the Eclipse Games title is clearly inspired by Geometry Wars, but with decidedly lower ambitions and even some slowdowns during the most agitated phases: considering the quality of the graphics, not a splendid thing to be seen. The techno-style musical accompaniment, pleasant at first, turns out to be a bit too repetitive.", "date": "2016-01-31", "grade": "6.5"}
