{"name": "True Crime: Streets of L.A.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/true-crime-streets-of-la-4.html", "text": "True Crime: Streets of LC... The first time I sat down in front of TC it reminded me of the old Die Hard Trilogy that appeared on PlayStation about a century ago, maybe because of those traffic lights and those yellow taxis scattered everywhere, maybe because of the sensation it gave me on my skin, but I really couldn't compare it to more recent games from which it impartially takes much more substantial cues. Yet it is impossible to distance yourself from GTA, and its many lovers will have something to rejoice; yes, because playing the Activision title the effort made by the programmers in an attempt to ~allow us to be able to do everything that we are allowed to do in GTA~ is damn palpable. Mom, how bad this speech is: it is true, for the form and above all for the content, but although TC boasts a storyline that would have united it decidedly more with a title like The Getaway than with the much-quoted GTA, it is clear that it was thought to make a further effort to create a conceptually ~dual~ product. An on-screen map will delimit the spaces in your immediate vicinity: on it a green arrow will inform you of the direction you will have to follow to continue the storyboard; as you approach your objective you will intercept various police communications that will signal the presence of crimes committed in this or that street and immediately a red arrow will be added to the on-screen map. Following the red arrow, which will not have the slightest impact on the unfolding of the plot, you will play GTA, following the green one you will instead reach a building, Nick will enter it and the game will now transform into Max Payne, now into a Metal Gear Solid stealth. now in a multi-directional scrolling beat'em-up as needed. This is CT. Following the red arrow, the gameplay is absolutely free: it is a clear concession made to align the product with GTA given that under the pretext of solving a crime you will be called upon to commit several dozen, perhaps much more serious from a legal point of view than the same infringement on which you were invited to participate. You will basically find yourself faced with two types of criminals: the one on foot and the one on board a car. In the first case, you'll chase him in pure Yankee style, shouldering passers-by and throwing yourself into John Madden-like tackles, in the second, you'll first have to destroy his car by shooting at him and hitting him with yours: once you reach the criminal, you can handcuff him immediately, beat him until he he will fall to the ground or still choose to execute him on the spot with a nice cannon shot in the face in bullet time mode; in any case the writing ~Congratulations, crime solved~ will make its appearance, even if together with him you will have decided to eliminate a dozen civilians, perhaps out of pure whim or just because they were passing by. I know, this leaves you dumbfounded, because following the green arrow instead opens a ~parallel~ game with a completely dissimilar feeling. The detachment is sharp, dry, burnt: Nick is a criminal for half of the game and the good Samaritan with the usual sad story behind him for the other, and it is the dual approach dictated by Activision that makes him wear these dirty laundry now, now the others immaculate. Just ridiculous. A real conceptual coarseness committed with his pants down in front of the Rockstar megahit. True driving, true fighting, true shooting... Yes, because I was also fond of Nick. I repeat that however conventional and standardized it was, the detective story with its beautiful smattering of martial arts was really nice, also thanks to a narrative line imbued with cut-scenes of simply delicious quality above all by virtue of massive routines that animate the characters with movements that are nothing short of ~natural~. Following the infamous green arrow, the game leads us to precise buildings in which Nick now finds himself playing Max Payne, with virtually identical playful contents, now facing stages in pure stealth tradition, albeit not too deep to say the least all (creep behind the enemy, stun him, continue), now sessions that strongly recall the mega brawls of Ryo Hazuky in Shen Mue. The most curious fact is that the guys at Luxoflux have decided to allow the user to be able to implement the driving, fighting and shooting characteristics of their alter-ego, through a system of skills in all respects identical to those of the RPG classic. For example, the city is full of dojos where you can hone your martial arts, shooting ranges where you can adjust your aim, but also pharmacies where you canrecover energy and even workshops or simple petrol stations where we can repair the battered vehicle in our possession. In an attempt to vary the driving sessions, some have been included that will force you to reach a certain building within a time limit, while others will be real stalking missions, a classic of the stars and stripes filmography from which you can draw hands: too close to the suspect's car and he will discover you, too far away and you will lose sight of him, really good intuition. The level of interaction with the scenarios really deserves a separate word. Both during the driving sessions and in those inside the buildings, you will be able to interact with practically every single polygon that makes up the digital Los Angeles set up by Luxoflux: the most surprising thing is the interaction with the backgrounds of the various interiors and some scenes will forcefully bring to mind the opening bars of the recent Kill Bill or the apocalyptic shooting of the first The Matrix during which entire portions of granite columns were dismembered by the disruptive fury of a veritable hail of bullets of all calibres. Forgive what may appear as a naive enthusiasm, but all this really seems to have some cathartic value. I close with the sound front: 50 original songs by a plethora of more or less famous artists in the States give life to the nauseating rapping soundtrack, perhaps perfect for running around in the suburbs of the city of angels, but which in the long run really put me on the ropes. True driving, true fighting, true shooting... Comment Masterpiece with a thousand faces or bland meatloaf? Well, the unfortunate aftertaste of American tackiness never ceases to be felt, undoubtedly thanks to that miserable choice of the dual approach on which I have dwelled sufficiently, and which will nip the enthusiasm of the most pretentious in the bud. Not to mention GTA, we tried to carry on the development of the title by really keeping our foot in both shoes, out of complacency we tried to literally throw everything into the cauldron, without the slightest foresight, to the point that we can't even accuse of plagiarism LuxoFlux would be so many names to have to bother. And it's not even here that TC collapses as much as in the excessive repetitiveness of its playful topics which, however varied they may seem in terms of ~typologies~ are really always the same in terms of ~contents~. However, I would recommend it to those who simply want to spend a few carefree hours in the company of a good action/multi-event considering that its structure lends itself particularly well to the hit and run experience. Lovers of games with considerable ~freedom~ of action/movement are called to a dutiful test session. Pros: Game area with more unique than rare dimensions The freedom granted to us is remarkable, such as the interaction with the background Three games for the price of one Cons: None of the three games is particularly fun Missions that are too repetitive Ill-concealed conceptual coarseness I like that guy because... ~Who is that annoying young man with the crackling Vespa who disturbs my public peace?~, you said it foolish, Nick Kang is the Activision counterpart of that Gran Steal Auto that rages in Liberty City: counterpart & competitor, opposite & contrasted in all the way to the DMA/Rockstar anti-hero, since that super-young Nick is none other than a cop. Take Keanu Reeves and the Tanzen, blend them and let them rest in the fridge for five minutes; now, Ryo Hazuki, kindly take off your clothes and put them on the table... That's good; we're going to put them on the compound that I'm going to take you out of the refrigerator and, taa-daa, here's our Nick. Something is missing. Yes, a characterization. Let me think... Oriental traits, martial arts expert, ex-cop, quick wit, no stand-ins: I'm here, Jackie Chan! Well now you really have a far from vague idea of who he is and how he is the star of the latest Luxoflux production for the Activision label. Well, without going too far, hats off to the guys at Luxoflux because the digital transposition of Los Angeles represents the most extensive, longest, widest, thickest and fattest polygonal construction I've ever encountered in my life as a gamer, and it's not short. I swear that more than once I said to myself, ~Enough, now I'll do the whole city from one end to the other!~, nothing, it's impossible, it would take hours and the absurd thing is that all this happens without putting your big nose in front of your albeit minimal loading: simply abnorme! From the beaches of Venice and Santa Monica to the Hollywood hills, from Chinatown to Beverly Hills and Bel Air, for the beauty of 250 square miles of totally walkable and, what matters most to us, totally interactive play area. In order not to underline too much how much the city of angels is literally teeming with inhabitants, in order not to spread incense yet on a decidedly solid frame rate and clipping at historic lows obviously looking at this kind of productions, in order not to linger on the habit of reflections shot even in real time from the windshields of the most disparate cars that we will find under our butts: TC concretely boasts an engine that is not there to save the resources of our next generation consoles as too often, alas, it happens and we thank you...", "date": "2003-12-11", "grade": null}
