We suspect that much of the appreciation comes from the incredibly droopy eyes of the cows, which we think are impossible to resist. Apart from this essential factor, however, there are many, and much more serious, reasons why Country Life is an extremely important expansion in the history of The Sims 4, not only because it introduces elements loved and requested by the public but above all because it reflects more than any other expansion pack the historical moment in which it was developed. We had already talked about the new mechanics introduced by the expansion in our test, so in this review of The Sims 4: Country Life we will focus on the aspects that convinced us most about this additional content. Lakes and ponds Ok, after the eyes of the cows, ponds will seem like another minor element but the Sims players know how false this statement is, since ponds and lakes were really highly anticipated. This new lot-building tool comes with good and bad news: the bad news is that our Sims won't be able to swim in the ponds we're building. The reason, and we come to the good news, is to be found in the extreme freedom of customization of the ponds, which is not reconciled with a complex activity such as swimming. We wanted to give players maximum flexibility in customizing the look and shape of their ponds. Because of this, Sims won't be able to swim in them. However, we wanted to make sure there was fun gameplay associated with ponds. You can find Sims splashing around the edges of ponds, catching fish you have stored in the pond, and decorating the pond with new items, Maxis developer Antonio Romeo reports on Twitter. To mitigate this, however, there are numerous points in the county of Henford-on-Bagley, a new district added with Living in the Country, in which our Sims can splash around. The addition of fish in the pond is important, but they cannot be introduced instantly. To add fish to a pond, our Sims must have already cataloged the various fish species, at which point there are two different ways. The first is that of experience: by fishing everywhere, the Sims will increase their fishing skills and knowledge of the fish fauna: once we have caught a specimen of each species, we will be able to add it to our home pond. This also applies to the more tropical types of fish that can be found in the various Sims 4 expansions, such as Island Living. The second way is that of money: by going to a shop or using the home shopping option via the telephone, we will be able to fill our pockets with fish and then empty them into our pond. Cottagecore A small country living cottage If you're a fan of architecture and design magazines, or an avid Pinterest-goer, you'll know that Cottagecore style went wild last year and continues to gain some traction. Cottagecore, or Aesthetic Cottagecore, is a design and lifestyle trend inspired by a quaint take on country life. Based on an idealized concept of back to nature and simpler times, her aesthetic focuses on natural materials, wholesome pastimes, handmade crafts, home-baked goods, gardening and other hallmarks of bucolic domesticity. In summary: Life in the Countryside. We had somewhat criticized the choice of such a specific style, which may not be to everyone's liking. It must be said that the furnishings inserted and all the construction options are very nice and extremely ~instagrammable~, as if they had come out of an Influencer's social page: the wooden counters, a Smeg-style refrigerator in pastel tones, floors and natural stone walls that give a rustic but at the same time refined effect if combined with the right design solutions. However, what is extremely appreciable, as also mentioned in the preview phase, is that the choice not to include any freelance profession linked to rural life: any Sim can move to the countryside, grow vegetables and raise animals, without having to undertake a career as a farmer or breeder. However, the lack of a career will not make our Sims starve, they will be able to live on what nature offers, fully embracing the Cottagecore lifestyle. The interpretation of the Country Living theme is extremely focused both aesthetically and philosophically, although it adapts to the slightly crazy standards of The Sims, with rainbow-colored llamas and rabbits dressed in waistcoats and bow ties. Reflectwas the reality An open-air lunch It is no coincidence that the Cottagecore style has been so on the crest of the wave in this two-year period 2020/2021 and the motivation must obviously be sought in the global situation that we have all experienced. Country Life, like Ecological Life some time ago, mirrors the period in which the expansion was developed. The pandemic, and the quarantines that followed, have changed our relationship with living spaces a lot, so much so that for many their homes have turned into a sort of prison. From this point of view, Vita in Campagna not only proposes a very comforting theme but manages to make the concept of solitude romantic. A simple life, without the stress of smart working, of dividing PCs at home to be able to work and study, live with one's family in a home where no one invades other people's space and being together is a choice and not a constraint. A simple and stress-free life is what our Sims will have Country life envelops the need for social distancing in a warm patchwork blanket steeped in romance, giving away a virtual mirage that many have longed for and perhaps still desire. But the dream of a bucolic life punctuated by milkings and homemade bread is also a warning and not just a chance to escape: Country Life invites us to take back our spaces, to dedicate ourselves to simple things, rediscovering ourselves in healthy activities and pleasant: a picnic with the family, a walk in nature, maybe gardening and if you don't have a green thumb, a beer in the pub with friends will do just fine. This expansion pack of The Sims 4 is important not only because it offers relaxing and soul-healthy game mechanics, but above all because it reminds us how important it is to feed our soul. After all, the slogan reads: ~Feed your spirit (and your chickens!)~.", "date": "2021-08-01", "grade": null}
