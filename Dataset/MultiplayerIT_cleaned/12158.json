{"name": "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-recensione.html", "text": "Logan is the senior member of a special forces group. He is sent to Mexico to investigate strange terrorist movements in a sunny city, where some unsuspecting inhabitants have been kidnapped. During the operations, two fellow soldiers are captured by a woman as ruthless as she is fascinating, but there is no time to investigate further, because all hell breaks loose in Las Vegas and it is time to fly by helicopter and join the fray, until the final showdown, indeed, a bit too concise. In this episode of R6, the possibility of taking cover behind walls and furniture by pressing the L1 key is introduced, which allows you to switch to a third-person view, compared to the canonical one in subjective. From this position it is possible to shoot without leaning out, with less precision, or, looking out with the left analog lever, thus being able to aim but remaining more protected. Everything works perfectly and goes well with the new system with which energy is recharged, taken from games like Call of Duty 2, and thanks to which it is enough to take shelter for a few moments behind a wall to get back in great shape. The management of the assault team is perfect, made up of two soldiers, in addition to Logan, who with simple commands, given by pressing the arrow keys, the X, and the select key, move quickly, placing themselves behind the doors and freeing the rooms with excellent timing, while the player can take from behind the terrorists intent on defending themselves on the other front. Small space is also dedicated to the motion sensor of the Sixaxis pad, which can be used to govern the micro camera that Logan uses to spy beyond walls or closed doors. The meanders of the casinos enhance all these gameplay elements, further demonstrating the state of grace achieved by Ubisoft Montreal in map design, not only in multiplayer, but especially in single-player mode. Every trick and tactic must be used and put to good use in locations that always offer multiple solutions, all of which can be adopted quickly and naturally, without the typical frustration of tactical shooters; so much so that at the basic difficulty level, anyone can complete the game in just over ten hours. When, on the other hand, the choice falls on a realistic game simulation, the Artificial Intelligence of terrorists proves to be truly complex. If we exclude some uncertainties in the approach phases, in fact, the mercenaries moved by the CPU really do everything, even the tour of entire locations, in order to come and track us down. There is life online The multiplayer dish is really rich, which allows up to 14 players to challenge each other online in modes ranging from the classic deathmatch, to elimination, both single and in teams. The new Attack and Defense is interesting which, on the maps available, assigns the two teams different objectives, such as going to recover data that must be taken to the base, or rescuing hostages with the attention, on the part of the terrorists, not to let them die in order to snatch them from the Rainbow, on pain of defeat. For the PS3 version Ubisoft has also included the Red and Black map packs (expansion that can be purchased at a cost of 10 euros also for Xbox 360), which brings the number of available maps to the respectable twenty. The cooperative mode is also of great depth, which puts all the levels of the single player campaign at the disposal of four players, with a real explosion of game mechanics and group tactics, giving the Ubisoft title great longevity. Also noteworthy is the Hunt for Terrorists, always in a cooperative, which sees a group of players face a map that must be completely freed from bots moved by the CPU. Whoever dies acts as a spectator and takes note. Another interesting aspect of R6's online is the creation of a real persistent soldier, who scores points after each game by unlocking new weapons and equipment, which improves his defensive and movement capabilities. Thanks to the points that are acquired, even after a defeat, one still feels stimulated to play and to persevere in a title, which will surely be stormed. Also in the PS3 version there is an awards system, which allows you to unlock trophies, medals and more by completing certain objectives, both offline and online. Clink of Coins Although the game is clearly designed around the levels set in casinos, the most successful settings are the last and the first, which closely resembles the latest Ghost Recon, while not sharing its graphics engine, which in this case is the Unreal Engine 2. These two locations are the only ones almost completely outdoors, where the engine sports excellent lighting effects and a concretenesswhich renders the different situations in an excellent way. In the closed environments of the casinos, however, one cannot help but notice that not all the textures are up to par, that the number of polygons is not transcendental and that, above all, there are not many objects with which it is possible to interact on screen. In short, entering a kitchen full of plates, glasses and various foods, shooting at full flame, and seeing only a couple of objects blown up, greatly diminishes the atmosphere of a game that makes realism its strong point. Fan a table in a bar with a machine gun and see that the paper cups, placed on top, remain firmly in place, creates a bit of disappointment. In a good visual complex, this is clear. The PS3 conversion, unlike for example that of Splinter Cell, is definitely adequate, with the implementation of Agea's PhysX physics engine and the correction of small bugs that were present on the 360 version. aliasing in some situations, and a more fluctuating detail regarding the creation of some textures and light effects. Even the sound sector defends itself quite well, with really beautiful music, accompanied by exciting sound effects. The many conversations of the terrorists caught chatting about this and that, before each ambush, are atmospheric. Maybe it sounds a little strange that these dialogues resume in the middle of a fight, if you stay in cover for longer than usual, as if nothing had happened. Between car wrecks and shattered glass, here comes a ~C***O! He owed me money too!, or I thought I heard something but no, it's nothing. When up until a moment ago, there were bullets everywhere. Comment Rainbow Six Vegas is one of the best fruits of Ubisoft Montreal and Tom Clancy's work. Some of the single player and multiplayer maps are simply perfect and allow the player to squeeze every single drop of gameplay instilled into this tactical FPS to the core. The innovations introduced in the game system work great, despite an obvious turn towards action that leaves behind the most exaggerated realism. Especially if you have the ability to play online, this new chapter is not to be missed, as it will keep you busy for weeks. Some aspects could have been better taken care of, starting from the somewhat fluctuating cosmetics, but for the rest there is only one to take off the hat and start shooting. If you haven't already played it elsewhere, Vegas on PS3 is definitely a recommended purchase. Pros: Great level design Welcome innovations Full online mode Cons: Short single player Graphics with ups and downs Reviewable save system It took six more months, but finally Rainbow Six: Vegas has also arrived on PlayStation 3, and all fans of tactical FPS can finally rejoice, because the title represents a good conversion and in general an absolutely valid title. After the controversial Lockdown, we are back at war, leading a team of three soldiers, armed to the teeth, in a certainly new setting: the city of Las Vegas. The package of this Rainbow Six is really succulent between single player, versus and online co-op, up to the support for splitscreen mode, LAN and online rankings.", "date": "2007-06-29", "grade": null}
