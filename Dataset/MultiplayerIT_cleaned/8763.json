It is no coincidence that Carnival Island is one of those games that we would have expected to see at the launch of Move, aimed at showing the technical possibilities offered by the peripheral through a series of small and light mini-games. The new title from the Los Angeles group Magic Pixel recalls in a not too veiled manner Carnival Games, the casual series that has found its fortune in the immense pool of occasional Nintendo Wii users. The similarities are not limited to the name of the game, but the goal of Carnival Island is to offer a fun and palatable experience that is worth playing despite the numerous alternatives released in recent months. We gutted it to find out if it succeeded or not. Poor carnival The premise of Carnival Island is simple and full of clichs, and sees the players thrown on a small island in celebration. Stalls, gazebos and carousels await the arrival of that one little boy or girl nearby, and each of the attractions has its own set of mini-games based entirely on using PlayStation Move. You can try your hand at ring toss or target shooting, rate catching or bowling, and almost always the controller response is excellent and reflects the player's movement well, although the inability to instantly recalibrate the pointing it could prove annoying for many. Based on the score obtained in each challenge, you can get tickets to spend on customizing your character, while by completing some objectives you can free pets or unlock new variants of the available mini-games. However, the real problem of Carnival Island concerns the lack of variety of the 35 proposed challenges, which are almost all similar in an all too evident way: it does not matter that you have rings, coins or bowling balls in your hands, since the player's goal, as well as the movement required, it is good or bad all the same. Suffice it to say that among the few alternatives there is a shooting gallery with a pistol and a Molechaser armed with a hammer, while the pinnacle is reached by the House of Mirrors, in which it is possible to distort your own photographs taken with PlayStation Eye . However, the overall amount of content is very poor, and all the attractions that make up the four game areas can be unlocked within a couple of hours. Clearly the unlockable extras invite you to play and replay the challenges proposed to obtain new tickets, but in general the fact that there are so few things to do leaves a lot of bitterness in the mouth, and that the few that are there are blatantly sinful in terms of variety. The same animals to unlock are quite an end in themselves and are limited to cheering on the player, where ~cheering~ means ~stalling in a corner of the screen~. Finally, we would have preferred if the game had allowed access to all the mini-games from a common screen, without the need to switch from one area to another and put up with a nice animation every time at the beginning, but that doesn't take long to get bored. As a successful showcase of PlayStation Move technology, Carnival Island certainly would have made more sense as a launch title, but as 2012 dawns and next-generation consoles gear up behind a curtain ready to roll, expect to see more interesting and original applications for the Sony controller, even in a game designed specifically to entertain a very young audience. Among other things, the large number of more interesting and more successful alternatives makes the Magic Pixel game uninteresting even for those fathers and mothers looking for a party game to play with their children.", "date": "2012-02-13", "grade": null}
