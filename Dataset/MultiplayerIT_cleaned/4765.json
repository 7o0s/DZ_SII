In fact, it can be an excellent choice even if you are not necessarily interested in the managerial genre or even racing in general, it is so well structured and balanced. The first chapter already presented itself as a good title, but with this sequel Playsport Games has managed to evolve its structure in practically every sector and direction, putting together a simulation that manages to balance the typical depths of managerial games of a certain level with the immediacy required by the mobile context, without ever falling into excessive simplification and remaining faithful to the spirit of a ~race~ video game. The aim of the game is therefore to manage a stable, make it evolve and possibly lead riders and teams to the title of champion, as regards the classification of individual riders or manufacturers. It is not a simple undertaking: there are many areas to manage as well as parameters to keep under control, but the game does a good job of gradually introducing the user inside its meanders and a simple, clean and captivating does a masterful job of not alienating even those who aren't quite fans of this genre. Mind you, we are still far from the typical two tap and go mobile game, to be extracted for a few seconds while waiting for the metro to arrive, given that a considerable commitment and a certain identification with the management mechanics is still required, but it is really easy to get caught up and take away from its gears, so as to make the games often much longer than initially desired. Also noteworthy is the sense of continuity and progression given by the long-term planning of the following seasons, another element that increases the addiction to the game. Motorsport Manager Mobile 2 can be more exciting than a real Formula One race The circus in the palm of your hand The individual choices entrusted to the player are rather schematic, generally falling within a few pre-set solutions, but there are so many areas to keep under control that there is only the developers to thank for having found such a balanced and miniaturized solution in a smartphone. It is about managing cars, drivers and engineers by managing their training, personal satisfaction and contracts, as well as the research and development sector for the construction of new technological components for the cars, or the construction and expansion of the headquarters to favor every single evolutionary aspect of vehicles and squad members. Obviously the economic management underlies all this, with the need to make ends meet, manage relations with sponsors and possibly increase the capital of the stable, but all this represents only the background part of the game, with the real action and its own that takes place during the races, between qualifying and the race. During these phases we have to take care of the set-up of the car, the choice of tires and the general strategy also understood as the behavior of the drivers and use of the engine, all things that influence the progress of the races as well as the number of pit- stop to be made. That said, the description could scare those who are not very accustomed to simulations of this type, but the beauty of Motorsport Manager Mobile 2 is the fact that everything is presented gradually and easily accessible to everyone, even without reading manuals or tutorials screen (actually extremely concise and agile). To give some examples: set-up management provides a few clear options ranging from ~tight bends~ to ~long straights~, to effectively simplify the different aerodynamic load to be applied, just as engine management goes from ~acceleration~ to ~maximum speed~. It is a user-friendly schematization of the variables involved, but which is effective and enjoyable for everyone. The race takes place with an overhead shot showing the cars as numbers moving in real time on the track, thus obtaining a good overview of the race and keeping tire and fuel consumption under close control , with the possibility of receiving radio communications from the pilots and deciding the pit-stop and its management at any time. The graphic solution works very well in functional terms, but perhaps it would not have hurt to show a more captivating reproduction of the cars on the track.", "date": "2017-07-21", "grade": "9.0"}
