Martin, it may be interesting to take a look at this review of Game of Thrones: Tale of Crows, to see if this particular interpretation of the fantasy epic is worth a try. The valuation is uncertain, as we shall see, but there is no doubt that Devolver Digital's strange ~game~ knows how to capture some particularly fascinating aspects of the world created by the writer. In truth, it is more of a narrative experience with interactive elements, which the team defines as an ~idle real-time narrative-driven game~ with a bizarre but also quite precise description of its structure, because in fact it is a game narrative that proceeds in real time, imposing pauses but continuing even while the app remains in the background without actually being played. The basic idea is really very fascinating: to bring to light the many forgotten stories of the Night's Watch, the ancient order of warriors dedicated body and soul to the Barrier, the main defense of humanity against the dangers that lurk in the deep North of Westeros since the dawn of time. The Night's Watch already existed eight thousand years before the arrival of Jon Snow and therefore there are many events that have built their history between epic battles, explorations in the wild lands, intrigues and events that have their roots in the darkest and most mysterious parts of the entire continent. Thus we find ourselves starting our guard in the shadow of the barrier, following the story of various lord commanders who have succeeded one another over the years at Castle Black. The Barrier and the wild lands beyond it perhaps represent the most mysterious elements of all of Martin's fantasy epic, therefore a narrative game focused on these aspects is very interesting, the problem is that to tell the truth there is no 'is a lot of text in the game, moreover diluted by the expectations imposed by the particular idle-style rhythm, but the premise of Tale of Crows is still very attractive especially for fans of the series (and in particular of the books, one thinks). My watch begins While we can see various fragments of the typical settings in northern Westeros on the screen, all the game action takes place by touching certain options within an entirely text-based interface. The pace - being an idle game - is staid, as one might expect in a world where journeys are long and slow and communications take place through crows sent to cover kilometers of distance: in essence, it is a matter of making decisions based on the choices offered and wait for any consequences, with these moments of interaction interspersed with pauses that can even last several minutes, with the game that continues to act in the background to invite us to leave and resume the story several times. The decisions concern various aspects in the management of Castle Black, of the Barrier and of the expeditions beyond this, as befits a Lord Commander: there are moments of dialogue in which we can choose how to set up the speech, the attitude to keep and the topics to be discussed, or moments in which we have to decide which missions to undertake outside the Barrier, how to carry them forward in the face of some choices and which commanders to assign to the expeditions. Among these choices emerge the characteristics that can be considered strategic of the game, requiring to associate the characteristics of various characters with possibly more congenial missions and to choose how to face problems between different attitudes ranging from adventurous to moderate up to cautious and defensive. To tell the truth, it is not always clear which consequence is more probable starting from a certain choice, therefore it is a question of continuing above all by following the instinct or simply one's taste on how to advance the story, substantially reducing the effective control of the player and the purely strategic ambitions of the game. Another problem is given by the lack of drama in the consequences of the actions: Martin has accustomed us to highly dramatic and upsetting twists and situations, things that do not emerge much in this game, perhaps precisely due to the impossibility of being able to take great freedom in writing. Everything takes place through a few sentences, so an enveloping narrative that develops over an abundant text is not to be expected, given that the exchanges are fast and are resolved quickly, just as the descriptions are somewhat concise. The game succeedsgood at capturing the atmosphere of A Song of Ice and Fire as regards the parts of the story centered on the Barrier, which are then the ones richer in mystery and with more disturbing elements deriving from the supernatural. There are several hints of these aspects in the game, with the presence of White Walkers and their more magical and dark extensions that creep towards the Wall and require you to take the right actions to be contained, but the story is always very essential and does not enrich much the extensive lore created by Martin. It always seems that the developers have not had the opportunity to act too much on the events, so much so that it is difficult to find yourself faced with truly impactful situations, narrated with great transport. In this sense, Tale of Crows seems unable to fully exploit its potential, with a narration that is too thin and dry, moreover diluted along large pauses. However, it remains an interesting way to illustrate a cross-section of a specific part of the Game of Thrones world, managing to transfer the feeling of being in command of a handful of men placed in the extreme defense of civilization, on the border with an unknown and dominated world by mysterious and overwhelming forces, with choices that often prove to be difficult as they are characterized by cryptic consequences, not easily deducible. Big style, little comfort The game allows you to switch between the vision of Castle Black at any time, an enlarged map that includes the Wall and a large area outside it and shots that follow the various expeditions in progress in more detail, so you always have keep an eye on what happens between the fort of the Night's Watch and the various teams sent on a mission. The graphic style adopted looks like a sort of cel-shading characterized by strong contrasts between lights and shadows, with real fragments of the scenery highlighted on a neutral background, with the possibility of rotating the settings as if they were dioramas. It is a beautiful representation of the world of Westeros, characterized by a simple and cartoonish but also very detailed trait, which perfectly recalls the glacial atmospheres of the areas north of the Seven Kingdoms. In line with this style, the interface is extremely elegant, between the choice of fonts and the use of emblems and symbols perfectly in line with the tradition of the series. In all this style, however, there are also some difficulties in use and one might think that the aesthetics have somewhat hindered the use of the user interface: the text is in fact incredibly small in size, often relegated to a corner of the screen despite being the element of main importance in the whole structure of the game. Likewise, it's not always clear what's happening at all times and sometimes you find yourself wandering from shot to shot looking for active elements that you can interact with. Considering that the game is built to be enjoyed above all on the iPhone or iPad, therefore not exactly huge screens, the choice of text display is not exactly understandable. It must be said that the whole game is translated into Italian, which for a title so strongly based on text and narration is very important and appreciable.", "date": "2020-08-13", "grade": "6.8"}
