{"name": "Rez HD - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rez-hd-recensione.html", "text": "At the heart of the system Rez was released on Dreamcast and Ps2 worldwide in late 2001 and early 2002, produced by Sega's internal team called United Game Artists (for the series, when a name is worth a thousand words). The very limited sales success achieved at the time contributed, in the following years, to making Rez a cult title ~for the few~, who however managed to always keep his name high and the memory alive, not to mention the ~myth~. . At the basis of Mizuguchi's effort there is practically Panzer Dragoon as a concept; therefore a shooter on fixed tracks, in which the only interaction of the player is linked to the on-screen movement of the crosshair. In fact, pressing button A allows you to lock a target with a lock-on, which will then be hit once you lift your finger from the button; up to 8 targets can be locked down simultaneously. Eliminated enemies can drop bonuses, in the form of red or blue balls; the former provide a smart bomb, the latter increase an evolutionary bar which, once filled, allows its virtual extension to change shape. An evolution, in addition to modifying the appearance and the type of beams fired, is in fact the equivalent of an energy bonus; in fact, each hit suffered makes him regress by one form, up to game over. If the description so far can convey the image of a decidedly standard product, it is in the practical realization that we realize how different the reality is. Rez is truly the classic example of a game where the whole is much better than the sum of the parts. We said at the beginning that Rez is a journey; a visual and acoustic journey, in a spectacular and unique amalgam. The graphic component leads into a synthetic world, in wireframe, a sort of Tron or Matrix where acid colors and bright colors dominate and in which the ultimate goal is to eliminate an evil artificial intelligence by crossing 5 levels. Sound, likewise, is a simply fundamental aspect within Mizuguchi's concept; a techno trance soundtrack that in each level starts reduced, minimal, and then grows step by step until it floods the player, truly immersed in a continuous flow of sounds, lights and images. And each successful hit is equivalent to a synthetic sound added to the track, with a real musical contribution from the player within the soundtrack which, however, is free, anarchic, and not tied to keystrokes at a precise moment as instead happens in rhythm game. In Rez, gameplay, audio and video really become one, an integration to the roots, the foundations of the experience; and it is precisely this cohesion that makes Sega production still today as fascinating, original, refreshing and unique exactly as it was 7 years ago. HD mon amour The HD suffix in the title represents exactly what it suggests, which is a technical improvement of the original product in line with the capabilities of the console it runs on. Let me be clear, nothing has been added or changed compared to the debut on Dc and Ps2 as regards the contents, with the exception of the Xbox goals; 5 levels were and still are today, as well as the game modes that allow you to face the journey in a classic way, or as invulnerable, or even in a score attack to improve your scores. However, the high resolution and widescreen really gave Mizuguchi's effort an extra impetus, as did the inclusion of 5.1 surround sound. Furthermore, the Ps2 version was sold at the time with a curious accessory, namely the Trance Vibrator; it was nothing more than a USB device to be placed on one's body during the game, in order to provide a separate vibration to that of the controller and aligned with the beat of the music. Much more than a bizarre end in itself, the Trance Vibrator really represented in Mizuguchi's idea a concrete addition to the overall experience. And so, cleverly, it was decided to keep the same function this time with the 360's additional pads; and playing Rez with the bass vibration hitting your stomach is really something that deserves to be tried... Lastly, the presence of the original version of the game should be noted, but the purpose of this inclusion is purely accessory and more useful than more to appreciate the improvements in this HD Edition. Xbox 360 - Goals Rez HD's objectives are almost all reachable quite easily simply by playing, accumulating hours, completing levels or reaching certain scores in the score attack. Comment At the price of 800 points, or about ten euros, the purchase of Rez HD becomes even more recommended than it already is a priori. A visionary title, coienthralling and unique, capable of accompanying the player on a journey in which one feels literally immersed in a sea of sounds, music and visual stimuli, all blended from the roots into an experience that once again recalls the value of Tetsuya Mizuguchi. Pros A unique journey Graphics, sound and gameplay perfectly blended Technical improvements more than appreciable Cons Rather short For many but not for all", "date": "2008-02-19", "grade": null}
