What is it about? Simply said: Reckless Racing is an arcade racing game with a top view, therefore belonging to that genre that has always been appreciated and which has seen exponents over the years such as Super Off Road, Micro machines, Drift Out, Pixeljunk Racers just to name a few . A type of product that is already present on Apple devices, where there is certainly no shortage of competition. The art of drifting In reality, Reckless Racing definitely has something more than its rivals on the platform, namely the quality of a truly superior level gameplay. It is evident how the Swedish programmers have spent a lot of time perfecting the control system, the response of the vehicles and above all their behavior on the road; with a curriculum entirely focused on automotive titles (with PGR for Zune and Raging Thunder II for iPhone), the folks at Pixelbite understood how important it was to concentrate efforts precisely on these components, so as to create a fun, immediate but not superficial. And Reckless Racing is in fact just that. The races, mainly on dirt roads but with portions of asphalt, are in fact a real hoot thanks to the feeling that the cars give back in the player's control; the fundamental ingredient in this sense is drifting, or the skid, intended to constantly accompany the lines drawn during the curves to be tackled rigorously at full speed. Although the game is absolutely immediate, also thanks to the variety of control options capable of satisfying anyone, the need to perfect the driving style and to learn the secrets of the tracks in the best possible way means that there is no lack of incentive to deepen the experience. The 3 difficulty levels available, divided into bronze, silver and gold, effectively support this progression, which is essential for then throwing yourself into online races. In the latter case, unlike the single player where the grid is made up of 6 cars, the total number of these is reduced to 4; a minor problem actually, which doesn't affect too much the pleasure of challenging real opponents around the world. And up to here we have described the positive aspects of Reckless Racing; unfortunately, however, the picture is not complete, since there is no shortage of elements capable of reducing the overall evaluation of the product. The main flaw is, without any doubt, the serious paucity of contents, of irons in the fire; there are only 5 tracks available, which can also be tackled in reverse, and covering them all takes a few minutes. A structure of championships or competitions is totally missing, both online and offline, limiting everything only to single races; a choice that while on the one hand favors the slenderness and agility of the structure, on the other hand reduces too much the stimuli and overall longevity. Sure, doing a couple of multiplayer challenges is always nice, but it's too much of an end in itself to support Reckless Racing over distance. In this sense, even the secondary methods, such as hot lap and delivery, are insufficient. Furthermore, online multiplayer is only really usable via a wi-fi connection; that on 3G networks is in fact too slow to support the speed of the game, with perennial lag and opposing machines that disappear and reappear around the track. Finally, any form of integration with the Game Center is missing, leaving the competition only to meager online rankings. A real shame then, even in the face of the wonderful technical component on which the title is based, full of details and sufficiently fluid (tested on iPhone 3GS).
