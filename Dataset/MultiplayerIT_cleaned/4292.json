We're not talking about a video game released the day before yesterday, mind you: Klei Entertainment put it in our hands in 2013, five years ago. A similar period of time, in the gaming sector, can decree the rise to the Olympus of titles that will be remembered forever ... or the complete removal from collective memory. Don't Starve fell somewhere in between: it is among the best of its kind, but is known only to a circle of enthusiasts. It was (and is) a little gem, but not everyone can love it. It is one of those cases in which the genre to which it belongs must absolutely be liked, as well as the proposed graphic style, and still the level of challenge tending upwards with real wheelies. What we are talking about today is the Don't Starve Mega Pack, or the sum of everything Klei Entertainment has worked on and continued to work on over the years. If you already know Don't Starve, you might be surprised at how it has changed over time. If not, it's your chance to take a closer look at it. It's okay, Wilson Wilson is a brilliant scientist, all focused on his experiments. The first time we meet him is in the basic version of Don't Starve, grappling with his latest invention that just doesn't want to know how to work. Suddenly a voice speaks to him, and it comes from his antiquated radio (it's just one of the many bizarre details of the production). The voice tells him what to do and how to do it, but poor Wilson doesn't know that it belongs to a demon... and in fact, once that strange machine he's working on is activated, he finds himself teleported to a strange, hostile and dark world. Where what matters is staying alive. Wilson doesn't know where it is, but we can immediately get a vague idea: it is a sort of island surrounded by the sea, characterized by various biomes. Klei Entertainment doesn't provide us with a tutorial or valuable advice, but still the indicators at the top right of the screen seem pretty clear: they show Wilson's health, his mental state and the time of day. What will happen when night falls? Better to collect as many supplies as possible for the moment, taking advantage of wild fauna and flora, or small objects that we can see on the screen... being careful not to do any damage. Don't Starve, apparently, is all here: the game mechanics are simple to understand, and also to master. Our alter ego must survive as many days as possible, hoping (sooner or later) to return to his world. We have to create the tools we need ourselves: a vertical bar on the left shows us the construction menu, or the projects that we can carry out if we have the right resources. This is the only compromise we can expect from the title: it is only willing to tell us what is needed to make a certain instrument, and in what quantities, but nothing more. We are forced to imagine everything else for ourselves, or to experience it on our skin, the first few times usually with disastrous consequences. For example, what happens after dark? Impossible to know during the first game: the whole screen goes black, and someone (or something) starts biting us. Better to light a torch or a bonfire, although not all enemies are afraid of flames. The last indicator on the screen is a bar on the bottom side: in pure Minecraft style, it shows our inventory, and allows us to quickly equip the tools we need. It is important to underline that Klei Entertainment has done a really good job regarding the game interface on consoles, since it was not easy to make some steps intuitive that on PC simply required a couple of mouse clicks. The configuration of the controls on the DualShock seemed very intelligent to us, and expertly uses the analogs both for the movement of Wilson and for navigating through the menus, as well as the backbones. How long will you be able to survive in the protagonist's nightmare? Playstation 4 trophies The Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together trophies represent an ambitious goal for players: given the high level of difficulty of the title itself and the presence of roguelike elements, they are not particularly easy to obtain. Overall, they require you to craft all the game objects present, to survive for a certain number of days in a row, and to face the most dangerous creatures scattered in the title by Klei Entertainment. If you're looking for an easy-to-get Platinum Trophy, this isn't the game for you. Trust me. A great Mega Pack At the time of its publication Don't Starve was a survival slap,original above all because it is able to draw on several different genres, making its classification very difficult. It is in fact, at the same time, an adventure, a crafting game, and above all a roguelike: every death is permanent, there is no going back if someone or something grabs us in the dark and devours us. If anything, you earn experience points with which to unlock other characters, each with its own characteristics, capable of varying the approach to survival a bit. Variety has been a problem from the beginning: Don't Starve had a lot to see in 2013, but not enough to avoid becoming repetitive after ten hours of play. Five years later things have completely changed, and the Don't Starve Mega Pack is here to prove it. The complete package in question contains all the human knowable Don't Starve theme: we refer to the two great expansions, Reigns of Giants and Shipwrecked, but also to the stand-alone multiplayer edition Don't Starve Together. Don't worry, the writer is about to give you a hand in orienting yourself among so many contents that for the moment are only a mass of random names for newbies. Don't Starve itself already offers a large number of objects, tools and craftable elements, as well as natural environments, creatures and characters. This is the starting point: it is the content of the Don't Starve Console Edition, the first element present in the Don't Starve Mega Pack. In short, it is the base game. But when it comes to starting a new game, you'll also understand that the Mega Pack features the two previously released game expansions: Reigns of Giants and Shipwrecked. Each of the two still adds new tools, enemies, playable characters and biomes. But that's not all: it also introduces variables to the game world itself, which will directly affect Wilson by putting him in danger (or helping him, if wisely exploited), for example humidity and overheating. Reigns of Giants focuses on the addition of the four seasons, each of which will be felt on the entire game world, and on some particularly powerful new enemies, the giants in fact (rather bizarre to see them up close). Shipwrecked in turn leverages new biomes, objects and situations, without changing the game formula at the base of Don't Starve: this time we find ourselves in tropical environments, dealing with tornadoes, monsoons, droughts, jungles, beaches and so much more. The developers have aimed to add new content, again, again and again, effectively tripling the offer of what was the original product. And if at some point you should get tired of playing Don't Starve alone... well, Klei Entertainment has thought of that too. The Don't Starve Mega Pack contains Don't Starve Together, where we will have to survive here too... but in company. It is a local or online multiplayer mode, which in turn offers a great variety of situations: the philosophy behind each game can be chosen before entering the world of our companions (or hosting one). Do we like to lead or do we prefer to take orders? Are we the gregarious types or rather aggressive? It's a short step from cooperation to competition, and we could become yet another problem for other online players in an already hostile game world. In all of this, on PlayStation 4 the Mega Pack also gives us two themes for the dashboard, one based on Autumn (the season of Don't Starve of course) and one dedicated to the Shipwrecked expansion.", "date": "2018-04-24", "grade": "8.5"}
