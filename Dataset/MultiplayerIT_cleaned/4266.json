The experience developed by Monolith Productions has been able to enhance and substantially enrich the mechanics introduced by the first chapter, giving us a much larger structure, a large number of fascinating characters and a narrative component which, while taking some liberties with respect to the a Tolkenian work, proved to be solid and engaging. The game was accompanied by the inevitable Season Pass, with some unpublished orc tribes and two story expansions: the first, The Blade of Galadriel, was released in February, while the second and last, The Desolation of Mordor, is available from a few days and is the subject of this review. Are you a god? No. In this new adventure we will abandon the role of superhuman creatures such as Talion and Eltariel, whose extraordinary powers naturally depended on the New Ring, to wear those of an ordinary person, Baranor. Commander of the Gondorian forces, the man experienced the conquest of Minas Ithil by Sauron's troops on his own skin, and in this expansion we find him literally adrift, accompanied by a few surviving soldiers as he heads towards the lair of a group of mercenaries, the Easterlings. His idea is in fact to raise an army to wage war on the Dark Lord starting with the siege of the fortress of Shindram, but it is a feat that he certainly cannot face alone. The problem is that the few remaining companions are decimated by the attack of some huge desert worms and Baranor himself is about to be devoured, when he is saved at the last moment by the dwarf hunter Torvin. The latter warns him about the dangers of those lands and gives him a fundamental tool for the new campaign, a shield equipped with a mechanism that fires a grappling hook and allows the character to reach any foothold in a few moments, thus moving faster than normal and completing climbs within seconds. Not only that: Torvin's equipment also includes a real parachute, with which Baranor can jump from the heights without fear of crashing to the ground, a bit like in the episodes of Batman: Arkham, as well as a powerful crossbow capable of launching steel bolts or stun bolts. Re-motivated by these opportunities, the character enters the Easterlings' lair only to find as their commander a certain Serka... his lost brother. The return of strategy Switching from the Shadow of War or The Blade of Galadriel campaign to the Desolation of Mordor campaign is quite a ~blow~, let's say. Accustomed to eliminating enemies with a couple of shots, fearlessly throwing ourselves against entire hordes of orcs and commanders, we will find ourselves having to stay hidden, study the situation and understand who we are facing before making any attempt. Death for Baranor is in fact problematic: upon returning from a game over, the completed narrative missions are preserved, but the progress relating to the conquest of outposts, the recruitment of mercenaries and the unlocking of equipment and skills is completely lost. In short, this second and final expansion tries to offer an experience that is in many ways hardcore, ruthless, which does not allow for distractions or lightness. Before jumping into battle, it is therefore necessary to fill up on healing elixirs (health does not regenerate over time, in this case) and arrows, as well as set up a bodyguard who can give us a hand with the enemies. Unlike Talion and Eltariel, Baranor has few unlockable skills that focus mainly on the amount of medkits and ammunition available, on the war cry that attracts mercenaries to the field and on the information gathered; however there is no need to choose between one power-up and another: they can all be activated at the same time, if that is the path we prefer. Accompanied by Serka, with space for more than a fun curtain between the two, we will have to complete a series of missions and then focus on conquering five enemy bases. Only then will we be able to proceed with the final phase of the campaign, which includes a traditional siege but also a huge amount of duels against high-level orcs, fights that we can only win by asking for the help of the Easterlings. Short life The completion of The Desolation of Mordor is seen a bit as a ~challenge within a challenge~, in the sense that the system keeps track of the experience accumulated along the way, urging us to do betteror with a new attempt. In any case, structurally this DLC appears much poorer than The Blade of Galadriel: if in fact the adventure starring Eltariel could be completed within three and a half hours, however leaving almost half of the secondary missions uncovered, the story of Baranor it is completed 100% in just a couple of hours. Considering that the price of the two packages is the same, 14.99 euros, it is clear and evident that the developers have made less effort with this latest expansion. Monolith Productions has worked on some different mechanisms than usual (the gadgets of the character, the strategic approach) and offered a certain variety for the main quests, but has also avoided refining certain aspects of the experience in the best possible way (the use of grappling hook is not splendid to look at) and renounced to introduce particular novelties in terms of scenarios and enemies, both based on what has already been seen in the base game, with the only exception of the giant worms. The excellent dubbing in Italian, with very heartfelt and convincing interpretations, undoubtedly represents a strong point for The Desolation of Mordor, and in the same way it is clear that those who have greatly appreciated Shadow of War and The Blade of Galadriel will hardly will let slip this short spin-off, narratively untied from the main events beyond the incipit. Our assessment is therefore of a general nature, but it shouldn't dampen the enthusiasm of those who, for the sake of completeness, want to take a last tour of the lands of Mordor ... until the next opportunity.", "date": "2018-05-13", "grade": null}
