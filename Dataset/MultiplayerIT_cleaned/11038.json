{"name": "Hell's Kitchen - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hells-kitchen-recensione.html", "text": "It is certainly not new to see a title that deals with cooking and recipes arrive on the Nintendo laptop, the various Cooking Mama or Guida in Cucina genres have accustomed us to virtually turning off or trying to improve our culinary skills by following advice and recipes. This time, however, we are faced with a product that stands out from the common panorama, combining the characteristics of cooking software with those of puzzle games, all in what is in fact the conversion of a genre that has rarely seen being translated into video game: that of reality shows. Hell's Kitchen is in fact the television series which, hosted by the famous chef Gordon Ramsey, involves twelve aspiring cooks who, divided into two teams, will have to challenge each other to compete for the coveted title of chef of an important restaurant in Las Vegas . All obviously with pots and pans and ingredients, in an atmosphere of frenzy and enormous tension that characterize the genre. It is on this imprint that the game develops, putting us in the position of having to manage an entire restaurant alone, in all its many aspects. In fact, we will not be relegated to the mere preparation of recipes in the kitchen, we will also have to welcome customers, collect orders, clear the table and satisfy, in general, all the needs of patrons. Fire and flames: when hell goes to the table The game welcomes us with an atmosphere that is anything but serene: infernal flames rise on the upper screen of the laptop, a trident of diabolical inspiration stands out in the title, all of which prepares us to have to face not particularly simple tests. Once a profile has been created, we will be able to choose between two different modes: the ~Career~ is the main one, flanked by an ~Arcade~ mode. Chef Ramsey greets us with a tough and menacing attitude that will make him a surly despot ready to call us to order at the slightest mistake or delay throughout the game. His undoubted charisma will be exploited, in the game, to continually put us under tension and stress us to obtain better performance and speed of execution, focal points for success in the enterprise we have to face: overcoming five weeks of life in a restaurant to finally become , expert chefs and masters of the field. The first week sees us start with the noble rank of dishwasher, which we will have to raise from week to week, passing from the most dignified apprentice, to then become assistant cook, cook and finish as chef de match. The structure of the game is quite simple: each week is divided into seven days in the restaurant, each of which represents a game session to be finished with the maximum possible percentage, which accumulated will serve to move up a rank. The real game begins when we start the first day in the room which is presented to us with a small tutorial on the upper screen and the recipe of the day on the lower one. Interesting note: the recipes are not there for beauty: they can be consulted and taken care of in every detail, to allow us to try our hand at the stove of our real kitchen and churn out true delights of haut cuisine. At this point we are ready to welcome the first customers. We are in the heart of the game, which takes place entirely in two environments: the living room and the kitchen. With clicks we will have to welcome customers to the dining room, take the menus after they have delivered them, cook the dishes ordered, bring them to the tables and finally clear away once the meal is over. Frantic clicks between a dish and a menu: and don't let the mayonnaise go crazy Just a few simple clicks. This is what the game consists of, in the ability to coordinate in order to be able to cope with the customers' cross-orders while maintaining speed in the service and quality in the dishes prepared. Once the simple sequence of clicks that will engage us in the dining room has been completed, the real challenge begins in the kitchen. When we enter the true realm of a restaurant we will in fact find ourselves in front of a pallet on which the ingredients to be prepared are displayed, different for each dish, and the relative oven and stove on which to cook them. The difficulty will gradually increase, simply by inserting new ingredients and a greater number of tables and relative customers in the room. In the kitchen we will come to have up to six bowls, of different colors, which contain the ingredients to be prepared. A click on the bowl will make them ready to be used in food containers. Each dish can consist of one or more ingredients and will have a predefined cooking time. When we have inserted the last ingredient into the relative container, the fire will light and the cooking time counter will start. This detail is fundamental, because different dishes have tdifferent cooking methods. We will therefore have to juggle to be able to make everything coincide, dosing the ingredients and calculating the time for their preparation, in such a way as to finish cooking all the dishes at the same time and bring them to the table without any of them being burnt. or cold. Chef Ramsey oversees our every move and the flaming gauges on his sides tell us his reservoir of patience. It goes without saying that if it ends we will be plunged into the group of disqualified players, with great humiliation and gnashing of teeth. The game, conceptually very simple, combines strategic elements with the need to be extremely coordinated and precise in our actions. Miscalculations are not tolerated, which will cause the inevitable restart of the mission. The whole thing is extremely frenetic, but also very well structured and manageable, managing to be fun without being frustrating. An extremely successful and unusual conversion, for a title that deserves to be played even by those who have never heard of Gordon Ramsey. Comment Hell's Kitchen presents itself as an unusual video game conversion of a successful reality show. The game, which can trivially be defined as a puzzle game but which actually blends strategic elements with the need for great coordination and quick reflexes, manages to keep the level of attention high and to entertain without being frustrating, despite the difficulty of its more advanced levels . The repetitive and schematic structure manages not to get bored and the pleasant and clear graphics like the soundtrack, which is also more than pleasant, give the final touch to a title that we would not have expected to be able to judge so positively. The introduction of an arcade mode and a real recipe book make it even more complete and allow us to recommend it to everyone to spend carefree even if demanding game sessions. Pro Frantic but technically impeccable Entertaining, without ever giving in to tedium Cookbook and arcade mode Cons Ramsey may not be liked by everyone Praises and scoldings of little variety", "date": "2008-11-20", "grade": null}
