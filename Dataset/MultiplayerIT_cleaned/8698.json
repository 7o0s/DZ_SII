{"name": "Battaglia per la Terra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100080-mass-effect-3-battaglia-per-la-terra.html", "text": "2007. The year in which the Mass Effect saga made its debut, at the time exclusively for Xbox 360. A visionary title in its own way, which experimented with various game formulas in a sci-fi context full of charm. BioWare was certainly not new to works on an epic scale, in this case the ambitions were such that they needed a trilogy to be realized. Well, after five years we can recognize that it was all true, the highly anticipated Mass Effect 3 completely closes the adventure of John Shepard and all the subplots related to it. It remains to be seen whether this epilogue is able to maintain the quality level, but above all the balance of the second, splendid episode. We at Multiplayer.it have already completely completed the game and are ready to give you the answer! Star eaters The prologue takes directly from the events narrated in the DLC of Mass Effect 2, the Advent. Commander Shepard is called before the Earth Council to explain the Reapers, a mysterious alien race intent on destroying all traces of organic life in the universe. In the meantime, however, the enemy crosses the atmosphere launching a terrible attack on the Earth. There is nothing left but to flee on the Normandy, completely helpless in the face of a relentless and devastating destructive force. From this point it is our job to gather a real army to oppose the invader. To do this we find ourselves faced with new interplanetary raids aboard our favorite ship, not only functional to forge precious alliances with all the races present in the game, but above all crucial for building the Crucible, a very powerful and ancient weapon capable, perhaps , to foil the threat of the Reapers. Shepard is therefore again the balance of the conflict, and we with him. Exactly and like more than the old chapters, BioWare has given great importance to the choices made by the player in the numerous dialogues and videos present. Unfortunately, the significant twists and the heavy repercussions on the narrative fabric make it impossible for us to go into detail, but know that every choice made will not necessarily be the best or the right one. Nor do we hide that we had some difficulty with the moral implications, so much so that we repeated a mission twice to see the differences (we'll stop here), and we can assure you that there are several of this type. The available endings themselves, in a similar way to 2, are influenced by the percentage of military forces accumulated in the main campaign, which we can consult at any time from the Normandy's control panel. The official guide The Official Strategy Guide approved and corrected by BioWare is available in all video game stores at the recommended price of 19.90. A volume with more than 400 pages, which will accompany both veterans and novice players in the intricate storyline of Mass Effect 3. ~We just wanted to create the best gaming experience imaginable,~ says Casey Hudson, executive producer of the Mass Effect series. Our history Mass Effect 3 takes up numerous issues left open, including not only the invasion of the Reapers, but also the identity of Cerberus, the pro-human organization led by the mysterious man already seen in the second chapter. For these reasons it is closely related to it and represents its natural continuation, however BioWare has recovered some elements of the progenitor, slightly changing the cards on the table and making this latest episode a hybrid between the first two. The desire to experiment remains unchanged, as evidenced by the elimination of the door bypass minigames (now automatic) and the - frankly tedious - process of recovering materials from the planets, replaced however by a different management of the galactic map, which we will explain in following. The desire to make the experience accessible for everyone is expressed and in this regard a customization has been introduced that allows you to choose at any time whether to emphasize the narrative sector, the action or the difficulty. The game is still a mixture of different genres, from third-person shooter, western RPG and graphic adventure, with lots of dialogues available between the protagonist and various characters. In this regard, we can assure you that the fears matured in the demo regarding the shortage of dialogues are completely averted. We simply replayed the same sections and discovered that they had been completely deprived of the textual parts and the cutscenes, both present in large quantities and never so rich in detail. The texts above all leave you speechless for their credibility, the ricquality of content and the depth of the topics covered. From comrade diatribes to political debates, Mass Effect 3 would look good as a science fiction novel and leads the viewer (pass the term) to feel strong empathy towards the various races of the BioWare universe. Battle-hardy krogan, wise salarian, turian strategist, or elegant asari, each has its own story and is keen to preserve its culture, but some have internecine wars to settle before siding with us. As already anticipated, there is no shortage of fan service: the developers have reintroduced Liara T'Soni to the team, and there are also Garrus, Kaidan Alenko and Ashley Williams, the last two obtainable based on the answers provided at the beginning of the game. In short, everyone is really there, even if the new arrivals are absolutely no less, such as the wiry James Vega and Samantha Traynor. Speaking of fan service, expect another welcome return: will we finally get to see Tali's face? Instructions for saving the world The legendary Normandy returns in all its splendor also in this third chapter, and after the first five hours of the game, very linear, it becomes a real hub where the player can move in complete freedom and acquire information, as well as obviously to establish the route. But now the galactic map is invaded by the Reapers, this means that the scan of the planets, resolved in a similar way to the first chapter, will attract their attention forcing us to flee. The Citadel, the inevitable location of the saga, is made fully available for exploration, and its parts gradually open up as the adventure continues. Among these are the Purgatory dance club (where an old friend awaits us), the hospital, the embassy and the internal market, a location of crucial importance as it provides many elements for side quests, as well as presenting numerous shops for the purchase of armor and weapons. This section has the most relevant changes: in addition to the numerous spare parts applicable to rifles, armor and pistols, we must pay attention to the weight occupied before launching into battle. Now we have a maximum of five slots available to load heavy and light weapons, but occupying them all involves an excess of weight which is detrimental to the recharge time of the powers. In this case, those who have chosen classes more oriented towards biotic actions must be careful not to compromise their balance. The biotic upgrade tree is now branched from the fourth level, allowing for even more customization. The classes available at the beginning of the game have obviously remained unchanged, including the hybrid sentinel, the pure soldier or the engineer. Also returns is the full editor that allows you to choose the gender of the character, or play with Shepard's default male model. No major changes have been made in this area, but we welcome the introduction of new facial textures to make faces look more realistic. Finally, there is also the import of saves from the second Mass Effect, using it we can benefit from some changes in the story in order to alter their impact. For our part, we played a virgin game, effectively ascertaining the absence of characters not considered in the default timeline of this third chapter. The use of Kinect The game implements the use of Kinect with chatted voice commands, all in Italian. In our test they were very precise and reactive and are divided into three types. In fact, with the voice, the different lines of dialogue can be selected, by pronouncing the chosen phrases, the contextual menus that appear near the interactive objects can be activated (~Open~ a door, ~Explore~ a mechanism, ~Bypass~ a system of safety) and, finally, commands can be given to all members of the team, in relation to biotic powers and special shots. Accepting to be thought insane by those who live next door, this system allows you to issue commands to the team and use your own without resorting to the radial menu, interrupting the action. You have to get used to it and learn its different names, after which, by pointing at an enemy and saying ~Stasis~ ~Singularity~ or ~Launch~, the members of the team who have that power available and who have it charged launch it. Innocence lost In the field Mass Effect 3 behaves broadly like the previous chapter, with a precise action tack inevitably influenced by the most famous third-person shooters. It comes to think of the Gears Of War saga first of all, with maps based on covers and the key used for pto carry them out, a full-bodied body section improved by the presence of the omniblade, a blade resulting from the holographic vector of the armor. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the shooter mechanics of this third chapter in such a simplistic way, as BioWare has enriched the formula with various elements in a sufficient way not to be too derivative. First of all, there are numerous sections with a discreet vertical development, unpublished for the series, or others that present labyrinthine structures on which to orientate, or specific objectives to be completed. The additional missions on Cerberus bases also alter the typical stage structure, forcing us to face growing hordes of enemies on limited maps, or escort civilians. The role-playing part has not been frustrated: the level of experience is still a determining factor and from the standard difficulty upwards the biotic powers are of fundamental importance, both those of Shepard and of the companions, and above all their positioning to protect us . In fact, enemies tend to get around Shepard, helped by the structure of the maps, carry out cover and elusive maneuvers, forcing them to adapt tactics if necessary. As if that weren't enough we have to avoid close combat with larger enemies, nefarious creatures capable of moving at high speed or killing us with a single blow. All this leads to various situations that kill the monotony, without considering the fact that each class and race represents a gaming experience in its own right. The icing on the cake comes from the classy touches of BioWare, which this tour has really outdone itself by proposing an extremely original location, but of which we don't want to spoil the surprise. Xbox 360 goals Mass Effect 3 features the classic 1000 player points distributed across 50 objectives. As we have already written in the review, we completed the single mode in just over thirty hours, unlocking less than half of it. To get the rest you need to complete the title a second time (or through an old save) and complete all the additional tasks, including the side quests, called N7 missions. Reaching the perfect score will therefore be an operation that can take you a long time. At glance The transition to the Unreal Engine 3 graphics engine on the occasion of the release of the Playstation 3 version was already very promising, but the work done in Mass Effect 3 often leaves you speechless. We are clearly facing a blockbuster that alternates spectacular pre-calculated scenes with breathtaking landscapes, including the home planet of the Krogan and the Asari. The polygonal load has increased dramatically, with scenarios full of details in which to get lost, perhaps due to some textures, and an emotional impact always guaranteed. Out of parameters the artistic direction, a little less sincerely the animations. Otherwise, it's difficult to remain unmoved while peering down at the turian homeworld from its nearest moon, or to engage in battle with a gigantic Reaper that is razing entire buildings to the ground. BioWare, in a fit of arrogance, does not limit these terrible monsters to the scenario, but forces us to face them directly in incredibly spectacular clashes. Not least are the music revealed, a peremptory element to better immerse ourselves in this fascinating universe. Orchestral parts alternate with electronic arpeggios that refer to eighties sci-fi sounds, creating a mix of rare effectiveness capable of imprinting itself in memory. The piano sections that accompany Shepard's most reflective moments are not easily forgotten, as well as some author's license that is perhaps a little affected but effective. Of considerable impact the conclusion, of which we obviously cannot speak, but able to provide a series of truly unexpected twists that do full justice and coherence to the entire trilogy. Hardly anyone will be disappointed. The game is fully dubbed in Italian and features first-rate quality thanks to the voices of Claudio Moneta and Cinzia Massironi, respectively male and female Shepard, as well as many other voice actors of undisputed value. Unfortunately the audio in some parts is slightly out of sync with the lip, while in others it is completely missing. These are sporadic situations, but when they happen they are annoying, for this reason we advise you to activate the subtitles in the menus. Mass Effect 3 also offers an unprecedented section dedicated to online co-op for up to four players. These are specific modes of resistance against enemy hordes, capable of earning valuable points in the statistics of the single campaign.
