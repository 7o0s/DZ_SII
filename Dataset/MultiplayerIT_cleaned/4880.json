{"name": "Ingiustizia  fatta!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183187-injustice-2-ingiustizia-e-fatta.html", "text": "Announced last June, Injustice 2 arrives in stores four years after the release of Injustice: Gods Among Us. Quite a long time, which allowed the developers of NetherRealm Studios to refine the experience in various aspects, focusing even more on the narrative and making the most of the DC license and the peculiar setting: an alternative universe in which Superman lost sanity after the death of Lois Lane and the child she was carrying, deciding to create together with other metahumans a totalitarian world regime in which no more crimes are committed because, in fact, people have been deprived of their freedom. Batman, along with a handful of rebel heroes, decides to oppose this ruthless vision and manages to defeat the Kryptonian, confining him in a special prison that inhibits his powers. Years later, however, a new threat looms over planet Earth, the same one that had destroyed Krypton long before: Brainiac, the collector of worlds. Injustice 2 substantially improves on the experience of the first episode and does so in every respect An epic story You'll excuse the pun, but Injustice 2 really does justice to the DC license, going beyond the narrative limits of the first chapter thanks to an approach that never borders on out of place humor, but rather always stays on point, involves, motivates and he even has the luxury of sending a few shivers down our spine (see the oath recited at one point by Hal Jordan). The plot is credible and there are no simplifications, net of the equalization of characters whose abilities are enormously different, given that in the game Batman, Robin, Black Canary, Green Arrow and the other human heroes stand up to demigods such as Superman, Wonder Woman and Black Adams. Justifying all this would have required the use of special armor for all characters, which the developers have decided to exclude to avoid inflating a concept that is however put into play in the final stages of the campaign. The latter is made up of a total of twelve chapters, each divided into four fights (in which one alternates in command of different fighters, often freely selectable), but the last one is present in a double version with as many endings, depending of the faction with which we will decide to side. The matches take shape in a transparent way compared to the spectacular cutscenes, which makes the transitions particularly soft and guessed, a bit like in Naughty Dog productions but applying this vision to a fighting game rather than an action adventure. To support the splendid narration and an absolutely punctual direction, worthy of a film production, we find an excellent dubbing in Italian which takes up the cast of the Batman: Arkham series and therefore gives us a Marco Balzarotti (Batman) in the usual dazzling form, a Matteo Zanotti as Superman (good as always, but Nathan Drake's voice was perhaps not ideal for outlining the resolute characters of the superhero par excellence), some splendid sorties by Riccardo Peroni (the Joker) and excellent performances also for the rest of the actors involved. Truly a slap-up job, which adds depth to the experience and which these days deserves to be rewarded given that not all publishers invest in complete localization in Italian. Between men and gods The work done by NetherRealm Studios for Injustice 2 is highlighted not only by the excellent narrative component but also by the roster, which includes twenty-eight characters between heroes and villains, to which we must add the Darkseid preorder bonus, the inevitable reskins and future arrivals via DLC . There are fifteen new entries: the flaming Atrocitus, Green Lantern's nemesis; the cunning Black Canary, an expert in martial arts and counter; Blue Beetle, with his extremely powerful multiform armor; Brainiac, an unstoppable force from outer space; Captain Cold, who can create big headaches with his freeze rifle; Cheetah, wild and very fast enemy of Wonder Woman; Deadshot, the villain with unerring aim; Doctor Fate, a mysterious and ancient being, endowed with great magical powers; Firestorm, the fusion of two men with the ability to control atomic energy; Gorilla Grodd, a huge primate as evil as it is intelligent; Poison Ivy, able to control any plant; Robin, in this case Batman's natural son, Damian Wayne; Scarecrow, with its terror gas; Supergirl, the only survivor of Krypton other than Superman; and finally Swamp Thing, the gigantic monster that protects the swamp and nature. One thing to note is that each member of the roster boasts a unique and different stylefrom the others, there are therefore no photocopy characters and it is possible to master the skills of any fighter thanks to very similar key combinations and the lack of specific specializations: all the heroes and villains have moves both for melee attacks and for those from distance. As for the old acquaintances of Injustice: Gods Among Us, the moves have changed in several cases, in addition to all the specials: executable when the appropriate indicator is full, they allow you to inflict huge damage on your opponent through a predetermined sequence of great impact. The spectacular nature of these maneuvers is indisputable and is substantially superior to what was seen in the first episode of the series: Batman jumps on the enemy and treacherously connects him to a Fulton system to project him into the air, where he is hooked by the Batwing which, after the inevitable of Tim Burton's film on the full moon, he lets the victim fall by unloading bursts of machine guns and a missile at him; Supergirl drags her opponent beyond the sun, where she recharges her energy to emit it through optical beams, launching the enemy into meteors and causing them to crash into the planet; Green Lantern creates a huge robot by continuously hitting his target, until he unloads energy cannons on him; Cyborg throws the enemy onto Apokolips, where he is kicked by Darkseid's troops until he comes full circle, where he is hit by a huge laser beam; The Flash uses his speed to open time rifts and crash his opponent first into the face of an Egyptian sphinx, then into the face of a tyrannosaurus and finally into his own version of the past, creating a real paradox. Absolutely freaking out! Hits here, hits there The combat system of Injustice 2 uses the same approach of the first chapter, with three types of blow (light, medium, heavy), a special ability, a great emphasis on combos and the exploitation of crescents and ~charge~ in equal measure for executing moves. The victory of one or the other contender is determined by the emptying of both energy bars with which each character is equipped, an expedient that obviates the lack of traditional rounds while producing a few moments of pause between a phase and the other than combat. In the nuances of the combat system it is possible to recognize the trademarks of NetherRealm Studios: the decisive uppercut that projects the contender into the air, the flying ~dummy kick~ with all its extravagance, holds and counter-holds, as well as the excellent yield of impacts, which allows you to ~feel~ the blows and therefore returns great satisfaction. However, the scenarios also play a leading role during the matches, endowed with a great personality, rarely banal and always full of interactive elements: there are objects that we can grab and throw at the enemy, areas on which to jump to get out of a disadvantageous position arriving behind the opponent and even walls which, with a well-aimed blow, we can break through by projecting the other fighter into new areas, at the end of a very painful sequence (again) made up of destroyed buildings and unlikely bounces. Playstation 4 trophies To get most of the Injustice 2 Trophies you need to carry out specific actions that have to do with the characters involved in the matches: defeat Green Lantern with the Atrocitus special or Batman with the Bane special, Robin with Cyborg and so on . Then there are the achievements related to the completion of the campaign and online matches, ranked and not, but also those that are unlocked by obtaining a certain number of items and equipment. Structure and technique The main menu of Injustice 2 allows you to try your hand at the single player component, with local and online multiplayer. The latter, equipped with a good set of variants, according to the tests we were able to carry out, works quite well: the matchmaking is fast, there are no problems related to latency and therefore it is possible to score moves and countermoves without any difficulty. although obviously it will be necessary to wait for the servers to be opened to the general public to verify that the infrastructure holds up well and maintains the efficiency it has demonstrated with a small number of professionals. Then there are four further sections: the customization mode, which allows you to use the unlocked objects to modify all the characters on the roster and vary not only their aesthetics and colors but also their abilities, in a very similar way to what happens with the loot in RPGs;the Brother Eye Caveau, the place where all the Mother Boxes that we obtained during our game sessions are stored, to be opened one by one to reveal their contents; the Guilds, real clubs that can be joined with a view to common challenges and rewards, complete with a leaderboard; and finally the area of the extras, where we will find artwork, character sheets and so on. As already done for Injustice: Gods Among Us, the developers have seen fit not to limit the single player to the campaign alone, which necessarily has a limited duration, adding to the package a virtually infinite mode called ~Multiverse~ and a ~Simulator of Combat~ which acts as an arcade mode, complete with bosses and endings for each character. Sinking its roots in one of the narrative elements that have always characterized the DC universe, namely the alternative worlds, this option offers a series of timed events with a variable degree of difficulty, which must be completed by winning a series of matches influenced by specific modifiers : Zero-G bouncing that exposes you to mid-air attacks, dropping life energy into the stage, extra support from the Martian Manhunter, buzzsaws popping out of the ground and injuring both characters, and so on. It is precisely from the point of view of the Multiverse that the RPG aspects of the customizations find their ideal location, given that some challenges require a certain level of experience to be able to be faced and the use of equipment with bonuses can only be of help in such situations. However, we must take into account the fact that the Multiverse, with its challenges and fight sequences, does not boast the same variety of extras related to the single player of Mortal Kombat X, which from this point of view remains a step above. So let's come to the technical realization, another topic on which we can only spend good words. In fact, if the graphics of Injustice: Gods Among Us suffered from some ingenuity, mainly due to its old-gen nature (the game was originally released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and was only later remastered for current generation systems), this second chapter boasts an absolutely excellent, accurate and refined cosmetics, with detailed and convincing polygonal models, as well as a good set of animations. The aforementioned transition from cutscenes to real matches represents a very valuable extra, the sixty frames per second are granite and on PlayStation 4 Pro it is also possible to enjoy HDR (which makes certain sequences - see for example the Superman special - even more spectacular) and a resolution that should be equal to 1440p, although for the precise data we will have to wait for the inevitable technical analyzes carried out with precision instruments. Sure, there are a few niggles here and there (the dated smoke effects when Brainiac's spaceship sucks up buildings, for example), but the overall level feels great and the soundtrack is amazing - as epic and immersive as you'd expect from such a product, capable of underlining in the best way the various situations that occur throughout history.", "date": "2017-05-16", "grade": "8.7"}
