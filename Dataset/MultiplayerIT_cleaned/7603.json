Since the first episodes for SEGA Dreamcast, the series has always stood out for its highly simulative soul and careful attention to detail, so much so that it has become the undisputed queen of simulations dedicated to basketball. It was EA Sports that paid the price in this generation, forced to cancel its historic franchise NBA Live. A case of absolute supremacy that has brought 2K Sports into a rather uncomfortable position, finding itself particularly exposed to criticism from those who consider each new episode not innovative enough to justify its purchase. On the other hand, we know that the annual frequency for a sports series is a thorny issue, radical changes involve considerable risks, such as what Konami ran with the latest incarnation of PES. We immediately anticipate that this is not the case with NBA 2K14, a chapter that plays it safe by refining where possible, taking advantage of the charismatic figure of Lebron James to give a precise imprint to the title. In short, nothing sensational under the sun, the operation had already been successfully carried out using the legendary Michael Jordan, but this time Visual Concepts has an ace up its sleeve that will delight many. Global village The title opens with a touching cinematic that shows us a more human King James than usual, complete with a beating heart, which tells us how success is never free and must be conquered with tenacity, sacrifice and conviction. The Manifesto of the American Dream. Everything else is not boring, but certainly something already widely seen in 2K13, starting from the menus and the preparation of our player, who represents a real persistent avatar in which we can invest using the credits accumulated in the various modes. It is on this occasion that the first novelty emerges, the elimination of VC Points, the virtual currency of the previous chapter which could be purchased by paying it with real money. This involves the elimination of microtransactions, an addition that had brought a long series of criticisms for how it was going to alter the balance of online multiplayer. All in all, a wise decision on the part of the developers, but the novelty that turns the spotlight on this chapter is the presence of the Euroleague teams. For the first time in the history of the franchise it is possible to use teams such as Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Olimpia Milano, giving the title a new flavor by virtue of the different style of play and potentially expanding the catchment area. The other modes are all there, starting from the intricate Association, the My Player career which sees us fight among the rookies to earn a place in the first division teams, training and the inevitable Blacktop mode. On the other hand, the All Star Weekend and its mini-games have disappeared again, a content that will probably be offered as a separate DLC. The title is as always freely customizable in all its parts. Another novelty of this edition is the career dedicated to Lebron James: we are free to choose to relive his rise in the Miami Heat or face a scenario of pure fantasy. An addition that frankly seemed forced to us, not at all comparable to the Legends of past editions and which inexplicably does not allow us to replicate the athlete's early years in the Cleveland Cavaliers. Fortunately, the classic teams have remained intact, so it is still possible to play a game as Larry Bird or Scottie Pippen. Higher and higher Once on the field, the production values dedicated to NBA 2K14 are clear, even if substantially it remains indistinguishable from the previous episode: the engine continues to impress positively thanks to the fluid animations and the detail of the players, but it is clear that the developers' attention is now aimed at the imminent nextgen edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. However, the qualitative levels achieved by Visual Concepts are undeniable, if we exclude some faces less successful than others, the action flows so harmoniously as to be confused with a real game and finds an ideal one apotheosis in setting up the surrounding scenes. The performance of the arenas is also excellent, with a well-defined polygonal audience that reacts based on the actions of the athletes. The commentary (still in English) is full of expressions and always accurate, while the audio sector takes advantage of the usual, daring selection of songs ranging from hip hop to rock. Let's not be afraid to hear Coldplay alongside Daft Punk, Gorillaz, Jay-Z or Puff Daddy in short. NBA 2K14 is the threeomphale witness a saga now at its peak in this generation of consoles On the gameplay side there are appreciable improvements, such as better rebounding performance by the defense, more effective blocks and a further refinement of the right stick to perform feints, called Isomotion, which often lead to spectacular flights to the basket. Small filings that do not betray the basic formula, increasingly based on a complex and uncompromising simulation model. The novelty is represented by the possibility of making plays on the fly by pressing the right backbone, a feature that further fluidifies the action, but NBA 2K14 remains a demanding title that requires great dedication on the part of the player, essentially addressing only fans of this sport. Anyone intending to throw two basketballs to relax can easily look the other way. Xbox 360 goals NBA 2K14 features 50 goals for a total of 1000 player points. As usual, the first 10 are earned by listening to the playlist that Lebron James has kindly selected for us. For the rest there will be a lot to sweat, including getting a contract from some big sponsor in career mode, or facing all the challenges with the Chosen One. Good luck! Evolution or refinement? Another inevitable aspect also in this edition is that of online multiplayer, always full of modes, which as mentioned should benefit from the elimination of VC Points. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this review, the servers are not yet active, so it is impossible to evaluate the goodness of the netcode, we can only hope that this year it will not be affected by the various episodes of lag encountered in previous years. As always, the Live Today function will synchronize with the times of real league matches, thus offering a complete virtual experience. NBA 2K14 is ultimately much more related to last year's edition than it would have been reasonable to assume, with a substantially indistinguishable graphic design and many stylistic similarities, including menus and music. All elements that take away something from the legitimacy of the purchase for those who already own the previous chapter. However, the presence of the Euroleague teams and the appreciable refinements to the gameplay are elements in clear favor of the 2K Sports product, considering that the former represents a novelty of historical value for the series.", "date": "2013-09-24", "grade": "9.0"}
