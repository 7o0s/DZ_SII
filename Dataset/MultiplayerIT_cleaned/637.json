It is in fact the first incarnation of the brand on Microsoft platforms, in a role, among other things, similar to the Sony ones, that is to show the potential of the new hardware. What about the game? Instead of revolutionizing the gaming sector, the programmers have worked on refinement, smoothing, accumulation. So much so that this sixth episode, a close descendant of the PSP version, is undoubtedly among the best ever made by Namco. But such a traditionalist vocation, so exquisitely radical and indifferent to the evolutions seen in the recent exponents of the genre, requires an appropriate understanding on the part of the player. In RR6 you drift continuously and run like the damned, regardless of the force of gravity and its repercussions on the roaring vehicles. The logical conclusion of this choice is that old enthusiasts will gloat satisfied, while those who have passed from titles such as Project Gotham Racing 3 may have some reservations. Reiko i love you But let's go step by step analyzing the latest Namco effort in detail. After the usual introductory film (in which we can admire the historic testimonial Reiko Nagase) we arrive in a rich main menu, which marries the tested, sober and futuristic graphic layout of the PSP version, but with the new 360 colors: white and pastel green. The result is very pleasant and classy, with hexagonal graphic elements recurring in the various modes, especially the main one, the World Explorer, an exhausting challenge made up of no less than two hundred and thirty races arranged in a honeycomb map. Each race is marked by a box (obviously hexagonal) numbered according to the level of difficulty. The navigation is completely dynamic, the player can choose the path to follow by unlocking the various challenges, the main purpose is the conquest of the numerous cars available, essential for the timed and online modes. In RR6 you drift continuously and run like the damned, regardless of the force of gravity and its repercussions on the roaring vehicles Reiko i love you The WE has a very slow but inexorable difficulty curve, the first half is easily manageable even by the casual player, while the second represents a considerable challenge, including among other things the historic head-to-head races already seen in past episodes. The most coveted trophy are the cars of the special category, bizarre prototypes resulting from the fervent imagination of Namco programmers, among these we find the inevitable Pacman car, futuristic hovercraft and much more. Once the game has progressed, it is also possible to unlock an editor to change the colors of the cars, audio comments and mini-games. Among the other available modes we find the evergreen single race and time trial, the latter enriched by online rankings relating to the selected route and updated in real time by Live; it is even possible to save one's own lap record (ghost) on the server, or download the opponents' ones to the hard disk. A truly commendable completeness. Can the nextgen wait? Namco has gone big in terms of available circuits, a good fifteen plus their respective versions backwards, and all unpublished. Given the strong propensity for this title to be online, all the courses are usable from the beginning, in order to allow the player to train immediately. As usual, some tracks are derived from variants of the same base, but presented in different climatic conditions, as can be seen in the symbolic circuit of this chapter, Harborline 765. Starting the race, the impressions are contradictory, the graphics engine is extremely fast and anchored at 60 FPS, rich in polygons and animated graphic elements, such as airships, helicopters and windmills, but the general appearance, although worthy of today's arcade cabinet, is more reminiscent of an older generation title pushed to the graphic limit. We know very well that the 360 can do much more than that, as evidenced by the absence of the effects already admired in PGR3. Even the color palette is in many cases excessively dull, presenting washed-out shades or tending towards greyish and sepia. The result is an aspect that is even too realistic for a game that is philosophically polar opposite. All this is clearly intentional and not incidental, but those who remember the first RRs cannot help but agree on the questionability of this choice. On the other hand, the cars are definitely beautiful to look at and the asphalt has a hint of bump mapping that embellishes its appearance, but honestly it's too little from hardware like this. An HD connection, as expected, improves things slightly, but alat the same time ruthlessly highlights the paucity of some textures. The design of the runways fluctuates, some are perhaps too anonymous and empty, others denote the talent of Namco graphics, such as the passage on the Harborline 765 bridge, the bucolic views of Highland Cliff or the evocative (and inevitable) airport. As already mentioned, the impressive speed of the game is surprising, especially noticeable with the internal view and the best performing cars. Although devoid of a nextgen aspect, the graphics engine is really handsome and without uncertainties. The references to the old classics of the Japanese house dwell on the bodies of the cars and the posters on the edge of the track, all faithfully reproduced on the Xbox 360. Can the nextgen wait? The music also follows the tradition, Namco has called all the historical composers of the saga, from Sanodg to Kota Takahashi, who offer us songs oscillating between old school techno rave, house lounge and other typically dance genres, but reinterpreted with the typical panache Oriental. For aficionados, the result is guaranteed, and the possibility of buying other songs from the market place will certainly be appreciated, while all the others will be able to resort to personalized soundtracks. The Virtual DJ, on the other hand, is awful, a speaker who comments on the various maneuvers, intrusive and tedious, but fortunately it can be deactivated. Faster than light! Playability is hand-in-hand with the PSP version: in addition to the necessary drift when cornering, nitro is also present in this incarnation, short charges that offer consistent acceleration to the machine, collected in three tanks that are recharged following a drift well executed. Making the best use of this system is essential for winning races, both offline and online, given that it is possible to exploit the tanks individually or in combination, obtaining an even greater speed increase in the latter case. For the rest, as we have anticipated, the game is distinctly arcade and offers elementary gameplay, with the cars bouncing on the edge of the track without a hint of damage. It is a precise choice, a characteristic that the saga has been carrying around since the beginning, but which will certainly divide the opinions of the players today. We spend the last words for the online multiplayer mode, with full Live 360 support, and equipped with a satisfactory number of options and possibilities for customizing the races. Up to 14 players can participate in competitions at the same time, choosing from custom matches or world-ranked matchmaking. If the routes are available to all participants, the cars remain tied to each user's garage, so the advantage for those who have unlocked the most is obvious, and how important it is to face the World Explorer to get them. Unfortunately we cannot fail to highlight some shadows that afflict this mode, mainly related to the connection delay (lag) by some users. This inconvenience prevents you from facing a race regularly, as those affected by lag will not be visible by the opponents until the final ranking. The problem affects only a part of the players and is probably sensitive to the connection zone, but the delay by a single car is enough to compromise the credibility of the entire race. We hope that with the imminent release of the European version the problem will be solved, because the mode is really a lot of fun and enriches the game considerably. Difficult to evaluate this new chapter in the Namco saga. A lot of water has passed under the arcade racing bridge, with new exponents, perspectives and philosophies. RR6 shuns all of this and continues undeterred the discourse left with the PSP version: many circuits, a vast and long-lived offline mode, self-quotes and nostalgia, more of the same to the nth degree. Enough to be the best Ridge Racer ever and, paradoxically, one of the least significant titles in the 360 line-up. This is because its owners will not be able to avoid turning up their noses when comparing it to PGR3 and its graphic superiority. Although the sensation of a perfect arcade is stronger than ever, the Namco title sacrifices effects and textures in honor of a truly supersonic, intoxicating speed, but which cannot completely overlook a 128-bit sector that does very little justice to the console. A far greater problem is the uncertainty of the online mode, plagued by lag that compromises the races, an inconvenience that we hope will be resolved as soon as possible, because playing against thirteen human opponents elevates the experience to a higher level. Who is willing to forget for a moment the specifics of the new Microsoft jewel, but searchhe fun and light-heartedness will find a very valid exponent in Namco racing. Despite the years, that drift still manages to amaze... Pros Very funny and immediate Very long-lived World Explorer Supersonic speed at 60 FPS Cons Only old enthusiasts will really appreciate it Graphics engine not up to hardware Lag-affected online mode Twelve years have passed since the famous Namco racing saga made its debut on PSX, and philosophically very little has changed: a perfect transposition of Pac Man gladdens the initial loading, the references to the old classics of the Japanese house dwell on the car bodies and trackside posters, all faithfully reproduced on Xbox 360. And the game itself remains faithful to the original intentions: fun, immediate, unrealistic. In two words: blatantly arcade.", "date": "2006-01-27", "grade": null}
