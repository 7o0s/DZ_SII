Available today at the standard price of 9.99 or 800 Microsoft Points and free for all Season Pass subscribers, let's see if this DLC is able to give new life to the survivors of Pandora. Frontal assault We start right off on the right foot in Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, thanks to a setting conceived with the right combination of madness and genius: the scenario is in fact that of a role-playing game along the lines of Dungeons & Dragons, with the schizophrenic Tiny Tina to master and the reluctant Brick, Mordecai and Lilith forced to participate in a crazy adventure whose purpose is to rescue the Queen of Flamerock from the clutches of the Handsome Sorcerer. The pawns in this case are the players, immersed in an absolutely new fantasy context for Borderlands 2 but developed by Gearbox with particular attention to detail. Therefore, there are not only new maps inspired by rpg clichs and enemies in line with the scenario such as skeletons, ogres, dragons, dwarves, knights and sorcerers, but substantially every key element of the playful universe has undergone some powerful tweaks to be closer to the world of role-playing games: to name a few, the vending machines for provisions and ammunition are represented here as sanctuaries (with Zed and Marcus who define themselves respectively as cleric and merchant), some weapons clearly border on the territory of magic (such as grenades that are thrown like a ball of fire or lightning) and even the voice of the rebirth stations adopts new phrases that fish in the fantasy imagination with the usual dose of irony. In short, Gearbox's commitment is evident from many small details, which fortunately are only the very pleasant kit of an expansion with a lot of irons in the fire. Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is above all very funny thanks to the extravaganzas of the game organizer, with her constant mood swings that are reflected directly on the scenario: it is not uncommon to see enemies or settings change suddenly due to some bizarre decision of hers, or even finding complex environmental puzzles already solved just because she got tired of waiting. However, the greatest satisfactions come from the more purely playful sector, for an expansion that proves to be the ideal continuation for all those who have already finished the game even in True Hunter mode. To begin with, the adventure is really challenging, with rather tough enemies that require different strategies to be killed and a good number of bosses that are anything but tender; the additional maps are then particularly extensive, with various secondary missions and ravines to explore in search of chests full of loot. Precisely in this last respect, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep does not spare itself, distributing rare equipment with a certain fluency even as a reward for killing the toughest opponents. The developers then adopted some stratagem also to make users spend a part of the Eridium accumulated by force of circumstances after having purchased all the upgrades on the black market: therefore, by paying out a few crystals you can play with particular slot machines , use altars that enhance specific characteristics for a short time or unlock special chests whose content quality is directly proportional to the value of the 20 dice (yet another reference to the world of role-playing games) thrown at the time of opening. The one offered by Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is therefore a playful experience that is certainly more dense than in the previous expansions, a sensation confirmed by the total absence of vehicles and by the more massive presence of enemies, often enhanced by a constant rebirth of the same that does not leave literally a breather. The approximately eight hours necessary to complete the main quest go by without dead moments, ending with the clash with a boss perhaps too little mammoth by the standards of Borderlands 2, but still capable of giving a hard time even to the crypt hunters more savvy. In our very personal case, the conclusion deThe adventure left us a little bitter in the mouth for a final loot far below expectations, the only discordant note of a DLC that still allowed us to significantly flesh out the inventory of new items, to try our hand at a new raid boss and to progress a few steps towards the new character growth limit set at level 61. And for a game that has been out for nine months, still being able to give certain stimuli is no mean feat.", "date": "2013-06-25", "grade": null}
