Something that, despite the undeniable fun that the game easily causes in everyone, leads us to reflect on how times have changed since we stared at the Game Boy's monochrome screen and the afternoons seemed much longer. Just listen to the speeded up and basically dubstep version of Korobeiniki, the famous soundtrack, to realize it. Speed, short and compact experiences, in-app purchases and social connections have invaded the staid and methodical experience of interlocking tetrominoes, transforming Aleksej Pazhitnov's rigorous logical game into a blaze of competitive gameplay that burns quickly, but also burns with an undoubtedly higher intensity. In practice, the new EA game takes up the classic structure and limits it to a time of 2 minutes, within which the aim is to reach the highest possible score. The mechanics are always based on the interlocking of bricks, completing the lines and thus making them disappear to free up space, but the new time limits substantially change the perspective: it is no longer a question of procrastinating the inevitable defeat as much as possible, managing the descent of tetrominoes with increasing speed up to the limits of human possibilities, but to try to make the most of the little time available to maximize the score. In this new mechanic, the power-ups take on a fundamental role, which expand the possibilities of eliminating lines and give significant advantages in terms of scores and multipliers, but at a considerable cost in terms of in-game currency. And here obviously the dynamics of in-app purchases come into play, which also bring with them the worst consequence of pay-to-win, to be taken into account if you want to take the ~social~ challenge against friends particularly seriously and rivals on Facebook. However, overall, Tetris Blitz is a well-calibrated game even for those who don't intend to spend money over and over again and also thanks to the particular time limit imposed on each game, it adapts perfectly to the mobile context, favoring quick sessions and constantly enticing to the next game. With the segmentation into two-minute experiences, the epic of testing the limits of human endurance is missing, in the long challenges against oneself of the original version, but the game gains in freshness and dynamism, also thanks to the possibility, offered at the end of each game, to change the skills to be used in the next game with the purchase of power-ups. Two minutes of glory The speeding up of the game also involved the control system, which instead of proposing the free movement of the tetromino offers pre-set solutions, directly displaying the possible placements of the descending piece. In practice, the game alone shows the various interlocking possibilities (which also vary according to the key used for rotation) and leaves the player with the simple choice of which solution to adopt, by touching one of the various projections that anticipate the points in which it will be possible to interlock the piece. At first it may seem an excessive simplification or a significant distortion for the fan of the original version, but soon one realizes that it is a necessary solution to gain time in view of the two minutes of the match, resetting the times of waiting in the heat of the high score. The accumulation of points is accelerated by the execution of ~tetris~, i.e. clearing four lines together, and by the activation of multipliers, as well as the entry into play of power-ups. The latter can be purchased by spending the virtual money won in the game or bought with real money. These modifiers are of various types and have different effects, all aimed at facilitating the deletion of lines: at the beginning of each game, a choice of up to three power-ups from the entire catalog is implemented which will come into action during the two minutes subsequent. Each bonus is consumed after three games, therefore it is not easy to always have them available and the purchase through only the money accumulated in-game, without the expenditure of real money, becomes quite difficult. Within the time limits imposed it is not easy to conquer huge amounts of virtual money in a short time, which stimulates the perverse in-app purchase mechanism, given that the scores that are reached with three activated power-ups are far higher than the collection chance with fewer active modifiers and tend to create a certain ~addiction~ to high scores. It is here that Tetris Blitz demonstrates its full potential as a money-eating trap, because at the structural level it is a matter ofis a game that could very well be sustained without resorting to micro-transactions, but the deepest soul of the game hides the dark side of competition at all costs, to which the insistent request to publish scores on Facebook is linked. It is clear that no one is pointing a gun at our head to force us to spend something on this game, which is basically still a free title, but this enormous imbalance between the scores that can be reached with several ~rich~ power-ups active and one or no usable modifier distorts the chances of a challenge on equal terms without a minimum rush to purchase bonuses. For the rest, Tetris Blitz probably represents one of the best variants of Tetris in circulation in the mobile sector, also accompanied by an excellent and functional aesthetic, simple and clean as per tradition but with various graphic effects capable of enlivening the action on the screen . Tetris blazes from two minutes a game, but the obsession with the high score can hit the wallet", "date": "2013-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
