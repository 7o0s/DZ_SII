{"name": "Capcom Beat Em Up Bundle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/capcom-beat-em-up-bundle-la-recensione.html", "text": "The heyday of side-scrolling beat 'em ups, which lasted from the late 80s to mid 90s, was a wonderful moment in video game history, with titles that literally drove the spread of coin-ops and brought millions closer of people to electronic entertainment, one coin after another. Together with SEGA, the absolute protagonist in this sense was Capcom, which gave birth to some of the best exponents of the genre throughout this cycle. During the Nintendo Direct in mid-September, the Japanese company announced the imminent release of the Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle which, as the name itself suggests to the smartest, is nothing more than a collection of some of those titles. Seven, to be exact, and the list is quickly made: Final Fight (1989), The King of Dragons (1991), Knights of the Round (1991), Captain Commando (1991), Warriors of Fate (1992), Armored Warriors (1994) and Battle Circuit (1997). Important names that enthusiasts know well. Are they the best exponents of the genre? Difficult to argue, because beyond personal tastes the absence of big names like Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Alien vs. Predator and Dungeons & Dragons, obviously motivated by licensing reasons, inevitably reduce the encyclopaedic value of the collection. Of course, one can easily ~satisfy~ with what the convent passes, considering the quality of the games and the sale price of 20, which correctly positions Capcom's proposal on the market: less than 3 for a single game is in fact a honest figure from our point of view. Two unreleased console games To provide a further element of interest to the product, also helping to distinguish it from the Capcom Classic Collections already released several years ago, there are two titles that stand out for being in all respects unpublished for the home market: yes it is precisely Armored Warriors and Battle Circuit, respectively dated '94 and '97, up to now playable therefore only in the arcade or via emulators. The first has as its main feature the presence, in the role of protagonists, of four pilots of as many huge Mechs; each of them, endowed with peculiar characteristics, is able to equip extra parts and weapons with which to have access to additional skills. It is a solution capable of giving a good additional variety to an already extremely spectacular title, thanks above all to the very generous size of the sprites on the screen and the many graphic effects. Unfortunately, these latest efforts by Capcom in the genre of scrolling beat'em ups denote a clear imbalance between the playful and the aesthetic component: The result is that Armored Warriors proves to be a game that is often too chaotic, in which it is easy to lose the perception of what is really happening in front of your eyes. Similar speech also for Battle Circuit, to all intents and purposes the latest title belonging to this trend developed by Capcom: also in this case the setting is totally over the top, although the protagonists are ~normal~ characters with great fighting skills . The peculiarity lies in the possibility of buying, between one level and another, new moves that can then be used freely through combinations of directions and keys: a sort of approach point for fighting games to encounters with scrolling ones, which at least partially alleviates the atavistic repetitiveness of the action of this kind of game. Technique and online modality From a technical point of view, Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle is a job done without particular effort: the emulation is always fully convincing, but the structure of the menus and their graphics are far from exciting, to put it mildly. The games all obviously run in the original 4:3 format, with a background that fills the remaining selectable portion of the screen within a short list. The gallery instead includes drafts, drawings, artwork and posters to explore the genesis and planning of the artistic component of each title. Probably the most interesting addition is the online component, which allows you to access multiplayer without necessarily having to have a companion by your side. Although with a very basic structure, this mode is certainly helpful in allowing the games contained in the Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle to express themselves at their best, or with at least one other player to share the progression with. Obviously, where possible, in 3 or 4 is even more fun. The netcode seemed good to us but the conditions of the test, with the servers called to manage only very few users, require us to maintain the benefit of the doubt. However, Switch represents without hesitation the ideal environment for the Capcom title, especially for the extreme accessssibility of local multiplayer through the two Joy-Con: the simplicity of the interface of the various games lends itself well to the limits of this solution, and only the reduced stroke and the modest precision of the sticks give some headaches, especially when you want to activate the stroke through double quick input in one direction.", "date": "2018-09-18", "grade": "8.0"}
