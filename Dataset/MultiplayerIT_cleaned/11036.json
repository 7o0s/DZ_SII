{"name": "Silent Hill: Homecoming - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-hill-homecoming-recensione.html", "text": "There are games intended to be talked about, to leave a mark. Products capable of generating enormous interest and great expectation among insiders and enthusiasts already many months before their release on the market. Either because they are well advertised by the development house, or because perhaps they belong to a ten-year series of video games that are quite famous and loved by the public. In all these cases the hype gets stronger as the days go by from the date of their announcement. One of the games that can fall into the category just mentioned is certainly Silent Hill: Homecoming, the long-awaited survival game by Konami, postponed for the European market from last October to this month of February 2009 for no apparent reason, given that on balance this version has no nothing different than NTSC. Directed by Masashi Tsuboyama and with a soundtrack by Maestro Akira Yamaoka, the fifth or sixth chapter, depending on how you look at it, of the popular horror saga of the Japanese softo, was designed by the developers to return the series to its themes and its typical settings, thus detaching itself stylistically from Silent Hill 4 to be ideally inspired by the second chapter, perhaps the most loved by fans. For now we won't tell you if this objective has been achieved, but only that the game can be considered as the normal continuation and evolution of the first three ~regular~ episodes of the saga (the fourth, as mentioned above, is in some ways considered almost a product in itself). Which is no small thing. Back to the past Let's start by talking about the plot, a key element of this production, which keeps faith with the fame of the series, proving to be very interesting and typically ~Silenthillian~ (at least from a certain point on), if you pass the term, even if it probably isn't of that Silent Hill 2 masterpiece (and here we stop to avoid the risk of spoilers). From the outset, the atmosphere that permeates the game is distressing, tense. There is a feeling of insecurity and overwhelming terror almost every moment. And various cinematographic citations, such as the clear introductory reference to both Adrian Lyne's film Perverse hallucination (~Jacob's Ladder~, always as mentioned several times in other articles, a point of reference and source of inspiration for the old Team Silent) and to the Silent comic Hill: Among the Damned, or that, later, to all previous episodes of the game (notes, location names, small details. Also who is in a hotel room?). Explosions, the sound of a siren, screams of pain. Then a hospital, lights, nurses, a sense of emptiness. The appearance of little Joshua, the monsters. A nightmare, waking up on the truck that is taking us home to Shepherd's Glen. But the city is different, it's not the one we left long ago. The fog envelops the houses, the monuments, the trees. The streets are deserted and the few inhabitants we meet seem to have changed compared to those we knew. Even old childhood friends, like Elle, have something strange about them. Was the one I had on the truck really just a nightmare? Or is this what we are living and will live? The answer will come from playing Silent Hill: Homecoming. Gameplay and news In general, the game structure of Silent Hill: Homecoming does not differ much from its predecessors. In fact we are faced with a classic adventure in which the camera is totally free and manageable this time, and where with the character you control it is possible to move to explore certain areas, search and collect clues and face dozens of monsters. There is no shortage of puzzles, initially simple but then increasingly complex and requiring a certain creativity to be solved. What is new is the system that manages the dialogues in the game and which allows gamers to choose the answers to give to the characters encountered during the adventure, but also which questions to ask them. There are three types of key phrases that determine a conversation and subsequent cut-scene. One question or answer rather than another have their own unique function. In the current state of the game (we have completed it only once) we can tell you with certainty that these choices cannot influence the type of ending to be achieved, except in three key moments in the story (towards the end of the adventure) where, based on the choices you make may lead to a different conclusion. In the exploration phases it is also possible to switch from the third person view to the more comfortable subjective view, perhaps when an object or clue is identified, in order to better analyze the environments and the elements present in it. Although in this case to highlight the fact that it is not possible to move. Sometimes it happensnto certain objects, multiple messages may appear, such as ~Examine~ or ~Use~, so you have to be careful and not be in too much of a hurry to move on to another action, otherwise you will lose important elements such as useful clues or items. Another novelty consists in the game signaling the various objectives to be achieved while exploring an area with an icon that appears in the upper left corner of the screen. By accessing the map menu and pressing the Square key, these objectives will be shown as a reminder. Even more a ~quick button~ system that allows the player by pressing a button on the pad or the directional cross to be able to take advantage of health drinks and health kits to heal quickly, or to change weapons and reload them. But the most consistent innovations are found in the battle system. The Development Team Silent Hill: Homecoming was developed for the first time by an American team, and not by the famous Team Silent, the one behind the first four chapters of the saga. Initially the project was entrusted to The Collective, former authors of the game Buffy The Vampire Slayer, with the supervision of Masashi Tsuboyama and Akira Yamaoka. The Collective later merged with another group of developers, Shiny Entertainment, to form Double Helix Games and thus accelerate development and production times. The fights In fact, the new combat system deserves a separate discussion. In fact, there are too many novelties to be able to liquidate them in a few lines. Let's start immediately by saying that it mixes different styles borrowed from various genres in a more or less successful way, in a mix that includes real-time actions complete with combos and counterattacks, quick time events and ~final moves~... But before that some of you start tearing your clothes as a sign of pain read on. Basically, the fight takes place as in the old chapters of the series, so don't expect a purely action twist to Resident Evil 4, only with greater speed in some cases or with more enemies, so as to make the clashes more ~dynamic~ or tough, especially if you are faced with very agile enemies, such as dogs. And new features. The attacks that can be performed with edged weapons or blunt objects, for example, are now divided into two categories: they can be fast, i.e. those that can be performed with the repeated pressure of a single key, often used to generate combos, or strong, slow to execute but lethal, almost always useful if performed at the end of a sequence of the first ones, as a decisive blow. The type of weapon used obviously affects the effectiveness of a combo or its speed of execution. In fact, each offensive element has its own peculiarity and allows you to carry out a whole series of different actions from object to object. For example, what can be done with the key combination while holding a knife is different from what can be done with an iron pipe: the first can be useful for hit and run attacks, the second for those where perhaps also shield with the same contraption. The use of weapons Because even the enemies, who are equipped with a fairly advanced AI, can in turn defend themselves, counterattack and use combos, often combining them, so it is essential to ~cover up~. Sometimes, however, it is impossible to avoid being literally slaughtered by the combined attack of several monsters at the same time. The alternative, not always effective, is to avoid enemy shots by dodging them. By pressing the appropriate button on the pad at the right time with the analog stick, in fact, our hero can move around dodging the attacker's blow or roll away in any direction. By pressing immediately after one of the action keys (the Square key is effective, for the heaviest blows) you can finally go on to counterattack. When an opponent is dazed from a series of blows received, it is possible to give him the grace. Based on the weapon equipped and the type of monster (some can be finished normally like in the old Silent Hill), one of the buttons of the PlayStation 3 controller will appear on the screen: at that point, by pressing it in time, Alex will perform a ~final move ~ complete with cut-scene generated with the same engine of the game. In some situations, as we have already had the opportunity to see in Silent Hill Origins, QTEs may occur during the clashes: also in this case, as is now customary, you have to be careful of the key that appears on the screen which indicates which one you have to press on the pad quickly to perform an action. The situation is different in the attack phases with firearms. In these cases Silent Hill: Homecoming in fact adopts a new framing very similar to that seen in Capcom's Resident Evil 4, and that is with the camera positioned inhigh on the protagonist's right shoulder and viewfinder to be used to best hit the monsters. This does not mean that the whole game is a sort of rip-off of the title starring Leon, but simply that for the first time in this saga you are offered the possibility to better see who you are shooting at and to aim at body parts of the enemy you want to shoot down without hitting randomly. Technical realization Technically the game has its ups and downs, perhaps also due to the fact that the latter under construction has undergone an acceleration for marketing needs. In some locations and at certain times the graphics are very detailed, worthy or almost worthy of the potential offered by the current generation of consoles. The Otherworld is a concrete example, as well as the care with which the nurses were made, sexy, despite the deformity of the faces, and detailed as never before. Or the passage always to the alternative reality, clearly inspired by the one seen in Christophe Gans' film and certain locations such as the gloomy Parisian-style cemetery. In other moments it almost seems to lose quality to the point of giving the player the sensation of having in front of a ~clean~ but flat version of what has been seen in other productions, but for the PlayStation 2. Some floors, or roofs, or even the clothes of some of the secondary characters (the deputy sheriff), just to give some examples, are of a unique ugliness if seen up close, and clash in the context... It must be said, however, that the dark settings, the excellent real-time lighting system that generates fantastic shadow effects, and some artfully created make-up help to camouflage, at least in part, these imperfections. Always keeping in the wake of tradition, in fact, the graphics have opted for the use of the classic ~old movie~ filter in game, with that patina capable of ~dirtying~ the view of the scenes. Overall, the enemy design is nice. Some creatures, like one of the bosses you will meet at a certain point in the adventure, seem to come from the perverse mind of the artist Hans Bellmer, who already inspired Masahiro Ito in the past, the Monster Designer of the first three chapters of the Konami saga, especially in the mannequins of chapter two. Unfortunately there are also some drops in framerate in certain situations and strange graphic bugs to report. One of the most obvious is the one we renamed ~solid darkness~: in some particularly dark environments, occasionally, even with the flashlight on, the light seems unable to scratch the surrounding darkness and project the beam of light towards the door that we are about to reach to move on to another environment. As if there was some sort of invisible barrier. As for the sound, we have well-made music and effects. Akira Yamaoka never denies himself and gives us a soundtrack that is probably among the most beautiful of the entire saga, such as the disturbing ~Demons in Shepherd's Glen~ or ~Hell descent~ or the cantatas ~One more soul to the call~ and ~The Sacred Line~ interpreted by the all-round artist Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, successful actress, voice actress and singer seen at work in various guises in various TV films (Star Trek Voyager), films (Silent Hill), anime (Wolf's Rain - Lady Jagura , Appleseed - Athena Areios) and videogames (Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME ,Silent Hill Origins, Silent Hill 3, Silent Hill 4). With an ad hoc Dolby Surround system we can guarantee that you will not remain insensitive to the sound show offered to you. Comment Scary, dark and disturbing in some moments at the right point, Silent Hill: Homecoming is one of those titles that is difficult for an editor to evaluate. In fact, passing an opinion on a game like this without displeasing someone is not very simple, just as it is not to evaluate it without taking into account some key factors, such as the appeal that such a product is able to arouse around itself regardless of what may be any imperfections. If you do it from the point of view of the enthusiast of the series and of the type of adventure-horror products, then the last chapter of the ~silent hill~ cannot fail to please even with all its defects. Settings, enemies, music, plot, everything in this sense appears positive, in line with the style that has characterized the Konami saga. If, on the other hand, it is evaluated from that of the casual player of the genre or in any case ~impartial~, then it is undeniable that the product has some things to improve, due to an imperfect technical realization and a game system that in any case needs a ~ rejuvenated~. Pros: Creepy as always. Interesting novelties in the gameplay. Excellent soundtrack. Against: Graphically fluctuating. No hotkey for turning around. Some", "date": "2008-11-20", "grade": null}
