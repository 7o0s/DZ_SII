The new mission of the elite soldier is set during the final stages of the Second World War, in a fictitious location in southern Italy where the protagonist of the game is sent to get hold of the plans for a lethal guided missile that could change the tide of the conflict. Structure As anticipated in our tried Sniper Elite 4 for Nintendo Switch, the latest episode of the now famous franchise can boast a set of interesting innovations compared to the previous chapters, above all an open map structure that allows us to freely explore the vast scenarios that form the backdrop to each of the eight missions that make up the campaign, and which will keep us busy for about six hours. However, freedom of action is not limited to the simple act of admiring often suggestive panoramas, which, as mentioned, draw inspiration from some of the most fascinating glimpses of southern Italy, but extends to the possibility of completing the objectives that characterize each assignment in the order we prefer, thus opting for very different approaches, which include silent climbs and finishers with a knife, also embellished by the inevitable kill cams X-ray. Gameplay The nature of Sniper Elite 4 obviously remains that of the precision shooter, which means that the smartest way to proceed is linked to careful and reasoned planning of each move: tag enemies from a distance with binoculars, eliminate them one at a time by covering the sound of the shots of the sniper rifle and therefore playing mainly waiting. However, the third person shooter mechanics have been substantially improved in this chapter and this also allows you to use noisy and frenetic tactics, face the German soldiers (not very smart, the artificial intelligence is perhaps below average) openly, shouldering the machine gun or a shotgun, or even resort to close-quarter stealth action with a silenced pistol and knife. The gameplay handles the general shortage of ammunition well, forcing us to change weapons and search the corpses for magazines, so as not to make the challenge too trivial; but it uses little grenades and explosives due to the lack of situations in which you find yourself barricaded, waiting for the enemies to advance. Returning to the stealth elements, silence and precision are rewarded but the game does not punish errors of judgment too severely: when our character is identified, the enemy troops organize themselves to track him down on the basis of his last known position, but the situation can be recovered by moving and hiding for a few tens of seconds. Nintendo Switch satisfies our wishes in a rather elastic way, adding controls via gyroscope for extra precision during long shots and obviously allowing us to play both in front of the TV and in complete portability. Both modes are enjoyable, just a pity that the layout suffers from an annoying glitch due to the incorrect and reversed assignment of the A/B and X/Y buttons compared to other versions of the game - we are waiting for an update to fix this. Multiplayer mode The multiplayer sector of Sniper Elite 4 includes two cooperative modes (campaign missions and wave survival) and six different competitive modes in which we will be able to face other players online. The stipulations are the classic ones: an all-against-all or team deathmatch, the King of Distance in which whoever scores the most points with kills from afar wins, the territorial mode Control and the alternative deathmatch Crossing Forbidden, in which the two teams are forced to stay away. Technical realization From a graphic point of view, Sniper Elite 4 moves between ups and downs but unfortunately on Nintendo Switch it cannot boast the effects that on PC, PS4 and Xbox One allowed the game to mask some of its historical shortcomings, first of all the models dated polygons and a not exactly extraordinary set of animations. Unlike the previous ports, the frame rate seemed to us to be firmly anchored to 30 fps, especially in portable mode due to the lower resolution, and some scenarios are definitely worth a look visited: ours is a wonderful country and Rebellion apparently knows it well, having also set the recent spin-off Zombie Army 4: Dead War there. The aforementioned x-ray kill cams return to Sniper Elite 4 with an even greater degree of visual realism.vo, representing in an all too clear and truculent way the consequences that our bullets have on the body of enemy soldiers, between crushed bones and smashed organs. The game can boast a good dubbing in Italian, with the late Roberto Draghetti who gives charisma to Karl Fairburne, while the soundtrack successfully mixes the classic theme of the Rebellion series with the atmospheres linked to the Italian setting.", "date": "2020-11-16", "grade": "7.3"}
