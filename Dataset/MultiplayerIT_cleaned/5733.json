{"name": "Gundam Evolution: la recensione dell'hero shooter con i robottoni di Yoshiyuki Tomino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gundam-evolution-recensione.html", "text": "There's a reason why dozens of content creators have called Gundam Evolution ~the Overwatch of robots~. It's a 6v6 hero shooter, with maps made up of objectives and bottlenecks and gameplay based on weapons and skills. The problem is that, of the Blizzard shooter, the game developed by Bandai Namco has taken many of the worst parts. From the design of the maps to the stuns (skills designed to immobilize the opponent for a few moments), passing through the loot boxes and a bad matchmaking, playing Gundam Evolution almost seems to relive the early days of Overwatch. However, fighting at a fast pace with some of the most iconic Japanese robots is an intrinsically fun experience and in our review of Gundam Evolution we will explain why it is still an excellent idea imprisoned in a dated game design. Mobile Suites come to life The graphic rendering of the Gundams is very faithful to the style of the anime Before wanting to speak to a general public, the goal of Gundam Evolution is to please fans of the Mobile Suit world: 17 of the most iconic Gundams have been transformed into playable characters, each with unique armaments and equipment. The graphic style, the movements and even the sound design have been taken directly from the anime to make you feel in command of a gigantic robot as tall as a skyscraper. In addition to the classic Gundam and the iconic Zaku II (the all-green one that always ends badly) there are Mobile Suits from all eras of the series. There is the Gundam Barbatos, the Sazabi, the Asshimar or the Marasai, all with a kit of weapons and abilities inspired by their canonical role. At launch, 12 of the 17 Mobile Suits are immediately unlocked, the other 5 can be obtained either by purchasing them with real money or by playing and earning in-game currency. The heroes of Gundam Evolution are divided into 2 main categories: ranged or melee . The former are the majority, because only 3 of the Suits available at launch are equipped with melee weapons and are among the most difficult to learn and make effective. Just like Overwatch, Gundam Evolution uses a 1-5 star rating system to explain to players the difficulty of each individual hero, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest. The tutorial will put you in the role of the Pale Rider who, just like the introductory hero of Overwatch 1 Soldier 76, is armed with an assault rifle, a grenade and an accessory capable of healing him in the middle of a battle. Each Suit is equipped with a primary fire with infinite ammo and a secondary fire that can either be a more accurate sight for your weapon or an alternative way to shoot. As for the skills, they are 2 for each Gundam plus possibly a passive one. The main weapons range from the normal machine gun of the Zaku II to the laser rifle of the Asshimar passing through the rocket launcher of the DOM Trooper and the sniper rifle of the GM Sniper II. Some heroes change shape becoming turrets or small assault drones, others have more or less powerful shields. Still others can heal their teammates and themselves. Fortunately, the support Gundams are not mandatory, because the maps are full of medkits. Furthermore, each character has his own G.Maneuver, an ultimate capable of turning the tide of a clash. The gameplay is fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping In the most intense fights it can be difficult to understand what is happening Each match lasts around 10 minutes, with an average search time of around 3 on European servers. Unfortunately, during our test of the PC version (it will be available for PlayStation 4/5 and Xbox One /Series X|S consoles from December 1st), Gundam Evolution had some serious connectivity problems: it was not infrequent to go so jerky as to not be able to get out of doors or die from attacks launched 10 seconds earlier by enemies who are long gone. These problems are not constant, as sometimes we played for hours without experiencing them, while others we were unable to complete 2 games in a row. We changed location, network and ethernet port: nothing to do. When we managed to enter the game, however, we understood that the main problem of Gundam Evolution is its game design. Several Mobile Suits have abilities designed to immobilize opponents for a few moments. In the frenetic and intense fights, the accumulation of these skills creates a feeling of frustration very similar to the one felt when playing Overwatch. Some extremely mobile heroes, especially in the narrower maps, can approach, immobilize and eliminate you without your being able to react in any way. Two of these characters are also locked behind buying or grinding in-game currency, which makes things even more frustrating, as they haunt the specter of pay-to-win. Few Maps and game modes Gundam Evolution maps are all the same At launch, Gundam Evolution can't rely on a huge variety of maps and game modes. There are Capture the Zone, where a single area must be conquered and defended, Domination, with the classic 3 points of interest to occupy and hold to score points, and Destruction, where teams must attack a site by placing and defending a bomb or defend it by defusing the enemy bomb. There are 10 maps in total, each dedicated to a single game mode: 4 for Capture the Zone, 3 for Domination and 3 for Destruction. None, however, manages to distinguish itself from the others for uniqueness: they are all variations of a gigantic science fiction installation made up of corridors and right angles on a difference in level of one or two floors. The bad news, unfortunately, does not end there. In almost all maps, the fighting is concentrated in a certain bottleneck, often the only access point to the objective. Here most of the games run aground: the defenders almost always manage to position themselves in such a way as to be difficult to eliminate or easily revived, thwarting every attack by the opponents. The maps of the Overwatch objective mode also had this exact same problem: the defenders took refuge behind the bottleneck, thwarting any attempt to advance by the attackers. The mode was so hated that it was first dropped from the competitive playlist and then completely removed from Overwatch 2. Gundam Evolution's unbalanced matchmaking adds further frustration to the experience due to the unequal mix of novices and experts. Complicated monetization and progression The character selection screen will always remind you which ones you don't have available Gundam Evolution is a free to play title which, like all hero shooters, puts a wall in front of the release of new heroes. To play with one of the 5 locked Mobile Suits you have two options: spend 990 EV Coins (the currency that can be purchased with real money) equivalent to about 10 euros, or put together 1980 Capital, the game's free currency. There is also a battle pass, divided into 50 tiers, with one free track and one paid track, also costing 990 EV Coins. The good news is that unlike most competing games, the premium track of the battle pass will reward you with enough EV Coins to purchase the next battle pass. The other good news is that there is enough Capital in the free track to unlock a new Suit each season. In addition, after logging in for the first time, you will be able to complete challenges called ~Beginner Challenges~, each of which will reward you with 50 Capital. Complete them all and you will have enough funds to unlock another Gundam. This means that, simply by playing, each season (which lasts just over 2 months) you can unlock 2 new Suits without spending a euro. In the game shop, then, there is a bundle called ~Item Pack DX Edition~ which, at a cost of 41 euros, will give you access to all the blocked characters and 5 legendary skins. As if all of this wasn't complicated enough, Gundam Evolution also has loot boxes behind which other cosmetics are locked. You will get some by playing, or they can be purchased for 2 euros each. If you open them and get duplicates of customizations you already have, you will receive 5 green cubes, a third game currency with which to unlock the individual loot box pool cosmetics.", "date": "2022-10-02", "grade": "6.5"}
