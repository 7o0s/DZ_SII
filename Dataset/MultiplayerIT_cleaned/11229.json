{"name": "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ultimate-ninja-3-recensione.html", "text": "For tie-ins based on successful animated series, the procedure always seems to be the same: the original story takes a step forward every time, adding a saga to those already present, while the total number of characters can only increase. In the case of Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, for example, it goes as far as Sasuke's escape and his transition to the ~dark side~, with the final battle between him and Naruto putting an end to a first, long phase of the story. The developers have treasured previous experiences, trying to put together all the strengths of the first two episodes to create yet another adventure of the ninja of the Leaf on PlayStation 2. Well, at least the ~dress~ is that of special occasions: Ultimate Ninja 3 offers us two distinct ~weight~ modes, to which we must add the inevitable Versus, a small collection of minigames and the now consolidated system of collectibles to buy and view. The Supreme Tournament The ~Supreme Tournament~ is the main game mode, and tells a small unpublished story, completely unrelated to the original series: the new Hokage, Tsunade, decides to hold a tournament in the Leaf Village to celebrate a important anniversary. It is to all intents and purposes a party, in which Chunin and Jonin will be able to collide for the conquest of a certain number of crystals: at the end of the dispute, whoever has the most will participate in a final battle, and the winner will have the opportunity to establish a Ninja Rule. It is clear that Naruto will do anything to impose his own rule, which would see him become the new Hokage of the village. And it is he who we will control, in this mode: using a third-person view, we will have to move around the central district of the Leaf Village and interact with all the characters to challenge them in combat or to help them in some way. By pressing the Triangle button, we will be able to call up a useful interface at any time to view the map and move to another area (the baths, the forest, the training camp, the plain of the sacred monument, the market), even if these are rather small places, where at most it is possible to meet a companion or an opponent. Through the same interface, we will also be able to check the status of our character, and possibly customize it in its special moves if we have the necessary objects. The control system during the exploration phases is typical of action games, with the left analog stick to move Naruto and the d-pad used only to walk slowly, the right stick to rotate the view (management of which very often leaves wish, unfortunately) and the main buttons for jumping, attacking or switching to a first-person view for throwing shurikens. The Villaggio della Foglia, in its central district, boasts quite generous dimensions and above all it gives us the possibility of climbing the walls of the buildings to get to the roofs, from where perhaps we can see otherwise invisible objects. Minigames for all tastes! We will be able to face them during the ~Supreme Tournament~ mode or directly from the start screen: these are the three simple minigames that the developers have included in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3. The first sees us throw shurikens towards a series of shapes, using a curious ~rythm game~ style system (you have to hit the right button for each target); the second is the ~tree race~ already seen in the PSP episodes, which unfortunately on PS2 becomes horrible and frustrating; finally, the third sees us challenge the master Gai in a series of physical exercises: to perform them at best, we will have to guess the combinations of buttons shown on the screen. The Story of the Hero The second ~important~ mode is the ~Story of the Hero~, or a classic ~story mode~ that sees us retrace the various phases of the anime up to the clash between Naruto and Sasuke, which sanctions the definitive departure of the latter and his landing at Orochimaru's court. Everything takes place through a total of twenty episodes, divided into four large chapters, which you have to unlock as you progress through the story. It is clear that we will not always play the role of Naruto, but we will control a large number of different characters, faithfully following the events told in the anime. Fans of the series can't help but notice that certain phases (above all the tournament for promotion to the rank of Chunin) have been summarized and simplified, probably because they were already covered in detail during the first two Ultimate Ninjas. The control system has remained the same, with some very welcome changesor to the last episode: during the execution of special moves, in fact, it is no longer necessary to rotate the analog stick faster than your opponent to determine the power of the blow; in practice, we have returned to the system of the ~rhythm game~ style button combination. For the rest, the Circle button is always in charge of the attack (with five different combos that depend on the direction of the d-pad pressed), X is used to jump (and to move from one floor to another of each location, a hallmark of the series), the Square to launch the equipped weapon and the Triangle to activate the chakra necessary for the execution of the special move. Secret techniques are always performed by pressing up or down twice on the d-pad plus the Circle button, while the primary back keys scroll through the collected objects and the secondary ones allow us to parry. Technical realization The graphics of Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 do not represent a revolution compared to the previous two episodes, it is clear, but in many ways it optimizes the work done so far and adds something where possible. After all, the numbers speak for themselves: we have the beauty of forty-one characters to choose from, many of whom have at least one different ~mode~ that changes their appearance and special moves. The latter are always limited to a total of three, but it is possible to act on the customization (on which this episode has a lot) to change them, and the total number of techniques at the end of the day is really high. The new characters belong to the phase of the story in which Sasuke escapes from the Leaf Village to follow his desire to become stronger at any cost, so they are warriors with demonic abilities; to these must be added some new masters loyal to the Hokage. The twenty locations in which you can fight are almost all old acquaintances, even if in many cases they have undergone heavy modifications aimed at improving their design: the training camp, for example, is no longer a frustrating place to fight, and there are several forest sections characterized by excellent vegetation. The graphics engine manages to move everything without ever an uncertainty, and you don't even notice defects in the rendering of the polygons: the only thing that leaves something to be desired is the management of the view in the ~Supreme Tournament~ mode, as already mentioned. It's a shame, however, that you can't set the video output in any way, either to achieve progressive screen refresh or to achieve the now indispensable thing like 16:9 widescreen. Luckily the sound sector offers more possibilities, in particular the awful English voices can be eliminated in favor of the original Japanese ones. Music and effects are average for the series, with very few surprises. Comment Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 is what fans of the Leaf Ninja expected from the third episode of a very successful series: a game that combines old and new, optimizing the combat mechanics and providing players with two different modes of depth . Unfortunately, not much work has been done regarding the calibration of the difficulty, therefore those who are already familiar with Ultimate Ninja will be able to finish everything within a few hours, remaining only with the simple extra missions of the ~Supreme Tournament~ mode and with the classic Versus to challenge the AI or a friend. In this sense, more could have been done, it doesn't rain, but in the end we are faced with the best Naruto for PlayStation 2: technically excellent, spectacular enough, equipped with excellent numbers and many little things that will make the happiness of fan. Pros Two ~important~ modes Forty-one characters and twenty locations Technically excellent... Cons ...even if there are few new features Too easy Not very long-lived", "date": "2008-09-01", "grade": null}
