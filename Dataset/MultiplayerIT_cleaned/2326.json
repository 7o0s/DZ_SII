Meeting the historical characters who have marked the passing of millennia of battles with their deeds is an honor, but above all it is not boring! EE is a brilliant game, or rather I correct the shot: son of a brilliant idea, tested, but now perfected and improved. You will always have to deal with the collection of resources and the economic development of your people, but never in such a way as to define this game as a ~management~. There's no shortage of action and real time seems to beat constantly in your games. And variety is ensured given the huge number of units in the game (try to think for a moment how different it is to battle depending on the eras you go through), different situations and tactics to thrive, defend and, if necessary, conquer. I think it is worth dwelling on those aspects that make this game a title of depth, thus going to talk about the ... GRAPHICS ENGINE GUARANTEED FOR 500,000 YEARS This time, a completely 3D engine will accompany us through the passing of the ages, which will greatly help to make life easier for us. First of all we need to say this: The graphics aren't the prettiest out there, yet I thank you that they are. For the simple fact that even with a huge number of units on the screen you won't feel any difficulty in managing this RTS, nor will you have the opportunity to point out too much, because in fact making this game playable and usable by a huge number of people, with this engine, well... hats off. And then it's all compressed on one CD. And then there's the zoom. Really strong! With the wheel you can switch in an instant from the ant-style sky to the face, or full screen, of the single unit of your infantry battalion. Yes oh well everyone has the zoom now. Ok, but not everyone has it smart. Let me explain: often it all boils down to approaching and moving away, except that the fact of zooming in makes it possible to notice the details better, but to the detriment of the large-scale view, which would be compromised (with unexpected massacres). GRAPHICS ENGINE GUARANTEED FOR 500,000 YEARS Here, however, everything happens naturally. Imagine the camera that is often seen on movie sets. Come on, the one you always see moving in TV services!. As you descend towards the ground you will glide smoothly with a sort of ~landing~ (easier to see than to explain) so that the inclination of the view always makes you visible what is happening around you, even when you stop for a moment to observe your a citizen who hunts a wild boar, or a fisherman who collects his nets loaded with fish. All this is done with a strange texture ~stretching~ effect which, although it will be often noticed in the first few games, will soon be assimilated as a right and correct quality/performance compromise. Mention also for the 2D parts of the game, i.e. the interfaces and the various menus, really clean and detailed, in order to always have everything under control, without gross hunks put there just to do. LET'S THROW INTO THE FIGHT Therefore, building, but not only ... you often throw yourself into the fray, and there will certainly be the classic spoilsport that will disturb your peaceful days, in pure RTS style. A prelude to the furious battles to come! To tell the truth, a criticism must be made, which is that the combat is mostly a jumble of units sent to slaughter. Even if there are combat formations. To be forgiven for this sort of repetitiveness in the concept of the clashes, the programmers have well thought of ~altering~ the statistics to the right point so that, for example, the piercing weapons (spears, bow and arrows) beat the edged weapons, which in turn are suitable for defeating percussion weapons (hammers and clubs) which in turn (acc.. my head is spinning!) beat piercing weapons. The same goes for boats. In short, a bit more tangling. NOT JUST HISTORY Culture yes, but with fun and folklore I dare say. Fantasy leaves room for units such as the prophet, who will bring plagues to enemy cities, earthquakes and volcanoes, simply by invoking divine wrath. But also clashes in a hypothetical future with units of land, air and water fruit of the imagination. Let's not forget, it's the basis of everything. Are we therefore willing to accept the not always realistic unit-building proportions? Why is a German soldier as big as a tank? ehm... You can keep silent about the fnote that at the beginning everything may seem slightly toyy and the colors will seem too contrasting? Exactly not, in fact I'm telling you for the record. Alright, let's close the history book, rub our eyes and move on to the final judgement... THE HERO OF TWO WORLDS Can Empire Earth be defined as the hero software of both worlds? The first, that of those who strategize it as a continuous challenge, a renewal of style and gameplay and the second, that of those who marvel and fall in love with a unit or a building, do they wobble on the mouse when it comes to coordinating a mine and a patrol on patrol? Surely the answer is NO. In the sense that the purists of the genre will hardly be attracted by the ~playful~ component, already too much trodden by thick titles, perhaps making a curiosity prevail for the introduction of the third dimension in a game with strong historical and epochal connotations. Those who haven't dabbled with this genre for a long time, are intrigued by it or are still so in love with Age of Empires in all its forms and if they were to be reborn they would like to be Napoleon, well whose turn it is! Empire Earth repurposes a concept in a big way, it runs smoothly, the units move delightfully and everything runs smoothly. You understand how this is done to consider, given that it happens more and more often that games come out in a hurry to be published, and are full of bugs up to the last groove of the CD. All in a pleasure of campaigns, there are four of them, that of the Greeks, English, Germans and Russians who follow four distinct eras and a lot of attention to detail and dynamic objectives that change during the mission. Movies with the game engine, and very suitable voice acting. This is a gentleman game, distinguished and cultured but which does not forget to be fun, and this makes it a milestone. In conclusion, therefore, we can safely approve this game with a nice quality stamp, without forgetting to write ~the unespected classic~, or rather the unexpected classic. THE DAWN OF HISTORY And it all started with a bone. The being formulated one of its first, small reasonings. It is the dawn of life, the beginning of the progressive and continuous ascent towards evolution. This being is called man, and this is a game that exalts man at the center of the universe, celebrates both his glories and his victories, but also his massacres and dark periods. A tribute to the very essence of this evolved but always fickle biped with a reverse thumb. Rick Goodman, creator of this apparently titanic video game project, is the same mind that gave birth to that Age of Empires that many still play today, a sign that ours has plenty to sell. And like all great men aim high with this Empire Earth. We are always grappling with a real-time strategy, we are always busy growing and developing our empire, but this time we will retrace all the fundamental stages of human evolution, from prehistory to a hypothetical future populated by machines and nanotechnology.
