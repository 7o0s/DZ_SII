{"name": "Astroneer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/astroneer-recensione.html", "text": "Astroneer arrives at the review appointment just over two years after its arrival on Steam, where it immediately gained attention with a combination of simplicity, atmosphere and interesting finds. And today the planetary survival sandbox of System Era Softwork, although devoid of plot or striking technological innovations, enjoys an even greater following thanks to an evolution, finally reaching the fateful version one point zero, which certainly will not end with the exit from the 'early access. A game devoted to exploration and crafting Astroneer is a sci-fi survival game set on distant planets. We start from the first world with the aim of building a rocket to escape to the next, all by shaping and exploring our surroundings with terraforming, countless structures and vehicles, in the name of a classic sandbox that does not aim to revolutionize anything. But we don't miss out on decidedly interesting findings which include the need to supply energy to almost everything, excluding backpack and main shelter, and the possibility of carrying oxygen with us with a network of nodes and pipes which, in the absence of advanced technologies such as portable oxygenators, is required to move away from the base. And it's a key element of a title that combines a managerial dimension with inventiveness, drawing inspiration from toy constructions to give us an experience that also allows us to customize the equipment, the base and even the vehicles. All in the name of a relaxing new age atmosphere, with the placid soundtrack that blends with a survival dimension that is anything but simulative, devoid of factors such as climatic conditions, hunger and so on. Nevertheless, as we will see, death is not lacking, but the challenge of Astroneer is a matter of exploration and imagination, starting from a bare base flanked by a landing platform that provides us with the first structures. We have the rest of the equipment on our shoulders in the form of a backpack to which an intergalactic vacuum cleaner is hooked up which allows us to detect, collect and subsequently deposit material, allowing us to dig the ground with more or less simplicity depending on the hardness of the type of soil and the technology at our disposal. And it is by taking up this invaluable tool that we set off in search of the compound, a fundamental resource that allows us to build the nodes with which to extend our network of oxygen pipes. But all around you can see nothing but plants, mostly useful for powering portable energy generators. To go too far, with the risk of being suffocated, doesn't seem like a great idea. Better to dig, therefore: and we do it by finding only soil and leaves, at least until we come across a narrow tunnel. There, in the depths of the earth, light is scarce, but our torch guides us curve after curve, up to a huge cave that suddenly opens under our feet. And here we are, surprised, falling into the void, condemned to a grim end, but along the way down our attention is entirely focused on a cave full of shiny materials, capsules and enormous riches, at least until our kneecaps shatter with a sudden impact. We leave, therefore, for the umpteenth time, back in the tunnels, still at the bottom of the cave. And this time we find a way to go down, but the ascent becomes tiring and oxygen is scarce. One wrong step and breathing becomes heavy while the heart thunders in our ears. Finally the light, but the hour is late and life abandons us a few meters from the base, with oxygen almost at hand. At this point patience falters, at least for a moment, but the atmosphere is pleasant and the desire to explore holds. We set off again, this time in a random direction and without too many expectations, and suddenly, behind the horizon of a planet that is small enough to show its curvature but with enough mass to guarantee countless hours of exploration, a compost seam pops up, an injection of enthusiasm that begins our climb to the stars. A relaxing survival sandbox As we said, Astroneer is not a punitive title. The lost backpack can be recovered by dying, there is no trace of angry aliens and the hostile flora can be eliminated quickly using our vacuum cleaner. But gravity, we have seen, is a dangerous enemy, which makes the exploration of caves even more complicated, where the bulk of valuable stuff is often hidden. Recovering it requires a way back, the inevitable oxygen and consequently time, without the guarantee of really finding something valuable. And it's not said that it's worth going back to get a backpack in fend to a cesspool, albeit one filled with rare materials. But this does not detract from the exploration that thrives on suggestions, mysterious finds, the darkness pierced by the large torch that we carry around and the awareness that all is not lost, even when we are unable to recover the lost backpack following a inglorious. Some finds, in fact, allow us to immediately obtain bytes, otherwise refinable by inserting large blocks of rare material in a furnace, instantly fleshing out the reserves of the coin which allows us to unlock new projects and to enrich a crafting that has expanded a lot over time. also encountering some complaints from those who preferred everything more relaxed and dreamlike. We, on the other hand, are happy with the result. Astroneer provides us with three 3D printers, one of which is small enough to be carried in a backpack, with which to build a lot of machines that can be installed on our backpack, on fixed and even mobile platforms, creating vehicles that, thanks to physics on a marked inertial force they can make evolutions of all kinds. The possibilities are so many and include oxygen tanks, portable wind generators, warehouses, new bases, solar panels, organic material generators, drill modifications, huge vacuum machines, purple lawns, vehicles composed of wagons and tools to power them beyond beyond the modest basic battery. The result is an articulated but intuitive title, capable of combining a relaxing atmosphere with an exploratory spark and with a not too punitive but still important mortality to give a little more spice to our journey. And it works, even if the formula is limited, the only way to destroy the structures is dynamite, the planets end up looking alike and the graphics are modest to say the least, even if well studied and decidedly accurate. Let me be clear, rectangular blades of grass and surfaces without textures certainly don't leave you speechless, but the attention shines through from details such as the movements of the character, from the planets that cross the sky and from the care for the models and animations of the structures, all seasoned with an almost completely invisible interface, with the oxygen level that can be seen directly on the backpack, as well as the contents of the latter. There is also the obvious cycle between day and night, gusts of wind, snow, profusion of colors and the personalization of the suit (from the shape to the colours) which has a discreet importance with an anonymous astronaut with cartoon features constantly occupying the center of the our screen. But it is certainly not as important as the 4-player cooperative (drop-in/drop-out), a dimension that - finally freed from the big problems of the alpha version - adds a lot to the experience, also paving the way for vehicle races, minigames made using physics and huge constructions. Too bad for the absence of servers, which limits us only to the friends list, but these will arrive, just as further refinements will arrive for a code that is undoubtedly improved, despite some bugs still peeping out, and which allowed us to play without major problems for several hours.", "date": "2019-02-06", "grade": "8.0"}
