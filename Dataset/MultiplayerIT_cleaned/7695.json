These are not necessarily independent products, given that now even the major publishers have titles of all sizes in their portfolios. Cloudberry Kingdom, published by Ubisoft and developed by Pwnee Studios, fits into the vein started, commercially speaking, by Super Meat Boy, that is, that of ultra-difficult 2D platformers in which the gameplay is focused on developing the player's skill by putting him in front to increasingly insane challenges. Basically it's about guiding the hero Bob along a series of linear levels that flow from left to right. The aim is simply to reach the exit, possibly, but not necessarily, by collecting the diamonds scattered around which increase the score and lead to a better judgment in the summary screen. In total there are three game modes: Arcade, in which lives are limited and you have to overcome a series of 500 levels, Story, in which you have to overcome a series of levels divided into seven worlds, with unlimited lives, and Freeplay, practically a level editor that infinitely lengthens the longevity of the game, thanks to the simplicity and immediacy of use (you simply need to set some general factors and then the system will generate the level). Bob's enemies? Well, expect spikes, moving platforms, spinning maces, flames, unstable platforms, killer bees, you name it. The form that Bob takes at the beginning of each series of maps creates some ancillary difficulties. For example, in some cases he is tied to a wheel, while in others he has a double jump and in still others he gets on board a real spaceship. Each transformation also changes the outputs of the control system: the wheel is more slippery, a miniature Bob jumps lower, the spaceship has to dodge obstacles by flying and so on. In some schemes, in addition to the obstacles to avoid, you also have to escape from a big press that wants to crush the poor hero. Do you want to know the perfect platformer to curse like crazy? Cloudberry Kingdom is for you Tougher than expected That's all? In fact yes. If you want we can add that it is possible to play in four at the same time, unfortunately only locally, and that Cloudberry Kingdom really gives the best by doing it (also because swearing together with friends is always more satisfying than doing it alone), but for the rest we have practically said all about the mechanics. Now we need to try to understand how attractive the dish can be. An average level of the Pwnee Studios title is a very short and intense torture. Knowing the obstacles and knowing how to move, it takes a few seconds to finish each scheme, but the problem is that there are often so many obstacles on the screen that the loss of several lifetimes before being able to move forward. The player is simply required to dodge the impossible, synchronizing with traps and executing certain moves to perfection. Not a little, and that's why we need to understand immediately if the concept is for us, also because there really isn't anything else. In short, for all the time you spend with Bob you will dodge traps, jump on platforms and enemies and... that's it. Even if in similar titles the technique is not essential to examine, let's spend a few words on the subject. Visually Cloudberry Kingdom gets the job done and nothing more. We could have expected better, even if it is a low budget title. For example, the aforementioned Super Meat Boy is stylistically much more successful even though it is certainly not a triple A production. As for the soundtrack, on the other hand, we really aren't there: apart from the few effects, a secondary issue given the context, the music by accompaniment are really ugly. However, if you are interested in this title, or if you will after reading this article, it is not because of the soundtrack. Turning down the volume is always on time.", "date": "2013-07-31", "grade": "8.0"}
