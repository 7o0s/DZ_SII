Hyperburner, the new racer developed by Patrick Cook for iOS devices, available on the App Store at a price of just 2.99 euros and without any IAP, does just that: it puts us in command of a spacecraft with the aim of completing a series of paths within six different scenarios, to be gradually unlocked and characterized not only by a peculiar appearance and color tones, but also and above all by an increasingly more insidious design, with obstacles that sometimes become very complicated to get around during our automatic motorcycle. An essential concept, but which is enriched with facets such as the unlockable ships or the progression system itself, which obliges you to complete all the tracks in order to get to the bottom of each location. The approach is also interesting, which allows you to play both by holding the device vertically and horizontally, controlling the vehicle with your thumb or forefinger, depending on how you feel better. The options screen also includes three different camera views: third-person close-up, third-person distant, or first-person. The latter proves to be the best choice if our problem is to perceive the ends of the ship, but in the same way it implies a more aggressive style, with sudden changes of direction. In reality, the Hyperburner experience is not particularly punitive, as light collisions are buffered by the rechargeable energy shield, and only a full and frontal impact determines game over, naturally with the possibility of continuing without having to wait for anything given the premium nature of the title. Hyperburner is an immediate and solid futuristic racer, with a nice campaign and great graphics Obstacle course Running among what appear to be space wrecks, but which in truth boast a design that is difficult to attribute to a random arrangement of obstacles, in Hyperburner we will find ourselves having to make decisions quickly, moving the spacecraft from one side to another of the screen, with increasingly large and spectacular maneuvers as we progress through the campaign. After completing the five stages in each area, we will also unlock an endless mode in which the challenge will be to get the highest score, staying alive and avoiding impacts for as long as possible. In all cases, the excellent touch control system (with adjustable sensitivity, moreover), so immediate and reactive, guarantees a pleasant and engaging experience, which inevitably leads to episodes of frustration when you crash in proximity of the finish line, but which rewards experience and the ability to memorize the peculiarities of each route, trying it again several times until success. To effectively support this system we find graphics with a clean and elegant style, which deals with the spatial theme in a competent way and diversifies the stages very well to avoid redundancies. The spacecrafts themselves boast a good design, just as it is possible to notice a certain personality in the composition of the scenarios, all while maintaining a frame rate that does not drop from sixty frames per second and therefore guarantees a fluid ride, without uncertainties that could give rise to unexpected. The soundtrack is also beautiful, composed of electronic songs that try to underline in some way the ~relaxing~ aspect of the gameplay, with rhythms that do not press and perhaps in this sense they miss the target by a hair, renouncing to emphasize the frenzy of the games .", "date": "2016-07-13", "grade": "8.5"}
