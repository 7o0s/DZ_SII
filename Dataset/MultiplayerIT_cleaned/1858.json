Now, finally, we have had the opportunity to try the full version: here is our review of Genesis Noir. Nucleus Genesis Noir: watches The first question that we are sure many will ask is: what exactly is Genesis Noir? Trivializing the speech, the work of Feral Cat Den is an extremely simplified graphic adventure. From phase to phase, we will have to move our character within small environments and interact with some element that will allow us to continue. The entire adventure is resolved by moving the left stick (or the arrow keys) and clicking on A (or the left mouse button). It is therefore difficult to talk about the more playful side of Genesis Noir, because on balance the work does not implement any real gameplay mechanics, but rather ~gameplay solutions~. Genesis Noir: An example of a music minigame Here, the reader will immediately understand whether or not he may be interested in the product. Genesis Noir tries to be as far away as possible from the classic video game concept and moves in the sphere of ~interactive audio-visual experience~. No challenge, no complexity, just semi-automated linear travel. From our point of view, it is not open to criticism in its intent, but it is not exempt from some small criticisms for the implementation. In fact, the gameplay solutions adopted are not particularly original: it is difficult to revolutionize the genre when the entire gameplay revolves around a button, but simplicity and originality can coexist (think of Wandersong). Fortunately, Genesis Noir gets every other playful element right, especially in terms of rhythm. The adventure never bores and even if we are called to complete simple and linear actions, we are constantly bewitched by what happens on the screen. Electrons Genesis Noir: before the beginning Indeed, the true power of Genesis Noir must first of all be found in its visual and sonic presentation. The black and white graphic style, occasionally flecked with gold that points the way, doesn't get boring even for a second. Each setting, full of details, unrolls in front of our eyes like a parchment and takes us from phase to phase in various places in the cosmos, from deep space to our Earth, which we will be able to visit in various eras. The screenshots, which you can also find in this review, give an idea of the caliber of this gaming gem, but it is above all in motion that Genesis Noir manages to shine. Furthermore, it is the perfect fusion of graphics, interactions and sound that convinces. Each act on the screen is accompanied by a note, a vibration, sometimes even just by a strange silence that manages to tell a lot. Genesis Noir: hunting Music, especially jazz, is in fact a fundamental part of Genesis Noir and will accompany us until the end of the adventure (where, in this sense, a surprise awaits you that we will not anticipate). But music is also a plot element. Dark matter What is Genesis Noir about? Talk about a love story. Talk about the universe. Talk about the Destiny of Humanity. It is about Nobody (No Man, in the original), a watch salesman, but also a preternatural being, who exists in a reality prior to time itself. Our protagonist becomes entangled in a love triangle with Miss Massa, a jazz singer, and Ragazzo Aureo, a jazz musician. Golden Boy fires a gun at Miss Massa and this act is nothing but the Big Bang, the beginning of everything. However, no one wants to prevent the Big Bang and save Miss Massa and, by freezing time, she travels within the trail of the bullet, i.e. the entire universe at every moment. We will be able to visit the first instants of creation, billionths of billionths of seconds after the Big Bang, but also see the primordial Soup, the evolution of humanity and even the future of our species, after the Earth has been abandoned. We will then go after Golden Boy to save those we love, but we can assure you that we will go much further. Genesis Noir: Golden Boy and the Earth We have already said it, but we are forced to repeat it, Genesis Noir is an audio-visual experience (and also narrative, of course) which aims to awaken in us that sense of wonder, amazement and almost vertigo that one feels when facing the infinity of the Universe. Feral Cat Den succeeds, or at least has managed to make us feel these sensations. It has undeniably moved us, but as always there will be players who - through no fault of their own - remain cold in the face of this work. Genesis Noir performsvery precise stylistic and narrative choices, disregarding how much the player can actually understand the whole experience. He wants to overwhelm you with sensations. We can only tell you that we were amazed (literally), bewitched by what was happening on the screen. And even if the discussions on the Maximum Systems should not interest you, that of Nobody is still a love story, a common story, which almost seems to tell us that Love existed and will always exist, but whose consequences are often unpredictable.", "date": "2021-03-29", "grade": "8.5"}
