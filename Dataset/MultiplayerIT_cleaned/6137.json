The result was Score! World Goals, a title that actually took the world's most loved sport only as the setting for what to all intents and purposes was a sui generis puzzle game, in which the goal was to recreate the actions of the most famous networks in history. The great success of the formula and the response from the public have allowed the team to expand the original idea by expanding the contents also with in-app purchases linked to specific clubs such as Juve, Milan, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Benfica and Liverpool. Three years later, First Touch Games has chosen to take up a large part of this concept by modifying it and adapting it to a new experience, which takes the name of Score! Hero, already available on iOS and coming to Android. Score! Hero is an original and interesting way of proposing football on touch screens Goool! Where World Goals put you in the shoes of famous and established international stars committed to scoring the most important goals of their careers, in Hero instead we find ourselves more modestly playing the role of a ~nobody~, or a talented young promise of football at the beginning of his professional career, with everything still to prove in order to establish himself in the big clubs and in the national team. The adventure is divided into levels that all take place very briefly, since they do not take place within an entire game, but only in specific key moments: the goal, however, is always to be able to score, perhaps starting from an inviting free kick or rather going to build an articulated action starting with the goalkeeper. Each pass is managed by tracing the trajectory of the ball on the screen: the direction of the same obviously determines the line that the ball will follow, while the length is linked to the power of the kick. The latter is a fundamental element not only because it determines the reaction (in any case always automatic) that the partner will have, therefore coming towards the ball rather than chasing it in depth, but also once in front of the goal to choose which corner to aim for and - above all - to center or not the mirror. With each pass performed, time stops allowing you to control the player in possession of the ball and to be able to calmly carry out your next action. Strategy and puzzles are therefore mixed in a compelling and interesting formula, which manages despite the repetitiveness of the modest thickness not to get bored even after a long time. The team's choice to simplify the mechanics compared to World Goals, in which instead the running lines of different team members had to be drawn to then see the results, appears sensible and intelligent with a view to providing a more spectacular and above all usable product in more immediate and direct way. Among other things, although each level has the goal creation as the only requirement for passing, it also offers three secondary objectives capable of guaranteeing more stars: for example, to score or assist with one's alter ego, or to kick from a distance prefixed, either by aiming at the corner or again by hitting the post. It goes without saying that getting the maximum rating requires repeating the same challenges several times. The only real criticism that can be leveled at Score! Hero is therefore essentially an inevitable repetitiveness and a few too many bugs, within an always pleasant context. The freemium system is not too limiting: in essence, the game currency is represented by banknotes which are given very, very modestly for free, while on the contrary they can be purchased with real money. These allow in fact to be able to rewind the action to the previous step to an error, in such a way as to be able to try again without having to start the level from the beginning. A sort of ~shortcut~, the lack of which in reality does not weigh that much. Possibly more annoying is the energy system, which practically allows you to perform only a certain number of errors before forcing you to put your wallet or simply wait about ten minutes: considering the modest variety of the action, actually being able to access Score! Hero in small bites is the best way to keep the interest longer.", "date": "2015-08-14", "grade": "8.0"}
