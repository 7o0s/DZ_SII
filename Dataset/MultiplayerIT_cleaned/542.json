{"name": "Top Spin 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-spin-2-recensione.html", "text": "The dish is rich. The differences with the Beta tested in the preview a few weeks ago immediately catch the eye. Luckily many bugs have been fixed, texture and polygon problems have disappeared, loading has become shorter, even if it has increased. The final version is very solid and the many bugs have thankfully been fixed. The general feeling that the title offers us is that of being a slightly improved version of the first chapter, that of a game with an identity crisis, a beautiful but ~cold~ game. Seated in front of a television, without showing the console, not many would be able to guess whether Top Spin 2 runs on an early Xbox or a 360. The general feeling that the title offers us is that of being a slightly improved version of the first chapter The dish is rich. Many efforts have been made in customizing one's character, except for the fact that 99% of the time we will not see our athlete's face at all. On the other hand, much progress could and should have been made in the construction of the playing fields and adjacent structures. Each field is well characterized but the various scenographic elements seem to be modeled by much less performing hardware. The number of stadiums is more than sufficient: it is played from Tokyo to New York, passing through France, Australia, England, Greece, for a total of 19 fields. Even the licenses acquired for tennis players are a good number, between men and women they reach 24. The ~outline~ of this title is certainly attractive, complete, solid and captivating, let us now analyze the game pad in hand. The grueling ascent of a young talent. Climbing the world rankings is really exhausting, and you'll soon understand why. Surely the core of Top Spin 2 is represented by the career mode, long and full of options. It starts from the characterization of our character, through one of the most incredible editors ever seen in an electronic game; it is possible to modify each component of the face and body, even changing the intensity of the veins, freckles or wrinkles on the face. Something similar to the one already seen in Oblivion, but much more powerful and effective. Maybe too much. The idea of being able to change the height of the eyebrows or the curvature of the saddle of the nose is nice, even when you don't understand its usefulness, given that these small details will be invisible in the game. Initially we will find ourselves at position number 200 in the world ranking and it will be our duty to climb it as much as possible. Our character will have to refine all the basic techniques of every tennis player, from the classic forehand and backhand, to cut shots up to the lob and special shots. The problems come with the uploads, which are not so long as they are numerous and frequent: far too much The grueling ascent of a young talent. All as if it were an ~RPG~: each workout will earn us stars to increase the parameters we have chosen, until our conditions are good enough to face a tournament. By winning tournaments you earn money through which you can pay the coach you're going to choose, buy accessories, rackets, sportswear and pay for special lessons to learn new strokes. By winning tournaments, our ranking will also improve slowly. The problems come with the uploads, which are not so long as they are numerous and frequent: far too much. Sometimes it will take two ten to fifteen second workouts to complete a thirty-second workout. Consider that in the career mode dozens and dozens of training sessions will be carried out, many tournaments and hundreds of times you will enter a shop to make purchases: only in this way will you have an idea of how many ~loadings~ will await you. A profound, fun, well-studied modality, but undermined at the root by monstrously repetitive expectations. Intuitive yet profound The gameplay is very solid and fully taken from that sacred monster of Virtua Tennis: a deep Arcade soul makes the title simple to play but at the same time profound to manage. The basic commands are the usual, sure shot, high lob, cut shot. Which mixed with the pressure of the right trigger transform into deadly special shots, much more powerful, cut and precise. When the back button is pressed, an energy bar will appear above the player with an indicator that must be made to reach the end, just as happens in most golf titles. It is essential to take the right time with each shot: being late will mean throwing back a weak ball, while hitting with the body in the down positionstays and with the right timing it will make our shot stronger and more accurate. The system isn't as intuitive as it was in Virtua Tennis, but it definitely feels deeper. In exhibition mode, we are free to choose a real tennis player from a cast of international male and female stars. Each player is equipped with his classic shots and their custom animations. The level of realism is very high, as regards the style of play. Seen up close, they are very similar to their real counterparts, even if the impression of being ~rubbery~ is palpable. To understand what we mean by ~realistic~ let's think of the characters in Fight Night, for example, much more refined and rich in polygons. Like any good self-respecting tennis game, Top Spin 2 is at its best in multiplayer, one-on-one or doubles. Small sour note: there are no replays. Accustomed to the spectacular slow motion of Virtua Tennis 2, we find ourselves slightly taken aback, given that the effect produced could have been much more beautiful than a technically dated title like the SEGA game. The audio sector is well cared for instead, each stadium has its own characteristic music depending on the country in which we play, the effects and samples are convincing and very varied. Even the menus (whose graphics are very captivating and modern) have excellent rock tunes that are well suited to the game genre. Live goals. There aren't many goals but surely the last ones can only be achieved with perseverance and a lot of training. The first three objectives are simple and can definitely be unlocked in the first few hours of the game. Unlocking all the missions yields the beauty of 1000 points. Let's see them in detail: Win tournament in Career, 25 points. Win Career match, 25 points Win Exhibition match, 25 points. Win 1 ranked match, 25 points. Defeat all pro tennis players, 75 points. Defeat all female tennis pros, 75 points. Become n1 in Career, 100 points. Win 25 ranked matches, 100 points. Play 50 ranked matches, 100 points. Complete the first Career, 200 points. Finish career with 1000 points, 250 points. Xbox Live and its contribution. As in any self-respecting sports title, the multiplayer component of Top Spin 2 is very important and ~heavy~ for playful purposes. The Live online gaming platform gives (so to speak) a considerable boost to the game in terms of longevity and as regards the challenge factor. Seeing your name at the top of the world rankings is no small feat, and getting there even less so. It is also possible to challenge a random user. There are many options, it is possible to set each parameter in order to skim the results: field in which to play, position in the ranking of the opponent compared to us, male, female, singles or doubles. The choice of the CPU in pairing us with more experienced or less skilled users is always effective. There is absolutely no lag, interference or freezing during game play, tested with 4MB ADSL connection. The personalization of our player is important but in view of the challenge it is even more discriminating between us and the opponents: it will be necessary to buy ever better rackets to be able to compete against the best. And at a higher level the challenge is felt throughout. Comment Top Spin 2 turns out to be, nowadays, the best example of a tennis video game on the market. A game certainly among the most complete ever seen, full of options, customization options with objects, rackets, clothes that has incredible. Deep and long career mode, in some ways similar to an RPG rather than a sports title. However, there are a couple of elements that make us turn up our noses. We are talking above all about the exhausting uploads, too many and too long and the lack of substantial news compared to the prequel. To conclude, a well-kept technical sector that has little ~next gen~ and is an improvement on the one already appreciated in the first chapter. Ultimately a full-bodied ~more of the same~ which on the one hand attracts, but on the other disappoints for some flaws that can certainly be improved. The path traced is the right one. Pros: A lot of options, items, characters and stadiums Online career Intuitive but deep game system Cons: Lots of uploads Technically little ~next~ 2K Sports is a label of 2K Games, a subsidiary of Take2.
