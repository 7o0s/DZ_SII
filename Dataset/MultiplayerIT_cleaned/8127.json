The reason for so much attention is to be found not only in the indisputable value of the product, but also in a conversion work that seems to have been more thorough than that reserved for other titles, topped off with exclusive playful contents and extensive exploitation of the GamePad in game economy. So let's go and analyze the extent of the new features of this incarnation for Wii U. Robin, give me the Bat-GamePad We won't stay here to recall how the original Batman: Arkham City was one of the best games of 2011 as well as a very strong testimony to Rocksteady's great talent: we therefore invite anyone who missed the title along the way to go and retrieve our exhaustive coverage, complete with review, video review and dedicated superdirect. As with the other portings of third-party products, the usual rule applies in this case as well: the game is mainly suitable for those who have not been able to experience the last adventure of the dark knight on other platforms, given that the innovations introduced here do not appear in ultimately enough to warrant a second playthrough. However, Batman: Arkham City - Armored Edition does its best to make sense of its sale at full price (or almost) by aligning itself with the contents of the most recent ~Game of The Year Edition~: the package therefore includes all existing DLC , or the campaign starring Catwoman, the challenge rooms of the same heroine as well as those of Robin and Nightwing and finally the Harley Quinn's Revenge expansion, which can be selected directly from the menu but which is advisable to deal with later since it is placed directly after the facts narrated by the main adventure. In short, a lot of meat on the fire capable of adding half a dozen more hours to global longevity. GamePad in hand, however there are numerous small differences fielded by Batman: Arkham City - Armored Edition, which in most cases predictably revolve around the interaction with the touchscreen integrated into the controller. The screen is occupied by default by a convenient map of the city, with the zoom adjustable as desired via a slider placed in the lower corner: with the virtual keys on the sides it is possible to access the description of the main objective, the upgrades screen, to the gadget selection menu or to the information section which includes the game instructions as well as the textual documents that will be unlocked during the adventure. These are gimmicks that weren't really needed, but at least they allow you to manage all these functions without interrupting the flow of the game. On the other hand, the evaluation for the useless sonar mode is decidedly less positive, which highlights the position of the enemies and the puzzler's challenges on the touchscreen: the conventional Batman detective viewer works better and is also more intuitive, since it does not require you to move continuously the attention from the TV to the GamePad screen. For the rest, the Wii U controller shows off in a more or less marked way as regards the use of the various gadgets: you can use the tilt sensor to guide the remote-controlled Batarang, touch the display to detonate the charges of explosive gel, move the GamePad around itself via accelerometer to analyze a crime scene in search of clues and so on, all found pleasant but which it is easy for us to forget soon enough in favor of the more comfortable conventional mechanics. Only the cryptographic sequencer is inextricably linked to the touchscreen, which hosts simple mini-games to be solved to pick up enemy frequencies or unlock password-protected devices. Also in this case, it is a nice feature but it certainly does not change life. The judgment on the developers' decision to pass all radio communications through the GamePad speaker is of the opposite sign, a secondary variant but which significantly increases the sense of involvement. In terms of pure gameplay, the only real difference from the original is the one revealed by the title of the game: Batman (but also the other playable characters) shows up heredressed in armor capable of accumulating the kinetic energy of the blows inflicted and suffered, to be released - after filling a special indicator - with the so-called B.A.T. able to momentarily double the power of his melee moves. Closing notes on the graphic design: beyond the different look of Batman's armor, the game differs in minimal details from the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, with some slightly less defined textures here, some more slowdowns (fortunately non-invasive) and little else.", "date": "2012-12-10", "grade": "8.7"}
