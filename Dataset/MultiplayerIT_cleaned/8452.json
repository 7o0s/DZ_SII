At the hands of bloodthirsty assassins called Lutadores. Who is this mysterious alien race? Where does it come from? And how does it manage to alter gravity? But above all, where is his daughter? The questions leave room for memories of a tragically withered serenity, in the crowded metropolis called Vanguard. His rounds with faithful companion Leo Delgado, the approximate meals left on the dashboard of the car, the dreams and hopes of a better future. Everything was swept away that fatal day of the invasion, when the earth broke apart, rubble filled the sky and blood covered the streets. And they arrived, the Lutadores, with those sinister tribal armor and incomprehensible language. The world is doomed, but he doesn't care, the only thought he embraces at that moment is about his daughter, the hope that she is safe, away from all that horror. Nothing will be like before This is roughly the incipit of Inversion, the new third-person shooter produced by Saber Interactive, a Russian software house best known for the controversial Timeshift. The idea is to bring a tested formula towards new solutions, with the strategic use of physics. In this case we are talking about a highly spectacular shooter on the model of Gears of War, now almost a virus for how it manages to creep into any production. It must be added that here the hand has been let slip, so much so that it seems an almost indistinguishable clone, with the same ~testosteronic~ impact, with beefy and massive characters, exaggerated weapons and a general rude and rough characterization. Probably thanks to the use of the Unreal Engine, once again the protagonist in all fields, but it cannot really be said that Saber has unleashed on the artistic side. In fact, the implementation of physics turns out to be quite another thing, capable of giving a certain personality to the product. After a few hours of play, David and Leo acquire special equipment (Gravlink) capable of altering gravity, in this case the movement of certain functional objects both for overcoming environmental limitations and in the field of war, given that for example we can throw the carcass of a car on the heads of a pack of enemies, or throwing the enemies themselves into the air and then calmly hit them. In addition to this, the game has special sections in zero gravity, very vaguely inspired by Dead Space and others even set on overturned planes, with a spectacular high impact. Unfortunately, however, both are bound to limited sections which make the experience rigid and compartmentalized. Traditions and news Saber Interactive enjoys quoting various similar products of today, in addition to Cliff Bleszinski's masterpiece, inspirations from Bulletstorm, Rage, Half Life 2 and InFamous are noted, while great emphasis is given to the narrative sector, through a series of cutscenes that strategically blinds the viewer as to why what is happening on screen. A large part of the game is a long flashback that tells the story of the two protagonists from the invasion of the Lutadores, mysterious neo-barbarians able to control gravity, up to the destruction of Vanguard, the main city of the game. All this manages to give the feeling of a mystery-laden experience, even if the unpleasant feeling that there is no story to tell hangs, due to the rather ridiculous situation that culminates in a final twist that is truly at the edge of reality. Despite this, it must be admitted that the eight hours of the Inversion campaign manage to entertain for various reasons, first of all the preparation of the levels, quite varied and full of situations that require different approaches, up to the numerous battles with the bosses, spectacular and really challenging , much more than the average, which will force you to make numerous attempts before you can break them down, but when this happens, it will be a real satisfaction. Those who have played Timeshift will immediately notice the typical vein of Saber, with sections that require a certain commitment, such as those against snipers, which unlike similar products leave no escape on the first shot, forcing the player to make the most of the resources can arrange. The result is that in Inversion you die a lot, even at the minimum difficulty level, but perseverance is always rewarded. Xbox 360 goals 50 Achievements for a total of 1000 player points feature Inversion, just like every retail title. Completing the 13 campaign chapters grants you 200 valuable points, but we recommend bringing a friend along to add another 50! Forto win the others too, you need to try your hand at multiplayer modes and carry out certain operations connected, for example, to the use of the GravLink. Good luck! The short blanket The main problem of Inversion is represented by the low production values, which are inexorably reflected in the product. The exaltation for every new idea thrown into the field is reduced by the impossibility of expressing it at its best. It is not pleasant to go through rooms that are gradually destroyed, with the walls devastated by bullets, only to discover that it is not even possible to scratch a vase when the action is not foreseen by the game code. This is a common problem in this generation, where the hardware limitations are felt, but in the Saber Interactive work all the scaffolding excessively exposes the pre-calculated mechanics. The numerous ambitions in the gameplay are also limited by the rigidity of the Unreal Engine, unable to offer that dynamism clearly sought after by the programmers. Even in the zero-gravity sections you are almost never able to carry out movements in a transparent way: often the direction to follow is unknown, or the character refuses to perform the action, often leading to anger for the ensuing deaths. In the end, the most successful parts are those of the classic shooter, which is expressed through the well-tested coverage dynamics already seen to exhaustion from Gears Of War onwards. Even here, however, the approximate production values are noted, with weapons poorly characterized when not extremely derivative. Despite the good graphic design, the attractiveness of the scenarios is non-existent, with anonymous structures and insipid enemies unable to attract the viewer's attention, as well as the two protagonists, who end up being the bad copy of the much more famous Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago (curiously even the ethnicities match!). It is almost forgotten that one of the key points is the rescue of David's daughter, demonstrating how little empathy is developed towards the characters and the events narrated. The game features the ability to play the campaign in online co-op (no local), along with a number of both deathmatch and survival multiplayer modes. The dialogues are in English, subtitled in Italian.", "date": "2012-07-06", "grade": "6.5"}
