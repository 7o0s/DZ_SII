Either for the innate sympathy of its characters, the crazy little monkeys AiAi, MeeMee, GonGon and Baby, or for a simple but in its own way extremely satisfying and fun gameplay, perfect for hit and run games perhaps when you are away from home and they have a handful of minutes at their disposal to be able to relax, the fact is that since its announcement there has been a fair amount of talk about this title. The product, which according to the developers ideally wants to refer to the first chapter of the popular series which arrived on home consoles for the first time in 2001 on the GameCube (it is no coincidence that some levels are taken from that edition) thanks to the efforts of Amusement Video, is a sort of porting of the homonymous version for Nintendo Wii, enriched by new functions and features. The concept is the same as always: along the lines of the old Atari Marble Madness, but with the help of modern technology and three-dimensional scenarios, the player must control a monkey positioned inside a transparent sphere, making it move along predefined paths in search of bananas and bonuses to collect along the way, using the third dimension as a key element of gameplay. The movements of the object are in fact obtained if desired by tilting the plane using the Vita's accelerometer/gyroscope as an alternative to the classic commands with the levers, to try to get it to its destination. Which is not easy given the presence on the ground of traps, mobile platforms, obstacles and other elements artfully positioned to make the journey more difficult. And by ~elements~ we also mean toy dinosaurs or toy soldiers guarding castles since the game features themed worlds with related scenarios. Rolling towards the goal In fact, the title contains about one hundred levels divided into five mega areas, specifically Jungle, Clay, Wood, Metal and Cardboard, plus eight mini-games, including Monkey Target and Monkey Bingo, curious variations of billiards, pinball, rodeo, as well as free simian interpretations of playful activities such as bowling, and boss fights, which grow progressively in terms of degree of difficulty. The first worlds are made up of very simple levels, the platforms are often delimited by barriers to prevent the primates from falling down, time is always very permissive and therefore they represent to all intents and purposes a sort of tutorial to start the player using of the controls, basically similar to those of the other products in the series, obviously apart from those specific to the characteristics of the Vita. In this sense Banana Blitz has a more than good learning curve, and after a few games rotating and tilting the screen, or using the two analog sticks to guide the pesky monkeys through the game won't be a problem. However, this does not mean that the game is very simple: in the more advanced scenarios or with the greater degree of difficulty, some sessions are really hard to overcome. In fact, contrary to the first impression that the product had aroused in us on the occasion of its demonstration at the Tokyo Game Show 2011, it cannot be defined as a similar-casual title, except for some of the aforementioned mini-games (others such as the Labyrinth of the love we found them rather difficult) which to all intents and purposes appear oriented towards satisfying the tastes of those players who do not have much time to waste behind complicated scenarios or excessive difficulties of any kind, and who therefore prefer games whose learning curve is not be too long or complex. All in all, the move made by SEGA can be shared, keeping in mind the type of user, the objective impossibility of making large changes to a rather consolidated basic play structure for the genre and type of console. While for the rest, we are talking especially about the main mode, you are really busy completing the various areas and the degree of challenge of some scenarios is quite high. To tell the truth, part of the excessive difficulty of some levels is in our opinion due to a certain sensitivity of the controls: using only the Vita ones we noticed what we think is an incorrect calibration of the gyroscope by the developers, so it is easy to roll often towards the abyss and then fall into the void. Instead, using the analog ones, better results are obtained since they are more precise, but we still believe they are too sensitive,especially at the slightest changes of direction. This certainly does not affect what has been said up to now about the goodness of the product, but certainly some less patient gamers could occasionally get nervous. Some problems also with the camera, especially in the narrowest paths, and in the menus, which are a bit slow to load. recharge. PSVita trophies For all Super Monkey Ball fans: Banana Splitz offers a good number of Trophies, a good 51: 42 Bronze, 5 Silver, 3 Gold, 1 Platinum. However, unlocking them is not easy at all: for example, you have to complete some challenges, recover all the bananas from all the stages, get 1,000 points in a single round at Monkey Target, make 10 goblins appear in one go in Hunt for goblins and so on. The little designer A very interesting novelty of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz lies in the possibility of generating a practically infinite number of levels in which to then play. Everything works thanks to the Vita camera and the feature included in the product called Shake 'n Bake Level Creator: thanks to this interesting editor, in fact, you can create personalized scenarios in which to try your hand, as mentioned before, alone or with friends in dozens of new challenges. But what characterizes this ~tool~ is not so much its level creator function, but rather the way it does it. In practice it is possible to develop entire routes automatically starting from a simple photo. Simply, just snap one of a picture, a room, a plate of pasta or even the user's face, shake the console immediately after and in no time at all the software inside the game will create an entire path. Of course, the results will not always be optimal, a lot will depend for example on the shape of the object taken as a reference to obtain an area, but in most cases it is possible to obtain good material. This gets even more interesting when you think of the fact that the harder you shake PlayStation Vita, the more the recreated level design takes on shapes and paths of a complex nature. You can share your creations with other users or download theirs, provided, however, that you have friendship with them on the PlayStation Network. A choice that we frankly do not approve of, as it partially limits the fun that a similar function could instead offer if left more ~free~ in this sense. Remaining online, we should mention the introduction of online rankings through which you can compare your results with those of other users, thanks to the GPS function and the use of a convenient interactive map of the world, as well as the presence of matches multiplayer over Wi-Fi for up to two or four people depending on the type of mini-game. Going to close our article, talking about graphics, that of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz is certainly not the state of the art of PlayStation Vita productions, but all in all it is pleasant. The worlds are colorful and well characterized in their own way, with scenarios that reflect in a cartoonish way the relative historical periods or the relative settings, while characters and lighting effects are the norm of this genre of games. The audio sector, on the other hand, presents pleasant little music to accompany the adventures of the nice little monkeys which in turn are vocally characterized by a series of rather amusing sounds. Also in this case we are not faced with the best of the best in terms of quality, but only with a fair sampling and composition work, however the sound still performs its ~task~ well.", "date": "2012-10-23", "grade": "7.0"}
