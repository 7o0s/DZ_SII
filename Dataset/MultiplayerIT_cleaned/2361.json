{"name": "Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alone-in-the-dark-the-new-nightmare.html", "text": "The horror returns Beyond the version for the portable eight-bit Nintendo, the versions for consoles and PC are all quite similar, if we exclude the higher resolution of the PC and the greater fluidity (although not free from drops) of the latter, what makes the difference between the 128-bit version for the unfortunate Sega console and that of the 32-bit Sony is the definition alone, given that 30fps and two-dimensional backgrounds peep out in both versions. Finally, after a long time, the release for Playstation 2 arrives, the last in chronological order to appear on the market; was it worth waiting for Carnby and Alone on the Sony black monolith? And above all, why all these extra months? Three-dimensional backdrops? slurrp! 60 frames per second stable? Wow! Animations of the face and lips? My! Too bad that in truth the game has not changed one iota, on the contrary History! First of all, it is good to say right away that the story is not linked to the prequels, so much so that even a boy who has never tried the first 3 chapters of Alone In The Dark can immediately get to the heart of the story. For connoisseurs of the previous episodes, the decisive change of look for Edward Carnby is surprising, decidedly cooler (don't show it to your girls, you never know Ed), here accompanied by the beautiful Aline Cedrac, but first things first. The action takes place on a creepy island (much more than you think, my word!) called Shadow Island; in this gloomy place a friend of Carnby's, the best paranormal investigator around, has recently lost his life (if I was writing about the thrill you could have thought that the game was a Dylan Dog spin-off, am I wrong? Ed). Charles Fiske, this is the poor man's name, was down there for a task assigned to him by his client, a certain Frederick Johnson, the same person who will send our alter ego there at his precise request, obviously to investigate the real causes that led upon Fiske's death. With Carnby, at the specific request of the client, also the beautiful Aline Cedrac, a busty teacher of ancient Indian languages, takes off. History! A presentation in full motion video of just decent quality (like the others that will be in the game together with the classic cutscenes in real time), even if slightly higher than the previous releases by definition, shows us the journey aboard a seaplane of the 2 protagonists, a journey destined for a dramatic event; as soon as they arrive in sight of Shadow Island, the seaplane seems subject to a hostile and unknown force which causes the destruction of the vehicle. Luckily, thanks to the parachutes, our duo manages to save themselves even if they split up: Edward arrives in a forest, Aline even on the roof of a mansion that doesn't really bode well (to put it mildly). It is good to say that the island is in the hands of the Morton family and Aline believes that Charles Fiske was killed by a member of that family, Obed Morton. As is customary in this videogame genre, all those that we initially define as truths with knowledge of the facts are destined to give way to reality, however terrible and frightening it is. We stop here so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering the beautiful plot, the twists (which will put a strain on heart patients and easily impressionable people) that permeate the title distributed by Infogrames and now close to release. Small warning right from the start: if you are afraid of the dark it is useless to continue reading this review, if you don't have any or you are curious, go ahead, now we will talk about . Horrible graphics As already mentioned in the initial hat, it was thought that a decisive reinvigoration of the graphics sector had been the main cause of the delayed release of the Playstation 2 version of Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare, after all two-dimensional backdrops, only 30 fps (or 60 not stable if you played on pumped PCs), lack of facial animations or clothes deformations, they certainly wouldn't have been a good calling card for the powerful console that gave birth to Devil May Cry and Gran Turismo 3. What a disappointment. If graphics of this level already make the owner of the Sega Dreamcast a little irritated (accustomed to the glories of the wonderful Resident Evil Code Veronica), we dare not imagine the face of an owner of the legendary 128-bit Sony watching a similar ~show~. So let's start describing the graphics of the game: the backdrops, as already mentioned, have remained the same, rendered, a peculiarity that would not be condemned if they were at least as fabulous as those of the ever closer remake of Resident Evil for Nintengo Gamecube; unfortunatelyppo however, they are practically the same as the versions already released, with a color palette that sometimes seems out of tune and with a rain effect that seems to belong to the past of 32-bit consoles. Horrible graphics With the polygonal elements, characters and monsters, the situation continues to make us turn up our noses: the human characters don't have a large number of animations, not to mention the facial animations, which are completely absent here (how ~nice~ to see Carnby still communicating with Aline over the radio with her mouth closed). If there are no facial animations, let alone if the clothes deform according to our movements, producing folds and rearrangements following steps and hops here and there. Most of the monsters are made with a low poly count, but at least they defend (slightly) better than the characters. The light effect created by your torch has perhaps been the most valid element of the graphics in the other formats, so on balance, although on Playstation 2 it only makes you laugh, it remains the most satisfying visual feature here too (not that it took so much ). As if all this were not enough, the Dreamworks guys have also managed to obtain an uncertain frame rate, given that despite few polygons on the screen and rendered backdrops, the fateful 30 frames per second, decrease on values that settle on 23-24, provided of course to use the much loved 60hz option (d'oh!! Ed), included therein otherwise the values will necessarily be lower. Despite everything, however, the creation of some monsters generates a certain smile on our face, either for a very ~Lovecraftian~ design, or for some stylistically well-crafted creatures (and resulting from a truly sick mind), but otherwise one could e much more had to be done. Particular mention also for the architectural style chosen for the house, decidedly gothic which at times recalls the film Nightmare Before Christmas (which in the opinion of the writer should have received a better reception) by the visionary Tim ~Beetlejuice~ Burton. Fortunately, a game like this doesn't need just beautiful graphics to attract (see Silent Hill on Playstation), other are the key elements such as the story and the atmosphere. About the latter one cannot fail to mention.. Scary audio Oh yes, a good 50% of the atmosphere of a surival horror game depends on the audio sector included in the videogame package: electrifying, distressing, drawn or barely audible music is practically mandatory and this fourth chapter of the horror saga Infogrames license plate absolutely does not disappoint in this respect. Really wanting to nitpick..well, the quality of some sounds is not the best (but otherwise they inspire an indescribable shiver down my spine) and the lack of implementation of the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound system (standard on Xbox from Microsoft) makes itself heard: think how many extra jumps towards the ceiling we would have made if there had been the sound localization of every single step, shot, grunt that it isin any case we can't complain, the bad, harsh, scary to be honest there is and it is palpable from beginning to end, both with Edward and with Aline. Scary audio In the single Dvd that you will find in the package, you will find the dubbing and subtitles in Italian and as usual the situation is not the best; wanting to give a couple of examples, Sergio Mancinelli (Yotaro Kid in Galaxy Cyclone Bryger, Ito in Due Come Noi and Kibito in Dragon Ball Z and Gt) who we recognized as Carnby's voice actor seems to me not in good shape, the fantastic Patrick is slightly better Prata (Go in Getter Robot Last Day and the spin off Shin Getter Robot Vs Neo Getter Robot) who voices the pilot of the airplane in the intro, but more than anything else annoys the bad cohesion with the lips in the initial full motion video, given that in game the mouths are all strangely silent. Aaargh a monster! Have you ever played a video game like this? Do you know at least Resident Evil and Silent Hill? Here, mix the strengths of these two great video game sagas and you will have obtained the fourth episode of the Carnby saga. Entitled CAPtive COMmunication, Infogrames has drawn on the graphic style (already borrowed from the Osaka software house from the previous AITDs, funny, isn't it? Ed), a good part of the furnishings and puzzles. The weapon aiming system is also not dissimilar to the first (noteworthy) horror game that appeared on the gray 32-bit Sony, the flashlight (once extracted) is used via an analog stick, while the inventory is unlimited , generatingenthusiasm for this choice (in the first place for myself) which will avoid long walks far and wide just to deposit weapons and objects in trunks mysteriously confluent with each other, however making others turn up their noses (I think a minority anyway). The saving system is only partially taken up: it is true, without amulets (which take the place of ink) you will not be able to save, but once you have obtained these objects you will be able to save wherever you like, without looking for a typewriter. From the title Konami (Silent Hill 2 is released in Italy on November 23rd) the obsessive atmosphere is borrowed where even the slightest suspicious sound can give you unspeakable goosebumps: shortly after starting the game with Aline Cedrac, you will hear a spectral meowing of a cat almost as if something were eating it or, again, in certain areas the monsters will turn off the light forcing you to use your faithful torch, really essential to finish the game, also because there are not a few enemies who fear the light (as opposed to others who will benefit from it!!). In summary, the fights, therefore, are there and they are not even few (Resident Evil legacy), but much is also left to the player's imagination, permeated by sound effects, terrifying screams and a truly spooky darkness (Silent Hill docet). The story is definitely exciting, the twists abound and the atmosphere is ensured not only by the aforementioned audio side, but also by a whole series of small objects aimed at increasing the tension such as letters, photos and lots of tape recorders with messages engraved on tape. It won't take long for horror vets to finish the game with both characters, even if the longevity is definitely a cut above the games mentioned above in the course of this review, mainly by virtue of a number of puzzles that go beyond the classic find the key, open the door and go on. The light, turn it on! On balance we are faced with a video game that we should recommend to practically everyone, by virtue of a captivating story, a thrilling atmosphere that generates that damned conviction that in less than 5 seconds something will make its way towards us but unfortunately something went wrong: the graphic impact really makes the interest of the gamer lose appeal who in a few days will have the opportunity to play Silent Hill 2. Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare is undoubtedly a game to try, it is true that technically it's horrendous for 128 bit Sony (and also loads a lot between one location and another), but it undoubtedly offers moments of strong tension and pure horror. If you have already bought Resident Evil Code Veronica and you have a nest egg sufficient to buy another game together with Silent Hill 2, think about it or in any case rent it or borrow it but do not say around that you have snubbed it completely; it would not be for real gamers to leave out a good game just for a very low technical realization. Pros: Distressing and well-studied atmosphere 2 adventures, linked together It is not among the easiest horror games Cons: graphically mediocre very long uploads The horror returns It was the year 1996 when Bio Hazard (in the West known as Resident Evil) was released on Sony Playstation, erroneously considered by many to be the first horror game (or rather survival horror game) to appear on store shelves. It is not so. In the early 90s, Infogrames invented the genre with Alone In The Dark, a great example of storyboards, puzzles and how virtual cameras are managed to really give the impression of watching a horror film. Anyone who remembers this game cannot help but notice all the elements in common with the game created by the brilliant Shinji Mikami, the man to whom we owe other globally known franchises such as Dino Crisis, Onimusha and Devil May Cry (still a couple of months for the European release). The setting of the visual sector is borrowed from the title Infogrames, a skilful mix of polygonal elements (such as the characters) and rendered backdrops (therefore two-dimensional), some types of puzzles and the presence of non-player characters scattered, coincidentally, in the mansion, background chosen for said game. Over time both franchises spawned 2 sequels (they were also ported to Playstation and Saturn) but inexplicably the saga ended up being forgotten; fortunately, it is no longer like this: the return of the investigator Edward Carnby, unfortunately postponed several times, has been long awaited by a large group of fans in the various announced versions; the first to be released is the one for Psone, closely followed by the one for Game Boy Color, personal computer (excellent provided", "date": "2001-11-14", "grade": null}
