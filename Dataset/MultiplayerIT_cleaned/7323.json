{"name": "Card Shark", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/card-shark-recensione.html", "text": "The gaming landscape is submerged by years of card games. Of course, there is no shortage of variety, including trading card games, rogue-like deckbuilding and RPG or strategic adventures where every action must be performed with its own deck of cards. In this scenario, Devolver Digital is proposing a new adventure, which certainly hasn't gone unnoticed by indie enthusiasts: Card Shark, a game in which we play a cheater who gambles on cards. Considering what the market has to offer in this sense, can we say that Card Shark offers a new type of card game? No, because Card Shark isn't a card game (or even a game of sharks, to be honest). We know that it might seem strange considering the name and that, between one trailer and another, all we've seen is a set of card games. The cards, though, are just a theme, a tool to tell a story, while giving us something to do with the controller in the meantime. However, let's not anticipate the times and go in order, in our review of Card Shark. Silent and nameless Card Shark is visually magnificent Let's take a step back and place Card Shark in its historical period, which is a fundamental part of the appeal of the game. We are in the eighteenth century, in the France of Louis XV. The French Revolution hasn't arrived yet and the kingdom is swollen with rich nobles ready to squander everything on gambling. We play the role of a nameless and mute boy, a simple scullion in an inn in the French countryside. Everything changes when the Count of Saint-Germain takes a seat at one of the tables and involves us in a fixed game. From here begins an adventure that takes us around France (and beyond), between one game of cards and the next. The purpose of the Count, who acts as a sort of guide for our protagonist, however, is not only to raise money, but to exploit the gaming tables to steal secrets related to an intrigue of the court of Versailles. Card Shark will take us around France and beyond The entire plot revolves around these past events which, as we will soon find out, also involve Louis XV himself. It is a simple plot, which slowly reveals itself in the early stages and gains speed in the final ones. It is always interesting, but above all it puts many historical figures into play, thus proving to be even more pleasant for those who are passionate about this period. Starting with the Comte de Saint-Germain and even going as far as John Law and Caliostro, there are multiple famous names that are revisited and inserted to fit the Card Shark storyline. However, it is above all the artistic sector that supports everything. Andrea Boccadoro's soundtrack is perfect in every moment and Nicolai Troshinsky's graphics don't have a single drool. The environments, the characters, the details of the cards and game tables, everything is a pleasure for the eyes. Trump cards A game about cards, not cards, this is Card Shark Card Shark, as mentioned, is not a card game, but a card game. This is because almost all the phases of the game take place at the table and the goal is to win dishonestly, but the cards are just a theme, an aesthetic choice. Ludically, there is no deckbuilding or strategic match management. Each mission will see us grappling with a trick, which is nothing but a more or less elaborate QTE-style mnemonic minigame. We will have to enter a series of inputs, sometimes with a visual hint and sometimes purely by heart, with respect to what we have learned in the tutorial phase that precedes each mission. The missions tend to be very fast, a few minutes at a time, and new tricks are learned from phase to phase. The more advanced ones are variations and fusions of previous ones, but from time to time they will be faced as something new, also because the player will hardly be able to remember every single trick on the list perfectly, if not dedicating more time to the game than it actually lasts . Our match lasted just over seven hours, meeting all the characters in the game and also completing the non-mandatory missions. We've also seen all of the endings, which can be completed simply by reloading the ending autosave multiple times. There is therefore no particular reason to replay, other than the desire to obtain all Steam Achievements. We will have to complete various QTE mini-games in Card Shark What matters, however, is that Card Shark is fun from a playful point of view. The theme is very original and the QTEs manage to be interesting to complete for the bulk of the game. In the middle of it all there are also other small mini-games, such as a coin toss, card toss and duels tothe edge of the sword, which can also lead us to Death (literally, we are talking about the Grim Reaper) who will thank us if we do not play on the maximum difficulty. Unfortunately these variants are only a minor part of the adventure. Card tricks are fun to learn and complete, but structurally they don't change over the course of the game. Still dealing with mnemonic QTEs, playing a match in the early stages and one in the last stages is not very different, except that in the end it will be a little more difficult to remember all the steps (there is a mode that allows you to completely skip the QTEs , for those who should get stuck). There is therefore little internal variety and we are sure that some players may start to get bored by the end. Our advice is to play the demo, available on both PC and Nintendo Switch, before proceeding with the purchase, so as to understand firsthand if the original Card Shark theme manages to charm or if the limited structure quickly becomes boring . We can safely say that we were fascinated and we recommend this trip to 18th century France to those who love experiences that are a little different from the usual.", "date": "2022-06-02", "grade": "8.2"}
