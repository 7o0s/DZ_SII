{"name": "Capcom Fighting Jam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/capcom-fighting-jam.html", "text": "A look at the gameplay What immediately catches the eye, as soon as the home screen loads, is the small number of game modes: there are only Arcade, for the classic game, Versus, to fight against a friend, and Training to train to use various characters. That's pretty much all CFJ has to offer, no extra modes like Survival or Time Attack, not even the Color Edit Mode featured in Capcom Vs Snk. As for the fights, there is nothing new compared to the classic fighting games, the basic structure is essentially that of a Tag Team in which two characters must be selected to be able to alternate before each round. However, it is not necessary to use both, in fact, if desired, there is the possibility of always using the same wrestler for all matches, but it is good to make the right choice before the start of the match, because it is not possible to alternate them when the fight started. The choice of characters can be made from a shortlist of 25 fighters (plus a secret couple) from five different Capcom games, which are Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 3, Street Fighter Alpha, Darkstalkers and the lesser known Red Earth . For each game only 4 characters have been included, for Street Fighter 2 we have Ryu, Guile, Zangief and Bison, while the Darkstalkers team includes Felicia, Demitri, Anakaris and Jedah, then there are Sakura, Guy, Yun, Karin, Urien and others for the remaining teams. For a title as ambitious as Capcom Fighting Jam 25 characters is very few and considering the fact that many of the most interesting ones were inevitably left out (including Blanka, Fei Long and even Ken), some of you may be disappointed to realize that the own favorite wrestler failed to pass the selection. If you have played Capcom vs Snk, you will surely remember the presence of the Groove System, an innovative system that allowed the player to change the fighting style of their characters. Capcom Fighting Jam uses a very similar principle to Groove, the only difference is that it has been implemented in a slightly different way: the fighting style depends on the team the chosen character belongs to, and therefore it is not possible to select him as we like in CvsS. This ~groove~ will therefore affect your character, both in terms of some particular fighting skills and in terms of the bar of special moves and their relative effectiveness. For example, Street Fighter 3 fighters will be able to perform a particular special parry (a move only present in SF3), which Darkstalkers fighters cannot use. While adding depth to the gameplay, this groove system could have been implemented in a better way, for example as in Capcom Vs Snk, in which, in addition to being able to choose the style to our liking, it was also possible to create a totally personalized one. Let's leave aside the ~pre-combat~ flaws seen up to now, and let's briefly analyze the actual game phase...at least in this respect CFJ doesn't totally disappoint, but it's certainly not without flaws. The characters have all more or less preserved their original feeling, some of them have been retouched a bit in terms of moves and speed, but nothing so shocking. This can be considered a good thing for those who love the old Capcom style and who have not looked favorably on the restyle of Capcom vs Snk, but on the contrary those who expected something totally innovative will be disappointed. Regardless of your preferences, leaving the characters as they were was a major mistake, this is because a strong imbalance is created between the fighters which weighs heavily on the gameplay. Luckily the controls are very good (6 button controls were used), and apart from the imbalance issue, the level of playability is similar to older Capcom titles. The technical sector Also as regards the graphics, everything has been left as it was originally, but in some cases there are some deteriorations. In principle all the characters use the exact same graphics and the exact same sprites of the respective original versions, however some (for example those of Street Fighter 3) have been intentionally brought to a lower quality graphic level to avoid creating excessive diversity with the older characters (Street Fighter 2). The definition has therefore been lowered, the number of colors and some animations have been cut... needless to say that the result is certainly not the best, it would have been wiser to improve the old characters instead of worsening the more recent ones, also becausethe differences in fluidity of the animations are however very visible between a wrestler from SF3 and one from SF2. Even the backdrops don't make a good impression, they are stylistically anonymous, sparse and without a minimum of animation. The sound sector defends itself well with original sound effects and voice acting, however the addition of totally energy-free music makes the gaming experience bland. Fortunately, it is possible to unlock the original soundtrack of each character, but there is always talk of midi music that does not hold up to today's standard, perhaps a remake would have been welcome. Final comment Capcom Fighting Jam is essentially a budget game halfway between Street fighter Anniversary Collection and a Versus Game. In fact, it gives the possibility to play with some characters taken from various Capcom games, while maintaining a certain retro taste. In the light of the analysis done, CFJ inexorably fails in its goal: few characters, few game modes (why not at least include online?), unburdened gameplay, questionable technical implementation. We strongly recommend that you look elsewhere, perhaps by getting the original games, or by taking a look at titles from other software houses, such as Guilty Gear and King of Fighters. p> Pros: retro feeling Ability to make characters from different games fight It's a budget game Cons: few selectable characters few game modes Technical realization lower than the originals It's been years now that Capcom no longer dedicates itself to the creation of new two-dimensional fighting games, and it was probably a decision due to the fact that the gaming market is currently quite hostile towards those games that don't boast nice three-dimensional graphics. However, this does not mean that Capcom has been, and still is, the leader in the 2D beat'em up sector, and that in the past it has given us top-level games, first of all those belonging to the Street Fighter series. When Capcom Fighting Jam was announced, all the numbers were in place to become the definitive gaming experience for fans of 2D fighting jams: all the fundamental characters of the most famous series of the Japanese software house would have been included in a single game to delight everyone the most diehard fans. From this ingenious idea we would have expected something truly colossal, a game that would have distorted the way of understanding the two-dimensional fighting game, especially after seeing what Capcom was capable of with similar masterpieces in the ~Versus~ style such as Capcom Vs SNK 2 and Marvel Vs Capcom 2 unfortunately, however, the final result was far below expectations, leaving everyone with a bitter taste, even if in the end it was not a total disappointment.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
