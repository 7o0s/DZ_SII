We will therefore finally be able to put a point on the package offered by Game Freak and, consequently, also on what this eighth generation represented. After telling you about our experience on the Isle of Armor, we are therefore ready to evaluate the complete package and the DLC The Snowy Lands of the Crown. Landa Corona: between history and legends To get to Landa Corona you take the usual train from Brassbury: you can do it at any time after having reached the Wild Lands for the first time, but it should be borne in mind that some sections of the DLC will require you to have arrived at a certain point in the story. To access all the playable it is necessary to have completed everything, even the campaign of The Lonely Isle of Armor. Once again, Crown Tundra Pokmon's level scales based on the number of medals they've earned so far. The region is a sort of snowy tundra with a Scottish flavor and some elements inspired by Edinburgh, and immediately presents a very precise narrative line: everything revolves around the relationship between Peony and her daughter Nia, and some legends collected by this volcanic character for entertain the girl during their vacation. The main thread is linked to Calyrex, the new Psychic / Grass-type legendary Pokmon who is the protagonist of a rather substantial campaign, where the player is called to face some missions and to make an important decision. We are not faced with a particularly articulated narrative, but the characters have a good characterization and the assignments are a good excuse to start exploring the area. The second legend is articulated following a new trio of legendary birds: the Galar forms of Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres are very distinct Pokmon compared to those seen in Kanto and, even if their appearance in the area is not explained in depth, the mechanisms that lead to their capture are really interesting: in fact, they can be found flying around in the three different Wild Lands of Galar and each of them requires a different approach to start the fight. Finally, the last legend concerns the Regi, a series of elemental giants inspired by the Jewish golems and introduced for the first time in the third generation games. Until now four were known, but in Landa Corona it is possible to meet two new unpublished specimens, Regieleki and Regidrago. Unfortunately, their capture is the one that disappointed the most: difficult puzzles to solve and deep dungeons to explore were expected; reality has materialized in four temples with a single room each, which can be accessed without having to bother too much with one's acumen. Sin. Bundle Packs The DLC The Snowy Lands of the Crown will be available from October 23, 2020 for all those who have purchased one of the Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield Expansion passes for 30 euros. Starting Friday, November 6, a bundle pack will be released that contains the main game Pokmon Sword or Pokmon Shield and the respective Expansion Pass. The contents are exactly the same as you would get if you purchased the base game plus the expansion separately, but the difference here is that all the included software is already loaded on a single game card. The Endgame that was missing Instead, what surprises positively about the DLC The Snowy Lands of the Crown is its enormous amount of content: in fact, you don't have time to complete a narrative strand, which immediately Game Freak offers a new adventure, a new mode or a new path to beat. As soon as you arrive, you are immediately introduced to Dynamax Adventures, a new mode where you team up with three other Trainers, online, locally or controlled by (so to speak) artificial intelligence, to explore a den full of Pokmon Dynamax. Unlike the normal lairs present in the Wild Lands, here you choose one Pokmon each from those offered on loan from time to time and start the challenge of a series of dynamaxized creatures. Three must be faced before the boss, or one of the many legendary Pokmon encountered in previous generations and finally available for capture. To increase the challenge, the damage received in the fights is not reset after the fight, but some characters can restore Health Points and Power Points, or offer new random Pokmon: you will therefore have to choose which path to follow also based on what you want to get next every discountro, and not just on the basis of the type to challenge. Also because capturing one allows you to replace the one you have in your team. The progression proceeds by voting, and at the end of the path you can only keep one Pokmon among those caught up to there. Each legendary can only be caught once, so the idea of hunting Pokmon with specific natures or IVs becomes quite difficult to apply. At the end of each round you get Roccemax, a currency that allows you to get rather tasty rewards; among these, the ability patch stands out, a new object that allows you to replace a Pokmon's ability with the special one of its species. Matchmaking can rely on 8-character passwords and proved to be quite fast in all circumstances. On the other hand, the mechanism for redistributing players in the event of abandonment by one of the coaches needs to be reviewed: at the moment this brings everyone back to the beginning, forcing them to resume the challenge in singles, being able to count only on non-player characters who really confirm themselves very unintelligent. A smarter system would have been better, perhaps capable of replacing the single player who leaves with a new coach, preferably human. At a certain point, however, the Ultra Beasts are also added to the equation, while an additional option allows you to tackle the Dynamax Adventures in infinite mode: a survival version that allows you to obtain a lot of max rocks, but which does not allow you to capture legendary Pokmon and that soon turns out to be a bit repetitive. It will certainly be a good excuse to face long streaming sessions on Twitch but, without an integrated chat to coordinate the moves, it is really boring to face dozens of Dynamax Pokmon in succession with strangers. Also due to the impossibility of leaving one's place to another when one gets tired of carrying on. However, the capture of the legendary does not stop at the Peony campaign and the Dynamax Adventures: at a certain point it will be necessary to follow the traces of another trio of elusive creatures, which will lead to an encounter with nothing less than a mysterious Pokmon. In short, there are really many incentives to explore every corner of Landa Corona and finally the team has accepted the request to insert articulated missions for the capture of the legendary. So good! Unfortunately, the structural limitations already highlighted in the review of Pokmon Sword and Shield remain, above all a presentation of the Wilds that is far too repetitive: the alternation of snowy areas and grasslands is interrupted by too few points of interest; caves and dungeons have almost no branches and all look the same; side activities are practically completely missing and, apart from Peony, there are no new characters whose history is worth knowing. Aside from that, the addition of the Galar Star Tournament represents the latest addition to Goalwick's semi-competitive activities. This umpteenth tournament created by Dandel allows you to face Multiple Lotte against and together with the various characters of the campaign, deepening their knowledge and obtaining other rewards for the competitive. Just a shame it can't be tackled online with friends. Goodbye Eighth Generation With the DLC dedicated to Landa Corona, the experience with the eighth generation Pokmon can be considered concluded and it can therefore make sense to take advantage of this review to take stock of these two years of content. It's useless to deny it: the franchise's debut on Switch was characterized by ups and downs. Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield represented an important turning point for The Pokmon Company, which found itself dealing with an unprecedented generational leap from the small 3DS to the hybrid of Nintendo. The difficulties are there for all to see: a meager and poorly optimized technical sector; cumbersome and incomplete online features; a narrative that tries to push on the characterization of the characters but does so without too much conviction. And it makes no sense to return to the question of the Masudian genocide, given that the latest updates have dramatically increased the number of Pokmon that can be caught. However, there are also positive sides: from a design of creatures particularly inspired by a successful renewal of the Pokmon League, passing through a competitive never so accessible and an Expansion Pass that has slowly embarked on an interesting path for what will be the future of the brand , especially in the approach to capturing legendaries and the variety of content. What will the next generation be like? And will it arrive before or after the long-awaited Sinnoh? Hard to say: what is certain is that Game Freak will have a fundamental test bench and will have to exploit every element at his disposal, including the coCollaboration with the other Nintendo teams in Tokyo, to create an all-round triple A, not only in sales.", "date": "2020-10-29", "grade": "8.2"}
