{"name": "Eroici ninja alla riscossa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/78110-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-heroes-3-eroici-ninja-alla-riscossa.html", "text": "Born on PlayStation 2 simply as a fighting game, characterized however by several original ideas (the double level of depth, the platform component, the use of objects, etc.), Naruto: Ultimate Ninja quickly landed on PSP as well, retaining the basic mechanics and introducing some innovations that are sometimes welcome and sometimes less so. The second episode, in particular, joined the normal arcade mode with an alternative mode in which Naruto and some of his companions were called to investigate a mysterious fortress pervaded by dark chakra. In this context, the characters moved like pawns on a board, facing a different test in each room of the fortress. For Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, the developers of CyberConnect2 have further exaggerated the same concept, even going so far as to eliminate the classic arcade mode in meetings and introducing the ~Road of the Master~ mode as the real fulcrum of the game. Once again Naruto and his friends move like pawns along a path also made up of crossroads, where it is possible to come across ~shop~ boxes to buy unlockable elements (images, music, etc.) but above all, challenges must be overcome. This applies to every single chapter of the story, which takes the events of the Shippuden series and pushes them further than ever seen in a Naruto tie-in, ultimately presenting itself as a rather long and demanding journey, which certainly not completed within a few hours. The challenges can take place within platform or beat 'em up sections. In the first case, the character we control must overcome a predetermined path, avoiding obstacles and defeating the enemies that appear in front of him on the fly, possibly collecting the objects present in the stage. This type of challenge can also be regulated by a time limit, within which it is necessary to reach the ~finish line~. In the case of the fighting game sections, the meetings can be single or group, and often imply special conditions to be met in order to be successfully overcome. It may therefore happen that you have to defeat your opponent without using the special move, or you have to deal with an enemy with increased power or speed, and so on. Ninja stuff As already underlined, the ~Road of the Master~ unfolds along a series of chapters which are in turn divided into individual stages of variable duration and of different types. During the early stages, however, this mode proves to be all too simple and accessible, putting us in front of simple scenarios with some jumps and objects to collect. Similarly, the first fights are completed almost without being touched by the opponent on duty. Fortunately, the degree of difficulty is adjusted after a while and the challenge, without ever becoming really harsh, acquires a minimum of consistency. The problem, more than anything else, is that the side modes have literally disappeared: via the classic arcade mode with the matches in sequence, it is now possible to play fights only individually, through the ~free battle~ mode. It is undoubtedly an inexplicable debasement of the product, which from a second weight mode would have gained a lot in terms of longevity and which therefore ends up offering a somewhat ~incomplete~ experience. Ad-hoc multiplayer for four players, in fact, for a number of reasons (primarily of a practical nature, i.e. having at hand three people who own a PSP with the same game) cannot constitute a replacement worthy of therefore it serves more as a side dish. Returning to the main mode, the control system is unchanged from the past and allows us to control each of the fifty available characters (many of which are to be unlocked) in the same way, given that the combos are performed simply by pressing the attack button together to one of the four directions of the d-pad. The special moves, which depend on the chakra bar, are also simple to activate and once launched require the pressing in sequence of the keys shown on the screen to obtain a greater or lesser impact on the enemy. Each ninja has unique attacks, as usual, and a spectacular animated sequence that plays during the execution of the special move: one more element that makes you regret the lack of the old arcade mode in meetings, where all these elements could have find the necessary valuation. From a technical point of view, little has changed compared to Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2, which in turn showed no particular changes compared to the first episode of thethe series: the polygonal models of the characters are often too small to appreciate the details, but they have a good number of animations and move convincingly. The addition of new ninjas (in fact fifty is a respectable number) further enriches the product from a quantitative point of view, which for battles always offers scenarios up to the situation and divided into the classic two floors of depth. The sound is decent, and thankfully the voices can be heard in Japanese rather than the awful English dub.", "date": "2010-06-28", "grade": "7.0"}
