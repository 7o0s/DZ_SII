{"name": "Madden NFL 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-2008.html", "text": "Madden multiplied by 3 Three versions of Madden, one surprise; PS2 is the only one that supports online play. If in a comparison with the Nintendo machine it could have seemed obvious, considering the lack of a dedicated network (despite the presence of the 56k modem and broadband adapters for some time), it leaves one a bit taken aback if one looks at Xbox and the potential already tangible for some time, of its Live service. In any case, this is the scenario that is drawn also due to a sort of boycott (apparently temporary) by EA against Microsoft's online gaming. Xbox takes its small revenge on the pitch by offering the most detailed version of the three. Without digging sensational gaps but putting on the plate a greater cleanliness and brilliance of the textures, especially in the overall visions. The Game Cube, for its part, once again takes advantage of the GC > GBA connectivity thanks to which it is possible to unlock secret Teams (present only on GC), or without using the pocket version of Madden, the laptop can be used as a Handbook , within which to choose, set up and study schemes and strategies. My Deductible on the Pitch. Never as in recent years has the profundity of a sports title been taken into consideration as one of the factors that could have determined its success and perhaps, never as today, to truly delve into the heart of one of these productions is it necessary to unhinge what lies behind a term that has become familiar: ~Franchise~, or rather, the Franchise Mode. Through this mode, Madden 2004 unravels the entire NFL season, in which the player is totally immersed in team management, player exchanges and relative deadlines for what concerns the trade, creation of schemes and the very interesting implementation of the Training Camp. Under this last heading appears the chance to train and tangibly improve the elements of one's squad. Insisting on a specific player to refine specific characteristics provides a sort of ~experience points~ to be assigned and distributed in the various stats but, hooking us to the RPG-style quote just now, what transforms a complete and classic Franchise Mode into a sort of Game of Sporting Role is the Owner Mode. Terminology has never been more explanatory. The managerial perspectives that open up and that go alongside the match on the field are almost infinite. In the guise of Owner here, to make the destiny of an expensive but also profitable football team shine, you will find yourself with dozens of decisions to make, each of which is closely related and functional to the other. The economic management of a sports giant passes through the promotion of the team itself. Merchandising, the choice of ticket prices such as that of drinks sold in the stands and the parking fee around the stadium are all elements that you will be called upon to manage and which, erroneously, may appear futile and marginal. Anyone who has ever approached a manager worthy of this reputation can testify that these details are the foundations of success in the making. The ~sporting~ situation of the team affects the marketing one and vice versa. When the team dominates the League, it is possible to afford particularly expensive tickets and skyrocketing prices for the sale of gadgets, one can even literally impose one's own brand through a series of investments in image. Similarly, disappointing results will make your team a product with little appeal making the need to lower prices inevitable to bring the football people back to your stadium. The product that is born from the mix of the purely playable element (the match) and the Owner Mode (the managerial) puts on the plate one of the most profound and complete experiences on the square, full of that mania that has always been the cross and delight of fans of the type. Show 'em whatcha got! The Madden series has always stood out for having associated a great technical achievement with a gameplay of remarkable quality. This, to EA, must be acknowledged. With football and the FIFA series they haven't understood much yet, despite having had several times a little monster of cosmetics in their hands, but if it's something they know well like the NFL, here's that, really, there's none 'is for anyone. Madden 2004 returns with its usual exquisite (albeit difficult as Football itself) playability, mixing an excellent control system with the almost unsettling amount of tactics and schemesi applicable. Having at least a smattering of how a team moves on the field, it's easy to quickly fall in love with the control system. Beyond the fluidity that permeates everything, Playmaker management is truly at the highest levels. Through the use of both analog sticks you control the movements of the team and any corrections during the race. After a wrong throw, if you pass quickly from an attacking action to one in which it is necessary to defend, the right stick allows you to realign and direct your defense for the tackle. Similarly, an offensive move can be influenced by directing the receiver to occupy the right yard while waiting for the game-winning pass. The American Football show in Madden 2004 is once again painted with excellent craftsmanship. The television cut of the matches has nothing to envy to the ESPN footage (of which the SEGA series has acquired the rights) and shows its effectiveness and truthfulness in no uncertain terms. Madden is truly a jewel to be enjoyed moving between plays and real-time cut-scenes that blend beautifully in the gameplay between one action and another, yard after yard, towards the coveted Touch-Down. Beyond the accuracy given to the player models (which can be found in the edit mode where it is possible to create new ones and then add them to your roster), subtleties such as the players' uniforms that get muddy during the match or the turf itself shows the inevitable signs of the tackles and violent contacts he witnesses, they absorb into the context totally. Remaining on the technical subject but trusting the sound department, it is useless to underline that the commentary is really accurate and with a strict ~Broadcasting~ style cut while, as always, EA's decidedly stupid approach as regards the soundtrack is now a certainty of each sports series with their brand. Dozens and dozens of hits ranging from pop to rock to hip hop and R&B, a healthy ~minestrone~ of genres to captivate everyone and which, in the context of Sports USA, to say the least the truth, it does not clash at all. Comment Let's start by pointing out that Madden 2004 is, undoubtedly, a paradigm of its genre. A masterful achievement both from a technical and a tactical point of view. Rich and articulated game options such as the Franchise Mode supported by the introduction of the Owner Mode which opens up complex but rewarding managerial horizons like never before. An intuitive and ingenious at the same time control system makes it, without a doubt, the best edition to date and puts it on the throne over the competition. It remains to say that Madden is, however, a game for fans of American Football and not for casual players. Having Football as the only ~Creed~ and a vague idea of the arcane reasons why, in Tennis, the field is divided by a net, are not assumptions that could ever lead someone to really enjoy a game like this. Examination of conscience before buying is a duty towards your wallet. Madden 2004 is Football. Enclosed in a code and conveyed in a pad. A sort of nirvana for those who love this sport. Pros: Impeccable technical realization Managerial options such as the Owner Mode make it infinite Excellent implementation of the commands Cons: It's American Football, undoubtedly difficult for casual players The lack of Online in the Xbox and GC versions Who is John Madden? The man who since 1989 lends his name and face to the electronic incarnations of the sport most loved by the Americans and least understood and followed by Europeans is a real Star. As a coach, in the '70s, he victoriously led the Oakland Riders to the Super Bowl (which for the Yankees represents a mystical experience regardless of the teams competing for the title) and then turned into a real living icon when, abandoned the ~field~, became commentator and official voice of the NFL league on behalf of CBS. It is precisely on this little man with a reassuring face that EA has built one of its most important brands in the field of console sports games. We talk about American Football, the NFL, on every available platform, in its 2004 version.", "date": "2003-11-21", "grade": null}
