Despite the excellent success achieved by the bizarre social network centered on Mii avatars, it is quite clear that the ~real~ debut of the Kyoto house on iOS and (in a few months) on Android is this Super Mario Run. A game of a completely different thickness and of a different caliber, and not only because the greatest icon in the world of video games, synonymous with electronic entertainment, takes to the field. But also because Super Mario Run is not a simple porting of the classic gameplay of the thirty-year-old series, but an adaptation designed and built specifically around the characteristics of smartphones and their methods of use. An effort that demonstrates how Nintendo has chosen to focus on this new path with conviction, while always keeping its commitment to proprietary hardware intact. Super Mario Run is a game changer not only for Nintendo, but for the entire mobile gaming industry I run alone Super Mario Run is familiar, as a 2D Mario game should be: from an aesthetic point of view it has been chosen to use the style of New Super Mario Bros., therefore perhaps not the most successful ever but undoubtedly the most modern and current . Along the 24 levels divided into 6 worlds, a good part of the most famous settings of the series are proposed, for a graphic variety that stands at excellent levels. The high resolution of the smartphone screens then gives the locations an unprecedented definition, with a cleanliness and a level of detail that pleases the eye even if the quality turns out to be a bit inconstant between one level and another. However, the characterization is the most important aspect, and from this point of view in a Mario title there is very little to discuss. Returning to the gameplay, as we said at the beginning there are both points of contact and differences with respect to the classic formula of the 2D platformers of the series: although the feeling is extremely familiar and despite the basic mechanics are based on the refined and elegant alchemy that is typical of productions Nintendo, Super Mario Run is not a simple porting operation. First of all because the protagonist runs forward automatically, without the player being able to interrupt or manage the progression; likewise, Mario can autonomously jump over obstacles or weaker enemies. The intention of the Kyoto house has in fact always been to create a product that could be played by holding the smartphone with one hand, thus supporting the more frequent situation or simply more akin to mobile gaming and the way a device is used. this type. And for exactly the same reason, the levels turn out to be extremely short, intended to be completed in a matter of seconds. The level design is brilliant, but the platform element has been partially resized, made simpler and more linear: the goal is not simply to reach the end of the stage, but rather to try to collect as many coins as possible among those scattered generously everywhere. In addition to the classic and simple yellow coins, there are also a series of 5 colored tokens that open the doors to what is the main challenge factor of the product, as well as the key element for stimulating the replayability of the individual levels. In fact, in each of them, once the 5 pink coins have been collected, a second purple set is unlocked, which is more difficult to recover. And, as soon as this goal has been achieved, you can try your hand at finding the last set, this time black: an even more complex task because it is also accompanied by a new layout of the platforms, destined to put the nerves and patience of even the more skilled players. Yes, because the apparent casual and simplistic aspect of Super Mario Run instead reveals in the second line a much harder zest, which imposes - in case you want to unlock all the contents of the offer - the repetition of the same levels even for dozens and dozens of times, in an effort to memorize the arrangement of the colored coins and act with the necessary, often surgical precision to be able to reach the goal. Not being able to retrace one's steps, in fact, making a mistake in a jump or missing the tale of one of the tokens inevitably requires starting over or spending a ~bubble~, the equivalent of lives, to float backwards for a certain distance . It is a choice of gamand intelligent design, intriguing and consistent with the direction chosen by Nintendo for this spin-off of the series, and which is well suited to the characteristics and boundaries of mobile gaming. But it is also quite evident how the limits imposed make the gameplay less varied and satisfying than the classic one, with a less broad scope and an inevitable predisposition to repetitiveness and frustration. Coins, coins, coins The collection of coins is not an end in itself, but allows you to develop your Kingdom: initially bare and with only a small and modest castle, it can be expanded and developed to your liking by purchasing (precisely with coins) a whole series of buildings , flowers, statues, trees and various elements. However, many of these are not unlocked from the start, but become available after populating the Kingdom of its inhabitants, or colored Toads. These are achieved through Toad Challenges, which are levels you play against a time limit by racing against the ghost of another human user or friends. The goal is to travel as far as possible by collecting coins and performing somersaults, jumps and evolutions that may be to the liking of the Toads: once the seconds available have run out, in fact, whoever has impressed the most mushrooms will be the winner. Among the tastiest rewards to achieve by building your Kingdom is the possibility of obtaining other characters, in detail Luigi, Yoshi and Toadette, in addition to Toad (which is obtained by connecting your Nintendo ID) and Peach (which becomes available once the main adventure is over). Each of them can be chosen to face the levels, and the sensitive differences in their behavior and characteristics allow to guarantee an additional factor of interest to the game. Finally, the price factor: Super Mario Run is available for download for free, but what is accessed in this way is simply a demo made up of the first 3 levels, which may be sufficient to understand whether or not the gameplay formula can meet your own tastes. If so, you need to shell out 9.99 to unlock the full game. Our opinion is that this figure is correct and commensurate with the value of the product, although mobile users have long been accustomed to the idea of not paying anything to be able to play on their device. But the limits and problems raised by the freemium formula, by microtransactions and by the pay to win factor are well known, as is the bulimia of a large part of the audience who play on smartphones and who have by now gotten used to switching between apps to the other dedicating in most cases only a few minutes to each one. It is clear that the maturation of these platforms and their audience cannot pass through the belief that games don't have to be paid for, and for this very reason the success of Super Mario Run could represent an important moment not only for Nintendo, but for the entire mobile gaming industry.", "date": "2016-12-17", "grade": "8.2"}
