If not, you should do it right away, since Taito's title is an excellent example of how the shot'em up genre still has more than something to say even today. The author of this work is Reisuke Ishida, a name not particularly well known in the industry but in all likelihood destined to become increasingly popular given the talent of the Japanese game designer; confirming this prediction, his new effort arrives on the iOS platform, which moves away from the world of shooters to instead embrace that of rhythm games. Beat with almond eyes Like many other products of this type, Groove Coaster also rests on extremely simple and immediate mechanics, instantly understandable; in summary it is a question of observing one's avatar as it travels a ~rollercoaster~ line, dotted with colored circles or other graphic elements. The goal is to touch (or swipe) anywhere on the screen when the avatar passes over the aforementioned elements, which correspond quite logically to the beats of the background music. The accessibility of the gameplay is obviously not necessarily synonymous with an easy game, and in fact Groove Coaster is on the contrary a particularly demanding product, especially at higher difficulty levels; in this situation, in fact, the lines become both more populated, requiring greater attention and concentration, and more complex in their development, often hiding the avatar or in any case making the journey more unpredictable. All this within a super stylish graphic context even if not poor, minimal but captivating to say the least, exactly as happened with Space Invaders Infinity Gene; Groove Coaster is certainly not a title that puts the graphics processor of your iOS device on the rope, but with a decidedly superior charm to many other more ~muscular~ games. The Japanese origin of the product is evidently perceived, in a splendid audiovisual blend with the soundtrack which inevitably is a fundamental element of the experience. In this sense, the selection is closely linked to the Taito production, with some tracks taken from Space Invaders Extreme and Arkanoid DS; more generally, these are techno pop, acid jazz, electronic songs and so on, with almost always particularly high bpm and - we repeat - decidedly Japanese-style. It is clear that this aspect represents the watershed for making Groove Coaster appreciated or not, precisely on the basis of one's affinity with this kind of audio offer; the preference for more commercial or popular music inevitably limits the possibility of being overwhelmed by the quality of the product, which is indisputable in any case. Even the effort to give depth to the gameplay, with a growth system that goes hand in hand with the possibility of unlocking power ups and avatars with different characteristics, highlights the value of Reisuke Ishida's effort, which easily ranks among the best rhythm games available on iOS.
