With a clear change of strategy compared to the past, Microsoft has decided to release this second chapter at the same time on all the platforms provided, and it is for this reason that Apple users have found themselves in the showcase two titles launched at the same time (moreover available also in an interesting bundle that includes them both). Here, however, we will focus on the latest Halo Spartan Strike, while if you want some information on Halo: Spartan Assault, we refer you to our review of the PC version. Not Spartan at all Like its predecessor, Halo: Spartan Strike also falls into the category of so-called dual stick shooters, or those titles framed from a top view in which the player controls the character on the screen using the two analog sticks (virtual in the specific case of the mobile), one assigned to the movement and the other to the direction of the fire. Although it is undoubtedly an inflated genre, the developers have been quite good at infusing the product with enough personality to ensure that it does not get lost in the sea of similar offers, starting with a technical realization that can count on top-level production values . The bird's eye camera does not diminish the graphic quality of Halo: Spartan Strike, which showcases scenarios characterized by an excellent level of detail, defined textures and very generous light effects that make the title a little gem. The audio sector is equally impressive, consisting of orchestral music, sound effects and an English dubbing that would not have absolutely disfigured an episode of the main series on consoles. And it is precisely the close link between Halo: Spartan Strike and the source material that is one of the most significant aspects of Microsoft's production: the fact of working on a ~simple~ spin-off did not prevent the developers from inserting all the weapons, upgrades, vehicles and enemies characteristic of the saga, an added value destined to appear even more significant in the eyes of all those who have played at least one chapter of Halo. The epic look of the Master Chief's adventures is certainly missing, even considering that the plot plays a decidedly marginal role here, but the fact that the Spartan protagonist is engaged in parallel missions set in the same scenarios followed by the hero of the main series is already an incentive more than valid to live this mobile experience. Halo: Spartan Strike offers perfect gameplay for mobile while maintaining the identity of the series Although not a title designed exclusively to be enjoyed on smartphones and tablets, Halo: Spartan Strike proves to be at ease with the touch control system: we have already mentioned the function of the two virtual sticks, and the input picture is completed by a tap on the character to activate the special ability, a tap on any part of the display to perform a melee attack, a double tap to throw grenades and use the appropriate on-screen indicators to interact, collect objects, change weapons and so on. Everything works properly, guaranteeing the user more than enough precision to manage the most agitated shootings, but things go less well when you start driving the various vehicles, which tend to ~slip~ a little too much. Nothing that could seriously compromise the usability of a product that offers quality action during the 30 missions divided into five distinct chapters, all characterized by a duration perfectly in line with mobile gaming standards. If you wanted to nitpick, perhaps more could have been done as regards the variety of objectives, which most of the time are limited to some slight variation of the classic plot that involves reaching an area, eliminating all enemies and continue to the next one. Nothing to say instead about the intelligent management of the challenge level, which connects directly to the credit system inside the game: these are given at the end of each stage based on your performance, and can then be spent on subsequent missions to buy weapons or better upgrades that will only remain active for that specific level. Even old acquaintances of the series peep out, or the skulls that impose specific handicaps on the player, however rewarding him with a bonus percentage of credits: each user can dunque crop the playful experience on the basis of one's ability and interest in accumulating more or less points during a game.", "date": "2015-05-06", "grade": "8.5"}
