{"name": "Skullgirls: Mobile Encore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183836-skullgirls-mobile-encore.html", "text": "It is curious to see how the fighting game genre is slowly finding its dimension even on mobile devices. The first attempts to bring Street Fighter IV and The King of Fighters proved clumsy and unsuitable, limiting themselves to adopting uncomfortable digital keys on touch screens, with the result that most of the time you ended up pressing the wrong button or not pressing any. Sure, with a little practice you could pull off a Hadouken on your first go, but the experience has always been unnatural, slow, and lacking that immediacy and precision in input that is sorely demanded by the genre. Then came experiments such as Injustice and Marvel Contest of Champions, which abandoned digital buttons and crosses in favor of simple touches and gestures on the touch screen, trivializing the fights but certainly making them more accessible. Developed by Hidden Variable Studios, the mobile version of Skullgirls represents a further step forward, finding the right meeting point between the intuitiveness of the controls and the technicality of a competition fighting game. Showtime! There are many reasons why Skullgirls has managed to find a following among fans of 2D fighting games. The roster of fighters was basic but also stylish, eccentric and full of personality. Peacock, for example, is a biomechanical weapon that smokes cigars in industrial quantities and that seems to have come out of an American cartoon from the 1930s. Big Band has the appearance of a big detective from whose raincoat giant saxophones, trumpets and other instruments come out musical. Ms. Fortune would be a normal girl with feline features, except that she can take off her head and throw it like a projectile. The jazz music and the graphic style that coherently mixes inspirations taken from western anime, comics and cartoons of different eras have made it a recognizable game. By recycling much of the assets and animations from the original version, Skullgirls for mobile devices manages to be equally enjoyable. Above all, however, the game retains the philosophy of the old Skullgirls to bring newbies to the world of fighting games. On PC and consoles he did it through a full-bodied interactive tutorial, a guide that effectively introduced the basics and vocabulary of the genre (and which has not yet been equaled by any of the most famous fighting games). On mobile, however, Skullgirls uses an immediate control system stitched around the touch screen of smartphones and tablets. One tap for normal attack and one long tap for strong attack, two fingers on the screen for blocking and one swipe up for grappling. There is no risk of making a mistake in the input, and these few actions would already be enough for a very basic fight in the style of Challenge of Champions. Unlike the Marvel fighting game, however, Skullgirls allows you to perform a large number of additional moves that make it more articulate and technical. You can dash forward or backward with a finger swipe on the Touch Screen, perform a swipe with a downward swipe, or even chain a series of punches, launch the opponent in the air, continue the combo while in the air, and then end it with a special attack. Obviously it remains a very simplified version of the original game: for example, the possibility of jumping or inverting the position with the opponent is missing, there are only two attacks instead of six, and consequently it is not even possible to perform crossups or simple mixups of high and bass. Yet, despite this, the game works, proving to be fun and intuitive for both novices and those who devour many fighting games. It's really a shame that such a solid and intuitive system finds itself shackled by such aggressive freemium elements. The roster of fighters is not accessible from the start as it was in the original Skullgirls, and each individual fighter must be unlocked through the ~gacha~ formula that is so popular in free to play games: you play, accumulate credits and get the chance to unlock a random character. It wouldn't be a big deal, except that the developers have decided to overdo it. There are different versions of each fighter (some rarer and stronger than others), while a skill tree allows you to unlock new slots for special moves, decrease the cooldown of certain techniques, increase available health and so on. Even the special attacks are not accessible from the beginning but must be ~unwrapped~ randomly in the same way as the characters. This means that a Painwheel fan may never see his favorite character, and even if he is lucky enough to find him, he will be forced to play disproportionately before unlocking all his abilities.ity and upgrades. Provided you don't want to pay with real money, of course. Even the Story mode, with its unbalanced matches and sudden difficulty peaks, seems to have been designed to push you to improve the statistics of your fighters, while instead of the classic Versus between multiple players there is a much less interesting asynchronous multiplayer (in which face each other's characters but controlled by artificial intelligence).", "date": "2017-05-31", "grade": "7.8"}
