Certainly thanks to an idea as simple as it is well done, the trendy ~cubed~ graphic style and the many characters to unlock, one funnier than the other. A real progression system, that of the skins, which was set in a context in which progression is missing by definition, being an endless game. The creators of the game, Hipster Whale, managed to earn an astonishing ten million dollars in just the first three months, they made a name for themselves in the mobile gaming arena and now here they are, busy reshaping their creation using no less that a Disney license. Indeed, it was Disney who commissioned him to do the job! The formula of Disney Crossy Road is always the same, mind you: in command of a character, our goal is to get as far as possible in an isometric context, avoiding the obstacles and dangers that characterize the route. Thus we go from crossing busy roads and tracks, on which very fast trains run, to jumping on trunks that move along the course of a river, possibly dodging rolling rocks that proceed vertically; all using a particularly simple and intuitive touch control system, which allows you to proceed forward with a simple touch, taking one ~step~ at a time, but also to move in other directions via slides, so as to overcome blocks or other. To make the experience frenetic there is a very short time limit, at the end of which we will be grabbed by an eagle and it will be game over. Disney Crossy Road takes up the formula of the Hipster Whale blockbuster, but with Disney characters Lots of stuff As mentioned at the beginning, to make the experience of the original Crossy Road irresistible there were the many characters, one funnier than the other, to be unlocked using the coins earned during the games to activate a slot and receive a surprise skin ; or by purchasing packs of coins using real money, which is never mandatory for the purposes of progression and fun. The same concept is repeated in Disney Crossy Road, but with a significant difference: instead of original characters (albeit present in small quantities), we will be able to take on the role of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and all the other classic protagonists of Disney stories , but also draw on the huge roster of feature films. From the new Zootropolis to Toy Story, from Haunted Mansion to The Lion King, from Rapunzel to Big Hero 6, through Inside Out and Wreck-It Ralph, changing the ~franchise~ will not only imply the control of a different character, but also the appearance of scenarios and music inspired by the related cartoon. It goes without saying that for a fan of the Mickey Mouse house it is an extra of absolute value, and considering the popularity of certain brands it is really difficult not to know such famous protagonists, places and melodies. Beyond a well-tested structure made more varied here, and even cleaner, more colorful and stylish graphics, the truly surprising thing about Disney Crossy Road is its ability to involve even those who have spent hours with the original episode : yet another demonstration of how Hipster Whale's product has really hit the target, establishing itself as the reference impromptu entertainment on mobile devices.
