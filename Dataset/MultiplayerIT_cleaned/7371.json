Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. When we reviewed Eternity Warriors 2, exactly one year ago, we wondered if the balance of difficulty that characterized the Glu-branded action RPG was the result of a hardcore approach or simply a freemium trick, concluding that the truth lay somewhere in the middle and rewarding the game for its undoubted qualities. Now it's the turn of the third episode, published on the App Store a little earlier than Google Play (but the Android version will arrive soon, don't worry), and we find ourselves evaluating a now mature franchise, capable of standing on solid legs and to even get rid of some whim compared to those dynamics that have always been associated with free to play productions. Let's face the question immediately, therefore, by saying that Eternity Warriors 3 can be played easily without paying. Of course, using real money in this case allows you to get certain things more quickly, whether it's equipment or upgrades, and therefore to avoid a grinding phase that proves necessary already after a handful of missions, when dealing with the first boss. However, precisely, with a little effort and perseverance, and perhaps watching some short advertising videos to raise gems (hard currency), it is possible to get to the bottom of the experience without hitting a wall of financial obligations. That said, the improvements made to the structure and gameplay compared to what we saw in Eternity Warriors 2 are immediately evident. The developers have in fact inserted three different characters (warrior, monk and sorceress, the latter unlockable only after completing a certain area), each with its own style and skills, which we can grow in parallel without any constraints, passing from one class to another. other via the options menu. The same is true for each of the characters: we have to face a series of missions, collect everything we find along the way and manage a very well-organized inventory in this way, which makes us immediately understand which objects must be worn and which, instead, resold or employed in a fusion process that serves to enhance our setup. A solution very similar to that seen in various strategic based on trading cards, but which includes the further substrate of a more traditional crafting system, to be carried out thanks to the discovery of certain elements. Eternity Warriors 3 undoubtedly stands as one of the best action RPG available in the mobile field Eternal blows Beyond the three characters, effectively different from each other and therefore heralds of a multifaceted experience, the strength of Eternity Warriors 3 remains the God of War-style combat system, very ~substantial~, full of personality and capable of returning an excellent sensation of impact, underlined by short and skilful ~bullet times~ that make the power of each shot very well. The system is so solid that you don't even need a lock-on system on your opponents, as it very rarely happens to attack the wrong target. Also thanks to precise and reliable touch controls, in this case a virtual analog stick that automatically repositions itself every time we touch the screen with the left thumb, accompanied by buttons on the right side of the display which boast more generous dimensions than in the past (the parry, above all) and a more natural and comfortable disposition. All elements that make the aforementioned grinding much sweeter, i.e. the need to repeat the same missions a certain number of times to collect new objects to ~melt~, level up and thus obtain a stronger warrior, who is capable of facing round bosses without falling after a couple of hits. To this must be added a technical sector of excellence, with absolutely fluid graphics (even on non-latest generation devices, apparently), very detailed, well animated and enriched by valuable light effects. To make a comparison with Dungeon Hunter 4, we can say that the scenarios of Eternity Warriors 3 are less evocative and also less extensive, but in terms of effects, animations and frame rates, the Glu product seemed superior to us. The only things that didn't convince us are the lack of online multiplayer, which is ~advertised~ in an improper way (there are somesocial elements, guilds and tournaments, but no direct clashes or cooperative sessions), and background music that is not always up to the situation.", "date": "2014-01-04", "grade": "8.6"}
