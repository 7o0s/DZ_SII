Thus, Warriors Orochi 3 also ended up on the porting bandwagon that from the past generation landed on Wii U, the excellent chapter of the hack'n'slash brand that Koei has decided to re-propose in this Hyper edition, enriched in content and adapted to take advantage of a minimum of the functions made available by the GamePad. Although the game remains the best chapter of the regrettable Orochi sub-series, the one for Wii U is an edition that doesn't do it justice at all, with technical problems and design disengagements probably the result of hasty development, aimed precisely at placing the console alongside the his debut. We proceed step by step. Bigger, slower Set several years after the events narrated in Warriors Orochi 2, the plot has not changed one iota compared to the original version for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3: after the defeat of Orochi the kingdom is once again in trouble, and this time due to the appearance of a gigantic hydra that causes earthquakes and devastates entire villages. As if a huge eight-headed dragon weren't already a big fish to fry, he is joined by the return of Kiyomori and his army. The trio of warriors under the command of the player soon realize they are too weak to eliminate the hydra, and thanks to Kaguya's powers they will go back in time to save all the allies who died in previous battles and muster an army large enough to defeat the hydra. immense creature. These are the premises of an action game very faithful to the musou genre, extremely familiar to those who have a minimum of familiarity with the mechanics and rhythms of the various Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors. It is no coincidence that we are still talking about a cross-over between the two series just mentioned, with many gameplay ideas that have been forcefully taken up by Dynasty Warriors 7, both during the battle and in the intermediate moments, when it is possible to interact with characters who are not players in the villages and customize the equipment of their heroes from the armorer on duty. However, the beating heart of the experience remains the combat system based on teams of three characters, with the possibility of switching from one to the other at any time by pressing a button: the interaction between party members extends clearly to rescue actions and special techniques, while the possibility of including exceptional unlockables such as Ryo Hayabusa, Ayane and Joan of Arc in your group is pure fan service. But how does all this GamePad in hand translate? Unfortunately, the development team has not made the slightest effort to adapt the experience in an original way to the particular controller of Wii U, whose screen is limited to simply streaming what is already happening on the TV. If this can be useful in case of busy TV or urgent runs to the bathroom, it leaves quite disappointed to see that one of the launch titles of the Nintendo console doesn't even bother to use the GamePad as a map, limiting itself to re-proposing the same and identical single-player experience already appreciated months ago on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Fortunately, things improve in terms of multiplayer modes, with the controller screen usable by a second user in cooperative mode, not to mention the new Duel Mode, probably the most appreciable addition in terms of content. As can be guessed from the name, it is a mode inspired by the classic fighting games, in which each player creates his own trio of warriors and battles it out in order to eliminate the opposing group; to make this new component even more interesting is a system of cards to unlock and points to accumulate, intertwining with the story mode to obtain new characters and new cards. However, where Hyper tumbles sensationally is in its technical realization, decidedly not up to the original chapter. It will be for streaming on two screens, it will be for a bad optimization job, the fact is that the port is much cruder and dirtier than the Xbox 360 and PS3 counterpart, with flashy aliasing, bad shadows and an annoying pop effect -in of distant units. All this without taking into account a more unstable and slower framerate when there are large troops on screen, which, needless to say to those familiar with the Warriors franchise, happens with enormous frequency.", "date": "2012-11-28", "grade": "6.0"}
