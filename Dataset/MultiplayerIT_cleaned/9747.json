It is no coincidence that one of the most impressive features of Evochron Mercenary, or the possibility of wandering the universe and exploring any celestial body without any loading, was already available in the title developed by Braben and Bell 26 years ago, albeit with some limitations due to memory limits. But new elements brought by different titles have been added to the Elite formula, obviously including the two predecessors of the subject of this review, which in past years have kept alive the feeble flame of space free roaming. The most relevant elements of this evolution are the quests, the possibility of drilling for raw materials and that of juggling by piloting your spaceship in space circuits. And these are the basic elements of Evochron in which there is no real context that forces us to choose one mission over another, but a huge galaxy full of possibilities where the historical events that form the background need not necessarily concern us. But if this choice favors the feeling of being a speck lost in the universe, and allows the sole developer to concentrate on the game structure, at the same time it deprives the universe of a narrative thickness that is often fundamental to giving the player an objective to pursue with passion. To infinity and beyond To contextualize our role in the universe, however, there are some factions that allow us to play a role and decide who to favor with our missions and who to make enemies on the path to success. And it is a rather arduous path that passes through routine missions, such as the creation of space routes that requires the simple destruction of asteroids, but which sometimes puts us to the test as happens during escort services to attractive spaceships for criminals or opposing factions. Furthermore, there is a market for goods to be exploited to increase our resources, a crew to manage and we can improve the performance of our ship by purchasing new components that allow us to customize and enhance every detail. Of course, the complexity of the market and micromanagement is not even remotely comparable to that of X3 but the variety of options of Evochron Mercenary is beyond question and beyond question is also the quality of the flight model which is based on Newtonian mechanics. Raw and raw physics therefore that we can use to perform extreme maneuvers using for example the inertia to perform space spins and hit an enemy who until a moment before was a pursuer. And predictably we also have afterburners available that allow us to exponentially increase the speed to chase an opponent or to escape his lasers while releasing all the available countermeasures. Furthermore, our ship has vertical engines that allow further escape maneuvers but are also essential to move us with greater precision during peaceful missions such as drilling for asteroids, placing satellites or exploring wrecks. But the inertial system is not very comfortable outside of combat and to overcome this inconvenience our ship has an ISD system which, when activated, uses the auxiliary engines to automatically correct the inertial drift and make driving easier and intuitive. Obviously, the ISD takes advantage of the ship's secondary engines, consuming more fuel than standard navigation and reducing autonomy, which is essential for being able to move freely in space without having to refuel at each station. Obviously for longer journeys we have the classic hyperspace jumps available but the initial version of the hyperdrive, which we will be able to change thanks to our earnings, is not very powerful and is insufficient even just to allow us to jump from one planet to another. To complete the offer of Evochron Mercenary we find four classes to specialize in as many tasks, giving us an initial direction towards which to direct our efforts. On the other hand, as anticipated, the tasks to be performed are not limited to commercial and combative activities but also include espionage and corruption missions and we are even given the possibility of building space stations. In Italian too... ...as rightly pointed out to us in the comments, it has been pointed out to us that a translation of the game in Italian is available, created by a group of willing users. We leave you at the link to find it, one more reason to experience this interestingand indie title. The Ugly Duckling The first thing that catches the eye of Evochron Mercenary is the low definition of the image that doesn't change even when setting extreme resolutions. Obviously this is a ploy aimed at hiding the flaws of a very poor graphics engine, but we are faced with a very complex, playable and full of possibilities title that was developed by a single person. A single developer who has created an engine that allows you to travel to entire galactic quadrants and to penetrate through the atmosphere of the planets without any loading. And although the quality of the peaks and vegetation is certainly not high, the planets are enriched by valid environmental effects and by suggestive stretches of water which balance, albeit relatively, the obvious aesthetic flaws. In addition, the game engine also calculates the atmospheric friction that can damage the ship at high speeds and it is inadvisable to launch a hyperspace jump when subject to the gravity of a celestial body unless you have suicidal thoughts. From an aesthetic point of view, colors and shapes are vaguely reminiscent of Wing Commander and that's not a bad thing even if unfortunately the terrain and structures are not much higher than those used in the now ancient title Origin. Fortunately, as we have already mentioned, the title adopts the same trick used in Chris Robers' titles that smoothed out the defects by graining the image, but it is impossible to improve lasers, countermeasures and missiles which are made in an amateur way and are more reminiscent of a demo of three-dimensional prime movers rather than a full title. If nothing else, planets, asteroids, stars, black holes and nebulae, when we observe them from the darkness of space, strike us with intense colors and vivid textures and the final result is an evocative panorama that is enhanced by decidedly spot-on and engaging spatial symphonies. The audio effects, on the other hand, are more spartan, both in terms of quantity and quality, but the female voice of the on-board computer takes care of recovering the sci-fi pathos which warns us of everything that happens around us, including altitude emergencies. And it's also worth mentioning the spaceship's HUD which is equipped with all sorts of markers or information windows and is beautifully designed, and coloured. In short, despite the modest engine and the investments of a single person, the final effect, although certainly not oriented towards high definition, is certainly capable of involving science fiction enthusiasts, provided obviously that they turn a blind eye to the poverty of detail. Furthermore, we cannot fail to underline the presence of a multiplayer for 35 players which allows you to engage pilots in the flesh in fights, speed races, clan wars and even in challenges to capture the flag. But the most relevant multiplayer element is the cooperative mode which allows 35 players to play freely on the same server by trading and collaborating to tackle the most difficult missions. Missions that become even more complex and fun thanks to the possibility of using the voice chat that is included in the title code.", "date": "2010-10-11", "grade": "8.0"}
