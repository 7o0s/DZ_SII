{"name": "La banalit del mare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/150738-la-banalita-del-mare.html", "text": "Windward's idea is extremely interesting: Four factions, each with characteristics that reward a more or less aggressive approach, exploration, naval combat, diplomacy and pirates, an environment created in a procedural way and a precise intent: to revive the glories of Sid Meiers's Pirates! Undoubtedly important premises for an indie title on Steam, which however run aground on the shallows of a game that is decidedly more modest than expected. Adventures, naval battles and intricate diplomacy are the premises of Windward. It's a pity that... We write our story Windward is presented as a game in which everyone can decide to write their own story and live the adventures they prefer, a naval trade simulator set in a tangle of tropical islands in which to make trade agreements and exchange cannon shots with rivals and the occasional pirate. You start with a small ship, armed with the bare minimum to defend yourself during the initial clashes and gradually, quest after quest you can unlock ever more impressive vessels, with a greater load capacity and cannons capable of besieging even a city. Steering our ship in Windward is very easy: you use the arrows to control the rudder and a key to adjust the sails to three different speeds, a bit like in Assassin's Creed. In theory the wind should be a variable to consider, because if it blows in the right direction you will go faster, but in any case you will go ahead without major problems. The main advantage of Windward is undoubtedly its simplicity: in less than a couple of hours of play we have been able to create a trade network capable of making us buy a bigger ship, we have hired some pirate ships in rapid and brutal naval battles, besieged a port, built our own outpost and explored almost every corner of the map. An advantage that however also turns out to be the main defect of this title, because having done all this, there is not so much left to do other than repeating this procedure endlessly. Simplicity therefore makes it interesting, but it is also the anchor that prevents it from being little more than a pastime. The problem is that the most superficial part is the one that in theory should be the most intriguing: the one dedicated to trade and diplomacy. The sea of boredom The only fast and sensible way to get the money needed to increase its influence on the seas is to exploit the trade routes and the supply and demand system of the various ports. All this makes a lot of sense, a pity that to do so it is enough to approach the city with the ship, sell what the inhabitants need, buy any surpluses and take them to another inhabited center that requests them. Full stop, the process never gets more complex than that, nor more dangerous. The only variable is that at the beginning we have such a small hold that we can only carry two units of goods, so the initial part of the game is a bit like being a postman being able to carry only one package at a time in a world that has so many mail to dispose of: it takes a long time and is quite tedious. As if that weren't enough, the quest system on which the game's diplomacy is based often involves bringing someone from point A to point B, a pity that to do so we are forced to sacrifice a load slot. In theory this should encourage us to optimize routes in order to bring people and things to the same place, in practice it is an invitation not to carry out this type of assignment and to overlook the possibility of developing diplomatic relations. They just don't pay as well as freight. So, even if there is a very weak system of quests, all very similar, Windward mercilessly falls into the ugliest of defects: the pure hard grind. Furthermore, considering that there is an entire faction dedicated to trade (and one to diplomacy) in the game, the economic system of the game seems decidedly too simple for what were probably the premises of the developers. Another aspect that could have been better taken care of is exploration. Is it possible that in a game set in one of the richest historical periods of geographical discoveries, in which cartographers were drawing unknown lands for the first time and captains were looking for new trade routes at the expense of their own lives, all that we are faced with is a series of islets very similar to each other that do not give any desire to proceed? Also in this case a faction becomes useless, given that it is the one most dedicated to the discovery of new lands to colonize and therefore represents one of the less developed sides of the game. Pirates! Just too many! Fortunately, occasionally there will be some fighting to break the monotony ofour life as shipboys, a pity that this only serves to plunge us into a different kind of monotony. As straightforward as the game may be, it will take at least an hour and a half before naval battles are anything more than just sailing in circles, auto-firing and clicking every now and then for the special shot. This system is fine for the first part of the game, when at most we will find ourselves against an opponent, but when we expand our sphere of influence in the second section of the map things will become much more complex. Until we manage to reinforce our ship we can only hope that the artificial intelligence does not send more ships against us than we can handle alone and we will never know if this opportunity can happen or not. This brings us to another aspect of the game that has been rendered with oversimplification (and a certain degree of sadism). Regardless of whether we like to explore, trade or do quests, after the first map we will have to spend most of our time cleaning it up from pirates, otherwise trade will be totally blocked. And don't think that's the end of it, because once the pirates are killed they will continue to sprout like weeds and the ports will take back if we don't constantly watch over the seas, without Windward offering us the slightest help or tool to defend the areas secure. Even if you don't like the fight, it will therefore be the only constant you will have to constantly and necessarily deal with, also because the other factions managed by artificial intelligence are world champions of ~stand still while the pirates smash everything~.", "date": "2015-06-01", "grade": "6.5"}
