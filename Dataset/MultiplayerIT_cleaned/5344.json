It's no longer a magnificent digital expression of Gibson's cyberpunk, and Blade Runner's dark, neon-broken aesthetic appears between his maps like a sudden change of tune. With Mankind Divided the ultra-modernity of the legendary first chapter and its sequel has moved away, to be partially replaced by a very strong connection with our everyday reality. A reality which, taken to excess, is no less dark than that of Ridley Scott's magnificent feature film. Except that our problem isn't the replicants: it's degradation, the dullness typical of the human being and, stronger than ever in recent times, racism; all themes that Eidos Montreal has decided to exploit for the construction of a powerful universe. Certainly not an easy task for the Canadian company, yet Mankind Divided, the sequel to the highly appreciated Human Revolution, has always given the idea of being able to support such a weight, both for the solid foundations laid by its direct predecessor and for the obvious care placed by the software house in the creation of a granite and inspired narrative background. Now that it's in the pipeline we've had a chance to play it properly, and our experience with the game is thankfully one that leaves a smug grin on one's face. But be careful, we are neither facing a return to total freedom and the orderly chaos of the first title, nor an incredible last firework. Mankind Divided is in fact a new beginning for the series, a bridge chapter from which the Deus Ex Universe wants to restart strongly. Deus Ex is a name that inspires awe in players: will Mankind Divided have respected it? Steel colored leather Human Revolution was a prequel with a well thought out storyline and a strong ending that we have no intention of anticipating here. To continue from there, therefore, Eidos Montreal had to make some appropriate changes to the closure, in order to reinsert Adam Jensen into society in the form of an enhanced super agent in the service of Interpol's Task Force 29. After a 12-minute (skipable) cutscene that broadly explains everything that happened in the previous title, you take control of Adam during a counter-terrorism operation in Dubai, complete with an undercover agent to rescue. It is a fairly linear section, designed to familiarize players with the commands and get them used to the possibility of dealing with situations with alternative approaches, but from there an extremely ramified plot begins, full of characters and moral choices on a scale of gray far from easy. The elation dies down a bit when, in the final stage, one realizes that one has a well-crafted overture on one's hands with many questions left unanswered, yet Mankind Divided still manages to completely capture with its colorful characters and exceptional setting . To enrich the whole we think the very heavy themes that form the background to the events of Jensen and his companions: we find ourselves in a world where the augmented are now outcasts - far from the glossy science fiction utopia of Human Revolution - due to a terrible accident that temporarily made violent all humans with bionic limbs, causing millions of deaths and injuries, and giving birth to cruel racial segregation. As enhanced, therefore, Adam has to deal constantly with the police, with the scowls of the ~normal~ and with the gratuitous injustices to which those like him are subjected. We are in a situation in which technology has completely escaped the hands of human beings, pouring rivers of hate, fear and ignorance into the streets that have now infected even public institutions. A type of narrative base that few dare to face in current gaming (and somewhat ~uncomfortable~, given the parallels with today's global situation). Cyber ninja, cyber warrior, cyber everything In terms of gameplay, the changes are perhaps not as immediately perceptible as the tonal change of the narrative, but they are equally substantial. After all, the basis is always that of Human Revolution - with a discreet emphasis on exploration, stealth mechanics, acute observation of the maps and variety of approaches available - the number of options and the finesse of the same have however increased significantly, thanks to the introduction of new very useful Adam power-ups, greater environmental interactivity and a renewed dialogue system that allows you to overcome most situations only with your own charisma. The new power-ups, however, are not even abusable, since they send Adam into ~overclocking~, forcing the player (at least forr much of the campaign) to disable one of the other options to be used. This solution forces the player to specialize the protagonist towards a precise path, which can be hacking and stealth as much as pure violence, with an eye towards the first choice. And this does not derive so much from forced ~blocks~ by the system, which allows Adam to become a killing machine without too many problems (between remote nanoblades, a recallable reinforced armor and modifiable weapons it doesn't take much to make massacres) but from a mixture of woodiness of the combat system and environmental narrative. In fact, focusing on hacking and dialogue allows you to reveal nuances of the story that are unattainable with simple brute force, while the shooting remains woody, with a marked magnetism when aiming and poor fluidity in Adam's maneuvers. Not that there is a need to be frightened by these problems, since the gameplay of Deus Ex still allows you to enjoy the clashes thanks to its considerable flexibility... Vector choices Even in combat, in fact, between environmental interactivity, complex maps and powers linked to upgrades, it is possible to indulge, not to mention a curious system linked to enemy resistances which is linked to the type of ammunition used. The guns can in fact fire EMP ammunition against drones, guards equipped with enhanced exoskeletons and combat robots, which temporarily disable them making an execution easier, or piercing bullets that devastate armored opponents in seconds. At the same time there is no shortage of mines and grenades with various effects, elements of the explosive map or which, if destroyed, release electric shocks, or simple defensive mechanisms that can be hacked in one's favor. The impossibility of abusing Adam's abilities, moreover - since they require energy that never fully regenerates after use - makes firefights rather tactical and forces you to measure out the protagonist's resources to get the upper hand (especially if did not spend points on lethal and defensive skills). Stealth, on the other hand, enjoys a cover system that uses visible vectors to indicate Jensen's movements, which can greatly facilitate the navigation of maps full of guards. Enhanced eyesight, stun bolts and the ability to mark enemies do the rest. Returning then to hacking and conversations, both enjoy new mechanics: the first presents a minigame similar to the one seen in Human Revolution, but offers extra facilities against enemy firewalls and data connections at obscured vaults in which it is mandatory to grope; dialogues, on the other hand, can be gutted with a bionic graft, which analyzes the behavior of the interlocutors and indicates their character tendencies with short flashes, in order to facilitate the choice of sentences to say. As we have already specified, the possibility of overcoming almost any situation even in a non-violent way is a considerable strength for Mankind Divided, and the almost total absence of bosses (the lowest point of Human Revolution, until they have been modified) further underlines the willingness of the developers to strengthen the campaign missions, without the need for ~wow!~ forced. I see JC The gameplay also benefits greatly from a new direction, which brings the title closer to its glorious past. Where Human Revolution was heavily penalized by a more linear and ~contained~ structure than the first Deus Ex, while maintaining a fair amount of freedom of choice, Mankind Divided enjoys greater complexity and a system that is easier to break and circumvent. These last two characteristics could be perceived as negative, but in reality the randomness of the factors involved and the ability to remain stable despite the unpredictability of the player's actions were enormous strengths of the ancestor, which are proposed here at least in part. Of course, you won't have total carte blanche with non-player characters and quests, but between the physics engine that can be used in creative ways and various obstacles that can be avoided with the help of the imagination (for example, we completed a quest where the goal was to kidnap a shady figure throwing it over a series of walls like a human ball, instead of following the most sensible path), there are moments in which the memories of JC Denton and his raids come back with a rare force. Wanting to find faults (in addition to the woodiness of the shootings described above) we were a little dissatisfied with the artificial intelligence. The paths of the opponents are quite complex, especially when it comes to enhanced enemies, however their movements are limited - to the point of allowing certain situations to be avoidedtions of alarm simply with the closing of a door - and it can happen to see them act in senseless ways. However, the presence of numerous guards, security systems and passages hidden in the maps in an often cunning way makes almost every infiltration exhilarating, despite the hiccups of the CPU. Even the longevity of the title does not disappoint, reaching around twenty hours for those who love to explore and face clashes with strategy and intelligence. Into the Breach However, in case you believe that, for a hybrid RPG like this, it is too short a duration, you will be happy to know of the existence in Mankind Divided of interesting extra content in the form of the Breach mode: an absolute novelty for the saga, which reshapes the gameplay around an almost puzzle-like structure. Breach puts you in the role of a hacker busy breaking into the systems of the Palisade, who can act in the virtual world in a similar way to Adam in the real world, but with some extra powers (including a handy double jump). The Firewalls and the various defenses of the Palisade will therefore put you in front of various levels full of enemies and obstacles, much more limited and linear than the campaign maps, but able to further enhance the mechanics of the Eidos title. Weapons, consumables and various goodies are obtained thanks to the equipment cards, accompanied by a development of the statistics that will make your life much easier during the missions, by virtue of the absence of regeneration of life points and the danger of certain enemies. Furthermore, once the data has been collected - a necessary condition for completing the available paintings - you will have to return to the entrance within a certain time limit, a gimmick that also forces you to study a rapid return route before interacting with all the columns of a location. Breach is therefore not a revolutionary gimmick, and it is also the mode that carries the weight of microtransactions in Deus Ex Mankind Divided, but it is a pleasant extra that could attract more than one player despite its inglorious role. Plausibly, the presence of leaderboards and the opportunity to send challenges to other players on the various missions will be the elements capable of creating a community around this mode with an interesting minimal aesthetic. Admire shots of Prague Where Breach offers an extremely clean visual impact, which at times recalls the fusion of white plastic and gold of the buildings of its predecessor, Mankind Divided makes a sharp turn from an artistic point of view with the city of Prague, where Adam spends most of the adventure . Prague is a mirror of the geopolitical situation of Mankind Divided: a splendid European capital divided between futuristic structures and historic buildings, where the decline of the augmented has hit harder than elsewhere and in the streets you can smell a state of control almost from a military regime. The policemen, for example, are a cumbersome and suffocating presence on the streets, and do not hesitate to mistreat passers-by with mechanical limbs for futile reasons. Adam himself is constantly blocked outside subway stops for various document checks, a clever (albeit annoying) expedient to facilitate the rendering of city neighborhoods and at the same time increase the player's feeling of anguish and inadequacy. In short, the city in which we move is as much a nightmare for those who populate it as a beauty to observe, due to areas clearly inspired by various European cities and a sharp increase in the polygonal mass of buildings and NPCs. These improvements didn't come without a hitch though, as the PlayStation 4 version we tested proved to struggle outdoors several times, with significant frame-rate drops even after a patch was applied. The improvements clearly won't stop at the version we tested, however long uploads and some bugs related to the ragdoll and physics (which are unlikely to be fixed at launch) made us shake our heads with a certain annoyance at times. In any case, it is not even remotely enough to ruin an experience of rare depth, which has what it takes to restore prestige to the Deus Ex name.", "date": "2016-08-19", "grade": "9.0"}
