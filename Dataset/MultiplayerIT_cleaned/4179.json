{"name": "NieR: Automata", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nier-automata-recensione-xbox-one-201743.html", "text": "We have repeatedly praised Yoko Taro on these pages, even more after the great success of her NieR: Automata on PlayStation 4. A game that we have defined as ~epochal~ not only for its extremely high quality or for its structural follies and narrative, with a story with darker tones than its predecessor, but also because in our opinion it could represent an important starting point for the author towards the global market. Waiting to see these expectations materialised, perhaps with a third chapter of the series, the game finally arrives on Xbox One and Xbox One X in a version entitled NieR: Automata - Become as Gods Edition which already includes the downloadable content 3C3C1D119440927 reviewed by Multiplayer .it in 2017, with the ~See-through~ suit for 2B, the ~Boy suit~ for 9S and the ~Destroyer suit~ for A2, plus other little goodies and support for 4K resolution and HDR on Xbox One X. A great adventure and fantastic characters Otherwise NieR: Automata - Become as Gods Edition on Xbox One maintains every other aspect of the PlayStation 4 edition we reviewed last year unchanged, including story and gameplay. The title, for those who don't know it, tells of a now abandoned planet Earth, with the last humans who have taken refuge on the Moon where they are engaged in an endless war with humanoid machines that have invaded its surface. To adequately deal with the ~biomachines~, the Resistance has prepared a mighty android infantry called YoRHa, which fights these mechanical creatures probably built by an alien civilization. In this context, the player takes on the role of the android Yorha 2B, in a long and enthralling adventure full of surprises and things to do, characterized by a story with dark and adult tones, but seasoned a bit by the humor of Taro, where the dialogues with the non-player characters, the moral choices and the secondary missions have their weight in masterfully ~telling~ all the facets of the plot. The narrative is also atypical in some ways, given that the game must be completed three times in order to fully understand and appreciate its story: from this point of view, each beginning seems like a real act of a single adventure, rather than the classic ~New Game +~, since it is experienced from the point of view of other characters and presents often new situations and side missions. In any case, returning to the game itself and going into detail, NieR: Automata - Become as Gods Edition is a title that alternates exploratory phases within large maps to be visited on foot or riding animals (complete with towns where interact with non-player characters to get useful information on the story or unlock new side missions, buy and upgrade weapons, and so on) to others with rather varied mechanics even within the same game session. The Platinum Games title is in fact an action JRPG that offers sudden changes of perspective that allow it to seamlessly insert 2D fighting game-style combat missions, platform phases and ~danmaku~ phases, that is to say moments similar to certain shooters scrolling that offer a huge amount of projectiles on the screen. Xbox One goals There are 48, of which 31 secrets, the unlockable Achievements of NieR: Automata - Become as Gods Edition, for a total of 1,000G. To get them you have to progress in the adventure, for example by upgrading all the Pods to the maximum, collecting a certain number of chips or defeating 255 enemies, and so on. A spectacular combat system and gameplay The combat system of Nier Automata in this sense is fluid, fast and adrenaline-pumping, with sudden changes of shot and variable, but not complex combinations, linked to the way in which the weapons are equipped in the light or powerful attack slots: they can be changed mid-combo weapon sets, consequently performing even more elaborate series of moves. Very important for gameplay purposes is the presence of a completely controllable dodge, which consists in the possibility of ~sliding~ in any direction, calculated completely around the danmaku elements of the game, so as to best blend these shooter elements with weapon fights white around which the Platinum Games game revolves. A very useful function, in short, and not an end in itself, especially during the challenges with the bosses which, as in the first NieR, are extremely scenic and original, thanks to their good artificial intelligence and movement patterns, at least at the more difficult levels elevated. A ~Normal~, in fact, the combat systemit is not very balanced in its entirety, and this is noticeable in the later stages, where thanks to the RPG elements of the game the characters managed by the user are too powerful for the enemies. Be that as it may, attention, quick reflexes and skill in aiming and hitting enemy weak points or approaching spheres remain the best allies to get to the bottom of these clashes. Things expand further by taking into consideration the presence of the Pods, small floating robots that accompany and support the protagonists during the adventure and which to all intents and purposes replace Weiss' magic in the first NieR. There are three in the game, two of which are additional with replaceable attacks and spells whose finding is optional, but which if put together can then unleash truly devastating powers as needed. Basically these ~little beings~ attack from a distance, but once upgraded through special chips, they can acquire new characteristics that modify their fighting style, attack and defense parameters, executable maneuvers and even make them obtain various support bonuses such as regeneration or increased mobility. The components to improve the performance of the Pods can be obtained by buying them in shops or scavenging them from the bodies of enemies. An imperfect graphic but with style Moving on to the graphics, NieR: Automata - Become as Gods Edition is confirmed as a beautiful but imperfect title, with no particular novelties compared to the PlayStation 4 counterpart, at least on the smooth Xbox One, the console on which we tested the game (on Xbox One X it supports 4K (2160p) and HDR at 60fps). In any case, from a purely stylistic point of view, the game is not discussed: the artistic direction is excellent as is the choice to use a gaunt color palette to keep the style close to the first NieR, and which, among other things, is well suited to the context in which the adventure is set. In the same way, the animations of the protagonists and main antagonists are liked, fluid and of great quality, which enhance the remarkable reactivity of the commands and enjoy a rather stable frame rate. In fact, during our tests, we did not notice any slowdowns or shots due to frame rate drops. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for textures and polygonal count: the general level of detail remains low, a sign that the developers have limited themselves to optimizing the product rather than significantly improving it, at least in some aspects. The same contour elements have remained the same, with vegetation that seems to come from the previous generation, for example. Luckily those minimal particle effects that manage dust, debris and other natural elements do their job by dampening the background stillness and the overall vision. What is really not convincing are the models of the secondary characters, especially the animations. NPCs are flat, with very rough textures and virtually no facial animations. It goes much better with the sound component, where an exciting soundtrack is added to the excellent audio effects, capable of accompanying every single moment of the adventure and exalting itself in particular during the adrenaline-pumping battles with the bosses.", "date": "2018-06-29", "grade": "9.0"}
