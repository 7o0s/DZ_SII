{"name": "Profumo di mare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/182970-battle-bay-profumo-di-mare.html", "text": "Announced over a year ago, Battle Bay has spent several months in soft launch, as usually happens with titles based on online multiplayer, which in this way can build up a substantial slice of users who are already there, ready, the moment you proceed at the official launch. It is probably also for this reason that the matchmaking of the new Rovio title, exceptionally devoid of angry birds and green piglets, is so fast and effective: having completed a quick tutorial that allows you to familiarize yourself with the simple controls of the game, it is possible to try your hand at match five- counter-fives that start in a matter of seconds, without latency problems or disconnections. The ship we initially have is the traditional balanced choice, a little slow in movement but armed with two cannons, each with different reload times. Using a virtual analog stick placed on the left side of the touch screen, we will have to navigate within eight different maps, identify our opponents and open fire using a button placed on the right side of the screen, relying on the automatic lock-on or by moving the viewfinder manually so as to score precision shots. The peculiarity of this experience lies in the fact that the ships do not dash quickly on the waves, but move rather slowly and need to orientate their weapons before they can fire, very similar to what happens in World of Tanks Blitz . Battle Bay is a valuable multiplayer shooter, with gameplay full of strategic facets It is the fault of the sea, the sky and the sea Victory in Battle Bay comes when all five members of the opposing team have been eliminated, but there is no shortage of capture points and strategic variants. However, the multifaceted progression system developed by Rovio holds the ground, which rests its foundations on a series of achievements but also and above all on the unlocking of new ships, weapons and objects, each of which can be upgraded by using the materials collected during the battles and the available credits. It is even possible to subscribe to a VIP subscription that allows you to progress faster, but during our tests we have never encountered situations that are visibly unbalanced against one or the other team, so this aspect does not affect the experience of those who want to play for free . That said, in addition to the starting vehicle, the Shooter, you can purchase four more: the devastating but slow Enforcer; the Defender, almost invulnerable to blows; the Speeder, snappy but not very incisive; and finally the Fixer, which acts like the traditional support unit for allied ships. The available slots can be occupied by different categories of equipment, such as weapons or thrusters, and in this sense there is a large choice of variants. Equipped with a tactical depth that grows as you climb the series, coming to face increasingly cunning opponents, Battle Bay also does an excellent job in terms of technical implementation: the graphics, cartoony and colorful, make the movement of the waves and the richness of the scenarios, showing the side only to a sometimes spartan interface (the names of the players, with that generic font, cry out for revenge), while the music accompanies the action without infamy and without praise.", "date": "2017-05-10", "grade": "8.5"}
