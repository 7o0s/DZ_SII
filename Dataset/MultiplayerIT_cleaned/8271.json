Thanks to high quality indie productions such as To The Moon, Gemini Rue and Home but also to experiments that exploit digital delivery on consoles via Xbox Live and PlayStation Network such as The Walking Dead by Telltale Games, new point and click adventures have appeared and have been able to obtain a decisive success. In reality, the developers of Frogwares Games in recent years have continued to offer various titles that continue to retrace the same genre and which focus on the charm of one of the greatest detectives ever, Sherlock Holmes. The great character created by the pen of A. Conan Doyle who, armed only with intelligence, moves in Victorian London, after having faced Jack the Ripper and Arsenio Lupine, this time he finds himself in the midst of a decidedly intricate story. London 1898 The incipit is provided by three kids who find Doctor Watson's diary in an abandoned attic and start reading it in one go, thus catapulting us directly into the shoes of the investigator and his trusted assistant. The adventure begins in 1898 with the incredible disappearance of a very precious Samoan necklace, theft for which Sherlock finds himself supporting the Police and Inspector Baynes. In a short time the investigator manages to solve the enigma of the disappearance, in a long scene that serves as a tutorial explaining how to move the character and how to analyze the crime scene. Too bad that when everything seems to have been resolved, the Globe Explorer newspaper, with decidedly heavy articles, accuses the detective of having exchanged the necklace by returning only a fake of little value to its rightful owner. Sherlock Holmes's reputation and freedom seem to waver but there is little time to reflect as he is immediately catapulted into a new investigation. The succession of events, which seem really narrated by the skilful English author, becomes more and more compelling up to the grand finale. Analysis and deductions The crime scenes are always analyzed together with Watson who is sometimes able to provide some valid indications, but in reality without too many problems it is enough to move the character towards the objects to be examined, which are highlighted with a magnifying glass icon , to go into details. When you find yourself stuck without knowing how to proceed, using one of the back triggers, you can exploit Sherlock Holmes' sixth sense to find clues that have escaped your eyes at first glance. Sometimes, however, these suggestions that should serve as ~help in the game~ do not prove to be so effective, and probably due to gaps in the programming or simple little ingenuity of the code they lead to inaccessible elements (such as rooms that are still closed and unapproachable). Once the evidence has been found, it is possible, using the appropriate function in the menu, to proceed by deduction by choosing from various solutions the one that appears to be the most appropriate on the basis of what was found on the scene and from the elements that emerged from the dialogues. A valid system, even if in reality it is not possible to blame the wrong person or go down a completely wrong path. The structure of the deductions based on the game menu is a bit rigid and breaks the rhythm of the adventure and we cannot overlook the fact that sometimes these arguments are a little forced and are carried out a little too much by trial and error. Regarding the game interface, we remind you that there are no automatic saves or check points of any kind and you must remember to save by entering the dedicated menu. During the adventure all the scenes to be analyzed are faced in the role of Sherlock but occasionally it is also possible to impersonate Dr. Watson, perhaps simply to recover certain objects or to examine a few simple traces. Whenever the protagonists are handled directly, their behavior is aligned with what the character would actually do, while when they remain entrusted to the CPU, expect nothing more than banal company. The crime scenes can all be tackled either in first or third person by simply pressing the dedicated button. In our game we definitely preferred to use the first person, both for the speed and immediacy that that setting guarantees, and for the fact that the third person view highlights the woodiness of the character animations. Once clues are gathered at the scene of the crimine it is possible to analyze them one by one in the laboratory and therefore we find ourselves moving test tubes and tweezers in search of elements to advance in the investigation, in a sort of period CSI. The challenges to be faced are usually resolved in the search for clues and then in solving very varied but often too frustrating puzzles. Sometimes unfortunately discouraged by the excessive difficulty it becomes necessary to proceed with attempts until the solution of the enigma. In these cases, some sort of help would certainly have been appreciated, perhaps through the character of Watson, or in any case some sort of support or valid alternative. Xbox 360 goals The classic 1000 points are divided into 32 objectives that require you to play the Frogware Games title carefully and intelligently. There aren't particularly abundant objectives but they all revolve around the 20, 30 reward points, this means that it will be necessary to play the Testament of Sherlock Holmes several times to be able to recover them all and it is not possible to follow a single guideline to obtain the loot of 1000. The game rewards if you don't use too many aids, but on the contrary a goal is precisely the one that requires you to ~consume~ all the suggestions given by Sherlock's sixth sense. Technically disappointing If from the gameplay front, apart from some small gaps, one cannot make too many criticisms of the developers, from a technological point of view the problems exist and are evident. It is clear that this genre of game does not put pressure on the hardware for which it was created, be it Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 or PC, presenting few dynamic scenes and mostly rigid environments within which the few characters (you will never see more than four or five subjects on screen). Precisely for this reason the problems relating to the frame rate and the slowness in certain loads are decidedly inexplicable. In a graphic adventure, reaction speed may not be a necessary element, but certainly having to wait a few seconds every time to switch from the analysis of one clue to another breaks the pace of the game more than necessary. The polygonal models of the characters have been created in detail and Watson and Sherlock are made with care as well as the various co-protagonists of the title. The same cannot be said of the scenarios that are gradually faced, not so much for the credibility and style with which they were recreated as for the detail of the textures and the fluctuating graphic quality. The dialogues have been done very well, all in English, and offer good acting. In our aid there are the subtitles in Italian which present a good translation.", "date": "2012-10-10", "grade": "6.5"}
