{"name": "Lega Volley Femminile 60 Campionato - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lega-volley-femminile-60-campionato-recensione.html", "text": "The title goes beyond the simple arcade with two buttons L.V.F. 60th Championship The title goes beyond the simple arcade with two buttons and offers a good variety of moves which, if well executed, offer a certain satisfaction in carrying out the actions. No particular experience is required and after a few games you will be able to perform different combinations of shots. Particularly interesting is the total management of the team, of which you can choose each player at any time, and also perform changes with the benches. If desired, it is possible to activate three types of automatisms, respectively the auto-pass (which automatically directs the ball to the teammates), the auto-attack (it is no longer necessary to press the respective button) and the marker, which indicates the area where opponents will crush (basically a useful cheat to use to place walls). The artificial intelligence proves to be sufficiently combative: an action can last for a long time and it is up to the player to find the right moment and position to strike. In fact, the opponent's field is divided into fifteen zones in which the shot can be directed (the power can be measured using a special bar). In addition to the efforts made to score every now and then, the AI makes sporadic mistakes, which make it more ~human~. It is also possible to see the replay of the match from different angles, an aspect that gives the title a television appearance (however penalized by the graphics). EXTRA! Note the presence of some extras, which will make interested parties happy: a photo gallery of 444 photos (!), and a couple of documents in .PDF format that talk about the 60th championship and the roll of honor, with the list of all winning teams. Furthermore, an editor is available to modify the roles and characteristics of the players (passing from technique to physical appearance). The amazing Mimi Compared to the previous edition, progress has been made but the title is absolutely behind compared to today's productions. The first report must certainly be made to the shadows of the players: they move with 2-3 frames compared to the animations of the characters! To be deactivated For the general sector, the situation improves: the athletes are decently modeled, but they don't have faces resembling their real counterparts (and we are not talking about hundreds of female players, but this is not FIFA); good are the height differences and the fair number of animations. The problem arises when they move at the same time, crossing the field in 3 steps or performing the classic ~wall~ in the exact same way. It's a shame because the dunks, passes, dives are done quite well. Added to this is a movement of the ball that is sometimes unrealistic, especially in the shots and in certain rebounds. There are about ten playing fields in all, faithfully made compared to the real ones, but the use of the color palette and certain textures gives the environments a decidedly plasticky and in some cases disproportionate appearance. The audience, as usual, is made up of cardboard silhouettes and a certain ~non-existence~ which makes the surrounding environment rather sad. To underline the benches with the players in 3D who observe the match (the only commitment for the meager surrounding elements). AH! ATTACK! Hee! Hee! The sound is another point against: the players perform with squeals and verses for a vocabulary of 10 screams ... to the umpteenth ~AH!~ you'll want to mute the audio. Better speech for the crowd, which offers some diversified chants and follows the progress of the game. The various fields each have rather anonymous background music which, however, is not paid too much attention to. Mila Vs. Shiro (2 hearts in volleyball!) Multiplayer allows you to challenge up to 4 opponents simultaneously on the same screen, a bit like in FIFA. Unfortunately it is not possible to play online or on the net, and to be in 4 you need to have two pads. However, the confrontation with human players remains more fun than the challenge with the AI and playing without help it is possible to compete in challenges to the last blood... that is, making a match last several minutes and filling it with spectacular scenes such as extremis rescues and walls with immediate rebuttals. To try! Women's Volleyball League 60th Championship is a game without too many pretensions, which above all aims at the immediate fun that it is able to offer already in the first matches. In terms of playability, however, it proves superior to a title like Dead or Alive Xtreme Beachvolley (but graphically we are light years behind, sigh!), Offering a good variety of moves and above all almost total control over the team (which however can also be automated). An all-Italian title that is being soldat a budget price, and which bodes well for further improvements in future editions. Recommended above all for the female audience and for those who do not live on bread and Shaders but can be satisfied with good playability. Pros: Immediate playability Adequate control system Fully manageable team Cons: Graphically lacking Little variety of environments Boring sound L.V.F. 60th Championship Very long title, even more than the previous 2004 version: it is the official simulation of the Italian volleyball championship, sponsored by more or less known brands and including two categories: A1 and A2. All the women's teams updated to the last season are present. From the initial menu it is possible to choose whether to play a quick game, try the training sessions (including tutorials) or follow the main mode, i.e. the Events. These include a tournament between several A1 or A2 teams, a knockout tournament or simply the play-offs. It is also possible to choose multiple teams to maneuver during the competition.", "date": "2005-08-01", "grade": null}
