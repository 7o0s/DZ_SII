{"name": "The Last of Us Parte 1: la recensione del remake pi contestato di sempre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-last-of-us-parte-1-recensione-remake.html", "text": "We tell you from the very first lines of this very complex review of The Last of Us Part 1: the writer has thought a lot before embarking on the drafting of the article you are reading, to try to combine the two diametrically opposed thoughts that bounced in his head after completing Naughty Dog's seminal work for the third time. Should the evaluation be addressed to those who approach the Californian developer's game as a virgin, having never had anything to do with PlayStation until today? Or should it aim to answer the crucial question of those who have already enjoyed the original work on PS3 or its remastered version on PS4: or is this remake worth buying too? The two points of view coexist and fight in the same vital space in search of predominating over the other and we are sure that whatever our (and your) consideration in this regard, we will never be able to agree on all the potential audience of this exclusive produced by Sony: we are sure that however we will do, we will be wrong. And for this reason we decided to let ourselves be carried away by the sensations, emotions and state of mind felt after reviewing the credits for the umpteenth time. A state of mind that, we want to repeat once again, is torn because it is clear how this remake was born in some marketing office with the precise aim of squeezing the series to turn it into hard cash, but at the same time one cannot not recognizing how the final result reaches peaks of excellence that have very rarely been reached in other re-editions of videogame works. So yes, we are aware that taking home The Last of Us Part 1 today means paying out the same 80 that required for any other new product that arrives on virtual and physical shelves for the first time, just as we are convinced that to make this remake some Naughty Dog resources have been diverted from more noble projects, perhaps a new IP or a sequel still in phase of pre-production. And we know well that not even 10 years have passed since the work of Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley first arrived on the PS3 market, but on the other hand there is a minimum time for a remake to become legitimate it's acceptable? And with today's vision so uncompromising, would we still willingly accept what happened at the time with the remastered for PS4 released at a reduced price, but still distributed just a year after the original version? When this remake will cost 60 or even 40 for any Black Friday, how could we consider a polarized review on the mere commercial aspect and Sony's cleverness valid? So, before diving into the details of The Last of Us Part 1 and getting to the heart of the review, let's answer the last handful of questions which, we well know, will keep your comments alive for who knows how long. Was there really a need for this remake? Absolutely not, we could easily do without it. How does Naughty Dog's remake change the original vision of Straley or Druckman in any way? Negative answer also in this case: the title is exactly the same, with the same story, the same protagonists, the same enemies (or almost), the same settings and the same twists and turns. Has today's technology allowed the development team to do something that wasn't possible 10 years ago? In this case the ~no~ is less decisive given that the novelties are many and are not exclusively technical or graphic, but involve every single aspect of the game with the consequence of making it much more enjoyable and pleasant to play than it was on PS3 and also on PS4. If this is enough to justify the purchase, only you can really know in your heart. The story: always the same The beginning of The Last of Us Part 1 with young Joel and his daughter Sarah The Last of Us Part 1 tells the epic of a long physical and metaphorical journey through an America devastated by a terrifying disease that has reduced the population to very few survivors, leaving streets, houses and urban agglomerations teeming with infected. is absolutely the most original and fits perfectly into the great cauldron of entertainment works that tell a near post-apocalyptic future: whether it is a nuclear explosion, a devastating war, an alien invasion or, precisely, zombification of the population, the key elements of the plot always revolve around the same fixed points. In this specific case, the two protagonists who will get to know each other by pure chance, Joel Miller and Ellie Williams,they will literally have to travel from Boston to Salt Lake City to deliver a possible cure for the epidemic to a military faction born out of the disaster. Even if we are dealing with a video game here, the links with the rats of any self-respecting road movie are particularly strong: the long pilgrimage across the United States will soon turn into an exploration of the moods of the two supporting characters and especially in the psychological evolution of their relationship and a bond that will become increasingly intimate and indissoluble. A stepfather and a goddaughter who will find themselves having to deal with characters who will cross their path, sometimes leaving indelible marks, other times disappearing in a flash following tragic accidents. The journey of The Last of Us Part 1 lasts a year , punctuated by 4 seasons which, once again, act as a metaphor, tell the parable of the awkward encounter between Joel and Ellie and their personal growth: from summer to spring, passing through the despair and sadness of autumn, the harsh winter rigor and then ending in the spring rebirth period when the bond between the two survivors blossoms and flourishes in a way we didn't think possible, exposing the real personality of the protagonists, often with unexpected implications. Ellie and Riley from The Last of Us: Left Behind The story of The Last of Us Part 1 is simple and linear, told in a masterful way thanks to directorial choices that are difficult to find in other videogame works and which perfectly exploits the fluid transition between gameplay and interlude sequences that has always been a hallmark of Naughty Dog designs. The plot can probably be summarized in a few lines, but what matters and what remains impressed is not so much the narrative arc of the game, but the personal stories of the characters who live it. Complex, believable figures confronted with the horror of a life that is no longer normal. The package also includes Left Behind, a DLC released 8 months after the original game and which serves as a prequel to the story told in The Last of Us Part 1, focusing entirely on Ellie about 3 weeks before her meeting with Joel. This is a wonderful addition to the package that offers another small handful of gameplay hours, about 3-4, to the abundant 12 required to finish Part 1. The Gameplay: Overhauled but unchanged A gameplay scene from The Last of Us Part 1 with Joel undercover ready to shoot an arrow As we have just said, The Last of Us Part 1 is a linear adventure, with a very deep narrative component and a distinctly action gameplay that combines a more exploratory part with numerous fights with various types of enemies. All enriched by a handful of environmental puzzles that involve, more than anything else, the movement of garbage barrels, stairs and axes, to reach holds and areas that are only apparently inaccessible, possibly interacting with Ellie or other supporting actors present in the area. The action component is clearly the founding part of the game and, although it is strongly linked to the environmental interaction and the exploitation of the spaces to keep Joel safe and outflank the opponents, it does not present an active management of the covers which, on the contrary, are automatic and contextual without a real ~hook~. The view is in third person and those accustomed to the genre will find all the typical controls in the game with the exception of the jump, which is automatic and dependent on specific exploratory contexts, and an advanced dodge with somersaults or other acrobatic tricks: Joel will limit himself to leaning with the body to avoid grappling and melee blows, but escape, in problematic cases, will be our only friend. The progression of the gameplay is marked by the collection of new weapons and the unlocking of a small handful of passive skills that we can ~purchase ~ by spending the pills that we will have collected around the rooms. Clearly all this serves to make us more resistant and able to face waves of enemies that will increase in quantity and quality given that during the journey we will come across various new types of opponents who will then begin to mix with each other to increase the challenge rate. Ellie is ready to have our backs in The Last of Us Part 1 Conceptually, the enemies are divided into two large factions: the surviving humans who in turn will belong to various more or less militarized and organized social groups and who will want to get rid of us in a violent way, and the infected who will have the sole objective of biting any still healthy living being to kill or infect it. Clearly the methods of attack and behaviors will take into account the different propensions to attack Joel and Ellie and we will have to be good at exploiting the surrounding environment and paraphernalia in the best possible way. The Last of Us Part 1 can in fact be played with great satisfaction by adopting a highly stealth approach, assaulting every single opponent at shoulders, creating traps and taking advantage of ambient noise, bottles and bricks to distract patrols and infected wanderers and there will even be areas where we will be given the freedom to go around every single opponent to reach the exit undisturbed, leaving a trail of survivors behind us , but also losing an enormous amount of resources along the way. Naughty Dog's work also presents the typical elements of survival: ammunition is scarce and most of the time we will have to be good at managing the opponents trying to group them so as to take them out by firing as few shots as possible, or perhaps by throwing a single Molotov cocktail. Furthermore, there is a rudimentary form of crafting since the aforementioned incendiary weapons, together with knives, medkits, explosive traps or smoke grenades, can be created on the field using a handful of resources that we will have to continually search for and collect around the scenario, rummaging even in drawers and cabinets, while we are immersed in the observation of the urban remains of a humanity that no longer exists. Why it's a remake: the fact of the matter Bill is one of the best characterized characters of The Last of Us Part 1 After reviewing the story and gameplay, so as to inform the small group of people who, to date, have never had the good fortune to play The Last of Us, it's time to get to the real heart of the matter: this Part Is 1 really a remake? What's really new or heavily revised that makes it possible to disprove all that sea of atrocious comments that keep asking us loudly ~what's the point of re-reviewing a simple increase in texture resolution?~. So let's say it right away, a beginning of paragraph: yes, The Last of Us Part 1 is an effective and effective remake, which cannot be reduced to a pure technical remastering of assets. There are no new sections or enrichments of the plot, much less the game aims to offer a different epilogue, perhaps with a different point of view, wanting to reduce everything to a comparison with Resident Evil 2 Remake or Final Fantasy VII Remake. The game always remains the same, but the enrichment of what surrounds the pure narrative is enormous and is clearly the result of 10 years of Naughty Dog homemade progress and, in particular, of everything that has been implemented in Part 2 So let's start from all those trappings that only fans of the series will be able to notice more. Now it is finally possible to manually set the granularity of the level of difficulty, managing separately the artificial intelligences of friends and enemies, the survival element and the realism of stealth. There are even advanced options dedicated to speedruns, permanent death and a couple of types of New Game Plus to allow a second game of the game while also keeping all the collected and upgraded equipment. The work done on the accessibility front is also enormous which, in addition to presenting a staggering amount of options regarding visual and auditory aids, offers excellent lightening of the controls and gameplay dynamics up to implementing some innovations such as the possibility of exploit the haptic vibration of the DualSense to strengthen the tone of the dialogues so as to make them more intelligible even to those who experience listening difficulties or the audio description of everything that happens on the screen, simply perfect for the visually impaired. In some cases, the environments of The Last of Us Part 1 have been completely redesigned from an artistic point of view The Last of Us Part 1 is then enriched with a series of particularly interesting extras: sketches of the characters, concept art of the environments both of the original version and of this remake, the re-proposition of the audio episodes of a podcast where voice actors and creators met to tell the making of the title and even a real commentary by Neil Druckmann and Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson who will accompany you during the cutscenes telling behind the scenes and behind the scenes. To all this is added the possibility of changing Joel and Ellie's clothing by choosing from various items of clothing while for what concerns some weapons it is also possible to change the skin by choosing between more or less showy options. It's just a pity that this last extra is only unlocked upon completion of the game. Clearly, the release on PS5 allowed the team to take full advantage of the DualSense, the controller", "date": "2022-08-31", "grade": "9.0"}
