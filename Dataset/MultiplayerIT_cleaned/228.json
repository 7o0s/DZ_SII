{"name": "Jonathan Danter: Nel Sangue di Giuda - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jonathan-danter-nel-sangue-di-giuda-recensione.html", "text": "Still religious secrets The plot of JD is placed in full wake of the modern trend linked to mysteries of a religious nature, inaugurated by the now very famous literary work by Dan Brown, ~The Da Vinci Code~. In fact, the story begins in a very similar way to the best seller, that is to say with an assassination, following which Jonathan Danter, an English journalist who emigrated to the United States, is urgently recalled to his homeland by Scotland Yard, which informs him to have serious reasons to fear for his safety, thus snatching him from an interview with an important cardinal in Miami and catapulting him into an unsolved mystery which his uncle, the murderer's victim, was investigating before being killed. Not revealing anything else, so as not to spoil the pleasure of moving forward in the plot as usual, we can say that the whole story also closely resembles Broken Sword, complete with the inevitable female co-protagonist and equally ubiquitous involvement of the Templar order , in possession of yet another secret to be revealed. Given these considerations, Jonathan Danter's plot offers a feeling of ~already seen~ for the entire duration of the game, essentially dividing itself in half between the works mentioned above, therefore lacking that appeal capable of keeping the player bound in front of the monitor both to go forward in the story and because he is fond of the protagonists of the game, which in this case does not even happen for the main character. How hard is the adventure Finishing JD won't take much time for more experienced players, as the game's puzzles settle at normal levels, making it almost impossible to stay still in one spot for an excessive amount of time, thus delighting those who are less used to it. to the mechanisms of graphic adventures: probably the presence of some more difficult enigma, where to rack your brain a little more, could have guaranteed more playing time, without encroaching on the frustration on the part of the gamer, so feared by the makers of titles of this kind, thus satisfying all types of end users. Certainly it must be said that the odious concept of ~pixel searching~ is completely unknown to JD, and this is certainly a praise to be given to Artematica in times in which by now almost all graphic adventures seem to have taken this path to make life is a little more difficult for the players, rather than focusing on the creation of complex, but still logical puzzles. For the benefit of all those who should still get stuck in front of the game's puzzles, we find in the original package a booklet containing the entire solution to the adventure, written as if it came from the real fist of the game's protagonist. As far as the game interface is concerned, following the numerous suggestions obtained from users after releasing MM, Artematica has introduced some interesting new features, improving but conceptually keeping intact the framework appreciated in the case of the adventure dedicated to the famous protagonist of the homonymous comic book. As a result we have the possibility of running from one point to another of the locations, quickly switching between them by pressing the right mouse button, as well as an interesting ~inventory of ideas~ system, where the considerations made are practically memorized by the protagonists of the game, which can then be reused at a later time as if they were objects, to solve puzzles: despite the excellent idea, however, the impression is that the developers did not want to focus excessively on this type of novelty, waiting for public feedback before reproposing it, perhaps in an expanded way, within other productions in the field of graphic adventures. 'A sir One of the funniest interludes of the game is the part in which you find yourself talking to the guardian of the Vatican Museums, with an unmistakable and amusing Roman accent. It is no coincidence that we can say that the audio component is JD's best, positioning itself thanks to a good dubbing even above the most popular and famous productions, as well as the main theme, perhaps a little abused but quite successful. Also as regards the graphics we are on good levels, above all thanks to the strong point of the lip synchronization in real time with the sound, improved compared to MM. The backdrops are quite accurate, especially as regards the locations such as Piazza S. Pietro or other very famous real places, as well as the animations of the characters do their job quite well, even more after their revision which took place with the 1.01 patch. Proceeding with the comparison withMM, this time we find the possibility to disable shadows together with the choice between multiple video resolutions. Inventory management is also very similar to that of MM, not only in terms of dynamics, but also in terms of actual graphics. the price at which the game is sold is 19.90 Conclusions After Martin Mystre, the consecratory work by Artematica was expected, a work that has only partially arrived: the plot twists of the game based on the successful comic series are unfortunately only a memory, given that JD's story flows without acute details, sometimes even offering the sensations of dejavu described in the body of the review. The game system itself is very simple and user friendly and also the technical sector, already good in version 1.00, finds itself playing in JD's favor after the revision that took place during the patch, thus solving most of the problems that would have jeopardized the enjoyment of the game itself by the public. In conclusion, we can say that the only - but important - real defect of this game is that of lacking originality in the plot, too tied to the ~Da Vinci Code~ vein, which also probably makes it a little difficult for the player become attached to the protagonists, who are brand new and therefore suffer in comparison with the charismatic Martin Mystre. However, some innovative ideas in the gameplay are to be appreciated, including the aforementioned ~inventory of ideas~ and the communicator, a kind of PDA through which the characters exchange clues and various types of content, as well as a respectable technical sector, probably superior even to some more famous titles within the genre to which JD belongs. Last but not least, the price at which the game is sold is 19.90! Pro Competitive price and made in Italy Good technical sector No pixel searching! Cons Unoriginal plot The more experienced players won't have too many problems Install the patch! JD version 1.00 had some bugs which, in some cases, forced the player to completely restart the game after returning to the operating system. Fortunately Artematica promptly ran for cover, publishing the patch that brings JD to version 1.01, correcting the aforementioned bugs and also adding the possibility of opening the various maps by pressing the M key, together with the improvement of some animations; reasons why we strongly recommend installing it before starting the game. You can find the patch in our download section or, alternatively, on the official Artematica website. Italians in the limelight The software houses of our country that have managed to obtain a role within the international panorama of the gaming industry have been very few over the years, and most of them have appeared more like a meteor, making themselves known from the public for the creation of one or a few more titles, to then leave behind only a memory, which has turned into regret in very few cases. Within this scenario, as little reassuring as it is sadly known by those who hope for Italy to enter the video game business, Artematica has managed to carve out a leading role today, thanks to titles such as Druuna: Morbus Gavis, Ducati World Championship and Martin Mystre: Operation Dorian Gray. The latter was the title most appreciated by the public, thus leading the house to develop a new graphic adventure, focusing on the successful previous experience. Thus arrives in these days Jonathan Danter: In the blood of Judas, also known abroad as Belief & Betrayal, with the hope on the part of Artematica of being able to repeat, if not surpass, the success achieved by Martin Mystre.", "date": "2006-12-11", "grade": null}
