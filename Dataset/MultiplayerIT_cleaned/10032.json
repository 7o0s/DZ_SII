A shooter with a third person view capable of combining a valid structure with progressive levels filled with classic boss fights, the presence of cooperative and competitive multiplayer, the use of diversified weapons and combat robots, all supported by an advanced technical sector capable of spectacularize the action to the max. Twenty years ago, playing Contra or Bionic Commando, the image of the shooter of the future might have looked very similar to this, if one had had enough foresight to foresee a three-dimensional development of graphics technology. The impact with the game is remarkable, also thanks to the particular characterization imparted by Capcom: on the other hand, the use of the proprietary MT Framework 2.0 engine has prevented the risk of excessive similarities or derivative impressions of the graphics sector, freeing itself from the prevailing Unreal Engine and allowing developers to work with greater creative freedom. The amount of content and game modes, which appear evident from the moment you enter the first screen - which represents a sort of connection hub between the various options - immediately makes clear the hybrid and multifaceted nature of the product, strongly impregnated with multiplayer. The impression, however, is that Capcom has succeeded perfectly in the intention of exponentially evolving the positive aspects of the first chapter (graphics, presence of cooperative multiplayer, boss fights, variety of situations) but has left the lesser elements almost unchanged convincing, especially with regard to the control system and artificial intelligence. Fire and Ice The incipit of the campaign condenses the essential aspects of the game into a few minutes. We start with a familiar scenario for those who have tried the first chapter, with the usual snowy expanses and the equally well-known attacks of the Akrid aliens and the pirates, but the news does not take long to show itself. To begin with, we are not alone but within a team of up to four elements, whether these are human players or CPU-controlled companions, and we immediately realize how cooperative action represents the new pivot of the gameplay. After a few meters made by trudging between deep snow and rocks, with the movement assisted by the use of the usual grappling hook, we are also made aware of the other essential novelty of this second chapter, or the presence of different settings. Within minutes we find ourselves immersed in a lush jungle, between stormy streams and a pouring rain on the rich foliage, testifying to the changes made on the ecosystem of the planet E.D.N. III from the terraforming process and the intensive use of geothermal energy, the fulcrum of the clashes between the various factions present in the story as well as the changes undergone by the Akrid, the indigenous alien ~population~. The story unfolds through various sub-plots that tell different points of view, giving a choral vision of the events that characterize life on the planet and the incessant war that tears it apart through 5 different protagonists drawn from the various factions in the game (which in some way they will find themselves together in the sixth and final episode), for a total of about 8-10 hours of gameplay. The various episodes, which each tell the story of a different character, are obviously very detached from each other and are in turn divided into rather short and often colorless chapters and missions from a narrative point of view. The result is a fragmented structure which, if on the one hand it favors the variety of situations, on the other it makes the campaign extremely fragmented, damaging the narrative uniformity of the story. On the other hand, this also seems to be a deliberate choice by Capcom which, focusing on the multiplayer game experience, has bent the conformation of the campaign to this by sacrificing the narrative elements to increase the pace of the action and facilitate the use of group. Party games The multiplayer soul of Lost Planet 2 is already evident from the initial screen. Going to select the Campaign, one is initially disoriented by noting that, instead of a classic start awhat is assumed to be the mode designed for single player use, we are faced with the possibility of ~starting a game~ by immediately selecting the type of connection for multiplayer (it is possible to play cooperatively offline through the split-screen for two players ) and the amount of teammates that can possibly be controlled by the artificial intelligence. It is a clear sign of how the whole game has been designed to be enjoyed in multiplayer, and it is in fact alongside human companions that this new Capcom product offers its best. The support for four players simultaneously in action has imposed a change in the structure of the levels and gameplay, with a faster pace, greater freedom of movement given by larger and more branched maps with different objectives to be pursued simultaneously and the need to develop strategies team to get the better of the most agitated situations or boss fights, even more gigantic and challenging than seen in the first chapter. These are all elements that tend to get lost when playing with artificial intelligence. Recurring situations, for example, are represented by the need to defend some points of interest from enemy attacks, perhaps keeping transmitters active for a certain amount of time or resisting progressive assaults by aliens or pirates waiting for support, or even the epic encounters with ~G~-class akrid requiring coordinated attacks against weak points. In these cases, team play becomes essential and the possibility of comparing and organizing among several players makes everything much more enjoyable. Each progress made, both in competitive multiplayer and in the campaign (in cooperative or not), involves an accumulation of points and a progression in terms of experience and level of the various usable characters, an element that the developers strongly wanted in order to make ~ useful~ from a multiplayer point of view every single session of Lost Planet 2. In terms of customization of the fighters, further steps forward have been made which add a certain strategic depth to the gameplay and push towards a ~group~ interpretation of the game: it is now It is possible to focus on different characteristics for your protagonist, configuring your favorite weapons for ranged, short-range or support attacks, for example, and the choice of two special skills (recovery, speed, attack or similar) to be associated with them increases the possibility of player specialization and team cohesion, in case you decide to play the game with a fixed group of friends. As in the first chapter, there are also several competitive multiplayer modes (for up to 16 players) structured according to the typical variants of the ~all against all~ or team deathmatch and the more strategic ones that require the conquest and control of points of interest , although in these cases the rather frenetic essence of the game does not reach the tactical peaks that other similar products have accustomed us to (Gears of War, for example). Between pirates and aliens As for the fulcrum of the action, the shooter dynamic has remained the same as in the first chapter, with the same, imperfect, control system. This is one of the less positive elements that hasn't encountered the substantial evolution demonstrated in almost all the other areas of Lost Planet 2: even if without big evident gaps, the aiming system assisted with the movement of the character (independent elements and linked to two analog sticks, as per tradition) lack that immediate intuitiveness that would be desirable in a shooter. From this point of view, even the use of the jump and the grappling hook does not always find a worthy application in the game, beyond its use as a diversion during firefights (since there is no cover system apart from the use of shields) and sometimes tends to make the action more confusing, given that the level design in general has been ~flattened~ thus facilitating the multiplayer action. The other element derived directly from the first chapter is the presence of Vital Suits, or combat exoskeletons that the player can control in battle, significantly increasing firepower and resistance to attacks. In this case, the possibility of disassembling the VS weapons and using them by moving on foot or changing them between the different types scattered throughout the levels is interesting. The third-person shooter mechanics also provides for the possibility of transporting different types of interchangeable weapons (heavy, medium and light) and assorted grenades, as well asa particular characteristic given by the use of the ~harmoniser~. This tool allows you to self-recharge your vital energy by spending the points you accumulate in battle, as well as ~shoot~ them directly at teammates so that they too can use them to heal themselves. Xbox 360 goals The objectives of Lost Planet 2 are equally divided between those obtainable during the campaign and those dedicated to competitive multiplayer, between objectives related to the progression of the levels and those that are unlocked by reaching certain requirements in terms of game performance. It should also be noted that Lost Planet 2 contains its own system of unlockable achievements independent of Xbox Live, in the style of the achievements inserted by Valve in its most recent games. Epic battles The graphics, in addition to the new focus on multiplayer, seem to be the most distinctive element of Lost Planet 2, which confirms itself as a product capable of showing the world well what Capcom's proprietary graphics engine is capable of in a broader context compared to the excellent results already obtained with Resident Evil 5. Already the first chapter of the series stood out as one of the most convincing first approaches, coming from the Japanese front, to the (at the time) new technologies of the ~next gen~, although the solution of an entirely frozen setting would somewhat simplify the representation of the world. This second chapter makes no compromises: snowy expanses, forests, metropolitan settings, interiors and exteriors, rain, night and sun follow one another in a continuous variation of environments and chromatic choices, surprising the player and characterizing the planet both in terms of technological elements and artificial, obviously set according to a futuristic-sci-fi taste, both in natural and wild contexts. A reflection of this dichotomy is found in the same enemies that we find ourselves facing, between humans of various factions supported by various technological solutions and akrid of new types, some of which (in particular the terrible ~G-class~) protagonists of truly epic moments . In some cases, boss fights are memorable moments, with enemies of terrifying dimensions and characterized by a level of difficulty that requires constant effort. Although the presence of various checkpoints and the continuous respawn never makes the challenge excessively prohibitive, against some bosses teamwork becomes essential to try to lower the cursed energy bar of the enemy. As for the audio sector, the orchestral soundtrack and the usual, excited dialogues (not too widespread to tell the truth) play their role with dignity in making the action as cinematic as possible.", "date": "2010-05-06", "grade": "8.3"}
