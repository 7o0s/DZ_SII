{"name": "FORCED", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125202-forced-cooperazione-forzata.html", "text": "FORCED is one of those titles that just happen to make life miserable for a poor reviewer. You play it for hours, you try out the different aspects and then you find yourself looking at the monitor doubtful even about the first word to write. You get up from your chair, go look in the mirror and, with a mocking smile, you're forced to agree with yourself that you could give him a bad vote or exalt him beyond belief, finding valid and incontrovertible arguments in both cases. Which class do we choose? We know that you are already wondering how such ambivalence in judgment is possible. The easy answer, but not exhaustive: FORCED is as beautiful and addictive when played in cooperative mode, as forgettable when played alone. But let's go in order. The story that is the basis for the gameplay is thin, almost useless. Players take on the role of gladiators who must win their freedom by overcoming trials after trials in increasingly difficult arenas. The setting is all powerful creatures who want to grant everything except what was promised, and a sphere of light, with a spirit called Balfus trapped inside, who will be our most precious company throughout the adventure. We start with the classic tutorial that explains the basics of the game. The controls are very simple and immediate, both if you use the mouse and keyboard pair, and if you choose the joypad way (a sign that the developers are also working on the console versions). The selectable classes, grabbing weapons from some statues, range from a warrior armed with a hammer, to a kind of wizard, passing through the classic intermediate characters. Probably more will come with future expansions, but now it's too early to talk about them. Obviously each class has its own tree of skills, which are unlocked by collecting gems in the various tests, and which greatly change the way you fight. In short, nothing difficult or never seen before. Less immediate is the use of the sphere of light, which deserves further study. Spirit a thousand uses Some puzzles are not trivial at all The companion ball of light has a very important role in the game economy, at the same level of combat techniques (if not higher). The protagonist can recall it at any point by pressing a simple key. If desired, it can be attached to the character by holding down the same button for three seconds. The likeable Balfus has not only a decorative function, as it might seem from the first arenas. Meanwhile, the sphere can be passed over altars to obtain different effects. There's the healing altar, the quickening altar, the one that creates a shock wave, and so on. It can also be used to destroy hourglasses that make monsters appear in bursts. That's all? Not exactly. It will soon be discovered that Balfus has special powers that will transform FORCED into a real puzzle game. For example, in one of the first arenas it will be necessary to destroy the statues placed behind the walls by passing Balfus on an explosive altar, to make him do a real slalom between the obstacles that risk making him explode before reaching the target. On another occasion it will be necessary to use it to keep an acid cloud under control and on yet another occasion it will be necessary to attach it to large mobile supports and then move them on platforms, guiding them with the character. In short, not bad for a simple gadget, right? Some sceneries are very beautiful At the end of each arena, one to three gems will be awarded: one for successfully completing the test (the only sure one), a second if a specific objective has been achieved (different for each test) and the third if to complete the mission within the minimum time required. Once a gem has been collected in a trial, repeating it will not yield another of the same type. The accumulation of the stones will allow you to unlock new powers of the selected class and to open new slots to increase the powers to take to the arenas. Obviously the better you are in the tests, the more you will get the gems needed to upgrade to the maximum. Don't underestimate this aspect, because after a certain number of arenas you will have to face the boss of the area. It is usually an exceptionally powerful enemy that will take a lot of effort to take down. In general, however, already from the second series of arenas you will notice a significant increase in difficulty, a factor that is greatly reflected in the dilemma with which we opened the article. FORCED: a splendid cooperative game, to be forgotten in single player Alone or in company? The bosses are really tough As we said in the introduction, FORCED is a title with a double soul. Let's face it, playing alone is really a pain.Not only is the arena system ill-suited to an epic solo adventure, but it soon becomes clear that the entire game was designed to work well with multiple players, sacrificing much of the single player experience. As already mentioned, the arenas grow exponentially in difficulty, to the point of becoming really frustrating in the advanced stages. There are some puzzles that are very hard to solve on your own, requiring absolute precision when using Balfus. Unfortunately, in many of these situations you will find yourself literally surrounded by monsters, some of which are incredibly leathery, which will make it a pain to take the steps to move the sphere... even if only to activate a healing altar to try not to die for the umpteenth time. The level of challenge, already high by itself, is increased by the character growth system: how do you become more powerful to overcome the most difficult challenges if to obtain advanced powers you have to finish the arenas by overcoming almost impossible challenges? Let's take the need to finish an arena within a certain amount of time: at the beginning, with a little effort, it is not impossible to do it, but in the advanced arenas you find yourself with gaps to fill of several minutes between the time taken and that required, above all in the aforementioned cases in which Balfus must be used with extreme precision. To succeed you need to be as powerful as possible, but to grow you need to pass the tests. In short, it's a snake that doesn't eat its tail but has decided to bite a high voltage cable. The boy is angry A bad picture, isn't it? The paradox is that instead most of the flaws of the single player mode become advantages in cooperative mode. The more FORCED becomes difficult, the more the fun with friends multiplies, either because playing in company is always more fun, or because suddenly the impossible becomes affordable and, in any case, a whole series of strategies can be implemented to overcome the various tests in more effective way, reducing the attention needed to perform each of the actions. Of course, other difficulties arise, such as the risk of damaging a partner with an explosive sphere, but these are difficulties calculated and balanced by the advantages of cooperation, which do not weigh on the action. Too bad that many players, including us, have connection problems and that, in cases where a game is managed, the lag is not very rare. From this point of view, however, the developers are working hard to fix the problems and by the time you read this review it should be easier to be able to play online.", "date": "2013-11-08", "grade": "7.0"}
