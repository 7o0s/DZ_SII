The classifications exist for the mere convenience of users, and so for videogame genres. It is true that there are some that are truly more recognizable than others, and on which one can intervene, as a contamination, up to a certain point. Twin-stick shooters probably fall into the latter category: two analog sticks to control the protagonist, rapid fire against every object that moves on the screen, rapid action, a thousand enemies on the screen. How to vary the usual dish, then? How to offer something that is immediately recognizable in a market now saturated with publications of all kinds, with an unspecified number of video games that every month - due to force majeure - inevitably end up in oblivion, without even a few seconds of glory? Art direction and atmosphere should be the most immediate answers to the dilemma. They certainly are for NeverAwake, developed by Neotro and published on all existing platforms by Phoenixx: what struck us, even before the gameplay which in any case defends itself very well, were the context and the disturbing setting. Let's find out in the NeverAwake review, which we completed on Nintendo Switch. The plot: between nightmares and daily fears Here is Rem, the disturbing protagonist of NeverAwake NeverAwake offers a dreamlike adventure, set in a disturbing world of dreams; but it would perhaps be more correct to call it ~world of nightmares~. The plot is extremely cryptic, a detail that helps to keep the attention up to the end credits, although there are no surprises worthy of the name. The protagonist is Rem, a strange entity destined to face hordes of enemies in a world that is certainly not ours. But Rem's story is linked to that of Yuki, a little girl who doesn't seem to be able to wake up. Prisoner for some reason of her own nightmares, she will have to wait for the dream alter ego to sweep away all the monsters generated by her fears. In fact, and this is another very original aspect of the production, in NeverAwake we don't find ourselves facing the classics such enemies - demon, aliens, various and possible monsters. Every creature in every world proposed by the Neotro developers represents the (very obvious) symbolization of the fears of a simple girl. It may seem absurd, but Rem finds herself facing gigantic aubergines, deformed dogs, even some dentists: in short, all those unpleasant aspects of the life of every human being (who likes dentists? and who likes aubergines, come on?), perfectly acceptable when awake, but distressing and oppressive when reworked by the irrationality of the dreamlike dimension. Thematic is also the subdivision of the levels (about eighty in total) within four macro-areas which then present minimal variations within them. In fact, the variety is not the most successful aspect of the production, also due to the continuous recycling of enemies from level to level; but considering the size of the product itself, these are not significant limits. The progression is interspersed with small text mirrors: the latter refer to some details, considerations or events related to the sleeper. Thus it becomes increasingly clear what actually happened; but the ending (actually divided into two different possibilities) remains bound to the player's choices. Gameplay: A shooter with many possibilities If fast-paced action is what you're looking for, NeverAwake will satisfy you The soul of NeverWake, it has been said, is that of the twin-stick shooter: basically a shooter on tracks (sometimes with forks) in which the player controls Rem's movements (left stick) and the pointing of her firearm (right stick). The back keys of the console allow you to perform the special attack, with a wide range and therefore useful for both offensive and defensive purposes, since it can also ~parry~ some enemy blows (ZR); and dodging (ZL). NeverAwake is neither among the simplest representatives of the genre nor among the strictly prohibitive ones: in reality the proposal is really balanced, the more accessible levels gradually give way to more complex proposals. But everything can be managed in various ways: either by enabling automatic fire from the settings (making use literally a walk) or by unlocking useful upgrades. This management is very interesting, because it avoids displeasing both the veterans and the newcomers, getting everyone to agree somewhat; everyone can also enhance their own style of play, supported by the many customization possibilities present. If yours is an aggressive approach, then you will need those boosts that, for example, rethey charge the special attack based on the blows inflicted on enemies; if you prefer to play cunning, perhaps it is instead appropriate to unlock the third shield, allowing Rem to suffer one more hit than the classic three (before game over). There are so many possibilities, and they are unlocked as you progress in the main adventure, spending soul gems, or soul stones, in short, the title is completely in English so choose the translation you prefer. One of the many nightmarish bosses in NeverAwake In fact, the entire gameplay is linked to these gems. Normally a shooter of this type requires you to get from point A to point B by eliminating as many enemies as possible on the screen to increase your score: the direction can then be horizontal or vertical, or even diagonal. NeverAwake, on the other hand, doesn't work like this: to complete a certain level you need to earn gems dropped by enemies (or present in the game world) until the appropriate indicator is filled. If in the meantime the level is ~finished~, you pass to the ~second round~, i.e. from loop 1 to loop 2, and so on. Usually, it goes without saying, a couple of loops are enough to gather all the necessary material; and then proceed further. There is no shortage of interesting boss fights, usually every three standard levels, which work in the same way: you have to fill the gigantic (and dangerous) enemy with shots until he releases enough gems. Thanks to the extremely small size of the individual levels, NeverAwake is lends itself beautifully to hit and run sessions; and - but this is a more personal opinion - perhaps Nintendo Switch, due to portability, is the most suitable console for an experience of this type. On the other hand, the performance (load times included) isn't great. We are sure that even a content title like this can be seen and enjoyed better elsewhere. However, on Nintendo Switch it does its job, without infamy and without praise; we always and only talk about the technical sector, we reiterate it.", "date": "2023-01-30", "grade": "8.0"}
