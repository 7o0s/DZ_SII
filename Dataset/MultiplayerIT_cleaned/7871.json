For those who have missed the reviews of the previous chapters, Infamy and Betrayal, the plot restarts shortly after the beginning of the events narrated in the original game, and offers an alternative historical course, with George Washington corrupted by the power of an apple of the 'Eden and self-crowned King of the United States. All this at the price of a lot of native blood, so that Ratonhnhak:ton is forced to take up arms and exploit the magic of the tribes to get revenge. Our hopes for this finale were quite high, given the interesting basic idea and the good realization of the first chapter. Unfortunately, as fun as the concept remains, The Redemption fails to fully develop its potential, amusing only at times, and resulting in an ending that certainly does not live up to expectations. Bear, walk with me The Redemption begins a few moments after the closure of the previous episode, with the protagonist finally embarking on the ship bound for New York, the base of the new totalitarian government of King Washington. The occasion is excellent both to re-propose a naval battle, which is one of the funniest gameplay offerings of the original game, and to give a small hint to the protagonist of the future Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. After these digressions, we return to the tracks of the plot, with Ratonhnhak:ton forced again to drink the magic tea of the tribe to secure a new power through which to fight the forces of the tyrant king, precisely where the latter is strongest and most protected. Where the previous two episodes had done an interesting job of providing the player with completely new tools for the saga, namely invisibility and the flight of the eagle, with this third episode the device is decidedly less original and fun to use. Once the usual preliminary sequence has been completed, as always very inspired in terms of design, the power of the Bear is in fact resolved in the possibility of developing a powerful wave of area damage, damaging and hurling enemies to the ground and destroying some structures. In addition to being rather trivial in terms of conceptualization, the power also proves to be excessively effective once on the field, and at times even forced, especially when one realizes that the damageable structures have been conspicuously arranged ad hoc to make the fights more spectacular. unfortunately without good results. Even the assignments, which will lead to the final confrontation in just over two hours, do not present particular flashes of originality, repeatedly tracing some clichs already typical of the original game. To this we must add the fact that the availability of the three powers at the same time, as it was easy to predict, makes comparisons with the blue jackets in Washington's service almost a formality, with the player practically invulnerable even against the most numerous garrisons. Again, this is a pity, given that in the level design we note the intention of the developers to push the player to use all three powers in combination in this third episode, where the two predecessors concentrated instead on encouraging at the same time exploitation of the last specialty earned. Unfortunately, the already mild basic difficulty level, combined with the extreme effectiveness of the Bear's attack, makes these attempts barely perceptible. Xbox 360 goals The Redemption offers three objectives, two of which are related to the synchrony percentage and subsequent completion, plus a third which requires the simultaneous killing of a certain number of enemies using the power of the Bear. The big Apple There is undoubtedly a positive note in this final chapter, and it is represented precisely by the city of New York. Where the previous two episodes limited themselves to re-presenting the Frontier and Boston without any particular novelty, in The Redemption the Big Apple is decidedly transformed, both in terms of atmosphere and architecturally. Washington's rule has in fact reduced the population to poverty and despair, and this is very well stylized in crossing the streets of the city, especially for those who still remember the lively and dynamic image proposed in the original game. The contrast is very sharp and creates an all in all credible context, excellent for motivating the protagonist in the approach to the final confrontation with the tyrant. Furthermore, in this third chapter appears the first, and the only, structure added specifically by the developers and not recycled from Assassin's Creed, namely the imposing pyramid built by Re Washington in the heart of the urban sprawl. Visible from every point of the city, it will be the background to the second half of the plot, proving to be a perfect place to put into practice the combined use of the three powers of Ratonhnhak:ton. Precisely in these phases shortly before the conclusion, The Redemption plays its best cards, at times with success, showing how the possibility of giving a worthy closure to the episodic DLC actually existed, and how the ideas behind it were good, as already guessed in occasion of the previous two chapters. Unfortunately, ideas and conceptualization are not enough to create a solid and enjoyable experience, as the objectives to complete and the fights end up lapsing into repetitiveness and boredom. Basically, you play only to get to the longed-for final battle, and find out how the developers decided to close the spin-off on a narrative level. Before reaching the revelation, however, there will be one last, disappointing battle to complete against the archenemy. Although the contextualization attempts to give the final battle an epic flavor, the banality of the mechanics on which it is based and the simplicity with which it is completed definitively ruin the effect, weighing once again on the overall quality of the experience. In the face of a plot that closes in about two hours, The Redemption unfortunately fails to offer secondary tasks worthy of particular interest, unlike the first chapter. Crossing New York transformed by the dictatorship is a good experience, but unfortunately there is not much to do, forcing the player to quickly return to the tracks of the plot. Wanting to give a limited judgment to this third chapter of the package, it can be said that it presents several improvements compared to Il Tradimento, but at the same time it fails to achieve the good results recorded by the progenitor, L'Infamia. In fact, despite a well-groomed conceptualization, the banality of the new power offered and its extraordinary effectiveness against enemies end up compromising the gameplay, among other things in the face of missions that are too close to those of the original game. In short, an unsatisfactory conclusion, also considering the ending in clear anticlimax. The purchase, for those who have already completed the first two chapters, is almost obligatory, provided you want to see the end of the story, but it will inevitably lead to a general sense of disappointment. Those who have not yet purchased any of the three chapters of the package, however, must carefully consider the situation. Overall, with its approximately 7 hours of duration, the experience offered by The Tyranny of King Washington has several interesting aspects, including the possibility of dealing with known situations in very different ways than usual and, despite a disappointing ending, the whole it is linked by a plot that is all in all not despicable. Unfortunately, the total price of 25 euros is currently really too high if we consider the quality of the play offer, fluctuating in many aspects. A future price reduction could certainly make the package more attractive, but for the moment the purchase advice is limited to the most diehard fans.", "date": "2013-04-26", "grade": null}
