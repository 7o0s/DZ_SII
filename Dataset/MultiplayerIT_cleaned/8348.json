Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent. After the various technical problems that had forced its temporary withdrawal, The Simpsons: Springfield is finally back available on the App Store, to the great satisfaction of the many fans who own a compatible Apple device. The Simpson phenomenon, on which rivers of ink and many degree theses have been wasted, has continued undeterred for over a decade and the airing of the episodes all over the world is still enjoying great success today. The credit certainly goes to Matt Groening and his staff, creators of a screenplay that is always attentive to episodes of custom and certainly not tender with the habits of citizens and the American ruling class. Although some of the polish that made the series famous has inevitably declined in recent years, the appeal of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and little Maggie is still very large, such as to make a new title dedicated to them interesting , especially if unpublished multimedia content is included in it. A ~small~ fatal distraction The opening of The Simpsons: Springfield shows the first of a series of animated sequences never broadcast on television and created especially for the video game: Homer, as usual present at work but totally distracted, is enraptured by a game on his ~MyPad~ (in the world of the Simpsons, Apple products are called ~Mapple~), criticizing the gameplay but despite everything investing even a thousand dollars because of tempting microtransactions. His concentration is so strong that he does not notice the accident that broke out at the main reactor of the nuclear power plant which, as an inevitable consequence, will cause a huge explosion, razing the entire city of Springfield to the ground. However, Homer manages to save himself thanks to an old rumor known among nuclear technicians, according to which being in the exact center of an explosion guarantees a good percentage of survival. It is obviously one of the many nonsense with which the title is full, which contribute to creating that atmosphere of irony and fun typical of the series. Once left completely alone, even the lazy Homer has to roll up his sleeves to try to remedy the serious accident: thus begins at this point the real management structure, which has as its ultimate goal the reconstruction of each single destroyed building but above all the restocking of the city of all its bizarre inhabitants. Thanks to the intuitive game interface, with a single touch it is possible to indicate to Homer the objectives to be achieved, initially reduced to cleaning the area from debris and immediately starting to build your own house. Once these first works are finished, Lisa appears as if by magic, the know-it-all daughter, whose purpose is to help her father by completing the initial stages of the tutorial. Each completed construction produces income and experience, to be collected at fixed deadlines (usually a few minutes), but the construction times are the first important variant of the game. Building the Jet Market for example, with the good Apu attached, would take the beauty of 4 hours, given the high income it is able to guarantee. However, waiting so much for the continuation of the game is too uncomfortable and so, in order to speed up the times, you can use some special radioactive donuts, present in the plant at the time of the explosion. With these sweet details the construction times but also the execution of the various ~quests~ are drastically reduced, facilitating the accumulation of money and experience. The downside, however, is given by the scarcity of donuts available, therefore to be treated as a treasure; of course it is possible to buy in quantities using hard cash but just be slightly careful to avoid spending the same amount as Homer in the initial movie and still have fun. However, the parameters of the city to keep under control in The Simpsons: Springfield are many: Indolence, Consumerism, Ecologism, Vanity, Obedience, Gluttony, Righteousness and Socialism, all of which can be influenced by the type of building inserted (the more trees will increase ecologism, the more restaurants the throat and so on). Each unlocked character brings a variable number of quests, all different from each other but always connected to its particular nature; the assignments can also be carried out simultaneously, without prejudice to the time necessary to complete them. The social natureial of the EA Mobile title comes out thanks to a fun narrative trick, according to which the atomic explosion gave rise to several Springfields located on parallel universes and, even more strange, all freely visitable. The other cities would actually be those managed by friends and, once a day, can be looted for up to three rents. Thanks to the Origin platform and the connection with Facebook it will not be difficult to find any contacts in possession of the game. A last mention goes to the technical sector, absolutely faithful to the original settings of the series with well-animated characters and an excellently reproduced atmosphere; everything is obviously reduced due to the small size of the screen but the final result is still enjoyable.", "date": "2012-09-01", "grade": "8.0"}
