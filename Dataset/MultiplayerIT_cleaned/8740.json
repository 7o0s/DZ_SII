However, Nintendo 3DS has become, in a completely unexpected way, the preferred platform for fighting games on the move: Super Street Fighter first, then Dead or Alive confirmed its ~handy~ vocation, so to speak; however, the definitive consecration comes now with Tekken 3D Prime Edition. The story that doesn't exist Who in all these years has followed the events that have affected the Mishima family and the various tournaments organized, has learned to live with rather imaginative stories related to blood conflicts, betrayals, metaphysical contaminations and, to a lesser extent, even love stories. A screenplay not really well done, but which at least had the merit of creating charisma especially in some characters, precisely those of the Mishima family, around which the main events revolve. Each episode of Tekken therefore strove to carry this intricate plot forward, to provide some semblance of justification for the various encounters; in Tekken 5 first but above all in Tekken 6 real story modes were also included, in the form of dynamic adventures with fights and sketches of platform phases, but the result was certainly not positive. Tekken 3D Prime Edition does not at least formally offer any particular story to support the action: we therefore start from the very full-bodied roaster of fighters present in Tekken 6, the last ~pure~ episode released on home consoles (if we exclude the Hybrid which is basically a collection with a demo), all already available, but with a not insignificant gem. In fact, Heihachi Mishima, the ~grand old man~ who for years has ruled the fortunes of the Mishima Zaibatsu company with ups and downs, appears in this version no longer aged and white-haired but rather lively and with an elegant black goatee. It being understood that even if the old man has never been physically weak, once he has been selected with the new features, his animations during the shots appear almost even more vigorous; also, a first in the history of the franchise, in executing the traditional electric punch present in all his bloodline will scream an energetic ~Yeah~. The 3D effect Excellently done, the 3D effect in Tekken 3D Prime Edition gives the backgrounds incredible depth, especially in the new locations added for the occasion. The models stand out a little less but, as mentioned in the review, the fluidity is not affected in any case. However, the problem arises when, taken by the heat of the fight, the inevitable movements of the hands move the screen from the optimal angle, causing discomfort and in the most serious cases even eye strain and nausea. When you're serious, therefore, we recommend disabling or minimizing the 3D level. A caress in a fist When starting the game, the system allows you to import your Mii data to create your profile; just add your favorite fighter and fighting side to complete it. The available modes are the Special Survival, which is a revised and corrected version of the old Survival Mode in which you have to try to beat a certain number of opponents always increasing with the same life (5, 10, 20, 40 and 100); the Challenge, i.e. the normal online match locally or via the internet, currently unusable due to a crazy lag on the servers, and the Quick Battle, comparable to the classic Arcade mode, in which to face enemies in succession and thus gain experience levels . To these are added the indispensable training, with or without the walls, and the only real novelty referring to the new platform, i.e. the Tekken Cards. Taking advantage of the well-known Street Pass function, in fact, it is possible to exchange the cards unlocked during the game with other users, which are 765 and represent the characters in various poses, extracted from all editions of Tekken and also from the recent CG film . It must be said that perhaps some other single mode would have lengthened the gaming experience at least for less ~fanatic~ users; for the ~hardcore~ the problem is instead very marginal, since they usually spend most of their time in training looking for and trying increasingly devastating combos until they drop. The 3DS keys are freely mapped to try to meet all needs: by default, they exactly follow the settings ofi a home pad but, inevitably, not the comfort. The main problems do not come from the digital cross (preferable also for reasons of stress to the analog pad) but from the 4 action keys, very small and close together, which in the rapid movements essential to carry out the most spectacular combos can be pressed by mistake. To meet less savvy users, as in Super Street Fighter 3D, it is possible to memorize up to 4 strings, which can be recalled via the lower touchscreen. Once in the arenas, the impact with Tekken 3D Prime Edition is highly spectacular: in fact, given the necessary proportions, there is no difference with the home version in terms of gameplay. Here then is the same exaggerated tactics, the same speed necessary in ~punishing~ an open or empty move, the same masterly importance in seeing low blows and holds in time to be able to avoid them. Even the Juggles, the spectacular aerial combos that have always been synonymous with Tekken, maintain the same properties and inflict the same damage; therefore also the Rage remains when life is about to end and the Bound System, the rebound that lengthens the combos. Like all Tekken, this release also remains substantially an ~interlocking game~, in the sense that although the general balance after so many years is now generally good, some characters are better off dealing with other ~genetically similar~ ones. The members of the Mishima family for example, although they are undoubtedly the protagonists, are in fact not more advantaged than others and indeed, to use them at acceptable levels, if possible they need greater manual skills. The movie Tekken Blood Vengeance 3D On the artistic quality and the plot of this computer graphics production, we refer to what was said in the review for Tekken Hybrid. We limit ourselves here to adding that the 3DS, although excellently made, is not the ideal device for showing a feature film, due to its ergonomics and small screen. 3D twice In one of the numerous interludes involving Ono and Harada, fathers of Street Fighter and Tekken respectively, reference was made to one of the most publicized technical characteristics of Tekken 3D Prime Edition, namely the ability to maintain 60 frames per second even with the function 3D enabled, which is not possible in Street Fighter. Referring to the appropriate box the opinion on the quality of the effect, however, we can say that the goal has been incredibly achieved. In fact, the title flows smoothly with or without stereoscopy, sacrificing only a minimum of definition of the image and models with the active function. In general, therefore, an excellent result, also made possible by the slower pace of play than the competitor and by the static backgrounds (although not infrequently flames or moving characters appear in the distance). Too bad, however, the absolute lack of customization for the fighters: all the incredible collection of clothing and objects that the user has come to know from the sixth episode no longer exists here, limiting itself only to the change of color of the only two selectable costumes.", "date": "2012-02-21", "grade": "7.9"}
