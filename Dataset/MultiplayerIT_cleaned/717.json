{"name": "Call of Duty 2: Big Red One - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-2-big-red-one-recensione.html", "text": "In this new war incarnation we will not find ourselves facing multiple campaigns with soldiers of different nationalities as happened in Call of Duty, but in Big Red One we will step into the shoes of a sergeant of the First Infantry Division of the United States Army, the famous Big Red One in fact, and we will face all the missions by becoming attached to our protagonist and his fellow soldiers. The title is developed by Treyarch, and not by that Infinity Ward author of the ~main~ series; however, also in this case it remains a classic fps, a first person shooter that will describe in detail the contribution given by this department of the American infantry in the conduct of the war. The missions obviously follow an increasing level of difficulty, alternating with exciting period films taken from the Military Channel, which manage not only to make us take a breather between one level and another but also to provide useful historical notations capable of increasing the immersion in the Activision stock. It's a classic fps, a first-person shooter that will detail the contribution given by the American infantry in the Second World War In the field, our sergeant will always move surrounded by his comrades, who are truly believable in many, many scenes, not only on the battlefield but also in the introductory combat cut scenes. The emotional involvement during the battles is really good and the spirit of fighting together, side by side as brothers is quite developed in Big Red One, even if a better result could have been achieved by better delving into the relationships between the soldiers on a narrative level . In carrying out the missions we will be helped by the now famous radar, made famous by Call of Duty, which will help us to identify the objective and the checkpoint from which to start again in case of premature death in a short time and without too many useless attempts. The actions of the Big Red One have developed historically, and so also in the game, since 1942 through Africa, Italy (especially in Sicily) and Central Europe. After each mission, to underline the really well structured and cinematic Italian ones, we will find ourselves having covered several virtual kilometers running in the open field, breaking through enemy lines or assaulting German positions and structures. A small criticism that we can address to the Treyarchs is that of having explained too little the reasons that lead to the conquest of an objective, from a narrative point of view, in fact, it is not clear why one should reach that hill, destroy the anti-aircraft emplacement or conquer the city, in short, the general plans that foresee the advance of our Division are not clear. Is it just about following orders? Maybe yes. There will not only be missions on foot but, to vary the game a little, there are also those aboard heavy vehicles such as tanks, half-tracks and instead of the machine gunner on the jeeps. They are very well made even if our personal taste certainly makes us prefer the walking ones, which are much more exciting. The missions last about twenty minutes on average, they are almost all well built and with a very cinematic cut with explosions all around us, shouts, machine gun shots, it seems to be in Saving Private Ryan or in Band of Brothers the TV series of the American HBO. Technically the Activision title is really remarkable, an excellent graphics engine with a constant frame rate even in the most convulsive situations, good polygonal models managed by an A.I. absolutely believable. On the other hand, the animations which are at times woody and unnatural are a little less successful. We were struck by the very good particle effects, the absolutely realistic smoke from the grenades as well as the light effects. Of the three consoles, the one that has the advantage is the Microsoft one with a better image cleaning and a slightly more stable frame rate, followed in any case not very far by Gamecube and PlayStation 2. Apart from the Nintendo Gamecube version, both for the Sony console and an online game mode is planned for Xbox that supports up to 16 players presenting the classic modes of every self-respecting fps: deathmatch and team deathmatch, capture the flag and domination on about a dozen maps. Our tests have provided more than positive feedback for the game via Xbox Live, which runs without too many uncertainties while we had some problems with Sony's online service with too marked a delay in the signal. However, the online mode of Big Red One is certainly not the main fulcrum of the game, which expresses its full potential only played in single player, however many more things could certainly be done to make the online onemajor part of Activision stock; the lack of a system of rankings and scores linked to the skill of the contenders is greatly felt. To conclude this technical analysis we can only underline the excellent work done by the programmers to equip the game with an excellent level audio component, if exploited by a Dolby Surround 5.1 system it manages to make Call of Duty 2: Big even more exciting and intense Red One. Cross-platform As anticipated in the previous paragraphs, Call of Duty 2 Big Red One was released on all three major consoles. The version that convinced us the least was the Gamecube which unfortunately is the only one that does not have an online game mode, a defect which is however partially balanced by a technical sector very close to that of the Xbox version, which in turn has the best technical realization with an always constant frame rate. As for online gaming on both PlayStation2 and Xbox, more could certainly have been done, it is still quite fun and apart from some lag problems, felt above all on the Sony console, it is sufficient and able to give a few more hours of play. Comment We liked the title developed by Treyarch and it rightfully fits among the best first-person shooters for this generation of consoles. The Call of Duty brand has accustomed us to very good productions and this time too the goal was achieved, presenting a game that used in single player manages to give several hours of fun. If the narrative connection between the missions had been better developed and at the same time the online game had been managed better, we would be faced with a masterpiece. The online mode, on the other hand, seems to have been added at the last moment, not so much as a completion of an excellent job, but rather because, for commercial reasons, it had to be present in the game. Call of Duty 2: Big Red One remains in fact a very good title that we recommend to spend these cold December days. Pros Technically very good Well-structured missions Realistic and capable of capturing the player Cons Some small narrative flaws Online game present but underdeveloped Activision is becoming increasingly adept at recounting the events of WWII, has developed over the years the ability to immerse us, if only virtually, in the mud of French territories and North African sands side by side with our fellow soldiers. Call of Duty was the game that started this great trend, and now history repeats itself with Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, out now on Xbox PlayStation 2 and Gamecube, not to be confused with Call of Duty 2 instead released only for Personal Computers and the new generation console from Microsoft, the new Xbox 360.", "date": "2005-12-06", "grade": null}
