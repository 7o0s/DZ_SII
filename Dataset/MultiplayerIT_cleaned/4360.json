These are elements that necessarily force these titles to remain confined to a niche, because they are substantially opposed to accepting the variations imposed by the evolution of the market and by the shifts in taste of the mass public, which also represents a strong point for keeping their charm intact. . What can be done in these cases is therefore to act on secondary elements of the typical mechanics and introduce some innovative concept, something that marks a certain discontinuity with the past while maintaining the roots firmly anchored to the classic canons. If the operation succeeds, the resulting game has what it takes to be very interesting and this is precisely the case of Steredenn: Binary Stars, a 2D scrolling shooter developed by Pixelnest Studio and already released a couple of years ago. years on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One but only now arrived on Switch, in a conversion that probably also represents its maximum expression. The Nintendo console has already proven to add a certain magic to many indie titles, if only to how pixel art tends to look on that screen, but it's the introduction of co-op mode with the two detachable Joy-Cons that makes this Binary Stars version undoubtedly superior to the original. Random universe The new idea around which Steredenn: Binary Stars was built is the procedural creation of levels, which makes each game different and thus substantially modifies the characteristic immutability of the waves and attack patterns of enemies and bosses of classic shooters by introducing the 'random element. Each game starts in exactly the same way, with our mothership being destroyed by an alien attack and the classic shuttle that finds itself alone to support the attacks of huge amounts of enemies, but the arrangement of the latter and of the asteroids, the their attack patterns and the events we encounter change every time. The levels thus always appear different in terms of rhythm and content while keeping the scenarios unchanged, to tell the truth rather simple and not very characterized. The level of difficulty, as per the tradition of the genre, is decidedly high and this determines a structural problem linked to the introduction of the procedural character: shmup is in fact a game usually based on experience, where the most expert players win because they are able to know or predict the attacks of the enemies and the strategies to adopt, as well as having a particular quickness of reflexes. This element is lost with a random construction of events and it was therefore necessary to replace it with another solution: the second particular introduction in Steredenn is the persistent expansion of the capabilities of the shuttle and the player, game after game. In this sense, the game looks like a sort of roguelike, with the need to always have to re-face the challenge from the beginning as soon as the energy reaches zero but with new abilities that are discovered with each game and the possibility of choosing new upgraded ships if you reach certain goals set in the previous game. To support such a structure, Steredenn must have short levels that can encourage you to start from scratch without being excessively penalizing, and in this sense it works very well also thanks to the portable context, which stimulates short and excited matches and tends not to tire that much . Space flares The general simplicity of the graphics, detailed and also endowed with a certain character but not particularly rich, also makes the action on the screen rather clear, which is decidedly important in a game that often turns into bullet hell, or has attacks whose Extreme speed reading becomes necessary for survival. The fact that the sense of fluidity is never entirely convincing is somewhat jarring, given that in such a game one could perhaps have aimed for 60 frames per second, an objective that does not really seem to be achieved, but the action remains always perfectly manageable, obviously within the limits of the player's abilities. The action is constantly accompanied by a soundtrack perfectly suited to the role, with hard rock guitars that bring back the atmosphere of Thunderforce, makinggive due proportions. In the face of a good amount of enemies and a really wide variety of weapons and upgrades that can be conquered on the field, the boss fights (excluding the last ones) seem rather anonymous. These are very challenging moments also due to the random patterns, but we are quite far from certain iconic bosses of famous series such as R-Type and the like. The need to maintain excellent performance throughout the game is not only linked to the search for the high score: the points multiplier, which increases with the destruction of enemies and eventually resets if we suffer hits, also allows us to expand the power and the range of weapons, thus resulting in an indispensable element to advance through the levels and becoming an integral part of the gameplay. Finally, a special mention for the cooperative mode present in this Switch version: the simplicity with which it is possible to set up a multiplayer simply by sharing the two Joy-Con and what is known, and this game option is particularly enjoyable in Steredenn: Binary Stars, with the particular idea of the energy bar shared by both players which makes the action even more cohesive and collaborative, proposing an excellent alternative to the standard mode.", "date": "2018-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
