{"name": "Rock'n'Blocks", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rocknblocks.html", "text": "Rock'n'Blocks starts from an interesting and quite original premise: creating a puzzle game within the world of emerging rock bands, in a sort of challenge between musical notes, guitar riffs and colored squares. Although the graphic style seems to be inspired a little too much by the blockbuster Guitar Hero released for Ps2 and Xbox 360, you can pass over it without too much difficulty. The game structure of the main mode, called ~arcade~, sees the player cross various cities in the United States, from Las Vegas to New York, in an attempt to bring his band to success starting from the stages of small clubs and reaching sign a prestigious record deal. To obtain this result, however, it is not required to know how to play an instrument, but rather to have a good skill and confidence with the keyboard of one's mobile phone. Rock'n'Blocks is in fact, as already mentioned, a puzzle game based on colored blocks; depending on the various levels of the game, these can appear from above or below or simultaneously, or even from the sides, but these are simple variations on a common theme, namely the need to eliminate a pre-established quantity such as to allow the proposed challenge. The interaction with the blocks takes place through a pointer, to be moved freely within the screen; pressing it on a series of at least 3 squares of the same color you get the explosion of the same. Obviously there is the possibility of creating larger blocks by combining the smaller ones in regular symmetrical shapes, in order to get more points. At the same time, bonuses capable of eliminating an entire row, or rather all the blocks of a color and so on, may appear; the picture finally closes a bar to be filled to unleash a ~riff~ capable of eliminating most of what is present on the screen in one fell swoop. The description up to this point of the review therefore draws the picture of a well-finished product; also from a technical point of view Rock'n'Blocks is a pleasant product, well designed and full of details. The sound component also boasts the presence, in the tracklist, of the popular ~Banquet~ by Bloc Party, albeit in a resized version to adapt to the capabilities of less technologically advanced terminals. Unfortunately, however, the Gameloft production does not take off in its fundamental aspect, that is the pure and simple gameplay; the mechanics studied by the programmers, in addition to being rather trivial, proves to be far too simple and unable to give particular stimuli. More than on the strategic component and on reflection, Rock'n'Blocks is in fact based on the speed in moving the pointer over the groups of blocks, thus revealing itself as an exercise that is quite an end in itself and which leaves the time it finds. To be clear, the Gameloft game fails to trigger that spring of the great puzzle games, that mechanism that pushes the player to go back to the screen to improve and pass the levels. And without this component, the result certainly cannot be brilliant.
