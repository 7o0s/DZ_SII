{"name": "Let's Sing 2019", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lets-sing-2019-recensione-karaoke.html", "text": "The life of the human being is marked by some almost ritual events, which recur after a more or less fixed period of time: let's think of the role of Sunday within the week for example, or of holidays such as Christmas. Something very similar also concerns the world of video games and consoles: can there possibly be a year in which titles such as Just Dance 2019 or Let's Sing 2019 do not appear again around October and November? In the face of often very insignificant variations and a novelty factor that is often completely absent, these are games that people continue to buy, to place under the Christmas tree, and to use to have fun with family and friends friends: it must mean something. And we too have something to say, in our review of Let's Sing 2019: what does the new annual chapter of the series offer players again? Content and game modes This year Let's Sing 2019 has decided to take a clean and minimalist path very similar to the one we have already told you about in the Just Dance 2019 review, not only from the point of view of the main game menu but also from that of the submenus. Just start the application and everything is ready, a few windows illustrate the main game modes and have also been ordered hierarchically according to their importance: for example, the banner dedicated to creating your own profile is smaller, just as small are those of Nintendo eShop and settings. Just the menu dedicated to the Nintendo eShop, present in the version of Let's Sing 2019 for Nintendo Switch obviously, underlines one of the most evident shortcomings of the entire production: that of a full-bodied and interesting service like Just Dance Unlimited, which offers access to a huge number of songs for the price of a monthly fee. If the 40 songs of Let's Sing 2019 are tight for you, unfortunately there are no subscriptions of any kind or particularly substantial packages: the game sends you back to the store of the respective console and asks you to buy a certain number of new songs for small sums, but come on content certainly not exciting. Given this possibility of only partial expansion of game content, Let's Sing 2019 naturally leverages its four main game modes: they are called respectively Classic, Feat., Mixtape and Juke Box, all strictly in English because it is not just one of the languages most used in the world, but also the one that is most fashionable in all contexts (especially in youth). However, don't expect who knows what innovations from the point of view of the gameplay, and moreover in all probability you will not be approaching a traditionalist series like that of Let's Sing to find just this: the Classic mode is precisely the standard karaoke, where you can perform as a skilled singer alone or with friends; Feat. requires a couple of players to sing together and to do it with great accuracy, because the score will increase according to the singing synchronicity between the partners; Mixtape allows you to select your five favorite songs and play them one after the other; finally, the Juke Box is designed to... listen to the forty songs featured in Let's Sing 2019 by connecting a pair of headphones to the Nintendo Switch. Yes exactly, it's not a game mode, but a simple service for playing the content and music videos featured in the title. Gameplay: a very peculiar online Let's Sing 2019 for the moment seems to have resisted the social drift of recent years quite well: personalization is important, but up to a certain point, while content sharing seems to be completely absent; maybe it's a good thing, at least within a title that expressly requires a group of people to meet in the same room to let loose in the most classic of karaoke. An online mode is present and it is called Let's Sing World Contest: it allows you to face other players on the net and thus climb the rankings, but it has been managed in a very particular way. It almost seems counterintuitive, but the online mode of Let's Sing 2019 is asynchronous: it means that, although you probably have the impression, you are not really playing with other people at the same time, but against the registration and against the scores that other people they got previously singing the same song. Deciding to manage the online sector of the title in a similar way on the one hand is very curious, on the other it could be the result of a precise strategy: that of not ruining the general accuracy of the local game mode. Let's Sing 2019 is in fact very precise in detecting not only the correctness of the wordsthe pronounced by the skilled singers, but also tone and timbre of voice, so much so that an indicator on the screen will signal in real time if we are exaggerating with acute or more serious sounds, redirecting us instead towards what should be the main melody. It will not always be easy to manage all these indications in an optimal way, also because the words to be pronounced on the screen scroll very quickly and the singers present in the recorded videos do not give anyone any discounts; moreover, all the songs present are strictly in English. It couldn't be otherwise, because it would be impossible to translate Bruno Mars' Finesse or ABBA's Mamma mia into Italian without distorting the respective artistic work, but surely the introduction of some current or at least recent song, even from our country, would not be sorry. But no, they aren't there, and they can't even be bought from the shop by spending additional amounts. Gaming tools: microphone and smartphone If you are wondering ~can I play Let's Sing 2019 holding a real microphone and singing at the top of my lungs?~ the answer is: yes, as long as you buy the version of the title that includes the practical USB microphone or you own a compatible one, for example the one from the previous chapter of the series. On the other hand, the microphone is a distinctive object of Let's Sing 2019, but not exclusive: a bit like it already happens in the latest titles in the Just Dance series and in the PlayStation 4 PlayLink line, the developers have thought well that in the pockets of buyers you are much more likely to find a smartphone instead of a USB microphone. For this reason, you can also play Let's Sing 2019 by downloading the appropriate App from your Android or iOS store, and then configuring it appropriately so that it is connected to the same WiFi network as the console and (more importantly) is able to recognize your voice; this last aspect actually seemed to us the least precise of the entire production, but probably here the performances change depending on the operating system, the possession of a more or less recent smartphone, and many other unpredictable factors, not least the game environment.", "date": "2018-12-09", "grade": "6.5"}
