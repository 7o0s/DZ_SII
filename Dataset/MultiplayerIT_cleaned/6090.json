{"name": "Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomorrow-children-phoenix-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Publishing a video game inevitably means encountering a certain number of difficulties; difficulties that must be carefully faced and overcome, to avoid complete disaster. Tomorrow Children was faced with problems of this kind. Born as an exclusive PlayStation 4 in the now distant 2016, it was practically ignored by the public, so much so that the servers were even shut down a few months later. Which meant clinical death, given that it was not possible to enjoy everything in any other way, except online; it doesn't matter that you could then in practice, albeit with varying difficulties, play alone. Years later, however, you find yourself grappling with the review of Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition. What happened? First of all, the developers of Q-Games have recovered the rights from Sony, an essential step to get back on the market. Then they restarted the servers and also updated a little content, gameplay and game settings, without distorting the offer, but refining it. Surprisingly, nothing has changed from the point of view of the platforms: Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition is in fact back available on PlayStation 4 and, in backwards compatibility, on PlayStation 5; we have had the opportunity to spend many hours in its disturbing worlds right on the new generation console. We then return to the Void, in search of resources and Matryoshka dolls: the community needs the help of every single citizen to thrive. If Soviet-like nightmares don't scare you, then read on. The gameplay: resources and cooperation Explaining the gameplay of Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition is basically not too difficult an undertaking, even considering that all in all it has remained substantially unchanged from 2016 to today. Our world, due to a disastrous experiment that fused the consciousness of all human beings, no longer exists. In its place lies an immense void (the Void) where from time to time, in addition to threatening monsters, islands full of resources appear that are useful for rebuilding civilization. This is the task entrusted to us by a creepy and despotic boss of the new state, the only one in existence, which in all respects resembles, well, Stalin's Russia. The dystopian atmosphere and context are certainly two of the points in favor of the charm of Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition, today as then. Let's go back to the game modes: the protagonist, a matryoshka doll, is given the task of contributing to the reconstruction of civil society. To do this, he will have to explore the Void collecting resources, resources and more resources, in a very similar way to the one seen in the most famous sandboxes on the market, from Minecraft to Dragon Quest Builders. The unmistakable style of Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition All you need to do is pick up an ice ax, a shovel, if you want a chainsaw, and get at it with the natural (or it would be better to say unnatural, in the disturbing post-human world) elements. Everything will be brought back to the base, our main city, and used to build new buildings and upgrade existing ones; the Government will help reward us with a number of useful tools. Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition is designed to be even more of a shared experience, and in truth to fully enjoy it you need a PlayStation Plus subscription, even better a few friends willing to join the game to keep us company. Because in two (or three, and so on) you earn even more objects, you enhance everything more easily, you defend yourself from the adversities of the void. The big news of Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition, however, is the introduction of an offline game mode, i.e. in solitaire: when necessary, you will thus be joined by another matryoshka controlled by artificial intelligence. It is not the same thing, of course, but in this way anyone will be able to at least try their own adventure. And then, you don't risk losing all the experience again due to sudden server shutdowns. Tomorrow Children six years later: some news Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition: the watchword is ~sharing~ Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition is now being offered at a price of forty euros, which is certainly not a small amount for an independent production; meanwhile, over the years, it has received a whole series of optimizations, of which we are about to provide you with a detailed report. However, all this requires a premise: do not think that Q-Games has rethought the video game from scratch. Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition today is what you already know, or what you knew, net of small, targeted interventions. Which do not alter the overall experience or remedy the weaknesses we highlighted in the review of the original Tomorrow Children: keep this in mind. The slowness, the rigidity of the gameplay, the constant sense of disorientation and the only partial satisfactions for hours and hours of play are still here, unfortunately. So let's move on to the news of the case. First of all, instead of leaving the player grappling with an incomprehensible world, Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition now presents a series of targeted tutorials, accompanied by explanatory videos; the situation has certainly improved, however the progression remains quite obscure and there will be several cases in which you will find yourself asking yourself ~okay, but now what exactly should I do?~ Similar speech for the presence of an element that should enrich the offer in terms of content, that is for the Monoliths. The islands in Tomorrow Children: Phoenix Edition can be very, very dangerous By interacting with these objects it will be possible to partially alter the islands being explored, modifying their appearance, resources and rewards; some Monoliths are activated only and exclusively by the interaction of a certain number of players at the same time, an aspect that would like to encourage online multiplayer. But everything, in fact, is limited to this: the rest of the exploration in general, obsessed with the accumulation of resources, remains tedious and unsatisfactory, even in the presence of about forty different islands. The introduction of the grappling hook would like to make the sessions more immediate and rapid gameplay, at least in the ~vertical~ approach to the places to explore; but it is easily understandable how changes of this type are unable to resurrect a six-year-old game, whose problems were (and remain) if ever structural, linked to the use and progression of the experience. In fact, perhaps the real novelty consists in the aforementioned possibility of offline play, a real chimera of the first publication on PlayStation 4.", "date": "2022-09-11", "grade": "6.2"}
