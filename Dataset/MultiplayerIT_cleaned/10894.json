{"name": "Eternal Sonata - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eternal-sonata-recensione_a.html", "text": "Eternal Sonata was one of the first Japanese Role Playing Games available on Xbox 360: originally titled Trusty Bell in Japan, the game developed by Tri-Crescendo on behalf of Namco Bandai has carved out a small niche of admirers, proposing a very classic (which winks at the Tales series, also by Namco Bandai) but a plot and a series of ideas, playful and narrative, extremely original. A couple of years later, Eternal Sonata also lands on PlayStation 3: this version has various additions, such as exclusive areas to explore and two extra characters (Crescendo and Serenade) to use in combat. And the title still maintains its splendid charisma. Based on a true story...? The idea behind the plot of Eternal Sonata is probably one of the most original ever exploited in the videogame field. The whole game revolves around the last dreams of Frdric Chopin, famous Polish composer and one of the greatest pianists of all time: on his deathbed, Chopin dreams of a fantastic and fairy-tale world where he finds himself reluctantly involved in a battle against forces of evil personified in the figure of the dictator Waltz, joined in his journey to save the world by bizarre allies, including the sweet Polka. Between chapters of the story, the player is introduced to some of Chopin's most significant real-life moments, which more or less covertly connect to the events and characters of the dream world. The story of Eternal Sonata is rather linear but does not disdain numerous twists and turns, the idea is genuinely original and real events are manipulated and translated into the fantasy world in an ingenious and sensitive way. At the same time, the player is practically brought to know the life and works of this extraordinary artist, in a bizarre union between video game and culture. Not just music Despite its two years of age, Eternal Sonata is still today one of the most graphically elaborated productions for the new console market. The praises mostly focus on the attention paid by the Tri-Crescendo artists to details: the garments, for example, in addition to being original and of rare elegance, are enriched by frills and friezes, just as the settings are extremely rich in details, in especially the interiors, while remaining fairly traditional in the context of fantasy adventures. The cel-shaded style and delicate pastel coloring make each screen of Eternal Sonata almost a painting, making the experience decidedly fairytale. It is therefore a pity that the graphics engine does not allow free rotation of the camera to admire the various locations. To enrich the technical sector we think not only the sublime pieces of Chopin, but also the excellent soundtrack composed by Motoi Sakuraba; it must be said that the traces of the Japanese artist are much more frequent during the adventure, but the composition respects the style of the historic Polish composer, thus maintaining a remarkable musical coherence. Tales of Chopin As per tradition, a large part of the adventure consists of fighting against creatures of all kinds, visible during exploration: a contact between Chopin and the creature will trigger the usual loading and screen change, transporting us directly to the battlefield. The Eternal Sonata battle-system is inspired by that of the Tales series, also by Namco Bandai, with some variations that underline a certain personality. In Eternal Sonata the player takes control of one party member at a time, who will have a certain amount of energy available to be able to move, use objects, attack or cast spells. As the level increases and the adventure progresses, the available energy tends to decrease, making the player's choices more complex and tactical, effectively increasing the difficulty of the clashes. Another crucial element during the battles also consists in the shaded areas: the position of a character, in fact, decrees the skills that he will be able to use, which change precisely if you are in the light or in the shade. The same goes for enemies: it therefore becomes increasingly strategic even to move on the battlefield, taking advantage of the shadows cast by the environment and by the enemies themselves, in order to use the right skills at the right time. The combat system is extremely simple to master, in line with the general ease of the adventure: the more or less arduous clashes are in fact the real challenge of the game, which does not offer any riddles or puzzles, or fine exploration phases to themselves. Eternal Sonata is a decidedly linear JRPG throughout its length, one characteristic that could make lovers of wider-ranging adventures turn up their noses, but which in no way detracts from the epic delicacy of Chopin's adventure. Comment With two playable characters, new story sequences and some new locations to explore, the conversion of Eternal Sonata for PlayStation 3 partially fills the gap of JRPGs in the toy library of the Sony console. Namco Bandai's game is one of the most refined and pleasant products on the market, characterized by truly courageous and commendable narrative choices and a respectable technical realization. It's not particularly difficult, it's extremely linear and there are very few extra contents, but it's a really different adventure than usual, a must for fans of the genre. Pros Very original and delicate story Technically splendid Ingenious combat system Cons Extremely linear Rather simple Few extra contents", "date": "2009-02-05", "grade": null}
