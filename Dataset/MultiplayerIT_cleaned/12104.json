{"name": "Metroid Prime Pinball - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metroid-prime-pinball-recensione.html", "text": "Rolling on Tallon IV Expertly developed by Fuse Games, Metroid Prime Pinball looks, at least in part, like a sui generis pinball machine. The tables, which commendably reflect the settings present in the first Metroid for Gamecube, are in fact not exactly traditional. In addition to the classic ramps, the inevitable buffers and the essential levers, there are various external factors that can intervene and influence the motion of the ball. Trimastids, beetles, space pirates and the same metroids during the game can materialize on the table with the ultimate aim of interfering with the morphosphere, grabbing it and spitting it away, blocking it, hitting it with rockets and so on. All this makes the player's action more complicated and less predictable, but certainly more fun and frenetic than a classic pinball machine. Another thing to take into consideration is the fact that the ball can be lost not only by falling into the space between the two levers or in the side lanes, but also when, repeatedly hit by the aforementioned enemy attacks, it ends up running out of energy it has. To help the morphosphere come energy power-ups for restoration, and the well-known triplet of bombs to be dropped on the table with the right timing to take out enemies. As in every metroid, missiles and gigabombs cannot be missing, collectible only in the boss tables and usable mainly against them. MPP in the 'multimission' mode requires the player to play the tables in sequence. The first choice is bound to the two tables that we will define as standard: one is set on the Frigate of the Pirates, the other on the Tallon Surface. The aim of the game is to collect the Chozo artifacts that will be given once the various tests that the table offers are successfully completed. For example, hitting a dozen insects scattered on the table, or walking a ramp three times in rows to activate a special bonus, and so on without forgetting the multiball breakers, useful for increasing the score with Jackpot shots. Once you have collected a minimum number of artifacts it will be possible to use the teleporter to catapult yourself to one of two boss tables: Phendrana and Phazon Mines. These tables are less convoluted than the previous two. On top a large empty area welcomes the already known bosses Thaedus and Omega Pirate. The aim of the table is to knock them down by hitting them repeatedly, take the artifact and go to another of the four tables. At this rate up to the twelfth artifact collected, which allows you to access the fifth table, the Temple of Seals, and from this to the last one, the Impact Crater, where you face the final boss. Pinball Fever As you may have noticed MPP faithfully retraces the glorious footsteps of Metroid Prime, it almost represents a tribute to it. As an alternative to the multi-mission mode just described, it is possible to play the classic single game in one of the tables; in the standard ones you go in search of the record score, while in those with the Boss the hunt will be for the KO in the shortest possible time. There is also a multiplayer mode (only in local Wi-Fi) on a bonus table. It should be noted that the game package also includes the RumblePak, an optional to be inserted in the GBA cartridge slot, in order to enjoy a very light and negligible vibration. Summing up, the title is well done and does not suffer from particular defects. The two screens of the DS are dedicated to displaying the two portions of the pinball machine, and the absence of scrolling benefits the visibility and clarity of the action. The motion of the ball proves to be quite credible even in the most agitated situations. The control layout is the simplest imaginable, with the exception of the precious 'tilt', i.e. that tap given with sly mastery, which allows you to save a ball otherwise destined to be lost; the tilt is performed by touching the touch-screen in the desired direction, a maneuver in our opinion a bit awkward unless you abandon control from one of the two levers for an instant. But the pinball machine is made up of moments and losing one can be fatal. Comment Metroid Prime Pinball is a well-made title, well characterized and faithful to the themes of Metroid. The technical realization is satisfactory, both graphically and in terms of music and sound effects. A few more standard tables wouldn't have hurt, since the boss tables, so simplified in design, are not as enjoyable as the others. Completing the main mode is not a difficult task. From that moment on, the main purpose of every pinball machine takes over: the frantic search for the maximum score. If that's what you're looking for, drop by.

The beautiful Samus allowed herself at most a couple of appearances as a co-protagonist in that shaken and multicolored cauldron that responds to the name of Smash Bros. For the rest she has always been faithful to her role as a bounty hunter within action titles -adventure, two-or-three days that they were. Until, curled up in the glittering morphosphere, she decided to give in to the court of a pinball machine and get tossed around with the ultimate goal of adding points, points and more points.", "date": "2007-07-24", "grade": null}
