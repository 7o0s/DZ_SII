This title can almost be defined as a sort of Luigi's Mansion without the ghosts, and not just because the weapons used by the two (later three) protagonists look a lot like the Poltergust 3000, the modified vacuum cleaner used by Mario's brother to capture spirits. Even the mechanics remember, and a lot, that game for GCN. Basically the gameplay is very simple and consists mainly in hunting the rabbits (and their allies) before they destroy the vegetables. In the role of Wallace, Gromit or Hutch (a good friend of their rabbit), we will have to capture the rodents and close the holes in the ground from which they emerge in order to prevent other creatures from using them to get out. We can also collect the vegetables to hide them before they get into the hands of the rabbits. However, by shooting down enemies while they are stunned, it is possible to acquire useful items. The two controlled characters are present on the screen at the same time, and at any time it is possible to switch from one to the other with a simple switch. In fact, their collaboration is often necessary to flush out the most tenacious invaders, perhaps by exploiting the skills of one rather than the other in certain areas. Furthermore, to vary the playability a little and offer a slightly more valid longevity, Frontier Developments wanted to insert some typically adventure elements into the game, such as interacting verbally with other non-player PCs to collect information or useful objects to continue the story . But be careful: even if talking to fellow villagers proves to be quite useful, you will never run the risk of getting stuck due to some uncollected news. If anything, you will only miss the opportunity to raise money since sometimes some of the inhabitants of the city offer you the possibility of being hired to disinfect their buildings for a fee. The technical realization is so-so. The game does not appear very fluid, although it does not have too elaborate graphics that weigh down the CPU. The 3D models of the characters are perfect as they faithfully reproduce those seen at the cinema made of plasticine. But precisely for this reason they appear stylistically simple, not very detailed. Ditto for the scenarios, even if a good management of the lighting effects creates a rather satisfying visual contrast of colors. The bestiary, on the other hand, is quite varied with its squirrels, its weasels, and so on and so forth, and the areas to explore and clean up, sufficiently numerous and varied. In short, an aesthetic sector without infamy and without praise. The audio is also on the same level. For example, the music that will accompany you during the adventure is not very exciting, but all in all it does its job, as well as the sound effects. On the other hand, the dialogues that reflect, and well, the irony that pervades the film from which the game was taken are improved. Cross-platform Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is also available for Xbox. Compared to the Ps2 version, the game appears slightly more fluid and with better graphics, especially for the lighting effects. Otherwise the two versions appear globally similar. Conclusions Wallace & Gromit is not a particularly innovative or highly appealing game. Although it faithfully captures the aesthetic style of the film of the same name and the humorous spirit of the film, it appears practically similar to the previous Wallace & Gromit: Frontier Zoo. The latest work by Frontier Developments is a product intended for a very young audience, given its simplistic game mechanics and characters, or to die-hard fans of the ~dynamic duo~ created with clay, who might appreciate it a priori. Pros: Good rendition of the spirit of the film of the same name. Nice characters. Fun. Cons: Very simple gameplay. Intended for a very young audience. In the neighborhood where Wallace, a nice little bald man, and his close friend, the dog Gromit, live, vegetarian craze has broken out. In fact, all the inhabitants of the area have been eating only vegetables for some time. So, given the high consumption of vegetables and the like, and the consequent need to plant and cultivate these vegetables, our two friends get busy, and invent a product to eliminate the risk of parasites and cure plants, called ~ Anti-pest~ which allows him to do excellent business. In fact, everyone wants to use it as it does not pollute or damage crops. But when everything seems to be going right, Wallace and Gromit realize that the product they invented has contraindications.extremely negative ions: in fact, it generates mutations in some animals and creates the first wererabbit in history", "date": "2006-01-10", "grade": null}
