{"name": "Spy Hunter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spy-hunter_a.html", "text": "As in the arcade version, Spy Hunter is also a game that focuses entirely on the immediacy of the controls without leaving any room for simulation. It is a game that allows you to pick up the joypad without thinking too much. Leaving aside the history of the game, which you can easily find in our preview, let's analyze the actual game. As in the original, we'll have to drive by shooting everything that moves and we'll have to avoid the bad guys who will try to kill us at all costs. The move from 2-D to 3-D has given the title in question greater depth and sharper definition. During the internships there will be crossroads to go through to reach the goal, the path will not be linear but will offer us various detours and pitfalls that will slow down our run. Our travel companion will be the stupendous (it's a car, I know!!|) G-6155 Interceptor, which amazes for its aesthetics and maneuverability: depending on the terrain, the machine will transform itself, allowing us to overcome impossible obstacles. For example, to overcome the aquatic sections, our super-car will transform into a hyper-technological boat that will allow us to continue traveling on water as well. But that's not all: when the car takes too much damage, it will drop the broken metal and will open in half, transforming into a very fast street bike. Understand well, however, that the resistance of the motorcycle will decrease while the car will gain speed and maneuverability. The missions at the beginning are very simple and allow you to familiarize yourself with the game's controls; as you progress in the adventure, things get more complicated: you will have to follow people, find locations and hidden objects. The clashes during the races are well done and the opposing cars look like something out of the classic spy movies of the past years; they will be able to make your life truly impossible by trying to ram you and throw you off the road at any cost. During the missions, there will be cutscenes that will illustrate the story and the evolution of the plot, even if the realization is not flawless and the scenes are very anonymous. The style of the game is well cared for and deep, but it's a quality that doesn't really suit an arcade game: playability is what counts! But the first impression wasn't entirely positive: I was able to notice that the maneuverability of the vehicles didn't change much every time I used a different vehicle; driving the motorcycle or the ship was often identical both in driving style and in response to commands. The graphics are well done but don't make a miracle cry, the cars are detailed even if they don't seriously impress. Sure, it's more defined than the PS2 version, but it doesn't express the full power of the Microsoft machine. The framerate is stable even if sometimes there is some minimal slowdown when there are many sprites on the screen. Without a doubt on the longevity front there is a commitment that is not excellent; in fact the first missions flew away in the blink of an eye and the others too, with a minimum of effort and concentration, slipped away without great difficulty. Furthermore, replayability is at minimum levels: the bonuses available, unless he has made some mistakes, are not enough by themselves to push the player to take the title back in hand. You will not have time to get attached to the plot that you will already have to abandon it, and maybe you will play another game just to try the two-player clash mode which in any case does not prove to be an extra in all respects. The beauty of the game comes from the espionage-style feeling and setting and the immediacy of the arcade genre, but despite everything the only addition compared to the PS2 version remains the inclusion of the original version of the game. The music and the sound, in general, are of good quality and the soundtrack of this title is an element pleasantly taken from the original version of the 80s. Very often you will turn up the volume to enjoy magnificent sound effects worthy of the best titles I remember , but other times it will happen to eliminate the sound that is too pressing and that in the long run can get boring. In conclusion I can say that the foundations of an excellent game are all there; overall, however, the ideas have been exploited in a superficial way and I don't think this depends on the hardware of the machine, also because we have seen what the Microsoft home console is capable of. Pros: Lots of tracks to experiment with Decent sound effects Very simple gameplay Cons: Low longevity Some missions are repetitive The graphics don't take full advantage of the potential of XBox Materials: Screenshots Preview In my life, I've wasted a lot of moneyi in the smoky arcades of my country, sometimes money well spent, other times not. However, I am proud that I skipped school (proud is a strong word) because I was able to try those wonderful cabinets that I still miss today. Spy Hunter, however, is not one of my memories. In fact, I've never had the pleasure of playing even the slightest game with it. Midway, aware of being able to make retro-gaming players happy who had missed that fantastic game, decided to insert the original arcade that was in the arcade into the Xbox version. Now you understand my happiness and the desire to review a new-looking title but with well-grafted roots in the Olympus of video games.", "date": "2002-07-23", "grade": null}
