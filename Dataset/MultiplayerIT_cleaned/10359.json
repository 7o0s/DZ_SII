With this C.O.P. The Recruit Ubisoft has clearly tried to take the standards of success of the genre and translate them into a Nintendo portable title that could have been a valid proposition on a console that certainly cannot boast a vast choice of free roaming footprint in its library cops and robbers. As much as we have tried to keep the comparison with the aforementioned GTA away from our minds, we must recognize that the analogies that Ubisoft has inserted in its title are many and such as to prevent us from keeping it completely out of our critical sensitivity, and this certainly does not weigh in favor of the game that has not been able to capitalize on the experience brought to the screen by its illustrious predecessor. But why? This is a question that we asked ourselves several times during the course of the game, both in terms of stylistic and technical choices. The first question is inherent in the choice to develop a title with free-roaming ambitions in 3D on a console like the DS. The result in terms of style is not very pleasing to the eye, the character design, as well as that of the environments and cars are squared and rigid, as on the other hand the hardware forces you to do. All this despite the fact that the graphics engine proves effective in putting the DS to the whip both for polygons on the screen and for the fluidity of the action. The impact is therefore certainly not the best and does not help to immerse yourself in a climate of involvement with the character and with the events, which fortunately are however interspersed with comic-style narrative scenes that raise the visual quality of the Opera. But beyond the stylistic choices, the real reason, to which we have not been able to give an answer, lies in the plot of the game. The protagonist, a certain Dan Miles, that we will have to interpret and manage, is anything but the prototype of the good cop fighting against the bad criminal, on the contrary: he is a clandestine pilot, a kind of ~need for speeder~, speeding around the city at 160 kilometers per hour. Until (rightly) he is arrested and placed in a position not to mow down grannies and prams anymore. The strange thing is that he is offered an aut aut a tad bit unusual: spend the rest of his life in prison or be recruited into the police force. An assignment that he takes very seriously, so much so that the first action of the tutorial plans to steal the car from the neighbor to reach the police station. It might seem like a minor inconsistency, and the plot will unfold going forward explaining many things about the events we see on the screen, but everything is marked by inconsistency and superficiality that make it impossible to enjoy some identification or at least to develop interest in the course of the events. It goes on in a mechanical way, without knowing why. And without the desire to understand it igniting in us, this is because we surrender to the go-drive-shoot brute that seems to be the pure and simple leitmotif of the game. The violent arm of the law The game controls are pretty basic. With the Dpad we move Dan, the car is driven with B to accelerate and A to brake, Y sets the handbrake. The driving management, absolutely elementary as regards the command of the machine itself, deserves a mention. One of the negativities of the game is in fact the sphere of possible actions with the car: if we hit a pedestrian, he will let out an indignant yell but, apart from passing through him, nothing bad will happen to him. And also for the other cars everything is resolved in a ~poof~. If we hit them enough to damage them to the breaking point they will produce a short explosion to instantly vanish from the screen, as if they never existed. Chase missions consist of exactly that: run after the auto-target, bump into it a certain number of times, and blow it up. ~Puff~, the car is gone, the mission is accomplished. Rudimentary, certainly devoid of any satisfaction. To shoot, select the weapon in the right corner of the touchscreen, an action that will cause the camera to move directly behind our character's shoulder. As in the case of the car, if we shoot passers-by we only get them indignant. No one dies, except the really bad bad guys. Which in turn, once dead, leave only a memory. The aim management system rests on the nib that we need to direct the puntator by swiping on the screen and on the backbone to shoot. Alternatively, you can configure the game to double-click the stylus directly on the touchscreen, rather than using the backbone. Everything is apparently easy to use, but extremely slow. In the case of multiple enemies, being able to turn around in time to target the other is as long as a coffee break. Well, not so much, but certainly in the perception it is rather frustrating, it would have been enough to speed up the movement a little or implement a quick turnaround system to mitigate the problem. Elementary commands that on the one hand make managing the game really easy, on the other hand are very limiting for the enjoyment of the gameplay. To protect and serve And that's how we go around the city, possibly stealing the first cars we find, in the role of a new law enforcer with high hopes. On the radio we will be notified of any new missions along the way, allowing us to never remain idle as we proceed with the development of the main mission line. To give a little variety to the game, whose main cornerstone remains shooting and driving sections (with at least questionable GPS management), there are a series of variants that also include stealth missions. Among other things, the insertion of cameras in panoramic points along the way that will allow us to collect specific photographs give a sense of additional objectives that at least enrich the gaming experience a little. It remains to be asked why a criminal policeman stops from time to time to capture glimpses of the city, but it is another question to which there seems to be no noteworthy answer. At the end of the day, the main flaw of C.O.P. The Recruit, beyond the technical and stylistic choices, seems to be precisely the absence of a charisma, of a character of its own that manages to lift it from a general flatness that it absolutely fails to fall in love with.", "date": "2009-11-26", "grade": "4.6"}
