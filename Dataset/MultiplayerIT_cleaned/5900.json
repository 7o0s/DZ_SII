Let's find out if this change of perspective has borne fruit... Small new world Without getting lost in narrative ambitions, Rise of Heroes simply puts the user in charge of a handful of heroes (initially only two) committed to tackling a wide variety of missions divided between ten different scenarios. The initial tutorial phase immediately makes it clear that the heart of the gameplay lies more in the party organization screen than on the actual battlefield: by simply touching the various menus, it is possible to choose which warriors to put into formation, upgrade their skills, buy and assign new items of equipment and so on, all regulated by the dual currency system that is now customary in free to play titles like this. The gold coins are therefore obtained by completing the missions and must be spent to increase the level of the characters, while the diamonds are obtained sporadically as a prize and are used to purchase new slots for the characters, weapons, armor and consumable items: without going around too much , let's say right away that without spending real money to have extra reserves of diamonds, you don't go very far, given that the prices of the items in the virtual shop are quite high and already in the early stages of the adventure you can experience bottlenecks caused by a level of the opponents much higher than that attainable ~naturally~ by their heroes. The general feeling is that in Rise of Heroes the user with greater financial resources wins rather than the one most skilled in the art of war, and a confirmation of this thesis also comes from a combat system that leaves very little room for maneuver. Rise of Heroes is too passive an RPG to be considered more than a pastime Look but don't touch Each mission of Rise of Heroes consists of three successive encounters with as many groups of enemies, and the goal is always to annihilate the opposing forces before they can do the same. In this context, the user is practically relegated to a role of mere spectator: the warriors in the field attack with the weapons supplied, autonomously deciding which objectives to address and when to use their special skills, while the player only has to act as a supervisor , using the consumable items it is provided with if necessary. A rather passive setting, which does not give the possibility to take full advantage of the characteristics of one's party and which reduces the outcome of the clashes to a matter of luck or mere supremacy in terms of equipment. As mentioned before, in Rise of Heroes it is not so much the ability that counts as the aptitude to spend on the various upgrades, a statement that proves to be particularly true in the multiplayer mode of the title where it is possible to challenge the teams of other players to earn medals to exchange then with rare objects: in these clashes whoever has the team with the highest values on his side wins, reducing everything to an almost mechanical operation that does not prove to be particularly satisfying. Considering all this, it is evident how Rise of Heroes can prove to be a quick and undemanding pastime useful for filling the dead times of one's day, while one can hardly speak of the Pine Entertainment production as a truly memorable mobile game. Even from a technical point of view, we are faced with an average job, with a fairly poor and repetitive sound and a pretty two-dimensional graphic creation but characterized by elements that are really too small that make it not easy to consult the menus, especially on an iPhone.", "date": "2015-11-12", "grade": "7.0"}
