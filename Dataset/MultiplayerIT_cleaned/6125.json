The developers wanted to tell, with a view to five ~seasons~ (four available immediately, the fifth arriving as a free update), each made up of as many missions, the typical plot of a Japanese anime: the protagonist, A-Tak, is a pilot as skilled as he is braggart, who is rescued adrift in space by a girl aboard a huge cruiser. Together they plan a strategy to inflict as much damage as possible on the forces of the Empire, using the only weapon at their disposal, namely the Galak-Z starfighter. Endowed with amazing capabilities, which are highlighted in particular at the beginning of the second season, when in a desperate move A-Tak pulls a mysterious lever and transforms the ship into a powerful mech, the Galak-Z is equipped with an upgradeable laser cannon and of homing missiles, as well as a system of reactors that allow you to carry out a whole series of spectacular evasive maneuvers. A repertoire that we will have to learn as quickly as possible, because it will immediately prove essential to survive and complete the missions, characterized by a high degree of difficulty. Dynamic, spectacular and extraordinarily tough, Galak-Z: The Dimensional is a great shooter An always different challenge The gameplay of Galak-Z: The Dimensional is inspired by classics such as Asteroids, projecting us within an inertial context that particularly enhances our ability to pilot the spacecraft, alternating the use of standard and reverse reactors, as well as the very useful boost (the functioning of which is regulated by an indicator placed at the top of the screen) and the thrusters for the lateral swerve, essential for dodging bullets. If you want to find a more recent match, however, the first name that comes to mind is that of PixelJunk Shooter, which with the 17-Bit title shares the strategic approach to the action and the evaluation of the enemy rather than the charge head-on low. There is certainly an element of repetitiveness in the structure of the missions, which punctually see us cross a portion of open space, complete with asteroids to disintegrate, and then access a presumably abandoned outpost, but inside which there are various enemy units, vehicles controlled by space pirates and even large cosmic insects that attack any intruder, be it our ship or those of our adversaries. The objective varies from time to time, randomly drawing the mission from a selection of short scripts, and can revolve around recovering parts or an entire device, destroying specific objectives or fighting a boss. which generally occurs at the end of each season. However, the levels are also changing, according to the dynamics of a procedural system that positions the structures, enemies, resources and points of interest in a different way. Double Game As already mentioned, we are faced with an unconventional shooter with a high degree of difficulty, which leads to approaching enemies often in a cautious manner, especially when it comes to advanced units, and to explore the scenarios in search of anything can help us, whether it's upgrades for the ship or credits to buy them in the menu between one mission and another. Opponents can identify us through their sensors, visually represented as in a stealth title, which means that in certain situations we will be able to choose to avoid them or hide. However, they are far from stupid, especially the high-end imperial fighters, capable of chasing us at speed and dodging attacks; or the very dangerous mechs, capable of disrupting our energy shields with a single blow of the sword, opening up to a second thrust that can be lethal. Starting from the second season, as mentioned, the Galak-Z acquires the ability to transform into a mech (by pressing the Triangle key) and this introduces profound innovations in terms of gameplay, given that in the robotic form the vehicle is equipped with the same speed but can hit opponents with a lightsaber (even charging the shot), activate a shield proper and hook anything using a grappling hook, and then throw it at a target. This last maneuver proves to be particularly useful starting from the third season, when the arsenal begins to suffer from the increased resistance of hostile vehicles and it therefore becomes important to exploit everything that the scenario has to offer, in this case explosive or electrified containers, which we can throw at the toughest enemies to ~soften~ them before a traditional lunge. Right or not? Fighting in the form of a mech soon turns into a spectacular dance, made up of quick shots and charged shots, perhaps remembering to activate the shield to deflect a few shots or use the reactors to avoid taking damage before striking with the sword. A very different approach compared to the use of lasers and missiles, which however remain an important option against certain opponents, especially those who prove lethal from short distances and therefore we may want to keep away while we try to hit them. It's all damn beautiful and engaging, and the sense of satisfaction you feel after completing a seemingly impossible battle is great; all the more reason considering the distinctly hardcore solutions adopted by 17-Bit as regards the progression in the campaign and the management of the upgrades. Running into game over during a mission means having to start the whole season over again, and this obviously can generate a mammoth sense of frustration, usually accompanied by unrepeatable exclamations. It is a choice that can be made, even more so if it serves to not trivialize a campaign that would otherwise be too easy to complete in two or three hours. The problem, in our opinion, lies in the management of upgrades, which reset every season, and that's fine, but which also rotate randomly between one mission and another, sometimes depriving us of the possibility of partially repairing the spacecraft . If you consider that the life bar remains the same for five levels, it will be easy to understand how such a constraint can appear unfair. This beyond the other upgrades, which from a certain point on you will tend to ignore, in the hope of being able to get them during the mission. Finally, the possession of a certain amount of special coins allows you to continue from the last stage after game over, but even in this case it is a controversial option, given that we will find ourselves deprived even of the possibility of transforming and we will have to recover all the upgrades by finding a chest on the map. Playstation 4 trophies The eleven Trophies of Galak-Z: The Dimensional are divided into two branches: the normal ones are obtained by eliminating a certain number of enemies and completing a mission without ever being hit, while instead the hidden achievements are linked to the completion of specific objectives, which however they are part of the normal dynamics of the campaign. Anime-style In recent times, a discussion has been held on procedural systems and on the goodness of this solution compared to a classic level design. There is no doubt that the random generation of maps brings with it a certain degree of variety, but at the same time it happens that you come across inexplicable situations (a barrier which, once destroyed, reveals a completely empty room, for example) and, in general, the hand of the developer is missing. In the case of Galak-Z: The Dimensional, this is also reflected in the visual quality of the experience, given that the scenarios are repeated in their own elements and there is never a real variation on the theme. Fortunately everything else works beautifully, from the spectacular anime-style introduction to the cutscenes, passing through the modeling of the vehicles and the elegant application of a cel shading that is never too heavy. In the most chaotic situations, for example when we push imperial troops and space pirates to collide while looking for an escape route, rather evident slowdowns are observed, but this is something that happens quite rarely. The sound is excellent, both as regards the dialogues (in English, funny and well interpreted) and the music, even if the latter are a little below expectations. Excellent controls, with an elegant use of analog backbones and a responsiveness that goes well with the needs of frenetic space combat. Too bad only for the presence of dead zones in the rotation of the sticks, which create the classic twin analog shooter situation, in which you have to move the unit to score a shot rather than simply aiming it.", "date": "2015-08-18", "grade": "8.4"}
