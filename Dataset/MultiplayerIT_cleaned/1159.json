Many console players may therefore have taken the opportunity, with the arrival of the May 2021 games, to test Stranded Deep, or a survival game, a genre which, although increasingly common on consoles as well, is mostly typical of the PC world. So here is our review of Stranded Deep in the PS4 version (but played in backwards compatibility on PS5). From the stars to the ocean Stranded Deep: Alone in the Tropics The work opens in a more cinematic style than the average survival. Our character (man or woman of our choice) is on a plane when an accident of unknown nature causes it to crash into the ocean. We then exit the sinking wreck and swim to a rubber dinghy, just before the plane explodes and knocks us out. When we wake up we find ourselves on a small island, the real starting point of the game. Stranded Deep, unlike many other survival games, does not give us access to a large map from the first moment. The game places us within an archipelago made up of multiple islands, all quite small in size. The first of these is dedicated to the tutorial that teaches us the basics of the commands and the creation system. In fact, it wouldn't be a survival if we didn't spend most of the time creating objects with the resources at our disposal. So expect all the more classic elements, such as wood, stone and leaves to be used to create tools such as an ax or a spear. The latter is perfect for catching crabs and fish in one fell swoop from which to obtain the meat which is then cooked in a campfire to feed us. Hunger is one of the characteristics to keep under control, together with health, thirst and body temperature which, on a tropical island, risks rising too much, especially in the middle of the day when the sun is high in the sky: just get outside shade or go for a swim to cool off. Indeed, Stranded Deep tries to be quite realistic in terms of game mechanics: an example are coconuts (you can use them to quench your thirst, but drinking too many in a row causes dysentery and dehydration) or snakes that poison us and require you to manufacture antidotes through some plants. The number of game mechanics, however, is all in all limited, especially compared to more massive games like Rust or Ark. Stranded Deep is a sort of little brother of the great survival games of recent years, so don't expect to have access to hundreds of resources, multiple biomes or the possibility of taming fauna. Furthermore, multiplayer is also missing on consoles, which is often the driving force of this type of game. Stranded Deep: a refuge, a hearth and little else Stranded Deep is all about solo adventure and resource micromanagement. This can be understood from the first island, very small and poor in crafting objects (especially vegetable fibers, essential for creating any advanced tool). The player is therefore enticed, after having become familiar with the game structure and having taken care of hunger and thirst, to leave with his own dinghy towards other islands, in the hope of not ending up on a full of aggressive animals, which in the first stages are complex to deal with. The difficulty is not particularly high, in any case, also thanks to the fact that it is possible to play without definitive death (basically deactivated) and it is possible to save at any moment using a shelter (very simple to create). Before leaving for a new island or trying to face a dangerous creature it is therefore possible to save and put your resources in safety (unlike games like Ark which force us to recover the resources from our corpse). Playing wisely and saving regularly, therefore, doesn't take much risk. Furthermore, by exploring the underwater areas around the islands, you can find additional tools such as a torch, but also food and advanced crafting materials. The statistics (Cooking, Creation, Gathering, Hunting, Physical...) increase by performing actions related to them and therefore make us stronger and more efficient. Crafting, especially, unlocks new recipes. In the advanced stages this will allow us to create faster and more solid means of movement, so as to manage multiple islands at the same time. At some point we will also want to create simple buildings and cultivation areas, as well as research the game secrets. Stranded Deep: More islands and a shipwreck in the distance Hardly, however, Stranded Deep will be able to occupy the same number of hours as other survival,as mentioned. It also doesn't help that the game is technically anything but exemplary. Survival games are never a point of reference in terms of graphics, we know that, but Stranded Deep, at least in the PS4 version, has a very evident pop-up effect and marked performance problems, with an unstable frame rate that ruins the experience a bit . Let's also add a user interface and inventory management that is far too cumbersome, especially when using a controller. There are also some quality of life optimizations missing, such as the ability to create more items at once or being able to interact more easily with what you have in hand (if you catch a crab with the spear you have to leave the spear on the ground, interact with it to get the crab, drop the crab on the ground, select the knife, interact with the crab on the ground to get the meat: absurdly convoluted). Stranded Deep: Near the islands there are often surprises We also point out that Stranded Deep allows you to create islands as you like and place them freely in the archipelago: this, added to the fact that it is possible to set the aggressiveness of the fauna, the permadeath and the level of difficulty, allows you to create a personalized experience, lowering or decreasing the complexity of the challenge depending on your need and taste. Finally, we point out the pleasant background ost, which enhances the sense of solitude of this desert of water.", "date": "2021-05-09", "grade": "6.8"}
