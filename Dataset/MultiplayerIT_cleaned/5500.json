This game, developed by Glowfish Interactive, will not be the epic that will define this generation of hardware but, in its simplicity, it guarantees genuine and unpretentious fun. Trifox is an action adventure with a top-down perspective, full of references to the great classics of the past and with a game mechanic similar to that of twin stick shooters. The levels are full of coins to collect to unlock new skills and for the more dedicated there are some secrets to discover. At the end of each mission, then, there is a decidedly accessible boss who can be easily killed in about ten minutes. What distinguishes the game from the competition is an interesting skill selection and upgrading system that allows you to adapt the combat and exploration style to every player's need. In this Trifox review we're going to look at all the reasons why those looking for a light and well-crafted experience should give this strange action adventure a shot. Three foxes in one Trifox progression is extremely linear Trifox owes its name to its skill management which works according to a very malleable system of 3 classes: the warrior, the mage and the engineer. The first is based on hand-to-hand combat, the second on medium range combat with magical abilities and the third on traps, turrets and machine guns. Each has a movement skill associated with it. The warriors have a dash similar to that of hack and slash, the magicians can count on a short-distance teleportation while the engineers have a small helicopter in their backpack which allows them to fly for a short time, a clear reference to Ratchet and Clank. After the first level players are teleported to a hangar which acts as a skill tree. With coins collected during levels and awarded at the end of each mission, it is possible to unlock the individual abilities of each class such as a spin attack for the warrior, a flamethrower turret for the engineer or mystical self-aiming projectiles for the magician. There are 9 unique skills for each class, 27 in total, and you can mix them all. Do you want the helicopter, magic bullets and a melee attack? Quickly done, also thanks to the intelligent Trifox command management system. If the soul of this game is that of an action adventure, its mechanics resemble those of twin stick shooters in which one analog moves the character and the other adjusts his aim. Precisely for this reason we recommend the use of a controller, but testing it with a mouse and keyboard the experience was not affected too much. The beauty of Trifox is that there are only two buttons with a fixed function: A to jump and B to use the special movement of each class. In the equipment room you can assign the skill you prefer to each trigger and each backbone of your pad (or to the keys that are most comfortable for you on the keyboard), creating a command system that cannot be more personalized. Explore, fight, upgrade, repeat In Trifox, exploration always rewards with a few more coins or a secret To begin to understand the behavior of the enemies, the range of effect of the skills and the explorability of each level, the most effective class is certainly the warrior. One of his first unlockable attacks is a powerful punch to the ground that stuns opponents within its range, it's invaluable when enemies start to multiply. To unlock many skills within the very first hours of the game you will have to break many crates, vases and other scenographic elements. The skill with which to do it faster is the magician's primary fire because it generates projectiles that, in a limited range, will hit the target by themselves. Finally, to keep the bigger enemies at bay, the engineer's fire-breathing turrets will have your back in the heat of the moment, especially since three can be placed at a time. Once you get used to the top-down perspective, the twin stick shooter mechanics and the management of the (very short) recovery times of the skills, the watchword becomes experimenting. Once you purchase an upgrade, the game doesn't give refunds, but you earn so many coins per level that if the skill you just unlocked proves ineffective for your fighting style, a single mission will be enough to unlock another. Each stage is repeatable (with upgradeable stats like number of deaths or total time) and has different collectibleshid them inside. They do not give game benefits and looking for them is an activity that is advisable only for the most avid completionists. Quotes and originality Trifox's settings are full of references to the great action adventures of the past From the settings to the narrative style, Trifox quotes and is inspired by great classics of the past such as Crash Bandicoot and Ratchet and Clank. The first 4 levels of the game, for example, have a half-Caribbean, half-tiki setting that Crash fans will be extremely familiar with. The enemies are not so many in variety and originality: in the initial 4 stages they always seem different but then they start to repeat themselves, only the bosses offer unique mechanics later in the game. Platforming and environmental puzzles, on the other hand, always find a way to amaze without becoming complicated. From classic platforms that disappear after you jump on them to electrical circuits that command automatic turrets, there's as much fighting as exploring to finish a level. Trifox is the epitome of unpretentious, slightly nostalgic, yet original enough not to generate a sensation already seen. The only things that annoy are some doors that close automatically preventing backtracking within a single level (but you can always replay it) and the fact that the perspective from above sometimes confuses the management of jumps and exploration. These flaws, however, are things that easily get used to and are trivialities in the face of adventurous relaxation that Trifox has to offer. Trifox rewards agility and cunning, especially in its platforming sections Our completion time, without hunting for collectibles, was around 6 hours and we collected enough coins to unlock 25 out of 27 skills. Trifox is available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store.", "date": "2022-10-17", "grade": "8.0"}
