In fact, the 2002 version of Kick off maintains most of the typical aspects of the previous versions of the title, a clear example is the ~bird's eye view~ (which cannot be changed), most likely this is a choice made by the developers to keep the gameplay intact, if so Anco has managed to leave the original aspects of the game unchanged. But the changes are there, even if an eye accustomed to a very high polygon count may not notice it, the details of the players on the pitch have been improved, as well as those of the various playing fields and stadiums. The old man who returns While maintaining a traditional and perhaps a little retro line, the Kick Off programmers have tried in a small way to satisfy the players of the new millennium, implementing functions which, if analyzed objectively, are not bad, let's see them together. First of all, when we decide to play this title we will find ourselves having to choose between a very large number of teams, as many as 204 (all the teams of the countries registered in UEFA) and between over 4000 players (naturally no real names) each of which with 8 distinctive skills ; For sound lovers, we will have more than 50 different effects available between soundtracks, chants and celebrations; there will be in-game goodies, in fact we may happen to see an ambulance enter the field following an injury, or we will be able to witness real invasions of the field by fans, etc. Finally, the most welcome surprise; a really powerful team editor with which you can enjoy creating your own customized team, nothing excluded, from the names of the players and their skills, to the color of the shirt, the type of ball, the capacity of the stadium, etc. The playability is somewhat affected by the (positive) influence of titles such as Iper Soccer and co., but this is certainly a positive aspect. Concluding What is certain is that playing Kick Off is not very simple (although the keys and functions are few and intuitive) especially for those who are used to playing football titles developed to the point of becoming simulators, in this title the claim to realism is non-existent, for this reason it will most likely be appreciated only by an ~old style~ type of user, i.e. by those who have not been used to moving between scenarios in which the power of machines and technological development are the masters from the beginning, but rather it grew up together with video games and saw their evolution. For this reason I want to emphasize that Kick Off '02 should not be judged as a mediocre title not worthy of joining the superstars of the moment, but as a piece of history that returns renewed in some respects, but which manages to maintain its identity of old school arcade and without too many pretensions. So, when you see little men enter the field amidst the noise of the audience and the colored confetti and you hear the referee's whistle, it will mean only one thing.It's time to Kick Off. Amarcord When I was asked to review the new title of the historic football saga created by Dino Dini, Kick off '02, I don't deny that I felt a strong sense of emotion (not cerebral ;)) seeing myself again for a moment as a twelve-year-old geek, sitting in front of the my friend that I was preparing to spend hours of virtual competition, but what sensations! It goes without saying that in times like these, in which we are used to seeing sports simulators and above all football, with high performance and with an abnormal level of realism both in graphics and in the game, presenting such a product may seem to go against the trend, but of on the other hand, one cannot fail to mention the return on the monitors of the new chapter of a ~cult~ saga for an entire generation of gamers.", "date": "2002-06-18", "grade": null}
