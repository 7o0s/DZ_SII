As in a sort of response to what was told in the previous story, in fact, Nick Fury organizes an unauthorized expedition to the territory of Latveria, the homeland of Doctor Destiny, in order to neutralize a threat which, in his opinion, could explode at any moment. other and bring death and destruction to the United States. The mission is completed successfully, but there is no shortage of doubts from the heroes who took part in it, among all Iron Man and Captain America. A year later, needless to say, the surviving Latverian commanders strike America and are stopped in extremis by the faction of the ~good guys~, which however is at that point faced with a situation that is anything but enviable: to prevent future reprisals by hostile armies attacked without the approval of the government occur again, the infamous Registration Act is developed, which obliges superheroes to declare their identity to the state and to move only in concert with the forces of order, thus avoiding the solitary actions that have always characterized their work. Iron Man supports this decision, Captain America instead chooses to disobey what he sees as a violation of the principles of freedom for which he has always fought, and thus two opposing teams are created that come to clash. Which side will we decide to be on? Marvel: The Great Alliance 2 proves that it can still entertain, especially in co-op: a pity about the port The threat of the terrible buzz If you've read our review of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, you already know how we think about remasters and how they should be made: if you aim for quality, the remaking of assets and the introduction of new systems and modes, it is lawful to sell the product for a certain amount, which in any case does not exceed two-thirds of the full price; if, on the other hand, the re-release is interpreted as a simple ~service~ for users who have not played that title previously, only adapting its resolution and frame rate, the economic demand should be substantially lower. Well, with this latest operation Activision has not properly followed these dictates, however entrusting the work to a team that has so far dealt with casual musical games, Zoe Mode, and which evidently does not have the necessary skills to create a re-edition that respects certain quality standards. Just like the remaster of the first episode, in fact, the game welcomes controller owners with a control scheme mapped to the hound member, to be fixed necessarily using this fix, which indicates a sensational lack of attention to the project. It's also impossible not to notice a huge audio problem, the effects of which are marred by a hum that makes them unlistenable. These are deficiencies that we consider quite serious, if we consider that realizing their presence would have been the minimum before proceeding with their publication on Steam, but which become unacceptable given the sale price of a good 39.99 euros (59.99 by purchasing the bundle with the two episodes), a completely inappropriate figure for a title from seven years ago that is translated on current gaming systems at the ~minimum wage~. Fantastic Four Trying for a moment not to consider the problems we have just talked about, it must be said that Marvel: The Great Alliance 2 has kept its merits intact, enriching the original formula with new functions (see the special moves involving members of the team), increasing the number of playable characters and making evident improvements to the technical sector, which now uses more complex and multifaceted polygonal models, as well as scenarios with a higher degree of variety than in the first chapter. Some maneuvers have been modified to avoid excessive imbalances in the gameplay balance, for example Iron Man's repulsors have become a volley of shots instead of a single, devastating emission, but there are details capable of snatching a smile from Marvel comic fans (the fact that the aforementioned Iron Man is unable to lift the biggest vehicles, something that characters like the Thing manage to do) and which tell of a development carried out with passion and intelligence by Vicarious Visions, who had replaced Raven Software after the debut of the franchise and which has dealt with the various episodes of Skylanders in recent yearsas well as the upcoming Crash Bandicoot remaster. In short, not exactly the latest arrivals, which makes it all the more unfortunate that their work has been revived in a mediocre way.", "date": "2016-07-30", "grade": "4.5"}
