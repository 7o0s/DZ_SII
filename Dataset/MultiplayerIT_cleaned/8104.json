Since the announcement of the considerable purchase cost (1600 Microsoft Points - about 20 ) substantial additions were desirable for a content that would have a lot to say, but consequently the bar of expectations has also risen. Playground Games is therefore facing an important turning point; justifying a similar product in the current times is not an easy undertaking, given that many of the times it is not even possible to distinguish between a necessary expansion and a profitable operation. After testing it thoroughly, we are ready to give you our opinion. Return to Colorado The Rally Expansion Pack immediately welcomes us with a surprise: it is not integrated with the main campaign, but it is a special mode that can be selected directly from the main menu. However some links remained. Despite the obligation to purchase one of the five new Rally cars available, among which Subaru, Lancia and Mitsubishi peep out, we still have the virtual money earned with Horizon races available to make the task easier. This means that those who have completed the base game will have very few problems getting them all, otherwise the virtual tokens that can be purchased through Microsoft Points are always available, and it is even possible to immediately unlock all the stages of this expansion. But let's go back to the beginning, the structure of the new mode moves away from the free roaming spirit we were used to, forcing us to a series of races to face in order. Each of these is divided into four phases, which bring the number of circuits to over twenty units. The aim is to earn the Rally bracelet through experience points, just like in the Horizon festival, to participate in the final competition. An operation that will take a good number of hours, not to mention the fact that both the cars and the circuits enrich the single player and online multiplayer modes respectively. Not only that, any car earned in the garage can be used in these new races, subject to a specific modification to prepare it adequately for the type of competition. Equally fully compatible are the decals from the editor, which we recommend going to immediately, the community creations are as usual superlative and deserve your full attention. There is no shortage of new objectives for the joy of our player score, which are always nice. All the races are essentially time trials on circuits in stages, with the classification calculated on fifty opponents and constantly updated both in the intermediate times and in the final finish line. The final touch of class is the presence of a co-pilot who accompanies us on each ride. Dirty and bad Once on the track, the tone decided by Playground for this expansion is immediately perceptible, certainly less permissive than expected and probably enriched by that grit that the base game perhaps lacked. Even at an easy level, and carrying out more than acceptable races, it will be very unlikely to finish first, a condition which obliges you to brush each trajectory with precision and treat with a certain respect the renewed physics, still hand-in-hand with the Forza series, but made more rough due to the worsening of the soil conditions. This time the handbrake and the drift are key concepts to understand as soon as possible in order not to fall at the mercy of the dust. Speed has also increased exponentially, so much so that the last few races are a riot of adrenaline where even the slightest mistake is paid dearly. Online the virtual list of competitors is replaced by your friends, increasing the longevity of this additional content. Technically, the programmers limited themselves to replicating the best parts of the main game map, setting up ad hoc reworked routes to meet the requirements imposed by this type of competition. Unfortunately this represents one of the major limitations of the DLC. If on the one hand it is commendable to maintain a stylistic coherence with the Colorado scenario (which ultimately characterizes this production), the sense of deja vu becomes really strong, considering that each phase of the various Rallyes is substantially a variant of the same circuit . Even the autumn color palette that governs each race is likely to get boring quickly. Perhaps it would have been desirable to divert to something different, facilitated by the advantage of a method disconnected from everything else, to focus on agreater variety of environments. Regardless of this, the Rally Expansion Pack is a positive addition to an already very complete title of its own, and yet another demonstration of Playground Games' ability in the racing game genre. Their latest effort therefore definitely deserves a tour, even if the price to get on board is far from moderate.", "date": "2012-12-20", "grade": null}
