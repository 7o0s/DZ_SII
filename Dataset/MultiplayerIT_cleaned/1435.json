{"name": "Bloody Roar Extreme", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bloody-roar-extreme_a.html", "text": "I'll split you in four! Bloody Roar Extreme, it is with this name that the title published by Konami arrives on the shelves, is certainly the bearer of a not bad idea for a fighting game: to transform the fighters into ferocious beasts with still anthropomorphic traits. In fact, all the contenders, more than a dozen, available in the course of the adventure, are of the Zoanthrope breed and have the characteristic of being able to change into wild beasts and skilled in combat. Obviously this possibility introduces an important factor to be exploited properly in order to master Bloody Roar. Following each transformation, our warrior will fight much more effectively, bring more powerful attacks, resist enemies better and see his number of moves increased. Moreover, our fighter will be able to transform following two distinct levels, the basic mutation, entrusted to the B key of the joypad, and the super mutation, executable with the black key, which allows us to vent our fury even more, but executable only once for round. All this is decidedly interesting, how can we deny it, a pity that the idea should have been exploited much better and perhaps it would have been preferable to make being able to transform more complex, just to give greater depth to the peculiarity of the mutation and make it highly strategic. The control system, the real focal point of any self-respecting beater, is discreet, there is a button for punches, one for kicks, one for parries and lateral dodges are used for back triggers. Unfortunately, however, the developers have decided not to make Bloody Roar a ~deep~ game, they have based the playability on a frantic keystroke, without worrying about wanting to deepen moves, countermoves and tricks. Completely useless to learn them in depth and make strategies, fighting against opponents guided by the game's AI, just go on and on with the classic combos of kicks and punches. In doing so, it is obvious that the title definitely loses appeal for those who love depth in a fighting game (who said Virtua Fighter?) and for those who prefer to learn all the moves of their warrior to feel completely ~his~ . However, the title offers all the classic options of any fighting game: Arcade, Versus, Survival, Time Attack, Team Challenge, Team Versus Challenge and Training. Zoanthrope a more difficult name isn't it? The game published by Konami, technically, is good enough, even if the troubled genesis and almost multiplatform origin are understood. The characters are sufficiently detailed and even the mutations are made in a more than decent way. We will be able to see the warriors transform in an instant, between good light effects and iridescent flashes, into their most varied animal counterparts: wolves, lions, chameleons, phoenixes to say the most successful. As for the characters, Bloody roar is promoted, even if it is fair to note a lack of originality that could have been avoided. The scenarios are also discreet, with some textures here and there not quite successful and equipped with some interactive elements such as walls, walls and fences that break in contact with the bodies of the wrestlers. The game engine, on the other hand, responds without a shot being fired and constantly keeps the 60 frames per second, allowing for good fluidity during the clashes. Obviously the title, like all fighting games, gives its best against a friend, even if even the most savvy user will seriously risk being subjected to a very quick ~rookie~ in pressing the joypad keys, precisely following the imprint deliberately frenetic given by the developers. Compared to the Gamecube and Playstation 2 versions, a new character and some additional extras have been introduced which, as always, aim to lengthen the longevity of fighting titles. The game is completed by a good work of adaptation in Italian, always welcome, even if not decisive in a genre like the one to which Bloody Roar belongs. Finally, the sound effects and music are successful, definitely involving the player. Comment Bloody Roar Extreme is a title that must be appreciated for what it is, without looking for useless comparisons: a good idea, discreetly implemented, in a title that makes frenzy and simplicity its strong point. Of course, all this will not attract the most savvy user, but it could find favor with those looking for immediate fun without many pretensions. On the technical front he defends himself fairly well,both in terms of the polygonal models of the characters and in terms of the game arenas. Pulling the strings, it therefore turns out to be a game recommended for those looking for immediate fun and those who love fighting in all their nuances. Pros: technically discreet a bonus character plus other extras frenetic and immediate Cons: lack of depth risks tiring very soon lack of originality The fighting game genre has lately been a bit inflated, on the various consoles we have been able to enjoy the various Tekken, Virtua Fighter, Dead or Alive without forgetting Soul Calibur 2. In this swarm of proposals, the valuable titles emerge, while the mediocre ones tend to remain seeds unknown or almost. The Bloody Roar saga, while passing a little on the sly, has reached its Xbox version after having passed, simply by changing the title, through its counterparts on Playstation 2 and Gamecube. Certainly the title we are going to examine is not purely a direct port of the two versions, however the fact that it was not originally born as a title for Microsoft hardware already alarms us as regards the technical sector, aware that often, too often Cross-platform releases limit your ability to take advantage of Microsoft console hardware.", "date": "2003-12-25", "grade": null}
