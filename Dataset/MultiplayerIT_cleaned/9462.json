Since the first chapter, the attempt has been to create a virtual world dedicated entirely to racing enthusiasts who are willing, literally, to get lost on a tropical island in search of fame and fortune (and also a lot of friends who love four wheels). An MMOR, an online driving game in which to meet players from all over the world, make friends, explore, this time, two islands and, from now on, share houses and cooperative driving missions. Test Drive Unlimited 2 has kept us company for the last ten days, with its sunsets, the rain that fell at more or less regular intervals and many players who eagerly awaited this new episode which promised to be like the first, but improved underneath all points of view. Unfortunately there are some flaws left, but the fact remains that, once you get used to it, it becomes really difficult to be able to detach yourself from the pad and abandon this strange world made up of luxury cars, haircuts, photos and... cosmetic surgery. A bright career Among the many novelties of this Test Drive Unlimited 2 there is the inclusion of a campaign that begins as soon as you choose the race and gender of your alter ego, who, starting from the simple companion of an Ibiza television starlet, will to become the protagonist of a show entirely based on racing, with a series of drivers/characters who challenge each other by excelling in the category of car that best suits them. In order to compete with the different categories of machines, it is necessary to obtain a series of licenses through tests to be carried out in the driving schools scattered first on Ibiza and, having reached the tenth level and having passed the first championships, on Hawaii, which returns, helped by the new iteration of the Eden Games. The most pleasant thing, in fact, is that the second island is not included as a mere bonus, but is an integral part of the story and shops, houses and, obviously, driving schools and competitions in which to compete continue to appear on it. The protagonist of the game can reach 60 levels, like in an RPG, divided into four categories of 15 levels each. To accumulate experience you need to win races, earn money to buy cars and houses, explore all the streets of the island and participate in online races, both competitive and cooperative. There is no doubt that having access to the network is one of the keys to enjoying Test Drive Unlimited 2 to the fullest, despite a series of problems which we will discuss later, but even solo the game remains perfectly enjoyable, able as it is to give of truly unusual freedom for a driving game, given that cliffs, forests and plateaus open up in front of the player, all freely explorable, especially in this episode in which SUVs are introduced instead of motorcycles. Both the day-night cycle and the variable weather conditions have been added, which also affect the drivability of the vehicles unlike the damage which is purely aesthetic and a couple of quests which require the player to explore every corner of the islands in search of animal carcasses. 'abandoned cars (to get bonus cars) and to take pictures of a series of viewpoints, to be delivered to a photo agency that pays their weight in gold. Compared to the first episode then, thanks to the greater diffusion of consoles, here there are many more players online right away and buying a remote house on top of a hilltop, getting out of the garage and finding other people who go all around with their SUVs is a pleasant and unusual sensation. Were there not a few too many problems, Test Drive Unlimited 2 could have really been the egg of Columbus of driving games. Drive tough Eden Games, perhaps to follow up on the idea of freedom that permeates the whole game, has always wanted to avoid an overly simulative approach to the driving model and Test Drive Unlimited 2 is no exception, proposing a balance between a more rigid system and the total light-heartedness of an arcade game. In addition, the model on which the physics is applied to the cars takes into account the four points constituted by the individual wheels, in order, at least on paper, to give greater precision without losing sight of the fact that we may be on a dirt road in the mountains , but aboard a Lotus Esprit. The problem, however, is that not everything has gone the right way and we find ourselves with rear-wheel drive vehicles that in the wet become really difficult beasts to tame, with Golf GTi that have a very slow recovery and the physics that occasionally make you perform strange bumps on curbs and dirt. In short, when you launch yourself at full speed, you never feel fully in control of the vehicle, at least at the beginning, and you have the impressionI think the slightest smudge can send us into the stratosphere or off a cliff, which is worse. Each car must be tamed, above all, by investing money in the garages for upgrades, which get better and better as you explore the island and level up. At first, however, you have to get busy, above all because TDU 2 does not give anything away and the races are also difficult, because the opponents never give way and the physics mentioned above means that at the slightest window, to lose the fight, it is almost always the player who often finds himself in the dust. The excellent layout of the routes and the great variety of terrains have you driving and once you get underway, you find yourself trying to explore an extra centimeter of the island to find the missing workshop or the dealer who, we are sure , hides the car that is right for us to overcome a specific race. Without forgetting clothing stores, hairdressers, body shops in which to customize the bodies and cosmetic surgery institutes in which to change the characteristics of our character, who will wear bandages and plasters on his face for a couple of hours after each operation. A life online Interactions with other players take place on whichever road you meet them, first and foremost. Crossing another vehicle, just smash against it to engage an immediate challenge or launch the request for a trip together with the other who acts as co-driver, all to increase the levels of sociality and increase the experience of the character. There are obviously the races, highlighted with flags on the island, with a convenient menu that allows you to enter any one and know how many players there are and which sessions are open, in order to participate without wasting time. There is again the possibility of creating ad hoc races with an editor and sharing them with other players, to be able to challenge them, putting a stake so as to win all the money put into the pot by the others, in case our time is the best at the end of the time window foreseen to participate in the challenge. The cooperative modes mainly consist of following a path at the right distance from those in front of us or following the group leader who, alone, sees the next checkpoint appear on the road. At least from what we have been able to see they are certainly not the most popular at the moment, but Test Drive Unlimited 2 has just been born and will be available to play for months, above all thanks to the life of the Clubs, or the street equivalent of the guilds of a game of role. You can found one for $50,000, invite other players and organize group activities with them and challenge other clubs to increase your prestige and gain access to exclusive cars. There is also a spectacular Guards and Thieves mode which is triggered automatically, accepting the invitation, when 8 players are in the same area: seven become policemen, one becomes the thief to be chased down and stopped within a certain time limit, with breakneck speed aboard police cars, in defiance of any highway code. Now it is also possible to meet the other players in shops, driving schools and lobbies before each race, to chat, exchange advice and make friends, up to inviting them to your home for impromptu parties. As seen, there is really a lot of irons in the fire, the problem is that Eden Games also ended up on the grill with quite a few bugs that we hope will be resolved over time, otherwise a difficult life. At the moment, the Clubs on PlayStation 3, for example, are closed because players used cheats to accumulate money and, as if that weren't enough, it is difficult to enter the races because the list of online games does not correspond to those actually available on the servers . On the official website, the team says it is hard at work to solve all these problems with a patch and it is to be hoped so because the code itself is lag-free and uncertain when you manage to get a game off the ground. Playstation 3 trophies Trophy hunters will find bread for their teeth here, given that Test Drive Unlimited 2 is a game of infinite longevity with its two islands, many game modes, hunting for racing car carcasses and panoramic points to photograph. It takes time, patience and the desire to drive many kilometers. Out and about in Ibiza and Hawaii The judgment on the technical sector of Test Drive Unlimited 2 is necessarily influenced by the way in which one gets involved, or not, by the whole structure set up by the developers. Vast environments, with sunsets, sunrises and torrential rains are described with pop-up elements in the distance, with sub-standard carsof modern driving games and with the polygonal models of the characters that leave something to be desired in terms of both the animations and the number of polygons. The point, however, is that the work is truly impressive and the amount of structures, contents and possibilities offered to the player is well above any driving game on the market and it would be unfair to judge it with the same criteria with which evaluate other exponents of the genre. Of course, more time would have helped, but if you let yourself be carried away by the breeze that always seems to blow on the two islands, it is inevitable that you will find yourself poking your nose into the narrow streets, lanes and tree-lined avenues to enjoy every glimpse. As for the other chapter, the work done on the soundtrack is excellent, especially for Rock radio (this time there are only two) with songs by interesting emerging bands and by more famous artists such as Phoenix and Metric, among others . Truly a pleasure to listen to while driving.", "date": "2011-02-18", "grade": "8.0"}
