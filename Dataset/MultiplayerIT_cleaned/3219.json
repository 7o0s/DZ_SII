{"name": "DoTA Underlords", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dota-underlords-recensione.html", "text": "Rereading the DoTA Underlords review, we realized that most of what we wrote fits perfectly with all the auto battlers that have hit the market in the last year. It almost seems that the genre born from Auto Chess, a mod for DoTA 2 which in the meantime has become an independent title of the same name, is one of those that makes it more difficult to distinguish itself, given the presence of some fundamental mechanics that nail the games to unavoidable necessities . So what distinguishes DoTA Underlords from Teamfight Tactics from Auto Chess itself, from Might & Magic: Chess Royale and so on are above all the details and the way in which some choices match the needs of the players. Valve must be credited with having at least tried, in the sense that the game released from Early Access has a lot more content than the one that was playable just a few months ago. Of course, the core of the experience always remains the same, which, if you like, is its main problem. Gameplay DoTA Underlords is a strategy game in which, having arranged different units on a chessboard, they automatically fight each other until one of the two sides prevails. Each player starts with one hundred life points and loses the game when they run out. Obviously, the last one standing wins. The units are taken directly from the DoTA 2 universe and fully respect its canons. Each of them is classified by the type of damage it causes and by signs which, linked to those of the other units, can create so-called synergies, i.e. bonuses due to the presence of several units with the same sign on the board. Units can also be stacked to create stronger units: three first-level units of the same type form a second-level unit, while three second-level units form a third-level unit. In total, to have the most powerful units you need to find nine of the same type. Why ~find some~? Easy, because the units are not freely selectable, but must be purchased in a shop that offers five at a time, taken from a very large selection. And here we come to what is the strength, but at the same time the biggest weakness of the game and of the whole genre. ~O fortuna / velut luna / statu variabilis / semper crescis / aut decrescis / vita detestabilis / nunc obdurat / et tunc curat / ludo mentis aciem / egestatem / potestatem / dissolvit ut glaciem~ recite the Carmina Burana. If we want, it is also a text that well describes the auto battlers. At the beginning of a game we cannot know which units we will be able to buy. With experience we will understand how to strengthen our army by spending the money given to us after each turn, but at the same time we will never be able to ignore the luck factor: it is not possible to adjust to a certain style of play, i.e. the use of units specifications, and always follow it, but we must adapt to what the case offers us. You have to be flexible and not fixated, letting go of the flow of possibilities. It's a kind of slot machine, you got it right. In reality, there is a way to try to force the game system: accumulate a lot of money in the first rounds, letting yourself be defeated without even competing, and then spend it all together in the advanced rounds so as to compose an army as studied as possible. In reality, this tactic has also been weakened quite a bit with the latest updates, but it is still possible to apply it in some way. From our experience, after playing a total of about forty hours between the Steam and Android versions (fortunately progress is synchronized between the various versions) and after trying many other auto battlers, we can say that there are some strategies that help, but that in the end the case always has its weight on the games, often decisive, also because if certain units do not want to appear in the shop there is little they can do. So we happened to place ourselves well, even to win, in three games in a row because we were favored by fate, only to be miserably massacred in the following games because we weren't able to create a decent army. Obviously the positioning of the units on the chessboard also counts a lot, which must be adapted to the contingencies, the choice of objects that are given away after a certain number of rounds and that of the Underlord, a particularly powerful unit that becomes the guide of the entire team. giving different bonuses according to his characteristics. By this we absolutely do not want to say that the human factor is not important, because in any case it takes a certain intuition and a certain quickness of thought not to make colossal stupid things, only that in the long run one has the perception of never having complete control of what you areis doing and there are junctures in which everything seems to be plotting against us to make us lose (or win). Content and graphics Compared to the competition DoTA Underlords tries to stand out for the richness of content, without leaving its mark. In addition to the classic mode, Valve has added another one designed for quick games, in which you have a small army from the first round and whoever loses four times leaves the game. In our opinion it is not particularly successful because it distorts the game a lot, making it faster, but also milder. The solution adopted by Ubisoft with Might to reduce the time of matches, based on the number of defeats against a large number of opponents, is much better. For the rest, the Valve title offers the possibility of facing bots to train and a tutorial that explains the basics of the game. Season 1 is currently active, in which to unlock rewards players must complete different objectives by selecting them on the stylized map of the city of White Spire. It is basically a question of playing normal games, but following the rules dictated from time to time. In some cases you have to face bots, in others to overcome puzzles and in others simply to take part in normal matches. As you progress, rewards are unlocked, which can still be obtained with the classic season pass. Microtransactions, for now, stop here. In general, those made by Valve are all nice additions, but they don't tie in particularly well with the style of play. DoTA Underlords, like all auto battlers, appears very rigid and seems to admit only itself, with all the other mechanics and additions that create a pleasant, but overall superfluous outline. Another problem of DoTA Underlords is the user interface, decidedly less intuitive and more confusing than that of other auto battlers. The information you need is all there, but some are hidden and accessible only by pressing one of the many small buttons scattered around the screen, while others are positioned so as to only waste the player's time. Considering that between one round and the next you have a few seconds to review the positioning of the troops, buy new ones, manage objects and review the strategy on the battlefield, much more could have been done so as not to waste precious seconds for the player. In this case it would really be enough to look at the competition, as Teamfight Tactics, Auto Chess and Might and Magic: Chess Royal do much better and are always free-to-play. From a technical point of view, the Valve title is exactly as we expected it: cared for in every aspect, but certainly not designed to push too much on the accelerator of brute technical prowess. After all, it must also run on mobile systems, so it would not have made sense to exaggerate the graphic side too much. If we want it is in line with DoTA 2. So it is the classic free-to-play without infamy and without praise, which you will forget in the blink of an eye.", "date": "2020-02-29", "grade": "6.0"}
