The confrontation ended in a tie last time around, but at this point in the life cycle of the PlayStation Portable it is difficult to expect who knows what effort from the developers, who aim at optimizing the work done so far rather than on an improbable revolution (such as the one which, for example, saw FIFA 12 as the protagonist on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC). It only takes a few minutes to understand that this is precisely the objective of Pro Evolution Soccer 2012, which presents itself with the usual range of modes and options, devoid of online multiplayer as always (we can now give it up) but strong in small improvements that solve some of the problems highlighted in the review of PES 2011. The game is once again confirmed as quite difficult, with a clear gap between the ~beginner~ level and all the others, from the standard up. In fact, if in the first case it is possible to literally walk inside the opponent's penalty area, with the defenders minding their own business rather than coming to tag us, it is enough to increase the degree of challenge for this situation to become pure fantasy, and one is faced with overly organized teams, capable of intercepting any of our deep passes and stealing the ball from us without apparent effort. On the one hand, it is a good thing that the most inflated maneuvers to finalize the action have been made more difficult, but on the other, one cannot help but notice that in real matches these solutions continue to occur, especially when the teams more tired and therefore widen their shirts. Structure and game modes From the Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 start screen you can access different modes. The first is the quick game, which allows us to play a match by selecting two national or club teams from the hundreds available. Then there are the licensed competitions, namely the Champions League and the Copa Santander Libertadores, which take place exactly as in reality and therefore with groups and final elimination stages, all with an increasing degree of difficulty. The Become a Legend mode sees us create a player of any position from scratch and face an entire career, watching him grow gradually and memorizing his characteristics so that we can then challenge a friend and his Legend via an adhoc wireless connection. The World Player mode, similarly, allows us to take on the role of a real-life player within an annual season, with the possibility of controlling the entire team or just that particular player during matches. The Master Championship could not be missing, in which you take the lead of a team made up of not exactly brilliant elements who gradually, with the achievement of victories and sponsorships, manage to grow and recruit prominent personalities within their staff. The cup and championship modes close the review, while as already mentioned, online multiplayer is missing. There are no changes compared to PES 2011, as you may have noticed. The experience is therefore ~already seen~ in the eyes of those who own the previous edition of the game, and the only updated roses represent a weak argument against the purchase of the Konami title. The matter clearly changes if it's been a while since you've played an episode of the series: in this case the number of modes proves to be more than enough to keep you busy for weeks, also considering the time needed to metabolize the level of difficulty and therefore to prepare new strategies that can replace those that no longer work, sometimes unfortunately also due to the demerits of artificial intelligence. But we'll get to that in a moment. Same story, same place, same bar Among the ~historical~ merits of Pro Evolution Soccer certainly include the speed and dynamism of the action, as well as the physics of the ball and the excellent sensation of impact with it, capable of returning a great sense of satisfaction with each shot . These elements are present in the PSP version of PES 2012, but in a not exactly crystalline way, unfortunately accompanied by some shortcomings. In fact, during matches it is not uncommon to make a through ball on the opponent's trocar, easily passing the defense line, and to see that the recipient of this throw instead of crossing the ball to take possession of it, inexplicably moves away from it, producing moments of intense frustration. No particular novelty is notedand as far as the aerial game is concerned, with crosses that are rarely well intercepted by our centre-forward to be bagged. In short, the feeling is that certain dynamics have been banned because they are considered too inflated, but without providing valid alternatives and making the construction of an effective action more difficult than one would have expected. Scoring goals despite all of this is a source of great satisfaction, but these are rewards that come the wrong way, in the frame of a gameplay which, like the methods, is practically unchanged compared to last year, with the same excessive power of the opposing defenders in the act of stealing the ball from us, even and especially when we're about to shoot. Finally, the technical sector remains at good levels, with a fluid scrolling of the field, animations of discreet workmanship and a good correspondence between virtual and real players, even when perhaps they are not superstars. The commentary would in theory be entrusted to the couple formed by Pierluigi Pardo and Luca Marchegiani, but the sentences spoken by the latter can be counted on the fingers of one hand.", "date": "2011-11-11", "grade": "7.5"}
