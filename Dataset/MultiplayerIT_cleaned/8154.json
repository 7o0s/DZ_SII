From this point of view, the console gains considerable interest for all those who have stayed away from this generation of hardware, or who have perhaps bought only Wii leaving aside the various Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. With Wii U, in fact, it will be possible to recover some pearls released in this 2012 and in one case even in 2011, see Batman: Arkham City. At the center of attention of the review you are reading is one of these: Darksiders II. The original title was reviewed in great detail by our Christian Colli several months ago, at the time of launch on the Microsoft and Sony consoles and for all the details on the story, the gameplay, its strengths and its defects, we refer you to his article. Here we will focus on the features that distinguish the Wii U conversion, in particular on the use of the GamePad within the game and on any differences in technical and graphic terms. First of all, it is essential to underline that the version available in shops at the launch of the new Nintendo console already contains all the various DLCs and additional contents released in recent months on X360 and PS3: we are talking about Argul's Tomb, the first downloadable addition containing a unpublished with three dungeons and obviously new equipment to collect, the Death Rides Pack with three unpublished secondary quests that are grafted into the game's campaign, the Deadly Despair Pack which offers some boosts to the speed of Despair, the horse of Death and finally the two DLC Angel of Death and Shadow of Death containing a series of legendary armor and rather powerful weapons that will be available from the beginning through the in-game messaging system. According to the developer, as if all this were not enough, additional legendary weapons and some unpublished armor sets have also been implemented in this conversion. But how well I use the GamePad! We don't risk being proved wrong when we say that Darksiders II is most likely the one that makes the most use of the GamePad as a real adventure companion among the Wii U launch titles. If in fact in ZombiU we can notice a greater interactivity with what happens on the main screen, while in Nintendo Land every single technical feature of the controller is used in the various mini-games, in Vigil's work the pad becomes a real essential accessory capable of making the extremely smoother gaming experience. While advancing through the game world or perhaps immersed in the environmental puzzles of some dungeon, the GamePad allows you to manage the entire inventory via the touch screen, equipping the weapons and observing their characteristics, all strictly in real time without having to pause the game. In an instant it is then possible to access the map of the area being explored via a lateral drag, which can always be moved freely by means of the touch and to the missions in progress complete with a summary and steps already completed or still to be faced . Furthermore, in combination with the left back button of the pad, it is possible to manage Death's additional powers by dragging them on the four front buttons for their subsequent quick use. It is obviously possible to pause the game at any time and access these same menus also through the TV, just as it happened in the X360 and PS3 versions of the game, but we can only be very satisfied with a rather thorough use of the GamePad that leaves augur well for the future of the controller, perhaps coupled with some hardcore RPG or even some form of strategic gameplay. However, there are a couple of critical elements. First of all, we cannot explain why Vigil has not made Death's skill menu navigable in this way, which instead remains anchored to the need to stop the game to navigate it via the TV, and at the same time we note the lack of a general redesign of these screens that remain the same as already seen on the other consoles but only, obviously, in a much smaller version due to the small size of the pad screen. This translates into extremely narrow spaces to manage via touch and in particular in the case of the inventory it unfortunately happens not so rarely to select the wrong object, given that the individual squares that contain the equipment are really small and therefore ofhard to center. Finally, worthy of note is the possibility via the options menu to change the management of the video stream on TV and GamePad in an instant. It is in fact possible at any time to turn off the TV and play the entire Darksiders II only via controller. In doing so, the typical features of this conversion are obviously lost and the game becomes identical to the one experienced on X360 and PS3, but we can only appreciate Vigil's decision to offer this opportunity perfectly in line with the first announcements of the new Nintendo consoles. Among other things, it is also possible to manage the audio stream separately, leaving open the possibility of using, for example, only the GamePad to play, however, using any external amplification connected to the console rather than the controller speakers. As good as anywhere else? Unfortunately, the real limits of this conversion are all in the technical sector. If from a graphic point of view we are quite in line with the versions for Microsoft and Sony consoles and perhaps we have even been able to notice an increased detail of the textures which contributes to increasing the sense of general cleanliness, the same cannot be said for the frame installments. In fact, in the presence of many enemies on the screen, the number of frames per second collapses miserably and in the most agitated situations we do not struggle to define the title one step away from being unplayable. As if this were not enough, sometimes there is also some sporadic case of tearing (when the image seems to ~break~ on a horizontal line) with slight repercussions on the latency of the commands. Surely this element can only weigh significantly on our final assessment especially in the light of the most recent statements made by Nintendo; it is clear that conversions of products developed on other platforms, carried out in a short time to return to day one and with limited knowledge of the new hardware are certainly not indicative of the potential of the console, but at the same time it is certainly not pleasant to experience lower absolute values than those collected on systems now on the boulevard of sunset. Nothing to say instead about the audio sector which remains perfectly in line with the original one and boasts a well-made entirely Italian dubbing.", "date": "2012-11-29", "grade": "8.5"}
