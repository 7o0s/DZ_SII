Tribes 2 is a game specifically designed for netgaming so, let's face it right away, if you intend to follow a storyline, to go through a campaign full of action and twists, then this game is not for you! The generic game takes place on a server, usually crowded, in which two teams face each other in an open scenario where, between valleys, canyons and lakes, their respective defenses line up. Unlike the various Quake and UT, the player, or rather the tribbar as it is commonly called, does not have a single piece of equipment but, starting from a standard configuration, has a series of interchangeable pieces of equipment capable of generating very different combinations. . You can choose between three armors: LIGHT (SCOUT), MEDIUM (ASSAULT) and HEAVY (JUGGERNAUT). Obviously, the more the defense of the armor increases, the more the agility and movement capacity are penalized. [VNR] I NEED TO RIDE! - A scenic ride on the wheel of Tribes... It must be said that in Tribes 2 the main physical laws are taken very closely into account, in order to make the game scenario more likely and credible, but also more hostile. One of the most obvious consequences of this fact is the possibility of exploiting the slopes to obtain extra sliding speed, allowing even the heavy bikes to reach high speeds. This technique, called skiing, is one of the most famous features of the world of Tribes. Another feature of the game is the fixed presence of the jetpack for each player. The jetpack, for the uninitiated, is a tool that allows you to hover in the air for a while, until you run out of its limited energy reserve which, however, automatically restores when you are not using it. In this way it is possible to experience the map by distorting the classic canons of the first person game: imagine flying across the sky, from a bird's eye view, while the battle rages below you, among a thousand flame flowers and a rainbow of death! Of course, you'll want to conserve some energy in the jetpack for a soft landing... [VNR] I NEED TO RIDE! - A scenic ride on the wheel of Tribes... It is possible to create personalized profiles by choosing the armour, the weapons, the ~pack~ and any supply of mines, grenades and signallers. We then change at the INVENTORY STATION, scattered throughout the various bases. The PACK is the object that players can carry on their shoulders and is divided into two categories: those that can be deposited and those that must be worn. It is, from time to time, a shield, a jammer, or an object to be placed on the map, such as a turret, a sensor or even a portable inventory station! Objects placed by players can be completely destroyed, while resources on the map cannot, but it will be possible to repair them and restore their functioning. Thus, a landspike turret may be lost to a nearby explosion, but a generator may be repaired and back up and running again. Obviously, if an object is only partially damaged, it can still be repaired, regardless of whether it was placed by the player or not. But the available equipment does not end here, in addition to armor, turrets, sensors, inventory stations, it is possible to use ground vehicles and Zero-G aircraft for greater mobility and to transport the clashes even in the sky. As a consequence of this fact, it will be possible to see spectacular attacks from the ground and from above, with aerial combats, bombings and cross-actions between the various forces. Furthermore, there is a very convenient communication menu which, by pressing a few keys, allows you to send complete messages to all players or only to your teammates. For example, pressing the V - N - B keys calls for the support of a bomber, on your aircraft ([VNB] I Need A Bombardier!). And already because, on some particular means, there will be enough space to carry more than one player and therefore we will see real flying ~gunboats~, loaded with Juggernauts armed with mortars and rocket launchers to the teeth, fly over the enemy bases, ready to sow terror and pave the way for a ground attack. The strategic scenarios that open up are truly impressive, just think of what a vehicle can do that carries an inventory station, which allows you to hide an area of about 30 meters from enemy sensors and is armed with a missile launcher turret. And if you are a commander, you will always be able to organize your troops using the extremely comfortable and ultra-detailed command panel (CC=Command Circuit) which allows you to keep an eye on all the resources of your squad and to assigndifferent tasks to the various players. [VNR] I NEED TO RIDE! - A scenic ride on the wheel of Tribes... And if all this is not enough for you and if you want to go beyond the concept of war by creating your own strategic scenarios? Well, then you can always use the internal editor to create your own custom maps and, who knows, maybe one day the servers will play with them! [VAO]ATTACK THE OBJECTIVE! - Goal analysis. Now that we know how to put on the equipment and repair a plasma turret, let's see what the games in which we will take part consist of. There are nine different game types: TRAINING MISSIONS BOUNTY HUNTERS TEAM HUNTERS DM SIEGE CAPTURE and HOLD CTF RABBIT Let's see them one by one... TRAINING MISSIONS: is a group of five training missions designed specifically for the single player. They constitute a sort of micro-campaign, but are for training purposes only. Note that on the packaging it says ~additive and exciting single player campaign~, uh... ^_^ Basically, it's a game section that won't last more than a couple of hours actually. BOUNTY: each player is assigned a ~prey~ and his goal will be, in fact, to kill it. For each game eliminated, the player receives a certain score, while for each other player eliminated, except your hunter, you receive a penalty. HUNTERS: as in Head Hunters Classic, for Quake3, also in this case you will have to collect trophies for each kill and take them to a collection point, called Nexus, to receive points. The trophies, in this case, are flags and the more he carries with him, the greater the reward will be once he reaches the Nexus. When you kill an opponent, they will drop all flags they currently have on them. TEAM HUNTERS: like HUNTERS but in teams. DEATHMATCH: This is the classic free-for-all matchup, fun for the first five minutes or to practice a bit. SIEGE: SIEGE! This is one of the more interesting modes in Tribes 2. One team takes turns attacking and the other defending. The attacker must be able to penetrate the opposing defenses and touch a CONTROL POINT (CP), in order to conquer the enemy base. At this point, or when time runs out, the roles are reversed. CAPTURE and HOLD: in this other case, there are a certain number of CPs scattered around the map, and each team will have to capture and hold them for as long as possible. CTF: CAPTURE THE FLAG, or capture the flag! This is certainly the main mode of the whole game and is the most practiced on servers around the world. For those unfamiliar with it, the game plan is simple: each team has a flag and the aim is to penetrate the opposing defenses, steal the flag and bring it back to your base. Easy. Do you believe? Naturally, each team will have to adopt an attack and defense strategy and, you can understand, having such an arsenal at your disposal, the possible strategic combinations become really many. RABBIT: it is a mix between the CTF and the DM. There is only one flag and whoever picks it up becomes the target of all other players. The longer you own the flag, the more points you will earn. It should be added that Tribes 2 supports bots, to be able to play even offline (but they can only be used for training). Therefore, we can experiment with the various game modes even without joining a server, but not all maps are playable with bots, unfortunately. [VFF]I HAVE THE ENEMY FLAG! - Multiplayer and Community. We now come to the soul of the whole game, to that beating heart that beats behind this complex scheme of rules, which may seem disarming at the beginning (and not only at the beginning): the Community! At Dynamix they have succeeded in the mammoth feat of bringing together all (or almost all) of the Tribes community within the game interface. So, in addition to the classic chat (which this time really includes almost all existing channels), we will find an e-mail client, renamed t-mail for the occasion, with which we can communicate with any tribber (get used to this term ^^) existing on the globe, a browser with which to browse the profiles of the various players and of the tribes they belong to, a complete forum, where the massive presence of the development team can be seen (those with the |DEV| tag), and even a dedicated page to the news. News that can be entered directly by the players and, after being carefully scrutinized by the Dev-Team, which will be published. All this implements a simple hypertext system and, therefore, the possibility, olthree that to insert various images, to add links to other parts of the community, such as teams, chat channels, web pages (viewable through the external browser of Windows) and so on. As you can see, the community is alive and each player can actively participate in its growth. It is an added value that makes this title not simply a great game, but an experience that goes beyond the games on servers. [VFF]I HAVE THE ENEMY FLAG! - Multiplayer and Community. And now let's talk about the servers. Tribes 2 servers can host a huge amount of players. On one of the Barrysworld servers there is a game (MEGAGAME) which hosts 80 of them! Furthermore, the figure of the administrator has finally been included, who has full powers over the players present. In case the administrator is missing, it is obviously still possible to carry out game control actions, through a classic voting system. Now it has become very dangerous to take hostile attitudes and annoy other players too many times. In the past, on the servers of Tribes (the predecessor), there was some incorrect action, such as the voluntary killing of teammates and the destruction of one's base. Attitudes that, more often than not, were dictated by the frustration of those who don't know how to play, together with a large dose of immaturity. Now, in addition to the instantaneous kick from the server, it is possible to resort to extreme measures to remove the annoying elements, the usual lamers, definitively banning their cd-key. Of course, this is a drastic measure, but it can prove to be the ultimate tool for letting matches be attended by only those who want to have fun and play in full respect of the other people present. [VRG] REPAIR OUR GENERATORS! - Game engine and technical aspects. If Tribes exploited, at least initially, only Glide and then, later, also OpenGL, Tribes 2 already natively exploits OpenGL plus Direct3D (but no longer GLide). The game engine has been completely rewritten compared to the first chapter and a lot of new features have been added. Now, not only are the maps much larger and more detailed, but the effects are much better (some are scary) and elements have been added that were more or less unjustifiably absent before. In the first place, we will finally be able to find water in the Tribes maps, trees and fog (spectacular to see!), not to mention reflection effects and dynamic lighting that cannot be missing nowadays. [VRG] REPAIR OUR GENERATORS! - Game engine and technical aspects. But all this graphics, however, has a price to pay in terms of hardware demands. To play with maximum detail you need a powerful machine, let's say from 700 MHz up and a good video card, with at least 16MB of on board memory, if not more. A lot, cmq, depends on the cpu, given that - for example - on a Duron 800 with TNT2 Ultra the game runs fine by reducing the resolution a little, the detail and playing at 16 bit. But another resource which, unfortunately, this game is greedy of is ram, so if you have less than 128 MB, then be prepared for big breaks and slowdowns due to access to the swap file. Luckily, it is possible to gain some fps by using OpenGL mode, if your video card supports it, instead of Direct3D. The graphic engine is not perfect, we had understood it, but this fact is even more evident during the numerous phases of the game, where serious errors of interpenetration of polygons are noticed, or exaggerated jaggedness at the intersection between different surfaces (observed where the water joins the ground), while in some cases it is even possible to see through the walls! [VRG] REPAIR OUR GENERATORS! - Game engine and technical aspects. Luckily, it is possible to act on numerous video, graphic and texture parameters, so don't despair because, even if you don't have a latest generation super pc, you can still play this splendid product. Another interesting feature is the auto-update function, provided by Sierra, which allows, once the game is started, to download the latest update and install it automatically. It must be said that, while on the one hand the technical deficiencies of the graphics engine are not minimal, on the other hand the development team does its job continuously, supporting the community of players with continuous updates and news.
