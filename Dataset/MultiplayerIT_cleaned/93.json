Even if you set the details to the maximum, it still looks like a game from 2002 or so, and unfortunately the impression is valid not only as regards the technical aspect. The gameplay is very simplified by the standards of the genre and the attempt to mix arcade driving games with skateboarding games has definitely failed. Acceleration takes place automatically, leaving the player with the task of setting the curves, jumping and using the turbo, taking care not to consume too much air reserves, on pain of slowing down. Obviously, bonuses are scattered along the tracks which must be collected in order to obtain various effects: ranging from the classic rings, to be used as currency to buy upgrades in the shop, to air reserves, which allow you to maintain constant speed and be able to use the turbo, up to real weapons to be used against opponents to hinder them. Sonic Riders is old at heart Why are you doing it? Obviously there is no shortage of secret areas to be reached with millimeter leaps and shortcuts to be taken when you have perfect knowledge of the circuits. In some situations it will be necessary to move the ~right~ and ~left~ keys quickly to obtain speed in short ~scripted~ sections of the circuit, where we will have no other form of control over our character. Ramps will also be distributed along the tracks that will allow you to perform long jumps in which we will be able to do acrobatics which, based on the difficulty and execution, will earn us a score. To complicate the situation there will be various factors, including air trails and other specific obstacles for each path, such as stalagmites inside an ice cave or incandescent liquid flows inside a factory. In addition to the story mode, there are other rather classic modes: the single race, a championship made up of five circuits, the timed race, the survival mode, the multiplayer mode, not online, the mission mode (you have to carry out specific tasks in each race) and team mode. Most of these would adapt very well to online ... too bad it has not been implemented and that, after finishing the story mode, the desire to try the others is close to zero. Chaos The big problem with Sonic Riders is that it fails where it should excel: it lacks speed and fun. The control system is elementary but from the beginning it appears inadequate to guarantee a minimum challenge. Especially in the first few games, chaos reigns and it is often not clear what is happening on the screen. The result is that you often finish first without really knowing how, while other times you finish in the last positions despite having played in a similar way. The situation improves with experience, but not by much. The driving technique therefore ends up counting for little, certainly much less than memorizing the circuits to know in advance where to position yourself to collect the various bonuses. Once you practice and understand how everything works, you can have some fun, but you never get to the exaltation you can try with other titles in which speed and disengagement always count (for example OutRun 2006, always from Sega). Paradoxically, to play decently, you need to develop a technique that has little to do with the actual driving (by the way, use any joypad to play, with the keyboard the situation is even worse than the one described). The circuit design itself seems made to frustrate, almost never allowing you to whiz freely and oppressing with an unbearable series of structural ~gadgets~ scattered here and there, which should increase the variety but which only end up poisoning. The developers should have better studied the balance achieved by Nintendo with its Mario Karts, rather than aiming for an indiscriminate accumulation of elements, which only end up confusing. Old old gen Finally, the conversion factor finally brings the situation down. Sonic Riders is a mediocre old-generation game that becomes bad if you carry it over to the new one. Even the console versions didn't shine in terms of technique... proposing, after a year, the same bad textures, the same three-dimensional models and the same identical circuits (which stand out only for the general visual poverty) is depressing. The bright colors and the sympathy of the characters, to be verified, don't help. Also some effects seem to not work properly, such as the AA that produces irrelevant improvements on the image. Let's also include the audio sector, characterized by musicand techno in the long run boring and annoying sound effects (such as that of the air trails that imprison the characters), and you will understand why we consider the release of this title on the PC market superfluous and badly programmed. Perhaps a release at the same time as the other versions would have made sense. But the delayed release, the numerous problems illustrated above and, more generally, the poor overall quality, make it deserve a corner in the exclusive club of titles to be absolutely left in stores, real or virtual.

Perhaps it will be appreciated by PC owners who do not have a console and who want to dabble with something disengaged but why, then, not look elsewhere? There are arcade racing games that are of much higher quality and are found at much more affordable prices. I mean, you haven't figured it out yet? Leave it alone. Pro There is Sonic... if you like the character The Italian translation is impeccable Practiced can also entertain for a few games Cons Chaotic Technically Jurassic and lacking in style Online is completely missing Those who don't die see each other again Sonic seems to be a commercially very lively brand, but qualitatively fluctuating between highs and lows (especially lows), and therefore decidedly unfriendly. Indeed, let's say better: it is now rare to find a title in the series that is worth buying. Obviously it no longer makes sense to compare it with its old direct competitor at the time of the war between the 16bit consoles, that Mario who now looks at it from unattainable peaks of excellence, despite having a few more years on his shoulders. Sonic Riders, the latest digital incarnation of the blue hedgehog is here to remind us that there is never an end to the worst You have seen the vote at the bottom of the page. Now we need to explain the reasons given that it is decidedly lower than that of the console versions, released a year ago. The game looks bad from the start, with a movie that aims to be cool to the point of being just in bad taste, thanks to a mix of techno music, fake visionary images and bright colors. The concept of the game is clear right away: taking the characters from Sonic's world, you attach them skateboard-like flying boards (do you know Back to the Future 2?) and make them run along improbable tracks, seasoning everything with a plot bordering on neural death, so as not to imply that you simply have to take part in a series of races stuck one after the other. The enemies on duty are a team of skilled skaters assisted by the ever-present Dr. Eggman, a classic nemesis who has been tormenting the life of the fastest hero in the world of video games since time immemorial. After such an exciting premise, one just wants to skip the various cutscenes and jump into the fray, to dart like crazy... but something is not right.", "date": "2007-02-14", "grade": null}
