{"name": "Ikaruga - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ikaruga-recensione.html", "text": "Thanks to Radiant Silvergun, a fabulous shooter for Saturn dated 1998, Treasure has consecrated its name in the Olympus of game designers, entering the hearts of millions of fans. Who, starting from that year, began to hope and wait for a second episode, capable of setting a new milestone in the genre in question. And so when, a few years later, there was talk of an ~RS-2 project~ that Treasure herself was working on for Coin-op, everyone thought that the right time had finally come to get callouses on their fingertips again. And indeed the story went like this, but with a new name: Ikaruga. 50mb of passion After having delighted us with another masterpiece of the Dreamcast era, Rez, the XBLA service of Xbox 360 takes out a new ace from its sleeve thus offering the effort of Treasure, at the ~usual~ 800 points equivalent to about 9 euros. Money well spent, for anyone with the slightest interest in this type of ~old school~ experience, very demanding but sensationally rewarding and satisfying. Compared to the so-called ~conventional~ shooters, Ikaruga brought (and carries) with it an atypical and original basic rule, actually partially borrowed from the beautiful Silhoutte Mirage of the same softco. In practice, by simply pressing a button, it is possible to invert the polarity of your ship, and therefore make it change color from white to black. Similarly, all the enemies on the screen are also characterized by one or another chromatic predominance. And so here is the simple but extraordinarily intriguing strategic component that enhances Ikaruga: in practice hitting an opponent of the opposite color leads to inflicting double the damage, thus allowing you to get the better of hostile spaceships in less time. On the contrary, however, your own shuttle can absorb bullets of the same color, becoming effectively invulnerable and thus being able to fill a special bar located at the bottom of the screen, which then allows you to perform a particularly effective special attack. The choice is therefore up to the player, whether to choose a defensive conduct by absorbing bullets, or rather an attack bringing double the damage; all this always in the awareness that, at the same time, there may also be dozens of enemies of opposite polarities on the screen, thus requiring choices to be made very quickly in order not to reach game over soon. To all this is also added a puzzle component, since eliminating at least 3 enemies of the same color in a row gives life to a chain which, multiplied and carried forward as far as possible, allows you to increase your score and the grade achieved at the end of the level. All this leads to the result that being able to face Ikaruga perfectly is an exercise in passion, perseverance, attention, dedication, memory and reflexes capable of exalting fans of the genre in an absolute way, but also of being too demanding for casual players. A treasure for everyone? In reality, Treasure has also thought of this last category of players, or at least has given them the opportunity to slightly lower the accessibility threshold of Ikaruga by intervening on factors such as the level of difficulty, the number of lives and continuous available . The fact remains that playing Ikaruga in a superficial way, quite simply, does not give particular satisfaction; the game is played in layers, at levels to be explored step by step, and to do this requires a lot of dedication and commitment. So yes, it's a hardcore product, which does nothing to hide it. As for the conversion process, quoting Rez again, the switch to 360 hasn't brought such a radical technical improvement. Visually it is largely the same compared to the Arcade, Dreamcast and Gamecube versions, however obviously enjoying the high resolution for greater cleanliness and general graphic brilliance. However, it remains an aesthetically very pleasant product, characterized by an inspired artistic direction and capable of optimally exploiting 2D sprites and three-dimensional backdrops. However, vertical scrolling makes more than half the screen of a 16:9 TV unused, so if the 360 is connected to a screen that is not very generous in terms of inches, you need to prepare for a very small play area. The most important addition of this edition is therefore undoubtedly the online multiplayer, which obviously adds to the local one; our experience in this sense has been quite positive, even if not without some very slight lag which, however, becomes very harmful within the gameplay of Ikaruga. Lastly, the ability to record replays of one's own games should be mentioned, egto be able to show the world their qualities. Comment Ikaruga is a faithful conversion of one of the best old school shot'em ups of the new millennium. The additions compared to the editions for Dreamcast and Gamecube are limited to a greater graphic cleaning, to the discreet online multiplayer and little else, and consequently those who already own the Treasure product in a previous incarnation should evaluate whether this is sufficient to justify the purchase. For those who have not had the opportunity to play it previously, the download is almost obligatory but be careful: Ikaruga is not to be taken lightly, it is not accommodating and does not give great satisfaction if played superficially. So get ready to give him several hours of your life, or leave it alone. It's not a challenge for everyone, that's for sure. Pros A masterpiece of the genre Really fulfilling Technically great Cons Little new compared to DC and GC Too challenging for some Xbox 360 - Goals The 200 points available are, also in this case, placed at various levels of ~depth~: and so if scarce half of them can be obtained simply by progressing in the game, for the others one must commit to earning marks higher than A, or even get to the end without using continue.", "date": "2008-05-08", "grade": null}
