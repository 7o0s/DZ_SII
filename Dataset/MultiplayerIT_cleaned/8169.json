This is Far Cry 3. We are facing a return to the origins of the franchise since today we find ourselves in a huge lush archipelago in Southeast Asia, a real piece of paradise reduced to hell on earth, among pirates, psychopaths, mercenaries and exalted queens of the jungle. But the cast doesn't end there, during the long adventure other people will cross the path of the protagonist Jason Brody, putting him in front of extreme choices, constantly balancing on the verge of madness. The initial incipit is trivial and inflated, but luckily for us the development often takes unexpected turns that deviate from the typical canon of first person shooters. Jason Brody, his brother and an assorted group of friends and girlfriends are on vacation somewhere in Bangkok, between drugs, big drinks, frenetic dancing and extreme sports. In short, as perfect American B-movie tourists, they don't miss anything, but when they end up on the wrong island, that of pirates, by parachuting, their vacation will turn into a nightmare, made up of violence, harassment and certain death. Jason is the perfect anti-hero, thanks to his military brother on leave he manages to escape from the prison in which Vaas, the psychopathic head of the pirates had thrown them, but right at the climax he remains alone against everyone and completely fasting on any notion of how to survive in a very different place from the streets of California. Far Cry 3 starts here. Jason must be able to save his companions and avenge his brother, and to do this he will have to ally himself with the ~good~ inhabitants of the island, fighting against the pirates. The awareness of the protagonist is one of the strengths of the title. At first Jason is fearful and fearful and recalcitrant, just wanting to find his friends and run away. As the story progresses he becomes a man, he understands that there is something more at stake and that he has a precise role in the fate of the island, in short, he is the chosen one, he will have to make difficult choices that will mark him deeply. In short, a beautiful story, staged in a rather original way, narrated without slowing down and in some ways inventive, with well-characterized memorable characters and full of twists, adult and never banal. How tough is the adventure The game mechanics are therefore those of discovery, exploration and survival, obviously declined between main and ~secondary~ missions. This subdivision is completely functional to the growth of the character. In short, Ubisoft was able to not make the assignments other than the main storyline something accessory and secondary, useful only to arrive at a typical free roaming number of hours. The discovery and exploration pass through the conquest of the thirty-four enemy outposts and the unlocking of the radio towers. Clearing outposts is used to gain additional ~fast travel~ points and to access vending machines for weapons, ammunition, armor and medicine. The radio towers, on the other hand, allow us to make the roads clear on the map, but also chests, herbs to collect, relics, other assignments and to access free weapons in shops. Survival goes through hunting. We don't kill animals to eat, luckily we don't have to refresh ourselves, but to exponentially increase the accoutrements Jason wears. We start with low ammo, the machete and only one weapon slot. Holsters, backpack, grenade pouches, RPG rocket pods, ammo, flamethrower reload pouches, and even your wallet can all be made more capacious by skinning animals. We also have to collect herbs to create medical kits, but also real status buffs to broaden the senses, useful both in battle and for hunting. Hunting, outposts and luggage are therefore inextricably linked. Freeing an outpost means being able to move freely in the ~clean~ area without the hassle of patrols, or hunting without fear of alerting someone, at the same time we can find announcements on notice boards that give us the opportunity to track down and kill particular animals that they give access to the maximum development of our equipment. Therefore, it is not enough just to go to the presumed passage area of the animals, we need to free all the outposts if we want to bring the capacity of the paraphernalia to the maximum levels. As for the hunt itself, it's not just pigeon shooting. Killing goats and deer is easy enough, if they don't run, but when it comes to wild boars, mad dogs, bears, tigers, leopards, dragons,komodo or sharks you have to be very careful, make little noise (equipping the bow or weapons with a silencer) and strike from a distance, hoping that the pack does not want to defend itself. In short, here too there is a lot to play, perfectly grafted into the game mechanics. Customizing your alter ego doesn't just include expanding your equipment. Everything you do in the game, from simple headshots to completed main missions, increases our experience. When leveling up, it is possible to spend the points earned in three branches, real perks, which correspond to clearly visible tribal tattoos on the protagonist's left arm, thus making explicit his being the chosen one who has decided to choose the path of the warrior. Heron, spider and shark, these are the three branches: spending points wisely changes the way in which you decide to play. For example, net of the perks that give us access to the increase in health, the more effective restoration of the same through injections and the doubling of skins in hunting, it is generally possible to specialize Jason making him more effective from a distance, therefore with the use of firearms, or amplifying its stealth abilities for silent takedowns. It is a very important choice, given the great freedom given to the player in choosing the approach to the clashes. The jungle on consoles The Xbox 360 version undoubtedly has a good impact but denounces a visible downgrade compared to the PC counterpart. The level of detail is lower, except for the excellent facial animations, and above all a recurring aliasing on the structures is noticeable. In terms of effects, the compromises are less evident and the colors are vivid and convincing. The frame rate, granitic on PC, is a hair limp here, we are not faced with slowdowns but you feel that the console version has a ~lower gear~. The biggest difference can only be on the visual horizon. In fact, all the elements on the distance often become poorly defined, without however resulting in annoying pop-up and pop-in phenomena. Ultimately Far Cry 3 is undoubtedly a product of great workmanship on consoles, it only lacks in detail and visual cleanliness, and it could not be otherwise given the vastness of the game world. The impact is nonetheless respectable. Strategy and Tactics And here we come to the second strong point of the game. The capture of outposts is a perfect example of freedom of action. They are small sandboxes where the player has to decide whether to study the area, finding the access points to the opponents' structures and weaknesses, or throw himself inside, guns blazing, hoping to kill everyone before reinforcements arrive. Tactical reconnaissance therefore plays a key role. Thanks to the camera we can discover secondary entrances, highlight the enemies present, ~tagging~ them even through foliage and walls and distinguishing them by type, and perhaps find out if there are cages to be destroyed in order to free wild animals, to throw the outpost into turmoil , but also and above all it allows us to see where the alarm is. If you manage to put it out of action without being seen, sneaking silently and throwing stones to divert the enemy patrols, the reinforcements will no longer be able to arrive, making our task much easier. It is therefore clear how many variations are involved and we never get to talking about repetitiveness thanks to the level design of the outposts and their location within the various places on the island. This pattern is repeated for most of the many complex main missions which are undoubtedly characterized by great variety and inventiveness. Impossible here to try to make a summary of the best ones, also in order not to run into dangerous spoilers, but we can say that they enhance the deeply stealth soul of the game, which is the best way to fully enjoy the complex shooter mechanics staged by Ubisoft . It is not simply a question of storming ~larger outposts~, in some situations we have to find and kill particular opponents without alerting all the soldiers on guard, in others the stealth soul is total, and here we unfortunately have to take into account that the lack of an internal map of the structures causes Far Cry 3 to expire almost in a repetitive trial and error to understand where to go and there are also exploratory sections that almost make us talk about a platform drift, complete with small environmental puzzles to solve. To close the range of game variety we find psychedelic phases, given that madness is the stylistic hallmark of Far Cry 3. These are induced by drugs or poison, in some cases lReality is distorted, the edges of the screen are altered, Jason has to fight personal and imaginary demons, all visually rendered with great style and effectiveness and manages to bring to mind the best moments of the first Max Payne. In short, Ubisoft has really done an exceptional job of trying to make the many hours of gameplay (we completed it in twelve actual hours, with only forty percent total completion) as diverse as possible, you don't get to the end out of breath, given that, at the risk of repeating ourselves, freedom of choice and level design really allow us to change the cards on the table, turning trivial shootings into a sort of cat-and-mouse game, where we can take advantage of all the possibilities that our arsenal and the terrain offer us. If I study I win The artificial intelligence of the opponents offers an adequate challenge rate even if there have been cases in which their behavioral routines have gone into crisis facilitating our task. The subdivision of the enemies into different categories and their strong visual and auditory ability really work to complicate the dynamics of the action, and in this sense they are the confirmation that looking for the ~reasoned~ approach is the real raison d'etre of the game. Obviously we can ignore it and throw ourselves into action without thoughts, but among snipers in raised positions, possessed kamikazes throwing Molotov cocktails, armored personnel carriers equipped with flamethrowers (to be killed from behind by unlocking the dedicated perk or by placing a mine or C4 at their feet) , riflemen in cover from easy grenades and fixed positions you can really die within a fraction of a second. Precisely the almost strategic nature of the clashes brings with it a non-secondary criticality. Spawn points are often visible. If we add the persistent tag of the enemies to this, it is possible to resolve the most complicated situations with relative ease, it being understood that this ~ease~ is given by painstaking planning and study of the opponents in the field. Once the campaign is over (from the double ending) the endgame remains open so that we can complete, if we want, all the other activities left aside to maximize experience and perks. In addition to the hunt and the outposts, there are all the Rakyat trials, i.e. timed mini-games with online rankings that engage us in various reinterpretations of the horde mode, car races, targeted assassinations, missions for the ~good~ inhabitants of the island or tests with various weapons. In short, there is no shortage of variety here too, there is a nice incentive to continue playing once the game is over. The other two incentives for keeping Far Cry 3 discs in the player are multiplayer and online co-op. In the first case, the game offer is the typical one, with different modes, among which those with multiple objectives stand out in a good number of maps and an equipment and experience system shared with the cooperative. The latter is undoubtedly the most interesting part of the lot. The story takes place six months earlier than the campaign and sees us in the shoes of four rather disturbed characters who manage to escape being boarded by the usual pirates of the cruise ship where they work. Once on the island, the story unfolds through six rather long chapters that see us engaged in rather varied situations. Sieges, conquests, bombs to defend and racing mini-games, all in the name of close collaboration between the various classes that can be chosen and which works perfectly within the level design of the maps. The customization is that of a generic competitive FPS, with the possibility of leveling up to unlock new weapons, equipment, optics, skills (reworked, but taken weight from the campaign perk) and war cries, i.e. status buffs that can increase the offensive and defensive stats of the character and his companions. The game dynamics are obviously, given the presence of four players, more devoted to the attack, more ~caciarone~ than the campaign, but they still manage to insert an approach within the frenzy of the clashes in which each player has his own role, where there is a need to actively cooperate to get to the next checkpoint. Xbox 360 goals Far Cry 3 rewards the player with fifty trophies. Most are obtained by completing the main missions of the campaign and those of the cooperative, while others engage us in particular situations related to character customization and the use of all his equipment. There are also objectives relating to secret objects and collectibles, the use of particular perks and the killing of enemies using me", "date": "2012-11-21", "grade": "9.3"}
