In short, an authentic double somersault in terms of concept, which however appears far from risky considering the traditionally excellent feeling between this peculiar videogame genre and touch support. So let's see if Pandora can also be appreciated from another point of view. Mean booty You certainly can't blame 2K's intention to change register with regard to this iOS incarnation of Borderlands, given the impossibility of faithfully reproducing the typical gameplay of the series away from its platforms of origin. However, after trying Borderlands Legends it's hard to tear yourself away from the feeling that it could have been done much better with the material available. Without bothering to give even a shred of narrative background, the game immediately puts the user at the center of the action through a tutorial that sheds light on the basic playful dynamics. Brick, Roland, Mordecai and Lilith are controlled by tracing on the screen the path that you want them to take, with the fire being managed automatically by the AI based on the range of each one's weapon. The four characters have three different special abilities which are recharged after each use and which can be activated by pressing one of the boxes at the top of the interface. These are old acquaintances of the original Borderlands (Roland's turret, Mordecai's Bloodwing and so on) to which are added some new features designed especially for the occasion. Furthermore, in each protagonist's equipment peeks out a unique utility that serves to give a certain type of support to one of the companions, to be used by drawing a line between the sender and the recipient of the effect: Roland can heal health, Brick restore shields, Lilith increase movement speed and Mordecai improve weapon damage. In short, on paper, Borderlands Legends would appear to be a well-structured strategic one, equally divided between the homages to the source material and the need to have its own personality, also given the change of genre. Too bad, however, that in practice everything translates into a mess on which a play structure that is too light and repetitive and a control system that is not up to the task weigh. Let's start from the first point: the ~missions~ (the quotation marks are a must) that are entrusted to the user are resolved in simple successions of a handful of scenarios in which the goal is always to survive the waves of enemies, collecting money to spend on new equipment at Marcus' distributors and grinding experience levels that give access to new branches of each character's unique - and rather limited - skill tree. If the variety is not a trademark of Borderlands Legends, it certainly cannot be said that things are better looking at the mere quality of the playful action. Things get too confusing already from the first levels of the game, with the user struggling to harmoniously manage the four at his commands, who for their part do their best to put a spanner in the works, showing off a 'artificial intelligence nothing that even prevents him from going around an obstacle independently. On the control system front, a chronic lack of precision is palpable, with inputs that are caught late when not completely ignored, and for a title that relies so much on the need to make punctual touches and swipes, this is a flaw not recently. It is also sad to note that a founding element of Borderlands such as that of loot is here reduced to a mere side dish, for an objectively unsuccessful product that can be said to share only the characters and graphic style with the original, reproduced here with a framed cosmetic from a bird's eye view that does its duty without infamy and without praise.", "date": "2012-11-06", "grade": "5.0"}
