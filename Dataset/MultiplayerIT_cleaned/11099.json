{"name": "Car Jack Streets", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/car-jack-streets_a.html", "text": "It has been ten years since the release of the first episode of Grand Theft Auto. We all know the series created by Rockstar Games, after all it represents one of the most successful franchises in the video game market, with several million copies sold for all formats and an increasingly enthusiastic reception from industry critics. GTA has not always been set in a three-dimensional and realistic way, however: the first two chapters were characterized by a modest technical realization, limited even for a console like the first PlayStation, with a top view and extensive use of zoom for represent the transition from the ~on foot~ phases to those by car. The world of mobile gaming has long felt the need for such a product, especially in terms of substance and freedom of movement, and there have already been some attempts to bring something similar to the first GTA to the screen of our mobile phones. Now the developers of Tag Games have their say on the subject with Car Jack Streets: a successful clone or another missed opportunity? The introductory phase of the game explains the situation and introduces the main characters, then we immediately jump into the action: we will have to get $50,000 a week and bring it to the boss we owe, for a total of more or less five months of missions important. Five real months, not virtual ones: one of the peculiar characteristics of Car Jack Streets is the fact that it synchronizes with the time and date of our mobile phone, proceeding in real time. If in the game we have an appointment at three in the afternoon, we will have to show up at the place precisely at three in the afternoon. Although this is not a novelty with regard to video games in general, nothing of the kind had yet been seen in the mobile sector, and this element alone gives us an idea of the longevity of the Tag Games title. The structure is very similar to that of the first Grand Theft Auto, with a view from above (no zoom, however) and the possibility of proceeding within the city on foot or aboard one of the fourteen vehicles available, divided between cars and heavy vehicles. Each car has different values in terms of speed, road holding and handling, values which translate into profoundly different behavior on the road. We will therefore have to become familiar with the various vehicles, identifying those with which we find ourselves better, and do the same with a simple control system that can hide pitfalls. We will be able to move the character in eight directions using the d-pad, pick up weapons by passing over them (an icon at the top of the screen will show us the equipped weapon and the remaining ammunition), fire by pressing the * or # keys and enter any vehicle with key 5. Things get slightly more complicated when you move on to the driving phases: by pressing the d-pad up and down you can select the various travel speeds and possibly engage reverse gear, while steering with the right and left. The fundamental point is that in this case the controls are related to the car and not to the screen, so you need to practice a little to master the vehicles and very often we will end up colliding with something. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence is not one of the strengths of Car Jack Streets, and this translates into continuous rear-end collisions and consequent traffic blocks, which in case of danger (perhaps while the police are looking for us) can lead to episodes of frustration . The missions that we can accept to earn money are divided into various types, but in any case they involve reaching certain areas of the city. We will not be able to have a map, but we will still have a GPS that will indicate (by means of arrows) the position of the objective. Just as the first GTA didn't boast spectacular graphics for its time, so Car Jack Streets isn't surprising for the technical solutions adopted: the design of the characters and cars is really essential, even if it must be said that the map is very extended and we are probably facing one of the few mobile games that can count on such numbers. The sound sector consists of some discreet music and a series of sampled effects which unfortunately generate an annoying slowdown on some terminals. Pros: A successful clone of the first GTA Respectable numbers Simple control system... Against: ...even if driving is a bit difficult Mediocre AI Graphics far from spectacular", "date": "2008-10-28", "grade": "S.V."}
