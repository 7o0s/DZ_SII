Since March 2007, an impressive number of gamers have been waiting for this moment, the sequel to the automotive messiah who has always stood out for being a real car encyclopedia, made up of passion but also lots of fun and an enviable completeness, perhaps never reached by other productions of the genre. It's been years of expectations, delays and new loves blossoming, now it's time to send your partners to rest and focus on Gran Turismo 5, whose release, for better or for worse, represents a historic moment for all fans of above. For our part, it's been six days of intense, constant and exhausting tests with steering wheel and pad, and we're finally ready to have our say on the latest, literal, effort by the Japanese Polyphony and Mr. Kazunori Yamauchi. Gran Turismo 5 is a contradictory title in practically all its aspects which potentially as content could have easily aspired to the maximum vote, but it is the result of extremely questionable development and marketing choices, and of a Japanese market that struggles to adapt to quality standards and today's times. Take it as a joke, but once all the characteristics of the game (as it is today) were fixed, another six months to perfect and complete everything would have been a godsend and would have done full justice to what is still a title of an enviable depth and complexity, but which was clearly put on the market because it was no longer time to wait. In any case and even if this preamble could cause more than a few concerns, there is a lot of good in the game and we will not fail to describe it in the next few lines. A difficult legacy A lot of water has passed under the bridge after GT4, between excellent car simulations and completely new hardware for Polyphony, but the style has remained intact, and what appears to the player's eyes is obsessive in terms of detail, starting naturally from the game menu and from the introduction of almost 7 minutes, something rarely seen in such productions. Between the fully configurable management of the pad keys, through the personalized music taken from your dashboard, to the management of the steering wheels and the game hud - unfortunately not completely removable - there is enough ~stuff~ to configure. The installation of the game is highly recommended to speed up everything and can be done all together in about 40/50 minutes for the beauty of 10 GB of space occupied or in a dynamic way and in ~background~ as you access the various tracks and options. We were talking about automotive passion, and GT TV is the first summation of this statement, with a section dedicated to a myriad of videos from sporting events around the world or services that revolve around the best racing cars around, all of excellent quality and with complete management of downloads and favourites. No more talk, as always, the Gran Turismo series offers its career and simulation part on the one hand, and the arcade part on the other. In the second, it is possible to immediately jump onto the track with your favorite circuit and car (be careful though, some are unlocked in career mode) and choose between free practice, drifting or a race according to three difficulty levels. The GT mode is instead the viaticum for the interface which represents the beating heart of the game and all the good things it has to offer. Between menus and submenus with superimposed windows there is the risk of getting lost and not seeing all the available options; however, the order and coherence of the whole soon take over and after the initial bewilderment one begins to become familiar with the various shortcuts and possibilities. The structure that forms the basis for the entire career of Gran Turismo 5 provides an interesting progressive and exponential level system, separately for the A-Spec and B-Spec modes. The second can be defined as a ~mirror~ version of the first, where it is possible to manage a group of drivers with physical and mental characteristics in the same events, put them on the track by choosing one of the cars in one's possession and watch the race with three basic commands are available to manage the behavior of the pilot. The roster is indeed quite limited and this mode is aimed at super fanatics who love telemetry and who want to enjoy the beauty of GT5 replays, also because there is no option to speed up the game time, which would have been extremely welcome. In any case, any event completed con success in the top positions or with the relative trophy allows you to acquire experience points in addition to credits, according to a ~grinding~ system that encourages the player to continue also because each competition has a specific level prerequisite, as well as the cars available at dealerships. The first way to climb quickly is represented by licenses, an evergreen that in Gran Turismo 5 is completely optional but in some challenges it is interesting and suitable for newcomers to the series. It is advisable to do as many as possible at the beginning because the experience points then become low and completing them also allows you to get some bonuses and a nice trophy to show off in your gamertag. motor show When the going gets tough it's time instead to head towards the A-Spec section, which offers five series, from Beginner to Extreme, each of which with nine different competitions according to the classic structure which provides restrictions for each of them beyond level to participate. We therefore have one-make races (the most beautiful obviously concern Ferrari and Lamborghini), or for rear-wheel drive cars, of a certain nationality or continent or of predefined historical periods. At the highest levels, things get ~complicated~, with events that include mini-championships or the participation of racing cars of over 900 horsepower, to get to Formula 1, the Nascar series and the Endurance series. This type of structure works quite well in terms of variety and in directing the player to choose as many cars as possible but there are still some balancing problems because in some events the restrictions are too weak and therefore it is enough to upgrade the car in one's possession to easily get the better of it on opponents; For example, it would have been enough to impose a limit also on the maximum number of horses to mitigate this situation. However, where the game gives a decisive push in terms of fun and variety in support of the excellent progression with the levels is in the special events. At each bracket it is possible to participate in kart races, practice with Nascar cars, become more and more familiar with the Nurburgring and so on, up to the rally races on snow and asphalt and the Grand Tour, a very interesting mode where, through interlude sequences we start from Bern to get to Rome through various dedicated races. In these situations, the sense of progression is perfectly balanced because most of the time it is the game that decides which car to use, it is also an interesting way to learn the different driving model of Nascar and rally cars, as well as to unlock for example the Nurburgring Nordschleife track in arcade mode and free trial. Without cars, however, you go nowhere, and Gran Turismo 5 provides an initial amount of credits and two dealers for new and used cars, which also represent the element of distinction for the thousand and one vehicles present. In the first case it is possible to buy the now famous Premium machines (just over two hundred), created from scratch for this version of the game and equipped with incredible detail from a polygonal point of view, from the external details but also from the interiors, with the view from extremely detailed dashboard (on three different zoom levels) and the rear one with almost obsessive elements; a true test of strength by Polyphony for a quality simply unattainable elsewhere. The second-hand dealer instead makes available in a cyclical way (as happens in GT for PSP) the standard cars, which have been borrowed from the previous chapter and brought into high definition with slight tweaks. Their quality is obviously lower and depends from model to model, you can hardly notice it on the track when you are focused on the race, much more in replays or when taking photos, not to mention that the view from the dashboard is not available for these models , cosmetic damage (we'll get back to that shortly) is less visible and there's a few less customization possibilities (the infamous wheel rims for example, so dear to our Console War forum users ;)). The quantity of cars is therefore very high, the variety good but not excellent because often and willingly there are multiple models of the same vehicle in the face of some strange shortcomings (especially aimed at the models of the last two years of medium/low engine capacity cars), which which somewhat mitigates the ~power~ of this number. It goes without saying that this gap between standard and premium models leads to choosing and spending credits when possible only on the latter type, also because by definition those who play Gran Turismo 5 love motor racing and seere le premium in replays but also in the details is good for the heart and the eyes. On the track In this sense, the section called photographic journey is the extreme synthesis of the passion that Polyphony has put into his creature, which can never be criticized. You choose one of the scenarios present (some are unlocked with the Grand Tour) between Kyoto, Bern but also San Gimignano and Siena - Mr. Yamauchi loves Italy, you can see it in many small details - you set the camera positioning and finally the one of the car in a painstaking way, with even the positioning of the wheels and the on/off status of the high and low beams. At this point you enter the photo mode (also available for replays) where there are a series of menus that will make photography enthusiasts gloat, with the management of filters, focal length, aperture and so on. The result is incredible and you can create real 1080p posters to use as wallpaper or simply to look at for personal enjoyment. It's time to finally get on track! The Gran Turismo series has always been famous for offering an extremely fun driving model that does not adhere to the subtitle it boasts (The Real Driving Simulator), in Gran Turismo 5 this tradition is maintained but with some more appreciable results. Let's start from the physics and the driving model, the steps forward compared to the GT Prologue are definitely evident in the behavior of the car, provided of course that all the aids (TCS, ABS, ESP, anti-slip) are deactivated. The different type of traction and the setting of the car starting from wheels and suspensions visibly affect the reaction of the car on the track, with credible management of understeer and oversteer and nervous reactions in relation to the type of engine under the bonnet , not to mention the different grip in the event of rain or on dirt and snow. Obviously realism and fun ~explode~ when dealing with the most powerful racing cars, where the sense of speed is absolutely satisfying and where the balance of physics naturally leads to having fun and wanting to try the tracks over and over again. When ~sacred monsters~ such as the Nurburgring Nordschleife, Suzuka or the Circuit de la Sarthe which hosts the 24 hours of Le Mans take to the field, driving in the latest Polyphony effort is an experience to remember in all respects All. The pad fulfills its purpose and its keys are fully configurable, unfortunately the age-old problem of the Dual Shock 3 triggers creates some problems when you want to play for example without ABS and in general it is not ideal for fully appreciating the physics game or for example for Nascar, where keeping the trajectory is almost vital to get the gold. The steering wheel is therefore rightly the definitive solution to fully enjoy Gran Turismo 5. In our specific test we used the game thanks to the Porsche 911 GT3 RS kindly made available by the German manufacturer Fanatec complete with aluminum pedals and stand. In this configuration, the Polyphony title becomes even more satisfying but also more demanding in managing curves and avoiding spins, where each curb is ~feel~ more and the force feedback contributes to the realism of the whole. As implied several times, Polyphony has set Gran Turismo 5 as a progressive video game where things are gradually unlocked and increasingly challenging races are accessed. The same thing goes for the skill of the opponents and the artificial intelligence, which in the highest level competitions abandons (although not entirely) the famous trains in place of more credible battles, off the track and even a few spins and counters in their own comparisons. Does it break or not? Unfortunately it's not all rosy, starting with the aesthetic and mechanical damage, the historic lack of the saga. In this chapter the former are present and as regards premium cars also very convincing from a purely visual point of view. The problem is that you have to crash many times and at high speed to see coherent effects, not to mention that some cars come to lose bumpers or doors, others have deformations as the maximum value and the standards are reduced to scratches and little else, for a result which appears more sketchy than realistic. After successfully exceeding level 20 and reaching extreme races, we can also state that the presence of mechanical damage is limited to tire and fuel consumption in specific races as well as engine overhaul and car stiffness restoration after several events. completed, but we are at minimum wage and the rest have probably been eliminated due to prolongation", "date": "2010-11-25", "grade": "8.9"}
