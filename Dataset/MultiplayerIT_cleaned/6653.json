{"name": "Kalimba che sopresa!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142766-kalimba-kalimba-che-sopresa.html", "text": "Press Play returns to the platform scene with Kalimba, a very colorful little title that has just arrived on the Xbox One marketplace and which will also arrive in the Windows version in January. The plot, which sees an island threatened by a shaman and small totem-shaped characters determined to defeat him, is a mere pretext to give life to one of the ideas formulated by the Strandby brothers during the development of Max: The Curse of Brotherhood. And it is the third time that the team acquired by Microsoft in 2012 tackles the most classic of videogame genres trying to broaden its horizons. But this new experiment does not include artistic ambitions and felt-tip pens. Kalimba is played with just two keys and the difference compared to the classic platform is all in the structure of the game that asks us to control two characters at the same time. Sometimes these move a few steps away or are even on each other's shoulders, guaranteeing the one above the double jump, while in other cases it is necessary to exploit obstacles and particular power-ups to ~desynchronize~ the movements of the two and to ensure that they can, with the help of our skilled hands, overcome the most complex obstacles. This is the basic concept but the elements that contribute to enriching it are innumerable. When the two characters are facing different paths, the movements they have to make are similar, also because otherwise it would be impossible to move forward, but in the vast majority of cases the visual layout of the path is different and this factor often confuses the senses. Furthermore, the enemies are often positioned differently and in this case it is necessary to take into account two different situations with the result that our eyes dart from one part of the screen to another in an attempt to keep an eye on the whole screen. An almost impossible task when the speed of the action intensifies and often death is the only solution to be able to understand how to get by between crumbling platforms, slippery surfaces, trampolines, enemies who run towards us at different speeds and rooms dungeons with extreme platforming sessions. The action, in essence, is quite excited but Kalimba is a varied title that does not make us miss changes of pace, more reasoned moments and situations to be overcome by relying on one's instinct. There are specific areas, highlighted with clearly visible colors, which can be crossed by only one of the two characters and it is here that the second key intervenes which allows us to quickly exchange the position of the two small totems entrusted to our hands. We can say that this is the main mechanic of the title and generates, in combination with the level design, an infinity of situations. In some cases we are called to quickly switch the two characters, sometimes while they are in free fall along a tunnel full of obstacles, to ensure that the right one is always at the barrier of its color. But swapping characters also allows us to change how the gravity-altering power-up works. In one mode, one of the two totems finds itself on the ceiling opposite its partner. By inverting the two protagonists, however, both are sucked towards the center of the screen and can flutter by hopping against each other's feet. The magic is born by alternating the two modes in the middle of the action, which makes it possible to make immense leaps as long as you can control your inertia. At this point we are getting an idea of the variety of Kalimba but that's not all. Even the most reasoned moments often rely on this mechanic that we often find combined with two switches, each of which can only be activated by a specific character. And the discussion is further articulated when one of the two characters obtains a power-up that is needed in a certain area of the level which can become unreachable precisely because of the peculiarities of the power-ups. These, in fact, can magnify the character, widening his jumping distance and making him invincible for enemies, or prevent him from moving freely as in the case of the feathers that are used to glide or to leave an avatar suspended so that it acts as a platform for the other. In these cases the platform action becomes one of the elements of a puzzle component which often, thanks to the excellent level design, is tasty and satisfying. Kalimba transforms the classic formula two for the price of one into gameplay Xbox One goals By completing Kalimba in single player and cooperative, 250 points are obtained while the other 750 provide variable doses of commitment. If you defeat a boss without morire is a matter of making a few retries, getting the maximum score in all levels and getting to the completion of the golden totem can require a lot of patience and no small amount of skill. Furthermore, to all this must be added a pinch of exploration which is necessary to find the secret rooms whose completion guarantees a certainly not negligible total of 105 points. Two guys one pad Not all Kalimba levels are made with the same mastery but the memorable moments are there and include big end-of-the-world bosses all intelligently built around the peculiar Press Play mechanics. Mechanics that include the offline cooperative whose presence is absolutely not to be underestimated. Playing in two, each with his own totem, might seem easier but coordinating, taking into account the enormous variety of Kalimba situations, is a real challenge made even more difficult by the fact that the penalty points are doubled. The result is exciting as long as you have a good partner to play with and a lot of patience. Even alone, however, the variety of gameplay makes the Press Play title always enjoyable even when the complexity of the formula generates large fluctuations in a difficulty rate that is sometimes almost zero and then suddenly soars. In any case we can say that overall Kalimba offers a fair level of difficulty. In some points there is a puzzle to understand, in others to make very rapid movements and often the two things mix in a chaos of teleports to be carried out to ensure that the right character with the right power is on the right side of the screen, perhaps in mid-jump or in flight, between lethal chasms and moving enemies. It is therefore not surprising that people often die but paradoxically Kalimba can be played in peace even by those with little patience. This is guaranteed by the generous checkpoints of a trial and error structure designed to always leave a crack to pass through the game's not very generous meshes. Death hardly forces you to repeat long sessions and trying again several times it happens to make it even by pure luck although going through an entire level without making a mistake guarantees a much greater satisfaction and is the only way to top the time rankings that add a time trial component at all levels of the game. Of course, we are far from those platformers calculated to the millimeter and getting away with sheer luck can make many players turn up their noses but while noting the imperfections we must admit that the setting chosen by Press Play guarantees the right balance between frustration and satisfaction with the possibility, for those who want to sweat the fateful seven shirts, to aim for the completion of each painting by obtaining the maximum score with the aim of obtaining the golden totem. In fact, each level bestows a section of a large totem that must be completed to return the island of Kalimba to its inhabitants. With an average score you get the classic section of colored wood typical of tribal totems but when the score is too low, to underline our ineptitude, the section of the totem corresponding to the level is filled with a miserable log of wood. To compensate for the humiliation, fortunately, there is a decidedly rather inspired technical sector, however modest. The style is that of trixels, triangular shapes made up of two-dimensional pixels that are well suited to the characters whose totemic nature deprives them of arms and legs to animate. The numerous expressions of fear, concern and doubt that characterize the different pairs of protagonists that change for each game world are therefore fundamental. On the other hand, the enemies who can acquire wings, change color and size do not change but remain anonymous and all characterized in the same way. On the other hand, the levels are less anonymous and this is also thanks to the bright colors, but it is clear at first glance that it would have been possible to do something more without altering anything from the graphic style. In any case, the price is commensurate with the offer which includes adaptation of the texts in Italian, a lot of witty references to the customs of the platform genre, a pleasant soundtrack and two non-essential extra modes but capable of adding something more to the experience.", "date": "2014-12-27", "grade": "8.0"}
