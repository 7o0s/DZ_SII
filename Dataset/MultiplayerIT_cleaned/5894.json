First of all, the flourishing of genres that are not very common in the West. Norn9: Var Commons is an excellent exponent of the current situation of PlayStation Vita: a visual novel released in the land of the Rising Sun a few months ago, arrived in the West thanks to the English translation alone. All premises that certainly do not make it an attractive title for local players, but which fans of the genre will certainly find interesting. An excellent cast, badly supported by a story not up to par: this is Norn9: Var Commons The new world Trying to keep spoilers to a minimum, Norn9: Var Commons presents itself as a very classic title in its ~otome~ setting (productions aimed at a female audience), telling the story of different protagonists who for various reasons will find themselves involved in the same succession of events bordering science fiction and the paranormal. The narrative starts from the story of Sorata Suzuhara, a young boy who mysteriously awakens in a parallel reality where space and time seem to have inexplicably mixed. The buildings have an architecture that recalls that of a few centuries ago, as well as the clothing of the inhabitants who populate the cities, who however have very advanced technologies and vehicles at their disposal even compared to our current era. Here then is that past and future come together to give shape to a narrative background of sure impact, in which a good number of characters gradually appear, all widely stereotyped according to the classic canons of the genre, but who actually seem to have something interesting to tell. In an attempt to understand what happened to him, Sorata soon runs into Koharu - a strange girl who initially doesn't even remember her name - with whom he will be embarked on the spherical space ship Norn. The goal is to reach the United States trying to understand what happened to both, but the spacecraft will act as a meeting point for all the protagonists of the title who will intertwine their stories in an attempt to discover the truth. On board, however, all our protagonist's travel companions are ~espers~, or boys and girls with paranormal powers, and they are all at the service of an organization called simply The World which has the task of maintaining peace in the world with any half, even obliterating entire civilizations if necessary. A decidedly controversial point of view that will be addressed in Sorata's storyline, which will have to be carried out simultaneously with that of another female protagonist. As happens in visual novels, the progression takes place in parallel on two tracks: on the one hand, the story of the game world develops and the resolution of the mysteries that lie behind The World organization, while on the other we have a constant deepening of the various protagonists, digging into everyone's past to bring to light the choices and events that led them to their current situation. PSVita trophies Norn9: Var Commons offers 30 trophies, all related to the discovery of the background concerning the main plot and to the deepening of the events of each character. 5 gold, 12 silver and 12 bronze trophies, to which is added the inevitable Platinum which requires many hours of play to be unlocked. See-saw mix In deepening the various characters, the title developed by Idea Factory succeeds in being interesting and captivating, while when it comes to summing up the various storylines after hours and hours of play we cannot deny a certain disappointment in the conclusion of the story . Through the choices available during the dialogues we have known many aspects related to everyone's childhood and the use of the various special powers, as well as information on the relationship that binds the boys with the organization and the man behind it, reading hundreds of of lines of text occasionally interspersed with cutscenes to underline the most important passages. Unfortunately, however, Norn9: Var Commons is structured in such a way as to require the deepening of all the storylines to reach the real core of the story, also because each of them is very focused on the development of the single character, leaving only the final remnants the task of deepening the narrative dBehind the mysterious journey of Sorata. As mentioned, by joining the dots we arrive decidedly unloaded at a rather banal conclusion that clashes with the depth and complexity with which the profiles of the various supporting actors have been woven. As a title belonging to a genre intended mainly for a female audience, there are several differences in style and setting compared to the latest visual novels that we have reviewed on these pages. The most marked difference largely concerns the perspective and the narrative cut in which the world and the protagonists are presented, which differ markedly from the nonsense and the fanservice overflowing with scantily dressed, busty girls and situations bordering on eroticism. There is no shortage of various interludes that prove to be particularly useful for diluting the tension and not taking oneself too seriously, proposing a whole series of situations that reflect the typical Japanese humor relating to the stereotypes of manga and anime characters and their unusual social dynamics, without however fall into the vernacular. Technically, Norn9: Var Commons confirms itself as an average title of the genre, with a succession of static screens in which the protagonists are represented in manga style, while the dialogues run fast, all written strictly in English accompanied by Japanese dubbing. The character design is not particularly sophisticated, but each character is well differentiated in clothing and expressions, fitting perfectly among the other supporting actors in a varied and interesting mosaic.", "date": "2015-11-15", "grade": "8.0"}
