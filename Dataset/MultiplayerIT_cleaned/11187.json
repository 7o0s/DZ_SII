For large stretches more than graphically valid, with breathtaking views and successful quotations, interesting from a narrative point of view, thanks also to excellent cinematic sequences, fun and satisfying for all the powers available to the main protagonist. However, it is crippled by an often insufficient artificial intelligence, by a level of difficulty that ~cheats~ and does not offer a real challenge and by an approximation of the menu and the side dish that is the daughter of games from other times. The title produced by LucasArt therefore does its job as an action without infamy and without praise, but undoubtedly it can be taken into greater consideration by Star Wars fans, who we are sure will find it an enjoyable title. Force runs strong in this game, too bad it's far from fully expressed. Pros Technically good Lots of fun powers to use Excellent storytelling Cons Rough execution of side parts Artificial intelligence below average Not very varied The evolution of the Force The game scheme and the graphic aspect follow the narrative evolution hand in hand, with the enhancement of the apprentice's powers, his doubts about which side of the force to embrace and who to fight, for a title that is an adventure in terms of setting with places a strong emphasis on the action phase, without concessions to other genres or variations on the theme that go outside the combat and reaching a certain point. But this feature is also one of the strengths, where thanks to the technology of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 using the powers of the Force has never been so fun and spectacular. At the beginning of the game we start with the trusty Light Saber (red...) with which it is possible to perform some combinations of attacks, and with the rudiments of the powers of the Force itself, but already very interesting. In fact, by holding down the R2 key (it is possible to change the setting in the options) it is possible to block and levitate a large number of objects on the screen and even the ~lighter~ enemies, also uprooting elements of the scenario and throwing them against AT-ATs, structures and so on. After having done the necessary practice, indeed undermined by a far from perfect coupling system, using this power is both useful and fun, and often necessary to get the better of when there are several opponents in front. In any case, the powers are certainly not limited here, for example with the circle button it is possible to release a devastating shock wave that throws enemies and smaller objects away, with the triangle instead of electric shocks and so on, according to an enhancement system progressive and role-playing. Continuing in fact in the adventure you get Strength points, which are used to level up and to acquire some spheres that can be spent on upgrades, which are of three types: those to learn new combos, those to enhance the physical characteristics of your character and finally those to expand the powers of the Force, such as the possibility of gripping multiple enemies at the same time. There is also a complete internal database, the possibility of using different costumes among those that are unlocked and new crystals for your sword, which on the one hand change its color and on the other add bonuses in attack or defense. The approximations of the Force In some cases this defect is even more accentuated, such as for larger enemies, which are equipped with very few offensive variants and can be killed with simple tricks such as hiding behind bumps or moving away to the point of not being chased and then hitting them distance to boulders and other objects. In all this the difficulty level settles, where the game is always rather easy except when the AI ~cheats~ not by increasing the challenge level, but rather the number of enemies present on the screen, which leads to repeating several times some passes with frustration rather than exploit bugs by attacking from a distance or hidden. Even the combat system, in addition to the aforementioned small lock problems on enemies and objects, remains undeveloped in the melee one, which is resolved in the usual frenetic button push, with the strategy reduced to a minimum. In short, a whole series of approximations that make the game far from being valid in all its aspects, while being supported by a fair amount of fun derived from completing the adventure. Also because technically Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is very good, and there are many breathtaking views, made with a visual deptha perfect, excellent choice of colors and in general a decidedly satisfactory impact. To say the least, it is satisfying to release, for example, a powerful shock wave of the Force, and to see a large part of the scenario crumble and move thanks to the excellent physics engine, giving that sense of power that only a Sith or a Jedi can return. The sound has unreleased tracks and others rearranged from the original soundtrack, and in general it is also excellent in terms of effects and dubbing. We close with the information by reporting that the game fully supports Dual Shock 3, but not the trophies. Cracks in the Force To act as a shoulder for the apprentice is Proxy, a robot capable of taking the shape of other characters, who offers several jokes together with the protagonist, while the levels vary from space stations to the beautiful mushroom level, up to some well-known ship space, in a mix of quotes and characters that will make Star Wars fans gloat. The flow of the game is obviously enriched by the fights against the bosses, in which the view often remains fixed and it is necessary to use the combos and powers at one's disposal with more discretion, a fight which ends with the classic interactive event which involves pressing the buttons right moment, put there for pure spectacularity and nothing else (since it can be repeated until it is successfully completed) and which sometimes even distracts attention from what is happening on the screen. The title thus arrives to be completed in 8-10 hours, to then access a fourth level of difficulty and the possibility of restarting the adventure with all the power-ups and clothes unlocked, while any multiplayer or additional mode is absent. 'outside the main one. Despite being one-way, The Force Unleashed is completed without any problems, thanks to the powers that are still fun to use and the setting that draws liberally from the Star Wars universe. On this point, however, the merits of the game end and as many defects begin which unfortunately have a significant impact on the final evaluation. Starting from the approximation with which the outline is made, with the menus more than meager at the beginning up to those that are not very accessible during the game, which have the aggravating circumstance of loading from one menu to another (!) also on the version PlayStation 3 (which installs on a hard drive), and which show little optimization at all. The biggest problem, however, lies in the structure of the levels and in the artificial intelligence, factors that significantly lower the challenge and the memorable points to remember. In the first case it is often possible to face a ~running~ level, without worrying about the enemies who at a certain point stop chasing the player, in the second case they do not shine for reactivity or for being competitive, but are limited to being sparring partners for the raids of the player who uses force.", "date": "2008-09-18", "grade": null}
