Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny.Zombie and twin analog shooter: a combination that is anything but original, this is undeniable, but it doesn't matter when you are faced with a product that is not only downloadable for free, but also very well packaged. This is the case of Zombiewood, the new freemium developed by Gameloft for iOS and Android devices, which catapults us into a Hollywood invaded by the living dead and has therefore become a nightmare for those who live there... unless they want to become a movie star. cinema! The protagonist of the game is in fact a stuntman determined to rise to prominence thanks to this exceptional event, putting himself in the shoes of the fearless hero who, weapons in hand, faces endless hordes of zombies to save women and children, or simply to be filmed as he tears apart the already tortured limbs of his enemies. The concept behind this nice shooter is therefore very simple and unfolds through eleven different ~films~, each composed of a certain number of ~scenes~, in which we will be asked not only to eliminate all the undead on the screen , but also to complete objectives such as defending a character or a location, or finding an object, and so on. To further increase the interest there are the many extra achievements, which once unlocked make us earn some coins to spend on the purchase of weapons, for their enhancement or to get clothes and protections capable of increasing our stamina, speed, and damage-dealing characteristics. One zombie dies, another kills The strength of Zombiewood lies in the numbers of the experience, a factor which in many ways combines with the freemium nature of the Gameloft title. The weapons that it is possible to buy are in fact extremely numerous and from the third ~film~ onwards it becomes necessary to have greater firepower because the enemies become much more ~tough~, therefore in the absence of sufficient coins one finds oneself replaying the already completed missions to try to accomplish the extra objectives. There is also an arena that allows you to bet virtual dollars and challenge your friends, trying to score higher than theirs within a given stage. On the gameplay front, the traditional twin analog shooter mechanics are solidly represented, with good feedback for the various weapons and fairly precise touch controls thanks to the two virtual analog sticks on the touch screen. It's a shame that in some, thankfully rare moments, the controls seem to 'stuck' - hopefully this will be fixed in an update. For the rest, there is a fair variety of different zombies, from the ~normal~ ones to those equipped with firearms, passing through the explosive and huge undead, capable of shooting laser beams from their eyes. The scenarios are very well done and above all they have different interactable elements, also from the point of view of the achievements. The graphics, in general, appear excellent in terms of style, detail and fluidity, while the sound sector stands out for some catchphrases but little more.", "date": "2012-11-03", "grade": "8.0"}
