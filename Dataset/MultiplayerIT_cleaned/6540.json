{"name": "Catture a pagamento", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145764-pokemon-shuffle-catture-a-pagamento.html", "text": "Last year we played and reviewed Pokmon Link: Battle!, a fun puzzle game developed by Genius Sorority Inc. under the license of the most famous pocket monsters in the currently known universe. Pokemon Link: Battle! we liked it, and it had demonstrated how it is possible to intelligently implement the traditional capture mechanics even in the most diverse genres such as, precisely, the ~match-3~ puzzle games. Now comes Pokmon Shuffle, which fixes the shot by proposing a simple and fun idea at no cost: the new title from Nintendo and Genius Sorority Inc. is, in fact, completely free, and just connect to the eShop with Nintendo 3DS to download the few blocks that make it up. Obviously, however, there is a catch. Pokmon Shuffle is a super fun puzzle game with an irritating microtransaction system Pay to catch, please On a technical level, Pokmon Shuffle is extremely basic. The backgrounds frame simple and sparse locations from an isometric perspective, while the gameplay relies entirely on the illustrations of the various pokmon: the ~opponent~ one, which we will have to face, on the upper screen, and those of the little monsters that we will have to align in the grid on the lower screen . While in Pokmon Link: Battle! it was necessary to continuously build combinations of pokmon, prolonging the combos and multiplying the scores precisely based on the speed of alignment, in Pokmon Shuffle the gameplay is more cautious and reasoned. The aim is always the same, and that is to align three or more identical pokmon vertically or horizontally, making them disappear so that those above them take their place, perhaps triggering one or more chain reactions. Every time we align and make pokmon disappear, it will be a bit like having carried out an attack against the pokmon we are facing: here the types of pokmon take over, in the sense that the attack launched against the opponent will have a specific element and, therefore, if we are fighting Charmander, and we line up three Squirtles, we will cause more damage because the attack is water type. Our goal is to reset the life of the opposing pokmon within a certain limit of turns; at that point we will have won the game, and we will be given the opportunity to capture the pokmon we just defeated with a probability of success that also depends on our score and the speed with which we completed the stage. There are currently one hundred and sixty pokmon to catch, and some of them will give us a lot of headaches, for example by suddenly changing the order of the little creatures on the lower screen or by placing blocks that we can only destroy by aligning adjacent pokmon. In addition, every time we face a new stage we will be able to choose four pokmon to take with us among those we have captured, which will then be the ones to appear on the lower screen and which we will have to align, helping us with their peculiar abilities. The selected pokmon will earn experience points at the end of the game, perhaps even leveling up to inflict more damage, and some of them can even mega evolve after having aligned enough of them, unlocking special skills and bonuses. If it seems like fun up to now, you're absolutely right: Pokmon Shuffle is a simple and intuitive puzzle, fully explained through a short initial tutorial and always ready to suggest visually or textually the best way to face a new challenge. Genius Sorority also has several periodic events in the pipeline to play to capture rare pokmon such as Mew or Rotom. All this goodness, however, has a high price, which is a paradox given that Pokmon Shuffle is free: the games are in fact limited by a very small number of hearts that are recharged every thirty minutes for a maximum of five at a time. Each game consumes a heart, meaning you can play about five games every two and a half hours; a limit that can be circumvented by buying extra hearts with the gems that we will get sporadically (very sporadically...) as we progress through the game, or that we will be able to buy from the Nintendo eShop. In short, Pokmon Shuffle relies on a rather irritating microtransaction system, because if it is true that each stage can be completed without spending a cent, while expanding the games over time, so is the fact that Genius Sorority has placed around every corner to encourage the purchase of extra games or various concessions, perhaps by imposing too strict turn limits for a game in which luck also counts a lot. Before each game, in fact, bonuses can be bought by spending another currency given with a dropper, perhaps to increase the maximum number of rounds available or to enhance thecatch the pokmon in case we win the challenge.", "date": "2015-02-25", "grade": "7.5"}
