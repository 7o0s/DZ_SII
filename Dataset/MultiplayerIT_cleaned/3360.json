{"name": "Battle Breakers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-breakers-la-recensione.html", "text": "Anyone who follows the mobile gaming market with a little attention (but also without too much attention, to tell the truth), will have already understood more or less what this game corresponds to, however the blazon of the developers and the size of the production forces us to learn more about them with this review of Battle Breakers. Lots of characters, assorted waifu, maps with sequential levels, turn-based combat, fighter management and summons: there are all the classic ingredients that have now defined the genre in an extremely standardized way. Mobile strategic RPG in recent years, practically without any original twist in this case but with considerable care in the realization of the whole. It makes you smile that the ~project of passion, developed by a small team of Epic Games~, as the publisher defines this game with a certain pride, is ultimately a title that seems to have come out of an industrial mold modeled paying close attention to not going off the rails at all, arriving moreover largely late on the market. From a brand of this caliber perhaps we would have expected something more courageous and original as a result of passion by small detachments of developers, but the intent of Battle Breakers is clear, and follows the will of Epic Games to put a foot in that glittering and gluttonous battlefield represented by free-to-play games with micro-transactions on mobile platforms. From a technical point of view, the work carried out is almost impeccable, but there are still several doubts about the effectiveness of such an operation, which arrives late compared to a now well-placed but perhaps less and less fierce competition precisely because the phenomenon seems to be declining in the latter period. After detecting a sort of creative revival in the mobile sector, above all thanks to the new business models and productions offered first of all by Apple Arcade and secondly by Google Play Pass, finding yourself in front of Battle Breakers gives the idea of a clear step back in the evolutionary path of this industry, but this concerns precisely the product typology of a game of this genre, rather than its actual quality in terms of construction. Collect, manage and battle Examples of similar titles are truly galore also on these pages, to stay on the more recent ones we mention Raid: Shadow Legends, AFK Arena, Valkyrie Anatomia, Epic Seven or even more peculiar derivations such as Looney Tunes: Il Mondo del Chaos, both to make people understand how this type of game has become a real monolithic standard, in its basic structure, but applicable to different contexts. The story is the classic pretext for staging a fight of good against evil, in this case with demons and various creatures that emerge from crystals scattered around the world, but the presentation complete with the opening song really delivers some excellent ~Saturday morning cartoon~ trashy vibes, as Americans would call it. However, the structure has nothing not seen previously: it is a question of gathering fighters of various types who draw inspiration from fantasy both in the Western and Japanese sense, obviously with a great abundance of more or less undressed girls who always enjoy a large presence in gacha games. The gameplay is based on the typical facets of this hybrid genre, sorting the player's commitments between the battlefield, the management of the characters and the construction of infrastructures in which to invest money and resources to further enhance one's army and strengthen one's presence in the world. game world. The combat system is turn-based and is limited to making the player choose the character to use and the use of a standard or special attack, with the classic system of balance of forces between elements in the paper-rock-scissors style, but also here everything soon flattens out with the use of autoplay, therefore the strategic component is limited exclusively to the composition of the team to be deployed on the field and its arrangement on the boxes based on the classes of heroes (tank, ranged, support and the like) . The cycle is always the same: team composition and autoplay, mission after mission, until these become too difficult and then one thinks of character enhancement or some summoning, which however, as usual, tends to reward those who spend real money for the use larger amounts of gems or participate in some timed ~promotion~. In essence, the grinding made game, which is what this whole mobile genre is focused on, with the usual aggravating circumstance of the advantage deriving from the spending of real money. Beyond thatll that one can think of tactical RPGs with gacha elements, there is no doubt that Battle Breakers is well done within this standard, which is demonstrated both by the average graphic quality, by the general characterization of the user interface, and by the integration of the various components into a rather organic whole.", "date": "2019-11-21", "grade": "6.2"}
