From the space wars of Star Defense to the gardens of Plants vs Zombies, from the towers of Fieldrunners to the sci-fi scenarios of the various Sentinels, the genre has found a second youth on the touchscreens of mobile and tablet devices, occasionally introducing some fresh innovations and also going to contaminate other types of games. Convinced that iOS players still hadn't had enough of placing units in defense of their towers, the guys from the Australian team 3 Sprockets have recently released Cubemen on PC and iPad, a tower defense game that tries to attract the attention of fans of the genre through a mix of extremely simple mechanics and some small original ideas. Cube strategy If other exponents of the genre try to enrich or justify their experience through a minimal narrative component, Cubemen skips the preliminaries and goes straight to the point. The user is simply offered a series of levels of increasing difficulty to play in any order and at any time; perhaps replaying them a second or third time in an attempt to get the best possible result. Each scenario is an arena made up of parallelepipeds of different heights, which thus create gradients and steps which on the one hand add greater strategic complexity, on the other they annoyingly obstruct the user's view. Luckily the camera can be rotated freely, which will prove to be providential especially in the more complex levels. A few text aids give any indication during the first game, although those who have played tower defense before will find everything extremely familiar. The aim is in fact to protect your tower by bringing some units onto the field, small colored soldiers who move up to the selected box and attack any opponent within their visual cone. As expected, the units differ in strength and resistance, but above all in the type of attack: those equipped with flamethrowers can roast a good number of small opponents, while those armed with grenade launchers can hit enemies even if they are behind a high barrier. Predictably, the most powerful units are also the most expensive ones, and it is precisely in the game economy that Cubemen's strong point lies: once summoned, the units continue to move forward or to attack the enemies until they are destroyed or until the The user does not decide to move them to another square, but Game Over would be instantaneous if all of his soldiers were eliminated and he had no more resources to spend. Everything therefore lies in starting in the best way, anticipating the AI or responding to its moves with the units that are best able to inhibit its strategy; the game structure is so severe and the difficulty curve so steep that it is almost impossible to fix a slow or inappropriate start. Many times you thus end up having to repeat the same level after a few minutes from the beginning, over and over again until you manage to find a suitable tactic, which on the one hand could give great satisfaction to strategy lovers, but on the other it could prove to be very frustrating for those looking for a not too demanding pastime. Unfortunately this need to weigh one's moves in response to the opponent's approach is brutally less in an unsuccessful online mode, where there are few players connected and the rooms are almost always occupied: being able to start a game in Skirmish can require several minutes of waiting and, even if you don't run into the frequent game instability problems, you quickly realize that the vast majority of online users always tend to use a single approach, immediately spending all their resources in many smaller units. However, it's not just the lower predictability of the AI that makes playing offline more fun, but also a wider choice of modes. In addition to the traditional one, there are five other more or less interesting ones, some of which impose limits on resources, the maximum number of units that can be summoned and the amount of lives at one's disposal. The conformation of the map then adds further strategy, giving bonuses or disadvantages to your units based on their position with respect to your opponents, and almost making you want an editor of the arenas. In short, Cubemen would be an excellent tower defense if it weren't for two main defects: on the one hand, the graphic component which, despite being minimalist and not tacky, is light years away from Tito's elegancethem stylistically similar like Edge Extended, probably thanks to the clumsy animations. On the other hand, a technical realization that leaves a lot to be desired, so much so that the game often lets itself go to unjustified frame drops and, what is even more frustrating, numerous crashes between one game and another.", "date": "2012-04-30", "grade": "7.0"}
