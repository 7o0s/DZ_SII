{"name": "DiRT Rally 2.0: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dirt-rally-20-recensione.html", "text": "Codemasters' racing heritage is one of the deepest in the gaming industry. In fact, the first titles developed by the English team date back to the end of the 80s, and it is for this reason that for many of us the name of the English studio is synonymous with our first videogame love, at least in the racing genre. Whether it was the very old Grand Prix Simulator or a more recent (so to speak) Colin McRae Rally that made us passionate, Codemasters has been able to convey the passion for engines on our screens, satisfying all tastes a bit, from those more oriented towards the arcade to those who instead try to get closer to the simulation. The birth of the DiRT Rally series is linked to this type of philosophy, which took place with its first chapter in 2015 to arrive at the present of DiRT Rally 2.0, which we are dealing with in this review. There was also a DiRT 4 in between, before Codemasters decided to return to make us chew mud and glory with a more simulation title. We are therefore ready to go with DiRT Rally 2.0. Modes and tracks: career drivers Right from the start in the company of DiRT Rally 2.0, Codemasters' intention to address mainly those who loved its predecessor, which we awarded at the time, is clear. In fact, the game presents itself with few explanations on the possibilities that we have at our disposal to kick off the dance, starting from a career mode which, as often happens, is at the heart of the DiRT Rally 2.0 offer. An offer that therefore starts from the possibility of creating one of our drivers to take him to the top of international rallying, participating in various types of events linked to both traditional rallies and rallycross with its races held within closed circuits. In this regard, it is worth remembering that in terms of licenses, DiRT Rally 2.0 cannot count on that of the official WRC championship, in the hands of Kylotonn Games and its WRC 7, while it can instead show off the one linked to the FIA World Rallycross Championship, of which it includes the eight tracks of Barcelona, Montalegre, Mettet, Lohac Bretagne, Trois-Rivieres, Hell, Holjes and Silverstone. The career is mainly articulated through these two disciplines, presenting in the case of the classic rally six settings that count a total of over seventy routes to be learned inch by inch between New Zealand, Argentina, Spain, Poland, Australia and the United States. An offer that, as we will see later, presents lights but also some shadows, completed by what are some community challenges that can be played asynchronously with other players. Outside of the career mode, DiRT Rally 2.0 allows you to compete in the aforementioned FIA World Rallycross Championship starting from its official cars, or to get behind the wheel of a historic rally with vintage cars. By completing events within the latter, the player can buy new cars from the over fifty that the game makes available, starting with a Lancia Fulvia for rallying and an Opel Corsa 1600 for rallycross. Without forgetting to strengthen your team, to ensure that engineers and co-drivers become more efficient in their work of supporting our driver in search of success. Compared to DiRT Rally, the hill climb mode disappears as widely announced. Gameplay: Handbrake pulled, along with breath The heart of DiRT Rally 2.0 naturally lies entirely in its driving model, focused on a simulation-type experience which, however, does not give up some softening to prevent only real rally drivers from playing. The possibility of activating some help is necessary above all with the use of a DualShock 4, where the use of the automatic gearbox is practically mandatory in order to be able to enjoy what on balance is a good performance in terms of feeling even with a controller in hand. Where DiRT Rally 2.0 manages to give its best is inevitably with the steering wheel and pedals, preferably equipped with a clutch, reproducing all the weight of our car when cornering, while the rain beats on our windshield but above all on the mud. The simcade policy adopted by Codemasters serves to soften a bit what remains a fairly steep learning curve, using aids to teach while learning to coordinate the co-pilot's voice with your own actions between ridges and switchbacks. Those who are already used to the DiRT Rally model will find a similar experience waiting for them, more refined especially in terms of tire grip in the various situations: in this regard it is a pity to have to wait for the release of the additional contents (for a feechin) to taste DiRT Rally 2.0 even on the snow, the real big absentee in the initial offer of this game. Disposed of the disappointment, it is still possible to appreciate the detail placed by Codemasters at various levels, starting from the management of the physics that allows the player to feel the full weight of the race on his own skin also thanks to a damage system that forgives a little, but not too much. What makes each stage electrifying is the impossibility of making a short rewind in the event of a mistake, accompanied by a length of the tracks that in some cases exceeds ten minutes. Thanks to this, DiRT Rally 2.0 leads us to face every single pitfall with the utmost concentration, carefully evaluating how to get out of a jump or how best to face entering a bottleneck. While on the one hand the awareness of having an error always ready to attack us around the corner weighs a ton especially in the initial stages, on the other hand the need to restart the entire stage to remedy it makes the rally experience offered by DiRT Rally 2.0 a commitment not to be taken lightly, in some cases reaching the limits of physical effort. On our road to learn how to master cars in the mud, Codemasters still gives us a hand beyond the aids: the game's artificial intelligence is in fact of the adaptive type, thus making it more affordable to reach a good position and then intensify the challenge when the difficulty level rises and we have to worry about maintaining what we have conquered. Playstation 4 trophies In addition to those obtainable by winning its stages, DiRT Rally 2.0 also brings with it fifty-one Trophies. The ubiquitous Platinum is accompanied by two of the Gold type, ten Silver and thirty-eight Bronze, divided among all the modes that are part of the game. The nature of the Trophies is in fact what one would expect from such a title, with the need to complete some levels or bring some cars to success. An exception is the bonus linked to the overturning, to be obtained strictly in Australia. Graphics and sound: Ego Engine at its best When we talked about attention to detail a little while ago, we were not referring only to the driving model, but also to the entire technical sector of DiRT Rally 2.0. Although less surprising than its predecessor, this new chapter is appreciated on PlayStation 4 Pro for the sixty frames per second that practically never mentions decreasing, in the absence of smudges that can somehow affect the trance state of the player at the steering wheel. Only by looking with a detached eye can you notice some compromises in the vegetation and in the representation of the car models, necessary to be able to put an Ego Engine at ease as it moves towards its inevitable retirement. From inside the driver's compartment, however, it's a whole different story: whizzing sinuously between the Argentine rocks or crossing the Spanish villages is pure poetry, also thanks to a wide field of vision which in some cases opens up to breathtaking views, from appreciate for a nanosecond before dealing with the upcoming Turn 1. Our driving errors also led us to ride at night without headlights, appreciating every inch of a stage completed blind except for sections in the moonlight or in the glow of a flare kept on the side of the road. The sound is equally efficient in keeping the level of involvement high in DiRT Rally 2.0, thanks to a co-driver with a clear voice also in Italian, punctual in giving directions on the route. Sometimes even exaggerating, forcing us to work extra memory to take note of what is in front of us. Naturally, the work on the sound effects of the engine is also excellent, the noises of which when changing gear sound like a melody while the revs explode in a thunderous celebration.", "date": "2019-02-20", "grade": "8.7"}
