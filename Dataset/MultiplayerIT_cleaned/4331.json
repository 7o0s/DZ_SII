To access the DLC you must have reached level 45: a non-trivial requirement, if we consider that this time Bayek will have to deal with opponents that are never so strong and dangerous, coming from none other than the afterlife. In fact, the theft of one of the mysterious artifacts that fans of the series know well seems to have brought dire consequences for the inhabitants of Thebes and the adjacent regions, which we will be able to explore during the new adventure. When the shadows suddenly manifest themselves in a place in the city, in fact, out of nowhere the disturbing figure of a disappeared pharaoh appears, brought back to life by the power of the fruits of Eden and determined to kill anyone who gets in front of him, be it soldiers or ordinary citizens. The Medjay of Siwa, who has reached the area at the request of Amunet, immediately finds himself facing one of these powerful opponents: a not exactly polite welcome, which makes clear the intentions of this expansion as regards the degree of challenge , which in the advanced stages will reach peaks of great hardness and complexity, urging us to exploit the equipment in all its parts rather than throwing ourselves into duels head-on. As a trophy, of course, we will be able to access new, deadly weapons. Shadows and lights The idea of facing a supernatural threat, albeit with a series of narrative devices, appears perfectly in line with the atmosphere of Assassin's Creed Origins and the mysticism linked to its evocative settings. The new maps are quite extensive, in line with the Sinai of The Hidden Ones, but boast architectures close to those already appreciated in the basic campaign, although at a certain point the situation changes drastically and you find yourself wandering inside unfamiliar scenarios properly conventional, committed to exorcising evil at its root and, above all, on its terms. To get to that point, as mentioned, we will have to become more aware of Bayek's capabilities, bringing into play resources that have so far been culpably undervalued by the developers. A game of trial and error, hit and run, which softens only by dedicating a little time to the inevitable secondary quests for the purpose of character growth (the level cap has been raised to 55), with a view to extra assignments that lead the total duration of the expansion close to twenty hours. New and interesting characters are introduced in The Curse of the Pharaohs, even if on a narrative level the expansion does not commit itself too much and throws the events in front of our eyes a little at random; including the first appearance of the ~shadows of Anubis~, which could have been made much better and which is instead consumed in a duel at the conventional end, without particular pressure, along the lines of what has already been seen with the Phylakes. Fortunately, there are the numbers to support an experience that proves to be engaging and exciting in any case, especially in the second half of the story, when the cards are finally shuffled a bit and new situations are confronted. A chapter closes With its initial missions based on Bayek's traditional investigations, a rich structure and an exciting and different final part, capable of ~daring~ relatively new solutions even in terms of settings, The Curse of the Pharaohs presents itself as a worthy conclusion for the Season Pass of Assassin's Creed Origins, arriving a few weeks after the much talked about but certainly interesting Discovery Tour. In short, the offer put together by Ubisoft for this last chapter of the series appears solid, capable of satisfying the expectations of those who he wanted to play Bayek for a few more hours, trying his hand at more demanding challenges and new situations, moved above all by the desire to admire new glimpses of a guessed and suggestive location like that of ancient Egypt.", "date": "2018-03-25", "grade": null}
