History teaches that titles that aim so high often encounter more than a few obstacles in their development, and evidently Camouflaj's work is no exception: in fact, it took four months to see this second episode appear on the App Store, seasoned with the icing on the cake of a bug that prevented anyone from accessing the game in the hours immediately following its release. What matters, however, is obviously the final product, and it must be said that this Rpublique - Episode 2: Metamorphosis commendably manages to smooth out some defects of the predecessor while carrying forward a plot that is becoming more and more compelling. Chasing hope The story picks up exactly where the first chapter ended (here is our review, in case you missed it), and Camouflaj's work as regards the script and the construction of the scenario continues to be excellent, especially if limited in the field of mobile gaming. Without obviously wanting to reveal any detail of the plot, we can however say that Rpublique continues to prove to be a truly fascinating universe, and not only for its convincing dystopian imprint: in fact, the references to historical moments and true events are numerous and perfectly blended a credible temporal collocation to what is told by the game. Obviously, the absolute protagonist remains Hope, who the user must help in his attempt to escape from the oppressive structure of Metamorphosis, using the security cameras to guide her step by step. Precisely this peculiar control system had been the cross and delight of the previous episode, assisted by the assists of an artificial intelligence that was not always reliable and of a sometimes confusing level design: managing Hope's movements through the video surveillance system was therefore such an original solution and suggestive as it is not very comfortable in practice, forcing you to continuously switch from OMNI View to the normal view respectively to interact with the elements of the scenario and give indications to the protagonist. Things are much better in this second chapter, thanks to the considerable progress in the areas mentioned above: the explorable area therefore requires fewer steps from one camera to another in order to be covered, and Hope proves capable of following more lucidity the orders given to him, without ending up in the arms of the guards due to sensational errors in evaluating the spaces. Rpublique - Episode 2: Metamorphosis continues on the right path and improves on some flaws of the prequel However, Camouflaj did not limit itself to this particular aspect, making further structural improvements. To begin with, a map is finally available that allows you to clearly identify the destination to reach and the ways to get there, freeing the field from the idle circles that we often ran into in the first episode. Two new features of the OMNI View have also been added to be purchased at the appropriate terminals, which allow you to see the guards through the walls and indicate their patrol path on the screen, always at the cost of a certain portion of the smartphone battery in possession of Hope. Finally, there is an unprecedented type of overseer, the ARC Prizrak, dressed in armor that protects him from taser damage and capable of carrying out random patrols and therefore much more difficult to predict. In an attempt to give greater variety to the playful action, then, the developers have inserted several puzzles during the episode, without unfortunately ever being able to completely convince: some appear too tedious, others sin of originality and one in particular is so bizarre that the software itself offers to solve it by itself after a few minutes of user inactivity. More courage would have been needed on this front, and Rpublique - Episode 2: Metamorphosis would undoubtedly have also benefited from greater longevity: avoiding going to look for every secret and collectible, the credits are reached within an hour, not without some disappointment. Wanting to see the glass half full, it is undoubtedly quality time: the already mentioned virtues of the Camouflaj title in narrative terms must therefore be added to the absolute excellence put in place from an audiovisual point of view, with a presentation to which congratulations must be renewed for the 'excellent realization of in-game graphics and sinterlude sequences and for a dubbing (in English) and a top-of-the-class sound accompaniment.", "date": "2014-05-05", "grade": "8.0"}
