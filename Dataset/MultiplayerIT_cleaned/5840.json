A sort of lese-majeste act, it would seem, even more serious given that the production of the Germans of Shin'en Multimedia comes out exclusively on a console of the Kyoto house. But does it really make sense to accuse a game of plagiarism that recalls the mechanics of an apparently abandoned series and which hasn't seen new releases for over 10 years? On the contrary, Fast Racing Neo seems to be an act of love towards a genre that has practically disappeared from the market after a period of great popularity. If new WipeOut or F-Zero are not in sight, why criticize those who try to offer fans of futuristic racing games something similar? Fast Racing Neo is a tough nut to crack that will delight fans of futuristic racing games He who hesitates is lost Shin'en Multimedia is a name that could say little to the less informed, yet the Munich software house has been active for over five decades, being able to count on a large catalog of productions on which titles such as Art of Balance and Nano Assault stand out. Fast Racing Neo is actually a sequel, to be precise to that Fast Racing League released on WiiWare in 2011; and as per tradition for the team, also in this case we are talking about a title distributed exclusively in digital format, this time on the Wii U eShop and at a price of 14.99. In terms of content, the Fast Racing Neo offer is quite standard: basically the game allows you to access a main mode made up of mini-championships of four races each, for a total of four for each of the three leagues of increasing difficulty available . Then there is the multiplayer (rather poor in options to tell the truth), in local split screen for four or online for up to eight players, which allows you to challenge each other on one of the 16 available tracks and a time attack which however loses a bit of interest given the absence of the ghost of one's best performance. Finally, to be unlocked after reaching the last league, there is the Hero Mode intended to offer an even greater challenge. A list of modes without flashes, nothing particular from this point of view, but fortunately not the same can be said once you get on the track. In fact, right from the first race, Fast Racing Neo leaves you speechless for the incredible sensation of speed that it is capable of offering: accustomed to racing games that progressively educate the player with a soft learning curve, being faced with the imposed rhythms immediately from the title of Shin'en leaves initially displaced. The gameplay, as mentioned at the beginning, chooses a development much closer to F-Zero than WipeOut: in fact, there are no weapons, which is why the conduct of the race must focus solely on the search for maximum driving cleanliness, trying to avoid mistakes and mishaps. In this sense, a fundamental element is that of the boost zones, blue or orange, scattered along the tracks: to be able to exploit them, however, it is necessary to have the ~phase~ of your shuttle of the same color, so as to obtain a precious and powerful acceleration temporary. Going over it with the ~wrong~ color leads to a slowdown, an eventuality to be avoided as much as possible. The phase change can be performed at any time simply by pressing a button: a simple concept to understand but thorny to manage, precisely because of the extreme speed with which races are tackled and with the consequent need to act quickly and precisely on the selector. There are also other elements associated with this two-color mechanic, such as trampolines that can both guarantee access to optional shortcuts and, on the contrary, be compulsorily exploited in order to continue along the path. Finally, scattered on the track, spheres can be collected to accumulate a further boost, to be activated and managed however at will via R1 at any time. Obviously, each of the 10 cars available can count on different characteristics, not only aesthetic, but also linked to acceleration, speed and weight values, with the latter affecting handling. The decision to set the title precisely on the extremes of the concept of speed necessarily had to go through a graphics engine capable of supporting this intent. In this respect, the German team has confirmed the enormous qualities with regard to its technical capabilities by packaging a brilliant engine especially for how it manages 60 frames per second without any drop or uncertainty. More generally, the glance of Fast Racing Neo is remarkable, if not exceptional considering that it isa of an eShop game: while never reaching absolute peaks in terms of polygonal complexity, the intelligent management of the visual horizon - which is never too deep - has made it possible to circumvent the technical limits of the Nintendo hardware, giving life to an really great product in the absolute sense. And there is certainly no shortage of spectacularity, given that the three-dimensional development of the tracks offers punch-in-the-gut moments, with whirling ups and downs and jumps of tens of metres. Even the general style, although quite derivative, can still be said to be fully successful. Refrain casual Fast Racing Neo is an unforgiving game, this must be clear to anyone intending to approach the Shin'en product. From the first league it takes very little to lose positions in the standings, but it is from the second that things take an even more extreme turn. Basically, it suffices to know that even the smallest mistake is destined to jeopardize the first position in an often irreversible way, not to mention going off the track which in a very penalizing way leads to a considerable loss of time before rejoining the race. At the crazy speeds imposed by the German team, even blinking becomes a risk; on the contrary, the only way to at least reach the podium is to memorize the tracks, repeat them until you drop, improving your reflexes, anticipating curves and remembering the exact positioning of the boost zones to exploit as much as possible. Fast Racing Neo can be enormously frustrating, and it is certainly not a game that we would recommend to the less experienced: it is obvious how Shin'en wanted to create a title for players with fur on their stomachs, for experts who want to be slapped repeatedly after race. Those who fall into this category will certainly find bread for their teeth, but also enormous satisfactions: crossing the finish line first after having put into practice exactly what you have painstakingly learned defeat after defeat is a real and authentic pleasure, in no uncertain terms. Among the defects, it is sad to note how the track design combines excellent routes - most of them, mind you - with a couple decidedly less successful. In a title that was already so demanding in itself, we would then have avoided inserting elements capable of causing an instantaneous collision and therefore the loss of seconds and positions: the enormous leg of a spider robot, a sudden landslide of rocks, sneaky puffs of flames from the ground or simple steel columns placed in the middle of the track are the cause of crashes that are a bit ~cheap~, not very refined, which can add further frustration to the player. Even the organization of the championships could have enjoyed more variety, since the three leagues present are practically photocopies of each other in which only the level of difficulty changes. And finally, a handful of more paths would have been nice, to extend an overall longevity that could be improved after all: who knows if a future DLC could not help in this sense.", "date": "2015-12-08", "grade": "9.0"}
