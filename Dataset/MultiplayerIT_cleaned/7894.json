It outlines our memories with tones that are often much more harmonious than reality. How many times has returning to a place linked to particular memories disappointed us? How many revised films look like pale copies of what we had in our heads? And how many video games picked up today collapse under the weight of nostalgia? The world of indie titles revels in the desire of older players to relive the emotions of the past, embracing gameplay apparently against all market laws. A small title overlooks this panorama, a role-playing game that conceals all the interpretations and historical passages experienced by the genre. Evoland is in fact a magical journey through the memories of a hugely popular type of video game. Nostalgia effect The Shiro Games title was born from the Ludum Dare competition, a particular event in which enthusiasts compete with each other by creating a video game from scratch, basing their ideas on proposals from the community. Winner of the twenty-fourth edition, Evoland Classic has evolved into a commercial product, offered on Steam and GoG for just under ten euros. But Evoland is not a real RPG, more like a meta video game. Borrowing a cinematic terminology, we would like to try to define this product which exploits the characteristic language of its genre to describe the language itself. Ok, we're getting twisted in the speech. Try to imagine an RPG that starts out as a classic from the 8-bit era. No colors, strictly two-dimensional characters and maps dashed with a few pixels. With the arrow keys you guide your hero trying not to let evil creatures approach you, who can kill you with a single touch and thus return you to the home screen. Making your way with your sword, which responds faithfully to the action key, you find a chest. No treasure awaits you inside, but rather a first evolutionary step, such as the possibility of saving the game in certain points on the maps. A little more self-confident, continue your journey and here is another casket that evolves the graphic representation by introducing colors and a few more pixels. Subsequently comes the possibility of moving in all directions, leaving the restrictions of the two Cartesian axes. The journey continues more or less always following this idea. Clink's adventure is in fact a continuous mention of titles such as Final Fantasy, Zelda (the name of the protagonist is obviously not chosen at random), Dragon Quest but you will also find moments in which the gameplay seems to come directly from Diablo. Not only will the graphics follow the historical passages of the role-playing genre. The gameplay itself, in fact, will vary, going from labyrinthine dungeons to maps reproduced with the legendary Mode 7, from random turn-based combat to action phases with dozens of monsters on the screen at the same time, puzzles to solve and infinite equipment to collect. The plot of Evoland is almost superfluous, inserted more to make us smile on the stereotypes of role-playing games, with a traveling companion called Kaeris and an evil villain named Zephiroth, who will push us to look for the two pieces of a locket with magical powers to save a land threatened by the forces of evil. The true story that Evoland wants to tell is actually that of its own genre, continually pinching our soul so sensitive to the nostalgia effect. Lots of little bites The continuous evolution of the aesthetic aspect and gameplay are together the biggest strength and weakness of the title, unfortunately. On the one hand, the adventure, if the idea manages to involve you, will glue you to the screen until the end credits, thanks to the developers' passion for RPGs that shines through every pixel. At the same time, any semblance of depth is lacking, given the futility of character growth, the absence of equipment, shops that are present more to testify their presence in the genre than for a real function. The gameplay of Evoland and all the accessory elements look like the cardboard backdrops of Hollywood films of the past, as engaging and effective as they are fictitious. The almost zero challenge of the random fights, whose presence is sometimes too insistent, is fortunately balanced by the funnier action phases, especially in the Diablo-style dungeons. Perhaps the most serious flaw of the Shiro Games title is the presence of many small samples, which however never allow you to get to the main course, presenting the bill too early. It is not just a problem of the duration of the adventure, in fact we are talking about an afternoon to get to the end credits, but of the ideas proposed that are sometimes really valid, capable of characterizing fasthe game of a few minutes to then be set aside in favor of others. As mentioned, this benefits the variety, but greatly limits the potential of a title that could have aimed much higher. As it is, it limits itself to making a successful but all too modest homage to some pieces of video game history. From 8 bits to polygons Starting from 8-bit graphics to get to three-dimensional scenarios and characters, Evoland showcases a really nice graphics sector. Touches of class such as the city with pre-rendered backdrops, first in low definition then embellished with high resolution or polygonal environments that acquire atmosphere with the addition of the lighting system are just examples of the excellent work done. Perhaps the budget limitations did not allow us to go beyond the somewhat cartoonish graphics of the last moments of the game, stopping the evolution a few years earlier than the last exponents of the genre. Maybe we'll see more in a possible sequel? The same work was done in the audio sector, with the main theme gaining definition. The soundtrack greatly benefits the involvement and the atmosphere, drawing liberally from historical soundtracks accompanying the fights with fast melodies and arrangements that mix orchestra and distorted guitar. Entering a village will instead start the classic, somewhat boring tune, with a soporific flute. In short, even in the field of sound the quotations abound.", "date": "2013-04-17", "grade": "7.5"}
