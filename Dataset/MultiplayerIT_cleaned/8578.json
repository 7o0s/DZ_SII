{"name": "Chocobo GP", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chocobo-gp-recensione.html", "text": "Chocobo GP, developed and produced by Square Enix, is the sequel to Chocobo Racing, originally released for PlayStation in March of twenty-three years ago (in 1999). It is a caricatured racing game, a sort of Mario Kart in the world of Final Fantasy; this was the first, but it certainly won't be the last time you'll read the name of the Nintendo series in this review. Not only because Mario Kart is the undisputed king of this sub-genre, but also because, unfortunately, he has created a standard that everyone seems to passively submit to. If in the past - a very distant past, we are referring to 1997 - we have witnessed kart games that tried to find success by differentiating themselves from the Nintendo saga, we are talking in particular about Diddy Kong Racing and his single player adventure, in recent years we have found much less courage. We tell you right away: however pleasant and well made, Chocobo GP falls precisely into this vein. It has some interesting gimmicks, nice environments, but almost all the most important mechanics - bar one, inherent to the weapons - are transplanted from Mario Kart, and dressed in Square Enix clothes. There are drifts, charged drifts, stunts to activate at the top of a ramp, gun boxes, reverse circuits: all features that the forty million (and counting) Nintendo racing players are familiar with. And frankly it is a choice that we can hardly explain: why should anyone prefer Chocobo GP, settings and links to Final Fantasy aside, compared to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe? Amazon offer Chocobo GP - Nintendo Switch 49.99 See Offer It is a work done on a smaller budget and does not have the deep and sensitive controls of the Nintendo game. It is really difficult to understand why Square Enix, which - we repeat - is certainly no exception in this, has not tried to differentiate itself further. Was it possible that there weren't more original ideas? After all, we're talking about a fantasy game, not a sports simulation. Having clarified the context and the relationship with Mario Kart, which goes beyond the specific qualities and defects of this title, we would like to reiterate that the Square Enix game is well made, well designed, and also very fun: find out with us why in our review by Chocobo GP, aware that the title will be released on March 10, together with the Lite version. The latter will be free and will allow you - albeit with content limitations - to experience the game both online and offline: in short, it represents much more than a demo. Guide and characters Chocobo GP: Chocobos compete on skates Even with some minimal differences, anyone who has played Mario Kart will immediately find themselves at home with the control system and also with the driving system. With the left analogue you direct the steering, with A you accelerate, with B you brake (yes, sometimes it is necessary, especially in certain 90 curves in sequence), with L you use your weapons and with R you drift . Precisely with R: it is not possible to perform the action with ZR, in any of the proposed button variants. A choice that we didn't like, because the furthest back seems to us to be the most comfortable, but one we got used to in a short time. With X you move the camera to look behind you, and with Y you use the special weapon (which we will talk about later), specific to each character: a choice, yes, quite incomprehensible. Basically, to use this skill you need to lift your thumb off the accelerator, wasting precious moments of gas. Only after a few hours did we realize that this action was also available through ZL, an option not only preferable, but better in all respects: it is strange that the game offers you the Y key as the main solution. In general, the controls are reactive and precise, and it is a fundamental quality for a racing game. We said reactive and precise controls, but not perfectly nuanced. The handling of the car is less profound than in Mario Kart, more direct, and also the modulations during drifting - steering and counter-steering - seemed less refined to us, that is, less related to the intensity of the stick inclination. In these phases, the longer the car stays in the drift position (holding R), the more powerful the future acceleration will be: we counted three passes (yellow, purple and blue light), exactly like in Mario Kart. Again: why not get creative? Why re-propose the Nintendo game setting, which is certainly not the only one? Mario Kart itself works like this (more or less) from the Wii episode: previously, an additional charge was activated with each counter-steer. It is true that this structure has proved to be the safest and least ~violable~, However... Just like the controls, the interaction between karts and roads is very good, but not excellent. Pleasant and functional, but not perfect. The cars are stable, when they go off the road they slow down sharply and even when they hit a wall or a fence, they lose grip: these are trivialities, we know, what we mean is these characteristics are little declined and graduated. They react promptly, but in a slightly nuanced and interconnected way: the final effect is a reduction of the variables, which are fundamental in a racing game. If we weren't clear enough, a practical example: if you go off the track, in the dirt, you will slow down regardless of the inclination of your tires, your previous speed, the position of the steering wheel. In short, the interaction with the road - and with the other karts - is functional, but nothing more: we repeat, it's not just a visual problem, because it limits the situational variables, which are important for racing. As for the characters, there are more than twenty, some created especially for the game, others inherited from Final Fantasy (such as the enchanter Vivi, from Final Fantasy IX). There are summons, chocobos (obviously), moogles. The art direction is commendable, as is the character design. Each driver has his own specific vehicle, let's imagine for aesthetic reasons: in the sense that, for example, a chocobo runs with skates, while a moogle with a more traditional car. It would have been complex to ensure that everyone could use any means; the only unfortunate consequence of this choice, apart from the visual variety, lies in the obligation of not being able to alter the statistics of a character. If you like the moogle Atla, for example, you'll have to accept the fact that it's very fast, but also that it accelerates slowly, has little grip, and handles rough: the two vehicle variants (present for each character) shift these stats but only marginally. Weapons and circuits Chocobo GP: Gilgamesh is about to be hit by a fireball The ~weapons~ in Chocobo GP are obtained exactly like in Mario Kart: every now and then a row of magilite appears in the circuit, and by impacting it you will be gifted with a power. The power-ups are also inspired by the Nintendo game: there is the spell to hit the opponent (which can also be thrown back), the one that allows you to defend yourself, an evocation has even been inserted that allows you to reassemble (like the missile). Perhaps the most interesting idea lies in the teleportation: a space-time gap opens (which can also be crossed by the other players for a few seconds) which leads you a few tens of meters ahead. The funny thing is that it also exists in reverse: the blue one materializes further on, the red one further back. Sometimes the position of appearance, not being predetermined, can be inadequate or inconvenient: a consequence that in any case does not affect the creativity of the move. The true originality of the weapons, which we really appreciated, lies neither in their nature nor in their use, but in their composition. Once you have an enchantment, you can keep it and, by impacting the right magicite, improve it. Each ~weapon~ has three different degrees of effectiveness, of enhancement. An interesting mechanism, which increases the strategy of the encounter: from our experience, we would have liked more defense spells (in fact there is only one). Furthermore, each runner has a special move, to be loaded along the way: its effects vary from character to character, some are of attack, others of acceleration, but it is very useful precisely in a defensive perspective, because it grants a few seconds of invincibility at the moment of the activation. The nice protagonist of Chocobo GP As for the circuits, they seemed well designed. They range from simple routes to more complex ones (obviously) and full of curves. The settings are always pleasant, but some stand out over the others: Gold Saucer (from Final Fantasy VII), Alexandria (from Final Fantasy IX), and above all Big Bridge (from Final Fantasy V). In our opinion, the latter is the best track in the game: it has a touch of F-Zero, very fast, full of ups and downs and forks. Each circuit is offered in different versions: basic, short, long, fast. The variants are not common to all, however. Regarding the tracks, two things didn't convince us. The first is a venial sin: some tracks have a series of 90 bends which simply don't have a ~clean~ line with which they can be tackled (if they do, we haven't found it): drifting is not effective enough, the brake slows down too much, leaving the gas is still a difficult move to plan. Perhaps, as in Diddy Kong Racing, it would have made sense to insert an sthird at 90 by pressing the gas and brake together. The real problem with circuits, however, is their number. And it's no small problem, on the contrary: excluding the variants, there are nine in total. Too few. Modes, graphics and soundtrack Chocobo GP: The Gold Saucer track, from Final Fantasy VII The story mode, so desired by Mario Kart players, was rather disappointing. In essence, there are some rather static (but dubbed) movies that carry the events forward: they don't shine for humor (despite trying), but the characterization of the characters is pleasant. The problem is not so much in the narration, elementary but pleasant, as in the challenges: in fact, they are always and only competitions. Narratively contextualized races, but we would have expected more creativity: more one-on-one duels, more atypical challenges and different from the other sections. Story aside, there are all the modes you'd expect from a racing game (four-race grand prix, custom grand prix, time trial with online record sharing and ghosts to overcome). Let's therefore focus on online multiplayer, which we have not had the opportunity to try: for those who purchase the complete edition it will be possible to play grand prix online, while for everyone (including the Lite edition, therefore) the Chocobo GP mode will be accessible, an elimination challenge that will involve 64 players. As for offline multiplayer, it is possible to connect multiple Nintendo Switches and play together up to eight players; however, and this is another limitation of the game, it is not possible to face more than two users from the same system. Chocobo GP: Zozo, from Final Fantasy VI Graphically the title is not very ambitious, however it is made with skill and expertise. The design of the settings and characters is really pleasant, and although the polygons are not abundant, although the lighting system is certainly not cutting-edge, the general aspect is appreciable, and suitable for the identity of the game. In our experience, the frame rate seemed stable, apart from a few particularly chaotic situations. A final observation on the soundtrack, which does not excel but pleasantly accompanies the action; except for the haunting (sung) piece of the main menu, which will manage to make the moments between one race and another unnerving.", "date": "2022-03-03", "grade": "7.5"}
