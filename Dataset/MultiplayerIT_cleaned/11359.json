{"name": "Race Driver: GRID - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/race-driver-grid-recensione.html", "text": "Ladies and Gentlemen: Start Your Engines! GRID has its intimate roots in the previous Codemaster game, that Colin DiRT who has been able to reinvigorate interest in a series now devoted to soulless sequelization after so many years. The graphics engine is the same, but enhanced, tweaked and perfected: it's called Ego, and will in all probability be the proprietary engine used in all future productions of the English software house. The soul of GRID is strongly oriented towards the spectacular and cinematographic action, and this can be seen right from the presentation, which is exciting and full of daring shots. It is precisely the initial sequence that makes us understand what the new Codemasters racing game is made of, variety is the watchword, with Touring Car races, drifting challenges in Japan, long grand prix at Le Mans, Muscle American cars, city and suburban routes and much more. GRID is extremely varied and offers the player a long series of options that manage to never get tired and at the same time offer an excellent sense of progression within the game. Tracks include San Francisco, Washington, Yokohama, Shibuya, and our own Milan. The De la Sarthe circuit is dedicated to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and Jarama has also been included, a beautiful Spanish track which in the past hosted some Formula One grand prix but which was then deemed too dangerous and relegated to minor competitions. GRID has some role-playing elements, such as the need to maintain a level of trust and reputation with the sponsors, by winning or placing us in the competitions of the season. The spectacular soul of GRID is revealed above all during the exciting replays, where we have the possibility to rewind or slow down the action from different points of view. The high rate of adrenaline that is reached during the races is helped by the multiple shots available, including the much loved / hated view from inside the cockpit that will delight those who have already appreciated it in DiRT and Project Ghotam. While we are competing, it is possible to take advantage of a ~time jump~ backwards in the event of an error, just like in the good S.C.A.R. by Milestone or in the recent Need for Speed Most Wanted. The option, automatically deactivated by choosing the Pro degree of difficulty, allows you to go back in time by a few seconds, which can be managed by pressing the left analog as if it were a real replay. Finally, pressing X at the moment in which we want to resume the race, everything starts again as if our mistake were magically cancelled. GRID starts strong, immediately engaging fifth gear, without tutorials, without exhausting editors, without waiting, but directly inside a Dodge Viper launched at breakneck speed. Each competition wins money, useful for shopping, unlocking bonuses, tracks and continuing in the story mode. Before leaving, all you have to do is choose your nationality and name, which is then used by the narrator to speak to us in the first person both in competition situations and during explanations. There is also a nickname to select, from a large list of aggressive words such as ~Lightning Bolt~, ~Torpedo~, ~Legend~, depending on your mood or your character. The spectacular soul of GRID is revealed above all during the exciting replays, where we have the possibility to rewind or slow down the action from different points of view Ladies and Gentlemen: Start Your Engines! Audio customization is an excellent strategy to increase the sense of identification in the game action and in the progression of the motoring adventure: the guiding voice is always present, both in the pits and in the race, and underlines every most exciting moment. After a few hours of play, however, one begins to hope to hear it more and more rarely, as it often happens that the comments arrive slightly late compared to the event, or that a dialogue starts that has no bearing on the context of that precise moment. As far as the possibility of editing the liveries of the cars is concerned, there are pre-established sets of designs and icons, additional colors and little else, Codemasters' goal was not to allow users to distort the spirit of the game, as often happened in Forza Motorsport and its overly fancy automobiles. After the first GRID races we are offered the possibility of creating our own team, choosing a sponsor and customizing the car with its logos. Once the driving license is obtained, the three main regions where we can compete are unlocked: Europe, USA and Japan. Not all races are available immediately, but they must be discovered by winning and obtaining ever better times and scores. In GRID there is truly everything. It starts with mcars from Gran Turismo, Touring Car, Formula 3, American cars, Drifting in Japan, through city tracks, mountain tracks or official tracks, up to the Le Mans track, where every hour lasts one minute and the climatic conditions change in real time. There are no less than 45 cars available, from Chevrolet to Toyota, Subaru and Nissan, passing through the super sports cars Lamborghini, Dodge Viper and Pagani Zonda, up to the mighty Mustangs of Ford. Each of them drives differently and reacts to external stimuli with different behavior on the road. The physics engine, also inherited from Colin DiRT, shows both good and less good things at the same time. The interaction with the seabed is certainly an advantage, with curbs that bend realistically and give very physical sensations, many trackside elements that fly away and destroy each other, and a good variety of driving styles. The less beautiful part, on the other hand, is given by the very behavior of the cars, which all tend to rotate on their own axis and lose grip with the rear axle, causing the loss of control in a rather annoying way. Furthermore, if the car goes sideways in a bend, it is almost useless to counter-steer to get back on the trajectory: even in these cases the result is always an inevitable spin. The sensation is that too little heaviness has been given to the cars, a factor which is also confirmed by observing the poor reactions of the cars to rear-end collisions. The unique style of GRID The damage system implemented by Codemasters is superlative. After accidents, cars lose parts, which then remain on the track for the entire duration of the race and can damage and hinder other cars. Some minor damages modify the driveability of your car in real time, while the more serious ones will force you to start again. Collisions with opposing cars aren't as damaging as collisions with elements of the track, which takes away some coherence from reactions. The choice is perhaps due to the purely arcade style of GRID, but it is still unbalanced. From a graphic point of view, the game is a polygonal orgy that stimulates our pupils in a positive and continuous way and shows glimpses rarely appreciated in this genre of video games. The models of the cars, by contrast, cannot compete with the precision and mastery of what was created by the Polyphony team in Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, but all the contours given by the track, setting and background elements are sometimes incredible, above all since the game runs constantly at 30fps without any stuttering or slowdown, with beautiful lights, volumetric smoke effects, particle effects, fully damageable models and twenty cars on screen at the same time. The style of the menus is effective: the text is three-dimensional and with dynamic shadows, and also appears in the loading times to inform us of our records and progression in the game, in a very similar way to what we saw in DiRT. As well as the color palette used, very saturated and tending towards sepia. The care placed in the visual sector, thanks to the EGO engine, was also supported by great audio, with music suited to the style of play and rumbles of the very powerful and varied engines. The online part is essential to amplify the already remarkable longevity of the game, and is made up of events open to matchmaking available in all three game territories (USA, Japan and Europe), through a lobby system and rankings for the best times . It is possible to play up to 12 people at the same time, while the host decides in advance driving options, number of laps and tracks, in matches virtually free from lag or uncertainties. Comment GRID is a pleasant surprise in the world of racing games. Codemasters has created a fast-paced, very entertaining title with extremely advanced graphics. The strength of GRID is its variety, with a high number of very different competitions and an equally heterogeneous fleet of cars. Online challenges also guarantee infinite longevity, thanks to an excellent implementation of matchmaking and game rooms. Too bad for some ambiguity of the physics engine and the difficult control of the counter-steering in the corners. Ultimately, a new brand that every motor enthusiast shouldn't miss and that everyone else would do well to try. Pros Many different races Graphics department Excellent online component Cons Difficult to counter-steer Pre-recorded dialogues get boring quickly Editor can be improved Xbox 360 - Goals GRID provides the player with the canonical 1000 points to unlock. In the first game, which lasts an hour, eight of them are scored for about 100 points, while the others will come to follow with an excellent sense of planning.ression. Many of these are tied to specific events, such as drifting for at least 5 seconds, or reaching 200mph. The others are obtained by completing events, visiting available tracks, collecting cars and beating online opponents. Ultimately, a game that offers a lot of satisfaction from this point of view, investing the right time.", "date": "2008-06-16", "grade": null}
