{"name": "Wreckless", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wreckless_a.html", "text": "Only one opponent: the Yakuza! In Wreckless there are two storylines, which you can choose from mission to mission. In scenario A you play as two sweet damsels driving around and blowing up Yakuza vehicles, while in scenario B you play two men who are spies who are also destroying Yakuza vehicles. Although the two scenarios look similar, however the missions you will be engaged in will be different. In the first mission of scenario A you will have to literally throw yourself like battering rams on the Yakuza cars to put them out of order. In the first mission of scenario B instead you will have to do more or less the same thing only that the final objective changes, that is to stop the armed machine and take the contents by blowing it from under the Yakuza's nose. As the game progresses you will have to carry out new, intricate and different tasks. The missions are mainly limited to destruction so that the continuation of the game directed above all towards this aspect could be frustrating and difficult. However, the game has many missions, but you can only move on to the next set of missions if you have finished the previous ones. The gameplay The gameplay is unobtrusive and easy to learn. You can accelerate, brake and drive backwards. Driving the cars isn't difficult and the car will swerve when you press the directional buttons, orienting it as you see fit. You will also have to pay close attention to the atmospheric conditions which will affect control of the car as well as the risk of losing control when going at high speed. In the game you will be faced a few times with different traffic jams that will be created on your way. The beauty of Wreckless is that when you hit and disable a car that is not part of your mission, it will remain on the screen for a few seconds and then disappear, removing the disturbance. Gradica and Sonoro The flagship of Wreckless is the graphics sector. The vehicles are made with great care and when you happen to be involved in an accident the deformations on the bodywork of the car are visible in a very real way. You will also be able to see other drivers inside their vehicles steer in conjunction with the movement of the wheels, and this is an example of how the developers have gone to great lengths to make the game graphically unpalatable. The real strength of Wreckless are the lighting effects. When you collide with another car you will see the sparks produced by the collision and in the night missions you will notice that the lights of the cities are given by street lamps and neon. Furthermore, during accidents involving several cars, you will also be able to see the blurred effects given by the intense presence of smoke that comes out of the damaged vehicles. The replays are well made and can be saved. The soundtrack is particular, even by ear it seems composed of music already heard in the past. Conclusions Wreckless has a great graphic look that takes full advantage of the power of the Xbox. In any case, the ease of gameplay, some physical movement bugs and some boring missions project Wreckless on the step of a driving game that does not pass the threshold of sufficiency. Pros: Lots of cars to destroy Amazing graphics Very simple and practical gameplay Cons: Uninvolving soundtrack Some missions will seem repetitive and boring You could have done much better Materials: Tips Runabout's spirit lives on in Wreckless Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions is essentially an action driving game imbued with the spirit that accompanied the popular Runabout series. Just like in Runabout, Wreckless places you in control of a car that you must drive through a world full of objects and cars to destroy in order to complete your missions. Unlike Runaboat, however Wreckless demonstrates an improvement especially in the graphics sector, even if however some problems of the past series are repeated in this driving game for XBox.", "date": "2002-03-21", "grade": null}
