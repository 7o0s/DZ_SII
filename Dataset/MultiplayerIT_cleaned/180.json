{"name": "EyeToy Play Sports", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eyetoy-play-sports.html", "text": "Technical realization A common denominator of all EyeToy video games is the essential, stylized graphic approach that is adopted by the developers so that the player can better distinguish his figure from the background or other animated elements. In this sense Play Sports is no exception, adopting very bright colors to increase the contrast and essential-looking figures for the various graphic representations. The result is certainly functional for the purpose, but certainly one cannot speak of spectacular graphics, on the contrary. This judgment is not supported by the quality of the image detected by the webcam, which in titles such as Kinetic Combat is excellent but which in Play Sports needs a lot of light for a decent result. It also follows a non-impeccable precision in capturing our movements, influenced by shooting, which can seriously compromise playability. However, the usual precautions are enough to solve the problem: a lot of light (possibly natural, or in any case white), a little space and an environment that is as least hostile as possible (better not to punch a piece of solid wood furniture: it wins), also because all the players that Play Sports need occupy a certain space... The sound sector is perfectly in line with the graphic one, in terms of functionality. In this case there is also a good dubbing in Italian, which increases the usability of the product by children. All together passionately Play Sports is a decidedly atypical product, which varies in form depending on how many people decide to participate. In the single player, in fact, the game is extremely limited: golf match or wrestling match. It is impossible to judge it in this way, because it is with the increase in the number of people involved that the number of games with which it is possible to try their hand increases, and not by a small amount. We are talking about a maximum number of eight players, all to indulge themselves in front of the PS2: in that case, Play Sports puts aside every brake and shoots minigames on repeat, moreover in a random way, within each mode. It will be possible to make parachute jumps, play tennis, swim, take penalties, hit a punching bag, ride animals, etc. etc. The random game release system on the one hand surprises and is well suited to the party game climate, on the other hand it actually imposes the limits of the product: not all minigames boast the same quality, therefore in this way the fruition is prevented of the only favorite games and perhaps one ends up playing the less successful ones more often. With the arrival of EyeToy, PlayStation 2 pioneered new ways to interact with video games. As always happens when a new technology is introduced - and it is a very current story - the developers have good initial ideas, thought of in the image and likeness of the hardware; then they begin to experiment. In the case of EyeToy, we were faced with various titles that are also suitable for very young gamers, so much so that this peripheral has been somewhat branded as a result. Then came the Kinetic series and it suddenly became clear that the PS2 webcam could serve far more sensible and adult purposes than initially believed. The technical implications have also favored single player applications so far... therefore the arrival of a party game like EyeToy Play Sports is destined to stir things up a bit. Comment It's never easy to judge products that step outside the box, and EyeToy Play Sports is certainly different from other PS2 titles. Its nature as a ~mandatory~ party game, which in single player practically loses all meaning, places it in a specific and perhaps niche segment: it is a game that should only be purchased if you are sure you can use it together with (many) other people. In that case it turns out to be fun, funny and engaging, at least in most of its ~incarnations~. Of course, we could ask ourselves if the ensuing fun is due to Play Sports or the numerous company... Pros: It's a party game Many games available Dubbed in Italian Cons: Valid only if played in a group Technically average Detection can be improved", "date": "2007-01-08", "grade": null}
