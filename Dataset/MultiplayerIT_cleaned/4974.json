And just in these days the full-bodied update 1.11 has arrived, followed by version 1.12 which is the forerunner for this downloadable content, at a cost of 14.99 individually, or 24.99 for the season pass which includes the previous Painted World by Ariandel. Regarding the details of the patch we leave you to the special dedicated on these pages, what we would like to underline, beyond two new PvP maps and matchmaking with friends via password, is the introduction of a whole series of adjustments in terms of balancing , especially related to heavy equipment and weapons. In the first case we have an increase in defense and weight, in the second an optimization of the animations together with a reduction in the energy required for each lunge, in such a way as to make these types of builds more attractive, but also less unbalanced than the rest of the Arsenal present. Even today there are several players who did not go down with the management of the balance and the increased pace of the game, the result, among other things, of a superior response to commands and the experience gained with Bloodborne; we, on the other hand, liked the From Software title very much also for this aspect, much less the first expansion, poor in content and above all devoid of memorable moments. Luckily The City of Rings is of a completely different kind: to access it you must in practice have completed the game without starting a new journey, since you must reach the bonfire that appears next to the one called ~Furnace of the First Flame~, on the road that leads to the final boss fight. The level recommended by From Software is 100, we were 95 and we had no particular problems in the damage done/damage suffered ratio: the ~problem~ is that the Ringed City was designed by the Japanese developer to put the strong nerves of the player, as we will explain in the next paragraph. The review of Dark Souls III: the Ringed City, the expansion that closes the From Software saga The truth revealed Before reaching the city that in effect gives its name to this expansion, you have to face Dump of Waste, a substantial section that appears to be a devastated part of Lothric with destroyed towers and walls, populated by new creatures dominated by darkness. The age of fire is coming to an end and the protagonist must reach the end of the world in search of the dark soul of humanity, within this lost city. The approach is brutal: after a short initial descent you are greeted by a multitude of events and enemies who ~shoot~ spells from a distance, then by the first decidedly aggressive beast but fortunately quite slow. Shortly after it continues to fall disastrously downwards, making its way up to the appearance of a sort of fallen angel capable of hurling darts of magic or curses, and torment the player whenever he is outside. It is therefore necessary to constantly move between one shelter and another, until you reach a swamp that will really test the nerves of even the most calm people. You have to run, avoid being hit by darts, fight, while death after death examine your surroundings to figure out the source of such unbeatable enemy; after great effort to reach the next bonfire which never as in this case seems to represent a priceless trophy. Dulcis in fundo, descending down to face the first boss, which seems like a walk in the park after so much physical and mental violence previously suffered. Finally we arrive from above in the Ringed City, which welcomes the player with an impressive, colorful and sun-kissed glance. It doesn't take much, however, to dust off your sample of bad words again, because in this case an army of ghost archers makes the path perilous, forcing the player to move quickly from one cover to another. The luxuriant context gives way to increasingly bleak passages, to then go up again and reach a castle, about which we don't tell you anything for spoiler reasons. The City of Rings is a ruthless expansion, which not only puts the player in difficulty because of difficult enemies - who then with the experience gained in the base game can be overwhelmed while remaining concentrated - but also due to the quality of the setting, decidedly more inspired than Ariandel's Painted World. Back assaults, magical ranged attacks and knights made with great detail return with force. The momentsbrutality mentioned above and the constant sense of danger around every corner, honestly, they did not cause us particular annoyance or frustration, only the need to think more about the conformation of the setting to understand how to overcome some apparently insurmountable sections. The City of Rings also sees the introduction of various weapons and equipment useful to the cause, with the greatswords above all offering really beautiful yet effective samples of moves. There is no shortage of shields, bows, spells and miracles, including rings already seen in the past but in their +3 version, therefore more effective. In terms of content we are on another planet compared to Ariandel's Painted World, both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view: the Ringed City is beautiful to see and to face, the design of the enemies and bosses seemed inspired both from an aesthetic and technical point of view, such as attacks and movements. We spent over 8 hours playing the game leaving some unsolved secrets; the level of challenge is always there and some gimmicks still manage to surprise despite three chapters and related expansions. There are also important characters in a narrative key and the presence of a majestic creature, which we do not mention directly but whose existence you are aware of if you have sifted through some photos available on the net.", "date": "2017-03-27", "grade": "9.0"}
