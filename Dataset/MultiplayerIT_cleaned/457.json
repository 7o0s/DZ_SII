{"name": "Project Minerva Professional", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-minerva-professional.html", "text": "Codename: Project Minerva Project Minerva is a title that offers very little to the gamer. Proof of this is the meager main menu made available to us by the programmers from which it is possible to access the only two (!) game modes available Since one of these, the ~Free Mode~ is nothing more than a ploy to lengthen the broth allowing us to replay any mission already completed again, let's skip ahead to analyze the real, only game option available, the ~Story Mode~. In the menu inside the Story mode we will have the possibility to make a whole series of choices aimed at getting to know better the actions we are going to carry out from time to time, and to configure our team, in order to make it suitable for the type of mission we intend face. In fact, in PM:P, in addition to the protagonist Alicia, we will be able to control a team of specialists through predefined commands made up of three elements that can be selected from the nine characters available in the game. Each of these mercenaries has different skills and parameters from each other, which makes them unique, even if essentially useless, as we will be able to elaborate on shortly. It goes without saying that it is very important to carefully choose your adventure companions to create the right group for the mission to be carried out. This selection takes place in the ~Briefing Room~ item, where it is also possible to consult the information relating to the missions and select the one to be tackled. Under ~Locker Room~, however, we will be able to make changes to the equipment supplied to Alicia, enhancing the weapons purchased in the ~Shop~, the shop that sells defense devices and other trinkets developed by the UNPAC technological research department. Mission Impossible  in the sense that playing PMP is really an impossible mission. And we're not just referring to the silly PC control system. No, to this programming disaster is added a general AI that is, to say the least, absurd. Alicia can issue orders to the rest of the team, which should allow us mere mortals to plan some field action worthy of the name. It should Because it really isn't. If it is true that there are seven types of commands to give to companions (~Fight~, ~Pursuit~, ~Cover~, ~Retreat~, ~Search for Enemies~, ~Wait~ and ~Skills~) it is also true that they are not needed practically to nothing. In fact, our team members are ~gifted~ with an AI that looks like Einstein in comparison to a sloth, and they will go off on their own, running around the map like idiots, not giving a damn about our orders, while the androids target them with every type of projectile at their disposal. With all due respect to the poor joypad, destined to make a bad flight against the TV screen following a strong hysterical attack on your part. More than expert mercenaries, they look like brain-damaged people released on the battlefield. In short, you are there planning an attack trying to create a winning tactic against the enemy, and after several minutes of racking your brain you give the ok only to see your cronies ignore it completely and realize that you have lost 5-10 precious minutes of the your life with them... Since our comrades don't want to miss anything, and for the reasons described above they certainly don't shine as tops in terms of intelligence, they also need some signals from us to identify the enemy. To carry out this task, Alicia can use particular binoculars capable of ~marking~ the enemies sighted and therefore making them reportable to team members. Too bad, however, that the game is so frenetic that it will be almost impossible to even try to use this gadget ... Go-go weapons To upgrade weapons and have access to a much wider choice of them, you need to earn points by defeating enemies, called TP (Technical Points) which will serve to increase our TEC Level (Technological Level), which in turn will increase the quantity and quality of the items for sale in the Shop. In this sense, the presence of even a lightsaber along the lines of those used by the Jedi in Star Wars should be noted And at this point there is nothing left to do but start the dance. From the very first lines it is evident how the plot, beyond the introductory premises, is linear and of little depth. It develops in fact through a series of CG movies that space out the various monotonous missions, without ever involving or enticing the player to continue in the adventure. So we go on almost by force of inertia with an ~oh well, let's see what's up now and then detach~ which is saying something. The ultimate goal of the adventure, in fact, does not seem so much to unravel the various mysteries that are hiddenThey are behind the A3 or the death of Alicia's brother, but rather to continue to the end, mission after mission, simply as in a common old generation 2D shooter. Though with different objectives, the missions all feel very similar. Once a ~Normal Mission~ has been completed, each of which is characterized by a variable level of difficulty in relation to the type of objective to be achieved, we will be able to start a ~Classified Mission~ and, once the latter is also completed, we will be able to advance to the chapter following. A disappointing gameplay To definitively undermine the patience of even the most hardened gamer and ready for anything and a disappointing gameplay there is also the so-called ~viewfinder~ mode. Our Alicia, in fact, is the only character in the history of 3D adventures who cannot shoot in the third person In practice, the aforementioned mode is not an interesting addition to our heroine's abilities, but the only way present in the game to shoot! When the view is in the third person you will only be able to face the enemies in violent hand-to-hand combat, while to use your firearm you will necessarily have to switch to the first-person view. Which among other things will not allow you to move, thus leaving you at the mercy of the enemies who can instead strike and move as they want and are all equipped with an almost infallible aim. This system is nothing short of horrendous, one of the absolute ugliest features ever seen. In a context of mediocrity like this, it was too much to expect level graphics. And in fact the aesthetic sector of PMP appears to be in line with everything else: sparse, colors that are not very perfect, poor textures that bring to mind the first generation titles or almost for Ps2. The animations are no different: the characters, even the main ones, have uncoordinated movements complete with sudden blocks of the characters immediately after a frantic run as if there were no frames between the running action and the one following the slowdown. The sound stands at discrete levels, but in some moments you will wonder what the hell certain pieces of music had to do with it in certain contexts, given that some of the songs in the soundtrack appear absolutely out of place in some phases of the adventure. Conclusions At the end of the fair, we believe there is actually little to add to what has been described so far in our review. Project Minerva Professional is a decidedly mediocre title, one of those games from which there is little to save, unfortunately. And I'm sorry to give such a negative opinion for a potentially valid product, especially if we consider the fact that it was made by Microids, a team that has accustomed us to higher quality games than this one. However the reality of the facts is the following: PMP turns out to be probably the first real hole in the water by this sofcto. Pros: Great variety of weapons. Not long-lived (therefore the agony does not last long). Cons: Ridiculous weapon targeting system. Very poor gameplay. Poor game AI. In the near future, the planet earth is devastated by a series of terrifying attacks by an unknown android military force, behind which there is almost certainly a powerful holding company, Minerva, which aims to create a climate of absolute chaos. to easily seize power by taking advantage of the fall of the various national governments unable to guarantee the order and security of their citizens. Aware of the global threat represented by these events, the UN decides to run for cover and to create an independent special para-military unit, made up of expert mercenaries, with the task of protecting the world population and fighting the androids. Part of this United Nations military force called A3 (from Anti Android Attackers) is the protagonist of the game, Alicia, a tenacious soldier whose brother was found dead under mysterious circumstances ten years before the events narrated in the video game. And it is precisely the desire to find out what lies behind the disappearance of her brother, as well as a strong sense of justice, that prompted the young woman to enlist.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
