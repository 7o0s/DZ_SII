{"name": "Gears of War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gears-of-war-recensione_a.html", "text": "Last year Gears of War represented a small revolution for Xbox 360 owners, who found themselves in their hands the first real ~killer application~, that game that alone justifies the purchase of the console, which catalyzes millions of players on Xbox Live, and which still, after twelve months, keeps them glued to the screen in adrenaline-pumping multiplayer games (only Halo 3 recently ousted GoW from the top of the most popular games on Live). Well Gears of War has finally arrived on our PCs, and it did so without giving up anything that made it great on consoles, but bringing a powerful level editor, new multiplayer maps, a new game mode and additional chapters for the single player campaign. Not bad huh? My kingdom for a locust Gears of War tells the story of the rude Marcus Fenix, a soldier accused of treason who at the beginning of the game we find serving his four-year sentence in a cell. However, like a bolt from the blue, his old comrade in arms and lifelong friend Dominic Santiago comes to free him, and due to exceptional circumstances Fenix is readmitted to the Delta Squad, a special army team. The ~exceptional circumstances~ are in this case the invasion of the planet's surface by a mutant humanoid race that lurks underground, which obliges the military to have to count on all available men, including convicts. These mysterious monstrous-looking creatures are called Locusts, and in addition to being able to boast superior physical resistance, they also have technologies in their hands that are certainly not inferior to those of humans. The purpose of the Delta Squad is to recover a tool (the ~resonator~) that allows you to create a detailed map of the tunnels dug by the locusts and then destroy them. After a thousand vicissitudes, the adventure will lead our heroes to the final battle with General Raam, head of the locust army. Will you be able to make them emerge victorious? 20,000 leagues underground Gears of War is not extraordinarily revolutionary or particularly original: its secret lies in small more or less innovative ideas that act according to the simplicity and immediacy of the game; all this translates into a solid and strongly apt blend. In short, Gears of War does relatively simple things, but does them well. Very good. One of the pillars brought is the cover system, heavily inspired by the one previously seen in the PlayStation 2 game Kill.Switch, but certainly taken to a new level of immediacy and effectiveness. By engaging in firefights with the locusts it will in fact be necessary to take shelter as much as possible behind barrels, walls, tables or any other object that can protect you from enemy bullets, in order to avoid a quick and inglorious death. Once in cover, it is possible to shoot blindly by exposing only the weapon, or to look out and, risking being hit, be able to aim much more precisely. This game system makes battles very exciting and engaging: moving from one shelter to another as quickly as possible and leaning out at the right time to hit your opponents is a mechanism that quickly metabolizes and becomes pleasantly instinctive. To help us in this come the commands, specially shaped around this need. 20,000 leagues underground With the space bar key (or ~A~ if you use the Xbox 360 pad), you perform practically any move useful for rapid movement: if with a single press Marcus seeks cover in the closest available cover, with a double click he performs a somersault, whether forward, backward or sideways, and holding activates running. Once in cover, other maneuvers can be carried out, such as quickly passing from one wall to another or climbing over an obstacle. Another little gem, which in our opinion should be exported to many other titles of the genre, is active reloading. In the past, reloading the weapon was done by pressing a button, now with active reloading a little more effort is required: pressing the button for the first time activates a light that scrolls quickly from left to right in the special charging bar, divided into three distinct areas; if the button is pressed again while the indicator is in the largest of the three zones, the weapon jams and precious seconds will be lost in unlocking it. Blocking the indicator on the part of intermediate size, on the other hand, a standard speed reload is obtained, while being able to take the smallest portion of the bar, the actual active reload is carried out, which has the characteristic of being very fast (requires at least half the time than normal) and to give tobullets greater destructive power. As already said: simple but very interesting idea. You extend my life, but you don't tell me right The additional contents of the main story, much talked about in recent months, take the form of five new chapters positioned at the beginning of the fifth act, and add an hour and a half of gameplay on average. They are certainly a good and right thing, also because they finally allow you to fight with that hateful giant monster called Brumak from which in the console version we can only escape, and they introduce beautiful open and vast environments, but they have some construction flaws that should not be overlooked . In the first place, the distance between one checkpoint and another is sometimes really excessive, which is impossible to overlook even considering the fact that the difficulty of the game in these new chapters seems to undergo a sudden increase, in defiance of the normal progression, and this could annoy less experienced players also because, we would like to underline it, it is not possible to save as you like but you have to respect the automatic saving when you reach each checkpoint, just like on Xbox 360. Furthermore, often the feeling of something ~grafted~ by force it makes itself felt more than necessary (especially in the chapter where it is possible to choose different paths). For the rest, the game is still the good old Gears of War, fun, immediate, extremely playable. For those who are never satisfied, and want more multiplayer maps or new adventures for the main campaign, Epic has also provided a powerful level editor, which with a little apprenticeship and a certain amount of creativity could dramatically extend the longevity of the game. title, becoming a real extra weapon. You extend my life, but you don't tell me right But since life is not all roses and flowers, we must also find some flaws. A flaw of Gears of War is that it does not have a narrative structure up to all the rest. The player finds himself disoriented by the fact that the events that created the situation in which he finds himself at the beginning of the game are practically unknown, and are only hinted at in a small page of the manual, or in some promotional films that circulate on the internet. The new chapters exclusive to the PC version clear up some narrative holes left in the Xbox 360 version between the penultimate and the last act of the game, and this is certainly good, but they don't go beyond that. Then, last but not least, the characters remain rather flat and all look a bit alike. A deeper development of the various protagonists would have been the icing on the cake for a real masterpiece. In terms of longevity, Gears of War can guarantee the average player a duration of about 13-14 hours, which could rise to 16 for those wise individuals who decide to start the game directly on intermediate difficulty. Then it must be said that the single player campaign is so fun that many will not disdain a good encore. And let's not forget about him... The multiplayer If Gears of War has been so successful online, there will be a reason. Actually, there's more than one. Up to eight players can participate in multiplayer matches, divided into two teams of four elements each to face each other in various modes: Warzone is the classic team deathmatch, Execution is similar but requires a particular way of finishing off opponents, Assassination focuses on killing the leader of each squad; then there are the new Annex and King of the Hill which shift the balance towards tactics forcing players to man certain areas of the map. All maps are little masterpieces of balance and design, and this PC version includes all those that have been added to Xbox 360 over time with downloads via Xbox Live. The multiplayer Let's not forget a mode that acts as a real workhorse, that is the campaign played cooperatively with a friend, both via LAN and via Live. By the way, to go online with Gears of War you will need a subscription to the Live service, recently introduced in the PC world, but this will have to be Gold (i.e. paid) only for team multiplayer, while for co-op it will be enough the Silver (free). Good news for gamerscore fans: if you have already unlocked all GoW achievements on Xbox 360 it doesn't matter, because on PC you will be awarded the points again, just like if it were another game. Finally, compared to the original version, split-screen multiplayer on the same PC is absent, but no one will cry warm tears for its absence. For the diehards of the joypad We tried Gears of War with an original Microsoft joypad forXbox 360 in USB version and, without major surprises (the game guarantees full support), the result was absolutely perfect. The controls are responsive, the analog sticks are precise and respond quickly: if only the sporadic swaps we'll talk about a little later didn't spoil the party, the general feeling would be that of playing the console version. In the PC world, there are really many keyboard and mouse aficionados, but we also recommend trying to use a joypad for even the most fundamentalists: they could be in for a real surprise. The only real advantages that the use of the mouse and keyboard can bring are in the greater speed to turn around, which can also be increased with the joypad by selecting a greater response sensitivity, and in the possibility of performing somersaults with the double click of the W, A, S keys , d. Graphics and sound Despite being over a year old in design, when set to the maximum level of detail Gears of War ensures a graphical magnificence like few other PC titles can do. Thanks to the now famous Unreal Engine 3, which on PC can also count on DirectX 10 support, the amount of polygons on the screen is remarkable, as are the numerous effects used, from motion blur to HDR, passing through the depth of field (or depth of field). The beauty is that the artistic side is no different, and is capable of making us go from gloomy and obscure environments, at times oppressive and claustrophobic, to almost poetic landscapes, such as the Fenix mansion and its surroundings, where a warm autumn foliage that dances in the sky it frames a beautiful lake. Ultimately we can not label Gears of War as a particularly heavy game. With the test configuration, if everything was maxed out at 1920x1200, the game didn't go beyond 20 frames per second - not a bad result. By lowering some details or, even better, bringing the resolution to more human values, the performance improvement is clear. Graphics and sound A non-negligible problem is that of swapping: this review build has the bad habit of swapping, i.e. accessing the hard disk at regular intervals to make loads causing jerks that interrupt the fluidity of the action, regardless of the frames per second . This problem is almost certainly due to the still immature optimization of the data flow (streaming, especially of the textures), a flaw that sometimes afflicts the development of games on PC. Epic Games itself has stated that it is in the process of fixing this, so in the version that you will find in stores (or at most with a first patch) everything should be fine. The Epic Games shooter holds the flag high even when it comes to sound, presenting quality and never out of place musical compositions, as well as particularly spot-on sound effects with great personality. As regards the dubbing, while preferring the original in English, simply fantastic (the voice of Marcus Fenix is by John DiMaggio, voice actor, among other characters, of Bender in ~Futurama~), it would be foolish not to admit that even the Italian voices are placed in a decidedly above average level, and are more than satisfactory in every single circumstance. Gears of War is completely localized in Italian, manual, menu, voices and subtitles included. Comment Gears of War passes from console to PC with extraordinary ease, and will not fail to conquer this new audience with a superlative gameplay enhanced by small but important innovative ideas, top-level graphics and a particularly engaging multiplayer mode. Being a fan of the genre and not considering buying Gears of War is practically pure madness, and even those who have already played the original title could give it a little thought, considering the additional content and the editor. In short, go and buy it all: you will not regret it.
