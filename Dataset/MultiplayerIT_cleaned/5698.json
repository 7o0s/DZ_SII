Ask the managers of Plants against Zombies who, from an excellent mobile game, have managed to move to the console sector without selling off the brand too much and changing the excellent tower defense mechanics into an absolutely respectable shooter, perfectly accessible by young and old. This without considering all the franchise made of gadgets, soft toys, t-shirts and so on. Plant Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare represented one of the most interesting titles in the first months of life of the Xbox One, although the game modes were not that many. Now, two years later, we are ready to analyze the sequel: will PopCap Games have used the right fertilizer? Will Plant Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 be able to repeat the success of the original? The eternal struggle for public green spaces Plant Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 takes place in a stalemate. The clash between little flowers and brain eaters has in fact reached a dead end, the two factions live perched in their respective fortresses, separated by a strip of land in which none of the sides manages to excel. An exhausting conflict, full of acts of heroism and moments of cowardice, which deserves to be sung by bards and minstrels and which instead at most collects a few screams from zombies who love disco dance. This setting allowed PoPCap to create the first really big game novelty. Instead of a simple menu in which to select the game mode or open some sticker packs, with each access we will be greeted by a real single player hub in which the sections of the title are represented with objects or places. For example, to play a multiplayer game we will have to turn on the portal and physically enter it. To see our statistics we will be able to take a stroll in a trophy room, while to buy the stickers it will be enough to approach a vending machine and so on. Of course, everything is mirrored for both plants and zombies and we can change sides as we please. In the disputed area we will be able to find secret areas, hidden bonuses or simply excellent opportunities for quick sessions in Horde mode. In fact, in the center of the battlefield there is a flag that we can hoist to start attracting waves of increasingly powerful enemies, trying to resist as long as possible and scrape together some coins to use for our purchases. Unfortunately, this choice has a price: the game requires a continuous online connection, even for solo missions, so that every progress can be recorded online. Graphically speaking, however, the game runs at 60 fps on both game systems, but on Playstation 4 the resolution is 1080p, while on Xbox One it is 900p. In this hub we will also find another very important novelty of this second chapter: the single player missions, which will allow us to experience our troops in a series of increasingly difficult clashes against enemy forces, being able to count on the help of some bots. In total there are twenty missions, increasingly difficult and with a fairly varied game design. In some we will simply have to defend our base camp, in others we will have to infiltrate enemies, recover specific objects or eliminate a particularly tough boss. The best one so far was the one inside the mouth of a shark whose toothache we had to cure; Yes, you read that correctly. While not a hair-pulling addition, these solo missions are undoubtedly a welcome change for those looking for something different or want to get familiar with the game. Furthermore, if you want, all multiplayer modes can be played with bots, or perhaps in local split-screen with a friend who, by logging in with his own account, will be able to accumulate money and experience as if he were at home. Meadows and graves The heart of the game obviously remains the multiplayer modes, which in addition to the great classics are enriched with some new options that make the gameplay increasingly varied and absurd. In total there are seven multiplayer modes: the ever-present Welcome Mat, in which only basic characters can be used and those who die too often get a health boost, a mode that mixes all the others in random battles, the team deathmatch teams, one in which we have to confirm the kill by collecting orbs of light, a ~conquer and control~ with three control points, Bomb in which we have to blow up the opposing gnomes by bringing them to our base and defending them for a few seconds, and finally Tombs and Gardens, in which you have to capture a series of control points within a certain period of time until the final battle and wherethe plants can finally also attack. In this mode PopCap Games went wild, because each of the beautiful and gigantic maps has a different mini-game as a final checkpoint that completely messes up the cards on the table and which varies according to who attacks and who defends. In one we have to aim three mirrors to defrost a huge zombie yeti, while in another we played a kind of football game in which we had to push huge colored balls into the opponent's goal. For those who prefer to play cooperatively, there are also Garden Ops for four players, which must be tackled like a real horde mode in which it is essential to coordinate with your companions. In short, it will also be a very simple game (and it is not) but Plant Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 is undoubtedly a title full of things to do. Yes, because obviously both online and offline missions are linked to a series of objectives and rewards that will give us experience and money multipliers, the perfect ecosystem to always guarantee us a reason to play another game. Also to be commended is the game's netcode which, at least for the time being, looks rock solid from day one, exactly like its predecessor. Another plus point: Electronic Arts has promised a lot of free content. We hope that any new maps are as beautiful as the current ones, colorful and huge scenarios in which it can happen to get lost among the thousands of amusing details. Xbox One goals Plant VS Zombies Garden Warfare 2 can count on 51 achievements for the usual 1000 points. Most achievements are unlocked by defeating a certain number of enemies or under certain conditions. For example by killing a plant using the goat or with a specific skill. The other achievements instead concern unlocking new characters, completing a certain number of multiplayer sessions or changing the appearance of our soldiers. Overall not a difficult title to ~mill~, but it could still take a long time. Chlorophyll or rotten brains? Obviously, additions to the roster of game classes could not be missing, which are full of decidedly interesting news and at the moment perhaps even a little too powerful. On the plant side we have the Rose, which fires homing projectiles, stuns and can do area damage for a short period of time; the Cedar, equipped with lasers, temporary shields and the possibility of becoming a sphere that knocks down enemies; and the Corn on the Cob, equipped with air strikes, Matrix-style somersaults and powerful cannons. The remaining ones are those of the first chapter: the Sunflower, the Peashooter, the Sniper Cactus and the fearsome Zombiechewer, still one of the most fearsome plants in the hands of an expert player. On the side of the brain-eaters we have the Zombolino instead, who can throw enemies in mid-air, shoot at 360  for a few seconds and above all summon a Titanfall-style mech equipped with incredible firepower. Then there's the Pirate, who can count on a parrot drone that launches bombardments, a cannon, explosive barrels and a weapon that can both act as a sniper and a short-range flak cannon. Finally, the Zombie Superhero represents the melee class, as he can count on flying punches and kicks, but also on a lethal death ray and a sort of Hadouken. The confirmed zombies are the Soldier, the Scientist, the Star Player and the Engineer. In both cases, the ~historical~ classes have not undergone any additions whatsoever, unless you get the pieces for the special characters. In fact, what will make you want to accumulate a lot of coins (or spend real money) will be the possibility of unlocking different versions of the various soldiers who will be able to count not only on new aspects, but also on different abilities. For example, the Cedar could launch beams that freeze the opponent, the Scientist could rely on a weapon that shoots sonic waves (complete with dolphins stuck on it), the Sunflower launch electric shocks that hit nearby targets and so on. In total we will be able to unlock more than 100 special characters, some of which are particularly rare, the so-called ~Legendary Characters~, which obviously can only be obtained by opening the most expensive card packs (and with a little luck). As for the balancing of the various classes, let's say that everyone will undoubtedly find their favorite character, but in some cases the developers perhaps fell in love with the character a little too much. The Rose is a seemingly light hero but capable of doing incredible damage as a support, thanks to its area of effect stun and homing projectiles. The Citron is another very powerful class and so is the Pirate, thank youand the two fire modes, it seemed to us too versatile. Obviously, given the nature of the game, we weren't expecting an ultra-balanced shooter, but perhaps a few tweaks wouldn't be a bad idea.", "date": "2016-02-18", "grade": "8.5"}
