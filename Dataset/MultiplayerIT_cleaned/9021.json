But although it was not born with the ambition of becoming the benchmark for future hardcore games for the innovative Microsoft peripheral, the Texan team's rail shooter has attracted interest thanks to a successful combination of a well-told storyline, humorous parody of old Spaghetti Westerns, and a very fun and intuitive control system. A cocktail that, let's face it, you don't often see when it comes to Kinect games. They called it Kinect... The Gunstringer features an input scheme familiar to those who have played Child of Eden before, with the player using one-handed control of the crosshairs to lock onto on-screen enemies by simply passing over them, before taking them all out at once with a single arm movement. Unlike Tetsuya Mizuguchi's work, however, here you have to give a sharp upward flick as if you were imitating the recoil of the gun, a nice and unexpectedly intuitive idea. If you wish, you are also free to mimic the shape of the weapon with your fingers, although this is not necessary at all and depends on the player's desire to indulge in the constant childishness of the game. In The Gunstringer, the vast majority of time is spent facing sessions in which, while the protagonist automatically runs forward, you have to aim at the screen with your right arm and use your left one to jump or move your alter-ego sideways. The concept is to move your hand as if you were maneuvering the wooden cross to which the strings of a puppet are attached, and after a few initial moments of bewilderment everything seems extremely comfortable, practical and, above all, quite fun. It often happens that Gunstringer finds cover behind boxes, and by moving the wires it is possible to lean to one side or the other, ready to fill the opponents all around with lead. Platform moments must be added to those already mentioned, in which to jump over obstacles and avoid traps scattered here and there, or sessions in which alternative weapons are used, such as shotguns, double colts and a katana. Let's be clear, the developers haven't tried too hard to add variety to the experience, and almost every game element and nuance in gameplay is presented and sold out within the first hour. The boss battles themselves, with the exception of the very first, follow an always identical structure, in which to avoid the opponent's blows until the latter, finally exhausted, decides to let his guard down, finally giving him the opportunity to hit him. There is also a multiplayer option, which allows a friend to join at any time and play alongside you, and when everything works as it should, playing The Gunstringer proves to be a real pleasure, so intuitive, natural and carefree in the controls from making it without a doubt one of the most enjoyable Kinect games out there. The important thing is to follow the canonical instructions, the fundamental one is not to have direct light sources in the sensor lenses, after which the Twisted Pixel title goes to position itself together with those that make us understand what it is really possible to do with Kinect in terms of precision, even when seated. Xbox 360 goals Thumbs up for the roundup of 50 unlockable objectives inserted by the developers: a good part of these can be obtained simply by progressing in the adventure, but there is no shortage of more particular ones that require the player to repeat levels already completed several times. Thus we find ourselves eliminating bosses within a limited time limit, hitting hidden elements of the scenario or driving a boat without touching even a rock. One of the objectives asks to eliminate 18,675,309,000 skeletons, but don't worry: it's more mundane than it sounds. An outrageous show As already mentioned, one of The Gunstringer's strengths, in addition to the goodness of Kinect support and the intuitiveness of the controls, is the crazy and very original setting. The entire adventure is nothing more than a long and enthralling puppet show, and for this very reason each setting is a sort of huge diorama, a stage made of cardboard and populated by little men made of fabric, bandits made of plastic and wildebeests made with cans of beer that, when hit, pop open and send the cattle flying off the screen.But the extravagance and madness of the developers reaches its peak when, between one shooting and another, the audience is seen watching the theatrical show: a huge crowd of flesh-and-blood spectators who indulge in utterances of joy, amazement and contempt to say the least exaggerated. You won't be able not to laugh watching one of those present get up from his chair and high-five the next guy after you beat one of the bosses, while at the end of the 4-5 hours needed to finish the game it is possible to witness one of the more moody interactive sequences of the entire product. In fact, playing The Gunstringer brings to mind the productions of Double Fine, titles that, even when they are not remembered as masterpieces, reveal all the passion of the developers and their desire to have fun while working on the game. To accompany the story and narrate the deeds of Gunstringer we think a solemn voice-over, which exactly as in Bastion often comments on what happens on the screen: unlike Supergiant Games' hack 'n' slash, however, this narrator he never takes himself seriously and indulges in deliberately tacky, snooty and hyperbolic exclamations. Too bad that, although the subtitles are in Italian, being able to follow them often becomes difficult, both due to their extremely small size and because from time to time they go out of sync with what you hear; in short, those who know the Albion language well are certainly able to enjoy this particular aspect of the game more. Finally, along the bizarre journey of Gunstringer it will happen several times to come across more or less cultured quotes from old classics of the past, thus finding himself doing target practice with Duck Hunt's ducks or jumping rolling barrels on a flight of stairs as in Donkey Kong, although it must be said that these last few moments have proved to be quite weak, not very funny compared to the rest, perhaps even superfluous. A large number of unlockable extras and a scoring system try to give an incentive to repeat the previous levels over and over again, but the truth is that, mainly due to the lack of alternative paths or a strategic component capable of stimulating different approaches and a don't let the repetitiveness of the experience weigh you down, the player won't have much desire to replay the entire adventure alone, unless you want to try to unlock all the objectives and try your hand at the Hardcore mode which makes the game much more challenging.", "date": "2011-10-13", "grade": "7.8"}
