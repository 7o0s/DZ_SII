{"name": "Thrillville: Fuori dai Binari - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/thrillville-fuori-dai-binari-recensione.html", "text": "Sequel to a product released for PC and last generation consoles, Thrillville: Off the Rails aims to give a new identity to the canonical management video games, giving players the opportunity to build the theme park of their dreams, but also to ~touch it with hand, exploring it at will and experiencing its various attractions. Now let's see if it's worth it or if it's better to take the car and go to the amusement park... The park is mine and I manage it Thrillville: Off the Rails puts the user in the role of an amusement park administrator, a character that can be customized to your liking by choosing from a variety of male and female models. As a manager, your task will be to build a structure that is above all profitable, but which also makes the public and critics happy and which can outclass the reputation of other rival parks. Unlike other titles that started from the same premises (see for example the forerunner Theme Park), Thrillville: Off the Rails is not a classic point-and-click management game full of windows and statistics, but rather a broader product that intends to address a much wider range of users. The player directly controls his digital alter-ego which, framed from a third-person view, can move freely on the territory and from here manage every aspect relating to the proper functioning of the park in a fairly simple way. It must be said that Thrillville: Off the Rails is not particularly rigorous from a strategic point of view, on the contrary: the only real task left in the hands of the user is that of choosing and placing various attractions and kiosks on the ground, following a very simple procedure which however does not spare some satisfactions. It can therefore be particularly fun to build roller coaster tracks, go-kart tracks or minigolf holes as you like, but also customizing the various structures (changing their color or decorations) and arranging them in strategic points leads to immediately visible satisfaction in increasing the number of visitors. There are many activities in which you can give vent to your managerial instincts: you can talk to visitors to get useful information, carry out advertising campaigns and research, change ticket prices and even request loans, but honestly, most of them turn out to be purely ancillary : just a minimum of rationality in the construction process and your park almost automatically reaches a considerable prosperity, reducing the need to keep an eye on the budget to an all-time low. Compare versions The differences between the four versions of Thrillville: Off the Rails are purely technical and do not concern the playful contents of the product. Beyond the peculiar control system on Wii (which in any case does not offer great variations on the quality of the global experience), the changes exclusively affect the graphics sector, which does not excel in any incarnation: on PC and Xbox 360 the game enjoys a higher definition but suffers from some frame-rate problems, while on the Wii there is considerable aliasing. However, it is the PS2 version that brings up the rear, finding itself with both of the above defects. park life That Thrillville: Off the Rails is a product really aimed at anyone can be understood not only from the ~rose water~ management section just described, but also from the minigames that literally populate every corner of the play package. Basically, every single structure of the park can be examined and tested, giving rise to subjective sections (for example in the case of roller coasters) or real mini-games belonging to the most disparate genres. There are fifty of them in all, and they include racing games, puzzles, platforms, scrolling fighting games, rhytm games and so on and so forth: the extreme variety is the main virtue of these digressions, but generally all the minigames are fun or at least curious, and their completion allows you to accumulate points useful for unlocking prizes, bonuses and access to new parks. With such an abundance of content, the developers have wisely decided to equip Thrillville: Off the Rails with a special Party mode, dedicated precisely to the multiplayer use of the aforementioned mini-games: a truly remarkable added value, which however cannot compete with many titles expressly made for group play. Nonetheless, credit must be given to the LucasArts production for having been able to combine the management part with the more strictly playful one very well, managing to create a very balanced video game that leaves the user the freedom to devote himself to the aspects he prefers. Unfortunately all this is notbeen accompanied by a particularly brilliant graphic creation: while not grinding a disproportionate amount of polygons, Thrillville: Off the Tracks denotes some frame rate problems and, depending on the versions, very poorly defined textures and aliasing in rather massive doses. The sound is better, to be rewarded for an excellent dubbing and for a constant musical accompaniment that would not look out of place in any real amusement park. A small disappointment is instead the control system on the Wii, whose peculiar characteristics could easily have been better exploited. Comment Thrillville: Off the Rails offers a balanced mix of strategy and action (through the 50 mini-games), and is one of the few titles currently in circulation that can really be defined as suitable for the whole family. The LucasArts product is therefore a successful ~middle way~, which however by its very nature could dissatisfy those looking for a strategic or a real party game. Although graphically only acceptable, Thrillville is still a fun game and in some ways original, and that's enough. Pros Good mix of strategy and action Quite original Suitable for the whole family Cons Graphically limited Not particularly deep Lacks a well-defined identity", "date": "2007-12-10", "grade": null}
