{"name": "Tom Clancy's EndWar - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-endwar-recensione.html", "text": "The small and lucky Nintendo portable console has always been fertile ground for strategic and point-and-click: thanks to the use of touch screens and styluses, the structural limits of a traditional gamepad have finally been overcome, making room for intuitive gameplay such as that of the mouse on PC, a machine historically more inclined to produce that kind of game. Ubisoft's latest effort, EndWar, therefore also arrives on the Nintendo DS. Finally it's time to take a break from veterinary clinics, puppies to raise and fashion shows, this time we get serious! It's Cold War between USA and Europe! EndWar resembles, in all respects, the famous turn-based strategy Advance Wars by Nintendo. The game structure, for those who have already played it, is in fact the same, with very few variations on the theme. EndWar is also a turn-based game, in which the player plans the attacking action by taking turns with the CPU (or a human opponent). The turn is made up of a movement phase, in which we can move troops and vehicles within a territory and within a precise radius that varies according to the possibilities, and a subsequent attack phase, in which we can choose the type of offensive action to bring to the enemy, but also to defend ourselves or create new allied forces. EndWar resembles, in all respects, the famous turn-based strategy Advance Wars by Nintendo It's Cold War between USA and Europe! Each soldier, tank, vehicle, submarine or fighter has its own statistics: attack, defense, range, displacement, based on which we must intelligently choose what and how to use it on the battlefield. You can choose between three factions, the US, the European and the Russian, the latter only available after completing the first. The story is briefly narrated in the introduction and serves to recreate a credible game setting and a war context that justifies the player's actions. EndWar is set in a hypothetical near future: in the year 2025 the Russian confederation is taking advantage of an ongoing cold war between the USA and Europe to enter the conflict and conquer the world. Troops Attack! Troops? Ready?! In EndWar there are dozens of settings, all well characterized and designed, from the snowy savannah to French cities, from the United States to the Russian steppe. The objective is almost always to conquer the enemy headquarters, but each mission has secondary goals such as destroying a tank, destroying an enemy radar, saving a supply truck and so on. It's a pity that this DS version doesn't take advantage of the console's built-in microphone, given that one of the peculiarities of this title is precisely that of providing the player with the possibility of giving voice commands, an option much appreciated on other consoles. It is also a pity that at the end of each phase, both movement and attack, a short loading screen appears which indicates the satellite connection has taken place, and which in practice breaks up the game action a little too much. The ROM cartridge of the game should cancel any type of loading, unlike optical media. Moreover, EndWar does not even have to process a large amount of data, given that the graphics component is certainly not heavy to manage. The second screen, on the other hand, does its duty by showing us the game animations when we attack and the screens with the statistics during the breaks; the lower one is always dedicated to the map which includes the environment where the battles take place and the military means involved. Goals on Nintendo DS? Yes please! EndWar for Nintendo DS certainly does not shine for a particularly brilliant graphic and stylistic component. Advance Wars itself, a title from a long time ago, is technically more robust and pleasant. The controls work well and the touch screen is perfect for the game genre, but on the other hand the path has already been trodden by many and for a long time. EndWar is proposed as a strategy game with a realistic style: so no more super deformed characters, soft and round tanks, fighter planes that look like Playmobil. The design of the Ubisoft RTS is different, but no more pleasant to look at. The animations are decidedly insufficient and the attack scenes are drawn with very bland and pixelated 2D sprites, with poorly maintained and often monochromatic backgrounds. The animations are decidedly insufficient and the attack scenes are drawn with very bland and pixelated 2D sprites Goals on Nintendo DS? Yes please! The game map is better, it contains many details even if the use of colors is parsimonious and very simplistic: we are far from the maximum potential of which the little jewel N is capableI intend. The audio sector, on the other hand, is the one best done with inspired and orchestrated music worthy of the latest Ubisoft war games. The tone is authoritative and militaristic, sometimes epic, and fits perfectly into the game. Additionally, some rendered voices can occasionally be heard during gameplay, adding to the sound package. The remarkable longevity given by the three campaigns is further increased by the objectives to be unlocked during the missions, which like the ones we are used to on Xbox360 tend to make us dissect the game until we obtain the fateful 100% game over. Comment EndWar is a pleasant and deep strategic game that has the only big drawback that it looks too much like other titles already released in the past. The peculiarity of the Ubisoft title is to find a different graphic style, based on realism rather than stylization as the competition did, but unfortunately the technical realization is decidedly below the potential of the Nintendo DS hardware. The gameplay works well with the use of the touch and stylus, a pity for the lack of the possibility of using the microphone and the numerous (albeit very short) uploads between each phase of the game action. Dedicated to lovers of turn-based strategy games with a realistic war setting. For everyone else, avoid. Pros Multiplayer for two people Proven gameplay Long and deep, thanks to the objectives and the editor Cons Anonymous graphics compartment Doesn't use the microphone Too many uploads After an exhaustive tutorial spanning three missions, the single player campaign begins. The maps are almost never huge, at least not more than those already seen in Advance Wars, thus maintaining a more strategic and non-dispersive feeling that is almost close to chess. The campaign is divided into three parts, depending on the initially chosen faction: many hours are needed to finish the whole game. EndWar is a long-lived and challenging game, especially in the last Russian campaign which corresponds to a medium-high difficulty. Going forward in the single player also unlocks new maps that can be used against a friend, in multiplayer via the Nintendo DS wireless, in which each player is required to have a copy of the game. Through a full-bodied editor it is also possible to create customized maps and share them with friends, save them, modify them at any time and use them for versus.", "date": "2008-12-11", "grade": null}
