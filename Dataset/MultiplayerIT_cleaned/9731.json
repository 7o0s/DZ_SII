It is now a real ~idea~, a way of making a genre, the Japanese Role Playing Game, with which only a few other software houses have managed to compete in almost twenty-five years of honorable service. For some years there has been much debate about the path taken by this historic saga: now in its fourteenth episode, including the two online chapters and excluding the various spin-offs, Square Enix seems to have lost a bit of sight of the spirit that distinguished the first episodes of the series, focusing more on the showmanship allowed by technological progress. Here, in this sense Final Fantasy: 4 Heroes of Light is a rather sensational turnaround. The producer Tomoya Asano himself defines it ~a classic RPG that uses today's technology~ and in fact this spin-off draws heavily on the 8bit tradition of the series to offer a paradoxically new experience to those who have lost the origins of the saga. Said like this it would almost seem like a positive thing, in reality there is a few too many problems... A fairy tale from other times The story of Final Fantasy: 4 Heroes of Light looks more like a fairy tale than a psychological sci-fi catchphrase like the ones Square Enix has accustomed us to with the latest iterations of the mother series. Here the main protagonists are four boys united by a common tragedy, the petrification of their kingdom by a dark witch, and by the will of the entity that appears to them in the form of a Crystal. Brandt dreams of adventure unlike his lazy friend Jusqua, Yunita is the scrupulous bodyguard of the spoiled princess Aire: the interactions between these characters are the true heart of a story with a decidedly fairy-tale development, in fact we go from enchanted forests to a village built on a huge whale and a country of ice that holds the last remaining dragon egg. To make the evolution of the story a little more lively, a screenplay takes care of it which for half the time enjoys uniting and dividing the four heroes continuously, projecting them into quite different situations: the story is however very simple and the characters rather stereotyped, but to embellish the whole there is an excellent artistic sector. The character design was entrusted to Akihiko Yoshida (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story) and his delicate stroke marries perfectly with a clean graphic design full of style and personality: we are certainly not talking about a 3D engine that squeezes the DS to the max , but the art direction is extraordinary as well as the attention to small details such as the wind that moves the grass, the adorable animations of the protagonists and enemies or the aesthetic variety of the equipment. The soundtrack by Naoshi Mizuta is a little less satisfying, deliberately retro but generally repetitive and monotonous, apart from some excellent songs. A game from other times The structure of Final Fantasy: 4 Heroes of Light is very reminiscent of ~old-fashioned~ RPGs, proposing the classic city-dungeon-city process for the entire duration of the adventure: the dungeons, in particular, are rather dull and visually repetitive, and the challenge in that case becomes more remembering the way back than solving the simple puzzles proposed. The casual fights, on the other hand, require a certain flexibility on the part of the player thanks to the unprecedented Crown System, which actually draws heavily on the Job System proposed in various episodes of the franchise. In Final Fantasy: 4 Heroes of Light you essentially acquire ~Crowns~ which represent the 28 classes and related combat skills of the various characters: it is in fact possible to change a character's Crown by modifying not only its appearance (i.e. the visible headgear) but also the usable stats and abilities. For example, a White Mage will not only be more effective in healing magic, but will be able to use it by spending fewer Action Points: these are the heart of the combat system and each skill consumes a certain amount of AP, which are generally recharged one at a time every turn. The fights take place following the rhythm of old-style JRPGs, the player chooses an action per character and these will be performed during the next turn, in order of speed: careful planning is required, however, because elements such as elemental weaknesses or the inexplicable automatic choice of targets, including non-hostile ones, which you don't get used to before several hours of gameplay. In short, Final Fantasy: 4 Heroes of Light has an interesting game system on its side, but unfortunately it runs into a series of problems that derive precisely from this overly vintage philosophy, starting with the individual inventoryand characters, limited to only fifteen spaces, many of which will soon be occupied by tomes of spells, healing items and equipment. The result is therefore a complex micro-management of skills and inventory marred by a decidedly unintuitive interface; a combination that soon frustrates the player's progression, furthermore hindered by the lack of clarity of the plot: often you don't have a goal or a precise explanation of what you have to do, the player is therefore forced to talk to each character about a new city in the hope to get hints, often cryptic, that indicate how to unblock the situation. Added to this is also a massive dose of old-fashioned grinding, necessary to balance the power of the party in relation to the new challenge to be faced, especially in the final stages where the difficulty of the game undergoes a terrifying and unjustifiable surge.", "date": "2010-10-14", "grade": "7.0"}
