{"name": "Bioshock: the Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bioshock-the-collection-recensione.html", "text": "Thirteen years have now passed since the release of the first, unforgettable chapter of Bioshock. The masterpiece by Ken Levine and the then Irrational Games has changed some rules of the game forever and has given dust to an all too much mistreated genre, which Levine himself had helped to make great with System Shock. The review of Bioshock: The Collection for Nintendo Switch is divided in half between the writer's almost obsessive knowledge of the series and the need to be objective in the face of the work done on a saga that is epochal in its own way. What we can say without The risk of seeming optimistic is that the package of three games, each with its own additional content, runs well and does not sacrifice too much on an aesthetic level. Certainly everything depends on a series of hardware needs, but if you want to take Rapture and Columbia wherever you want, now you have the opportunity to do it! Different stories, one universe It is impossible to enclose the narrative arc of the Bioshock ~trilogy~ in a few lines. Just explaining the connections that link the first chapter with Infinite would require a separate article, also considering the power that the double DLC of the last game released in chronological order manages to put on the plate. For those who have never had to do with the Irrational Games series, the advice is to live it free from any anticipation with all the empathy, madness and masterful writing it brings with it. The first Bioshock is set during the mid-twentieth century, in an alternate world in which a great tycoon, Andrew Ryan, was able to realize his extraordinary utopian dream: to build and make independent a city on the seabed. Rapture has lived in the shadows for years, free from the rules of the surface and intended only for adults, without the dangers of social inequality and supremacy over others. However, the concentration of great minds has led to the absurd ambition of going beyond human capabilities, creating a compound capable of increasing the possibilities of the body, at the price of madness and the exploitation of poor creatures. Utopia quickly turned into a nightmare and devastation has struck Rapture. Where the second chapter, developed by a different team, awkwardly tries to delve into some areas of the history of Rapture, Bioshock Infinite totally changes the cards on the table, transporting us to the clouds, inside another utopian city characterized by a cult as profound as it is risky. Columbia, this is its name, is the backdrop to a story set in the same universe as Rapture but a few decades earlier. Three very different stories which together tell a single great journey into the extraordinary and at the same time destructive capacities of man, without leaving aside a good dose of social criticism of a century, the twentieth century, which marked the greatest rise and the deepest decline of our race. Another immersive sim The definition of immersive sim has been debated for years. This particular term should mean a specific declination of the first person adventure, both from a point of view related to the gameplay, both for the narration, the interactions with the various NPCs and the management of controls and possibilities in the game, it should being able to return an experience as immersive as possible. Bioshock was released in 2007, carrying the legacy of System Shock and a niche genre, difficult to sell. The resounding success of critics and the public, thanks to a successful story, an extraordinary artistic sector and the implementation of interesting and original mechanics such as plasmids, have allowed Bioshock to become a milestone of the medium. The right mix of FPS e adventure was able to attract almost every type of player, also putting on the plate an extraordinary atmosphere and a setting that made its way into the hearts of all players. Rapture is alive, vibrant and extraordinarily designed in every corner of it. Each macro zone represents a small ecosystem, a world apart to be discovered, with its enemies, its little sisters, moral choices and audio diaries, real messages recorded by the old inhabitants of Rapture, now reduced to crazy thirsty for Adam . To help this splendid contextual narration we think of a dubbing in Italian among the most characterized and successful in our videogame history, an element that should not be underestimated. Where, as we have already said, Bioshock 2 tries to ride the wave of success, Infinite is the real sequel / prequel. Set in Columbia in the early 1900s, it never manages to immerse the user in its atmospheres clike the great submerged city, but on the contrary, try to amaze him with its splendid airiness. With the majesty of the skies and the breadth of the maps and with the possibility of almost constantly experiencing the presence of a supporting character who is equally responsibility and advantage. Bioshock Infinite attempts to be a perhaps impossible masterpiece. Levine's real game design dream probably still unrealizable in those days, which would have needed a few more years and a generation of next hardware. The development problems and the need to reduce the freedom and possibilities of action have sunk a gameplay which, to all intents and purposes, turns into a much more classic shooter than the progenitor, losing sight of its real peculiarities a little. is capable of putting on the plate a story that is perhaps less impactful on the individual episodes, but much more choral and characterized by one of the most symbolic, hermetic and particular endings that we have seen in a quarter of a videogame century. The dispassionate advice is to play them obviously in order of release and not chronological, keeping the two additional contents of Infinite as the last element, capable of making sense of everything and leaving you shaken as it has happened few other times. The port to Nintendo Switch Everything we have told you, trying to keep the utmost confidentiality towards those who have lived on the moon and still have never completed the Bioshock series, is finally also available on Nintendo Switch. In an operation that has brought several 2K titles on the Nintendo hybrid, the Bioshock: the Collection represents another step towards an increasingly interesting catalog. If from a purely aesthetic point of view we can be considered fully satisfied, it is obvious that it is the technical aspect that requires compromises that are not always digestible. Bioshock is not Call of Duty, but it is still a first-person game with a strong shooter component, especially with Infinite. The need to adapt the frame rate to 30 frames, so as to keep it solid on all occasions, had the direct consequence of making the game almost exclusively enjoyable in the portable version. For anyone who has experience with the series on PC or with the same Collection on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One it is therefore preferable to consider this port only if you really cannot do without Rapture and Columbia, for all the others instead the advice is to recover this package elsewhere, at now ridiculous prices, so as to enjoy the experience to the fullest. On the other hand, the sound is excellent, with a successful adaptation, an element that is sometimes underestimated in the conversion work towards the Nintendo flagship.", "date": "2020-06-02", "grade": "8.0"}
