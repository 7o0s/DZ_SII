Waiting for that Shadow Complex which should represent the grand finale of the initiative, Trials HD represents yet another demonstration of the goodness and robustness of the Live Arcade service. The balance of the centaur A bit like in the historic Excitebike, also in the effort of RedLynx - now in its third episode after two chapters on PC - you find yourself riding a motocross bike on a two-dimensional plane to be crossed by traveling the level from left to right; the fundamental objective is to reach the finish line at the opposite end trying to do it as quickly as possible. Difficulties arise as you enter the game, when the levels begin to increase in complexity going to require an gradually greater dose of patience and skill; jumps, ups and downs, ramps, climbs ever closer to 90 degrees, explosions, loops of the loop are just some of the elements that are progressively added in the transition between the various levels of difficulty. A crescendo that finds its realization in the leap from medium to difficult, which represents the watershed between the all in all ~demanding but not too much~ approach and that of the proverbial ~seven shirts~ to sweat. Extreme mode on the other hand is really a kind of nightmare, where even hundreds can be needed (and hundreds) of attempts before only reaching the finish line, not to mention the gold medal. Needless to deny that frustration is really around the corner, even for those accustomed to ~difficult~ games that now seem like an endangered species; Nonetheless, even choosing to stop as far as skill and patience can take you, Trials HD still has so much to offer despite the fact that there are no CPU-controlled opponents to beat; the stimulus is all linked, much more than to obtaining gold medals, to the perfect integration of the online component, which constantly offers direct comparison with one's Xbox Live friends in the foreground, as well as obviously the global rankings of the other players scattered around the world. The result is an incredible and constant challenge in an attempt to limit one's performance, to repeat the same route dozens and dozens of times to experiment with new solutions or simply to perfect every single passage of the track. Nothing new under the sun then, but the programmers have been very skilled in putting the pieces together to enhance this component to the highest levels; just think of the select key with which you can instantly restart a stage from the beginning, without even a moment of loading. A too great temptation for those who want to devote themselves to finishing off the fraction of a second, much more suitable than restarting from the last check point (button B) in order to aspire to the top of the standings. Also particularly interesting is the possibility of observing the replays linked to the times of anyone present in the standings, whether they are a friend or not; in this way it is possible to grasp the secrets and strategies of the strongest players, consequently finding further incentives to apply themselves on personal bests. Xbox 360 goals The usual 200 points to be obtained thanks to your progress in the game; needless to say, given the difficulty of Trials HD, getting them all won't exactly be a walk in the park... I try again... Although Trials HD is a very pleasant game to look at, above all thanks to the excellent use of lighting, the technical component undoubtedly finds its element of greatest thickness and interest in the application of physics; despite the obvious concessions linked to the playful element, Trials HD offers a truly realistic approach from this point of view, with the bike always behaving in a more than credible manner. The balance of the pilot's weight is a component that soon becomes essential, as well as the management of gas and brakes and the correct alignment of the wheels with the ground during landing. Aware of the goodness of this aspect and of the great possibilities it offers, the programmers have also created a robust series of extra alternative challenges, sort of minigames in which the aim is maintain balance for as long as possible in or on a huge metal sphere, or perhaps cross rings of fire, or travel as far as possible on a single wheel, or make the unfortunate driver break more bones and so on. A diversion more than gradevole that increases the variety of the package without ever giving the impression of being out of place or added in a hasty and listless way just to make up the number. However, the real turning point for longevity could have been the editor, a powerful tool with which you can create a track from scratch by giving vent to your creativity; it is a pity however that, due to limits probably not attributable to the will of RedLynx, the sharing of one's creations is only possible among users present in the friends list. There is no real community that encompasses user creations, as a result the very purpose of this feature is greatly diminished.", "date": "2009-08-17", "grade": "8.5"}
