{"name": "PC Building Simulator 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pc-building-simulator-2-recensione.html", "text": "There are feelings that only PC gamers can describe, such as receiving a box of a new piece of hardware and immediately starting to assemble it in the tower or, better yet, receiving all the components of a whole new PC, meticulously evaluated for hours consulting dozens of online stores, and then unpacking them and dedicating themselves to a slow and sensual assembly, waiting to connect the new hardware to a monitor and press the power button to check its operation, a climactic moment that alone is worth the expense and effort supported. The relationship between some PC players and the construction of their system, which in reality is never definitive, has something erotic and profound: in some way it is creation and reproduction, so much so that if someone has managed to achieve success by simulating it, i.e. highlighting it essentially playful and primordial nature, there must be a reason that goes beyond its mere exterior, as we will see in the PC Building Simulator 2 review. There is also a story We will build the dream PC To talk about PC Building Simulator 2 you can start without delay from a number, i.e. from the more than 1,200 different hardware components included in the game, all to be assembled and disassembled in the Free Mode and in the career mode. The first is a sandbox mode in which you are free to do whatever you want, i.e. assemble and disassemble PCs as you like, given that you have a practically unlimited budget, while the second, more structured, asks you to manage a PC service shop, then fix problems customers are having with their systems. All using workbenches and all the typical tools of the trade. Don't be fooled, because we're talking about a relaxing and very relaxed experience in both modes, with nothing to really rush us or force us to jump through hoops. Yes, because the essence of the Spiral House title is not the challenge, but the detail. The 1,200 hardware components are in fact reconstructed to the millimeter and require the same steps necessary in reality to be disassembled and assembled. So there are the same screws, same blocks, same fans and so on. Of course, in the career mode you have to make ends meet to buy new tools and improve the shop, but the truth is that the management part itself has nothing too demanding and seems to be thought of more as a framework for the central activity of the game, than as something that should draw attention to itself. However, there is a kind of story: Uncle Tim (the one who supplied us with the parts in the first chapter) set fire to his shop to defraud the insurance and we have to roll up our sleeves by starting a new business. Go to prison, the marrano, but without disturbing us, since we have so many components to assemble and so many novelties to experiment with. Compared to the first chapter, incidentally, there are some new operations that can be performed, such as moddare the cases, apply the thermal paste and modify the cooling of the video cards by switching from the classic fans to a liquid system, more expensive, but decidedly more effective. Nvidia is very present in the game This last aspect is the most refined, so much so that a special workbench and a new tool are dedicated to it: a tablet to monitor temperatures, which can be consulted at any time. Everything is done flawlessly, but at the same time friendly, in the sense that it does not require knowledge of the subject to play. The interface is in fact equipped with a series of tools that assist during operations, making life easier for newbies, and which prevent them from making blatant mistakes. From this point of view, PC Building Simulator 2 seems to have been designed as a game for everyone, despite being very rigorous in simulating the steps required on PCs undergoing repair or assembly, which is definitely a good thing. Manage the shop Moddare produces a certain enjoyment There are also new features at the store management level. Aside from improving the facility, you need to make sure you process the requests in the most efficient order, in order to have high ratings and attract more and more customers. At the same time, you can engage in a fairly profitable side business: the purchase, repair and sale of used PCs. The latter is unlocked once you reach a certain level, so it's not available immediately (it doesn't take much, anyway), but it's a way to cash in well, while paying few taxes. In any case, regardless of how you decide to set up the activity, the core of the gameplay always remains the same: put the hardware on the counter and figure out what's wrong, to intervene in the waycorrect. At the beginning of the game you are assisted by the tutorial, so let's say that you go quite quickly, but if you want you can also proceed more independently. The maximum is reached when, having enough funds, you can buy the components freely, to sell new pre-assembled PCs. That's the moment you know if it's true love or just a casual relationship. Overheating The components are reproduced perfectly As we said, there are many components available, all reproduced in an extremely realistic way and coming from the best hardware manufacturers, who obviously gave their support to PC Building Simulator 2, given the success of the first episode and the indirect advertising that resulted. Let's say that if you want to build a latest generation GeForce RTX, but don't want to spend thousands of euros to do it in reality, this is a great way to observe it and evaluate its size, shape and complexity. GPU fetishism aside, the Spiral House title really offers a lot of components of all kinds, which translate into hours and hours of gameplay for enthusiasts. In this sense we are faced with the best possible simulation, which takes what was good in the first episode and intelligently adds new features, without ever aspiring to distort its formula. From a technical point of view, PC Building Simulator is excellent, in the sense that it does exactly what it has to do: the setting is reproduced with a decent level of detail, while the hardware components, as already pointed out, are the perfect copy of the real ones. Since most of the playing time is spent on the counters immersed in the latter, it is difficult to complain about this choice.", "date": "2022-10-24", "grade": "8.5"}
