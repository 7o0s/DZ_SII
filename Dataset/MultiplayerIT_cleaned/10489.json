{"name": "Klang 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/klang-2-recensione.html", "text": "Rhythmic games are not a big news for the gaming scene. Indeed, to be honest, there are galore, especially on the indie scene. After all, the combination of music / video games has always been one of those that has most fascinated developers, probably due to the mathematical nature of both media, which determines undeniable elective affinities. The problem with these titles, in many cases, is their structural limitation and mutual similarity. After all, they all start from the same basic concept: the player to go to the rhythm. Whether you do it with a plastic guitar, with a controller or with a mouse and keyboard doesn't matter, at least in general terms. Paradoxically, but not too much, in some cases the escape route from the standard formula of the genre has an essentially graphic and narrative nature, as in the case of the game object of our review, Klang 2, which emerges from its visionary nature, which transforms every game into a real sensory experience. Game mechanics Klang 2 is played all to the beat of music Klang 2 is actually very simple to explain: whether you use a controller or a mouse, what you have to do is perform the moves indicated by the icons that appear on the screen in the correct times. For example you have to click on an icon, or give a certain direction with your control tool following the indications of an arrow icon, or still hold down on a third icon until it runs out. The difficulties are always the same as for every rhythm game: don't miss the icons and perform the moves in the correct times. The closer you get to perfection, the more you receive a high rating at the end of a level/song, with a rating ranging from one to four stars. The latter in the case of Klang 2 are not just a habit to be shared on social networks, but represent a real currency that can be spent to unlock the next levels and progress the adventure. As the levels progress, thirty in total, new rules are unlocked, which give a certain variety to the action, even if they never take it too far from its basic mechanics. In fact, Klang 2 would be all here, if it weren't for its particular aesthetics and for the choice of music for the soundtrack, two elements that together give it a unique and engaging style. Gameplay Some sceneries of Klang 2 are really beautiful Klang 2 tells a story. The game takes its name from its hero who, locked up in a strange structure of which he knows nothing, finds himself having to fight for his life against opponents who wage war against him with music. In fact, many levels are transformed into real musical battlefields, in which the execution of rhythmic moves, synchronized with one of the songs, is linked to the staging and creates real ballets between the characters involved, with sensorially stimulating choreographies that make it pleasant just to watch what happens on the screen. Giant eyes, laser beams, tunnels, characters darting across the screen... it's got a little bit of everything. In reality, you never have much time to simply stand still and observe, because you have to stay focused on the icons, if you don't want to miss a few shots. In any case, it is inevitable that the sounds and lights generated by the tracks end up stimulating the player, they are so present in the experience and so much are they significant. Tinimations, the development team, has in fact worked a lot on the graphic style, creating a truly successful mix of techno culture and ancient Greece, which offers highly spectacular moments. The soundtrack curated by the composer bLiNd is excellent, which fits perfectly with the visual style, creating an exciting combination, which invites you to play and replay the same songs, perhaps by selecting a higher execution speed, or aiming to get more stars. The only real problem with Klang 2 is that on balance it runs out really quickly, showing a certain limitation, although the random appearance of the move icons makes each game different. On the medium distance it is easy to say that there is little or nothing left to attract the player's interest, unless he gets involved to the point of developing an inexhaustible passion to gnaw a few points from the judgment of the levels.", "date": "2021-10-19", "grade": "7.8"}
