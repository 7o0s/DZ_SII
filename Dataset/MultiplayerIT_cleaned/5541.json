The atmosphere is the right one to tell horror stories and make some macabre jokes. The meeting is also attended by one of the teachers, once also a student of the Kisaragi Academy, the high school where they are and connoisseur of the legends that revolve around her; legends born from some mysterious disappearances and from the fact that the institute stands where once there was an elementary school with a mysterious past, the Heavenly Host. Everything seems to be going well, but the rain doesn't stop falling. In honor of one of the students present, who is about to transfer, the group, made up of boys between sixteen and seventeen, performs a propitiatory ritual to make their friendship eternal. It is at that point that the unthinkable happens: the earth starts shaking, the floor opens up and, after a few moments of panic, the boys find themselves in another dimension, inside what appears to be an old elementary school. What happened? Why are they all divided? Why are there so many corpses around the classrooms and corridors? Who are the disturbing presences that try to kill them? To answer these questions, all that remains is to play Corpse Party, a very original horror remake of a 1996 title. The PC version of Corpse Party has arrived in the West: could we not review it? An important background In the opinion of the writer, one of the great merits of Steam, and of digital delivery in general, is that it has allowed many titles that would never have found their way to retail distribution on PC in the West, to arrive in our area. Corpse Party is emblematic in this sense, given that it is a survival horror dating back to 1996, initially released only on PC-9801 (be careful because it has nothing to do with Windows PCs). In 2008 it was ported to Windows PC in a remake full of new content, released only in Japan (which is the version we're reviewing). However, the most complete edition remains that of 2010 for PSP, which offers richer graphics, especially in the surrounding elements. In reality, more than a single game, for Corpse Party it would be fair to speak of a series, given that it also has two sequels and that in the meantime the original has arrived on Nintendo 3DS and on iOS systems, both also available from us (the for Nintendo's handheld console it is a port of the PSP one, not the PC one). If we wish, we could mention the fact that four manga and two OAVs have been taken from the series, but we believe you understand that we are talking about what is in its own way a small phenomenon, largely Japanese, but with some echoes in our area too. In short, the game of Team GrisGris has a respectable background. Don't be fooled by its basic, RPG-like appearance for 16-bit systems (the original was developed using RPG Maker), because it hides much more Corpses and ducks The adventure of the Kisaragi Academy boys is divided into chapters with the various members of the group as protagonists. The goal is to survive, but to do so you must first understand what is happening and who wants them dead. Above all, we must try to bring the group together. In short, it is necessary to explore, try to read as many documents as possible and talk to the various spirits, to obtain valuable information. The game mechanics are very simple and resemble those of any JRPG in which you interact with the environment by positioning yourself in front of objects and pressing the action button. Most of the game is spent reading dialogue and trying to solve the puzzles that litter the gloomy elementary school, collecting the names of the ghosts' victims. Initially some passages may seem optional, but it takes little to realize that this is not the case: just come across the first of many negative endings. Yes, each chapter provides for the possibility of making mistakes, which force you to repeat large portions of the adventure, to go in search of the lost detail... let's say so. Fortunately, the individual chapters are not very long (they finish in less than an hour), but when it happens that you have to replay them two or three times, you feel tired, especially when it is not clear what is missing to get the right ending. In these cases the tension does not help. Don't get me wrong, because Corpse Party is built really well and manages to convey a strong tension during exploration and some dialogues. Too bad that some moments, which should be the most tense, are instead dull. We are referring, for example, to chases, which with a bird's eye view just don't make it and endstend to become annoying, above all after the movement pattern of the enemy on duty has been understood, nullifying its danger. In many cases it is even possible to block the unfortunates, due to a basic and predictable artificial intelligence. In short, the Team GrisGris game succeeds best when it tells its story by pausing the player, i.e. when the long dialogues start and the small animated sequences that mimic the narrated events. In this, the Japanese developer has shown himself capable of making the most of every trick at his disposal to make the story more interesting and dramatic, with strategic drops in lighting, a well-studied choreography in the animated sequences, with particularly disturbing sound effects and with a voice acting never invasive (only in Japanese language). A praise also goes to the music tracks, some of which are really very beautiful and spot on for the game. At the end of the article, we point out that the texts are completely in English and that for now there is no translation into Italian. We know that many of you are keen to know.", "date": "2016-04-29", "grade": "7.5"}
