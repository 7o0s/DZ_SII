The transalpine software house has made the practice of being inspired by the blockbusters of the moment a real trademark, almost always making up for the lack of originality - and of this we must acknowledge it - with a first-rate technical realization and a quantity of contents enviable. With the present N.O.V.A. 3, however, Gameloft seems to have really outdone itself: not only has it managed to set a new benchmark for FPS on mobile devices, but it has accomplished the not easy feat of cloning two different sagas in the context of a single franchise... Sweet style N.O.V.A. If in fact for the first two chapters of N.O.V.A. they were clearly inspired by Halo, with the third episode the French developers wanted to change register and take Crysis 2 as a model, probably in order to take advantage of the towing of a product with more recent success than the last Master Chief adventure. So here, in terms of design, the continuity with the previous ones is broken without too many compliments in favor of a look that refers openly to the work of Crytek. The exoskeleton of the protagonist, the style of the on-screen indicators, the look of the weapons and enemies and even the setting add up in a single, colossal deja-vu that leaves very little room for elements that can properly be said to have come from Gameloft. The only exception is made up of a storyline which, with its load of characters filled with clichs and trivial narrative cues, succeeds just in order to act as a glue between one stage and another and little more. However, it can be said that the aspects mentioned so far represent the only weaknesses of an objectively sumptuous production, capable of once again imposing the transalpine software house as the opponent to beat when it comes to portable FPS. Following a well-established script, the merits of N.O.V.A. 3 are inaugurated by an excellent graphic realization, which confirms for the umpteenth time the undoubted technical skills of the French developers and which undoubtedly imposes itself as the most impressive so far appeared on iOS systems. Between extensive and detailed settings, solid and well-animated polygonal models, coherent physical routines and galore special effects, it becomes really difficult to find something that doesn't work perfectly in the visual sector of NOVA. 3, especially when all the good things you see on the screen run at a constant frame rate only occasionally subject to a few small hiccups. In short, we are talking about a real technological jewel that deserves to be purchased even if only to please what marvels iPhone and iPad are capable of when they are squeezed properly: fortunately, however, the Gameloft title immediately avoids the danger of celebrating the the detriment of substance, offering a playful package that the majority of similar titles dream of. It starts with a single player campaign that compensates for the aforementioned lightness in terms of narrative with an action marked by an excellent pace, made up of firefights with enemies tough enough to guarantee an adequate level of challenge. Compared to the previous episodes, an improvement in the level design is evident, and the adventure continues in an absolutely pleasant way, with some style drops that can only be found in a couple of not exactly successful parentheses on tracks. Building on the excellent results obtained with Modern Combat 3, the multiplayer section of N.O.V.A. 3 proves to be even richer if possible, making available to users six game modes, as many maps (this time of more than generous dimensions) and a wide choice in terms of personalizing one's alter-ego. Everything works just fine, from the speed and simplicity with which you can create or find a match to the actual action on the pitch, for which we haven't encountered any lag problems. Of course, the design of the arenas is far from original and the gameplay offers practically nothing new under the sun, but being able to enjoy the experience of a good deathmatch on smartphones with all the elements in the right place is already a goal not to be expected. little. As icing on the cake, Gameloft proposes here another winning element of Modern Combat 3, namely a scoring system that rewards games played in both single and multiplayer with tokens to spend to unlock new weapons, upgrade those already in your possession and improve the skills of the protagonist. Finding something really wrong with N.O.V.A. 3 is a difficult undertaking, and the only (slight) bad moods can be generated soit gives it a control system that does its best to be efficient without completely succeeding due to obvious structural limitations. Tricks such as auto-aim and the use of the gyroscope to manage the view allow you to enjoy the action with moderate comfort, although the presence of numerous on-screen keys limits the view a bit and leads to some embarrassment when you press them by mistake one instead of another, given their small size. It's certainly no secret that FPS are a luxury that a touchscreen device theoretically couldn't afford, and Gameloft has once again proven itself adept at getting by with the means at its disposal.", "date": "2012-05-11", "grade": "9.2"}
