{"name": "Goldeneye: Rogue Agent", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/goldeneye-rogue-agent_a.html", "text": "Just be good, I want to become bad! In spite of the past, this time we will be at the service of evil: in fact, we will play an agent (with an unknown name) who, after being fired from his agency due to a caustic and violent character, is hired by Auric Goldfinger, the villain known by fans engaged in a fight against Doctor No. The funny guy in question has also thought of having an electronic chip implanted in the protagonist's optic nerve, which will allow him to exploit some special powers, such as seeing through walls, tampering with electronic systems and weapons of enemies at a distance, and other nice powers that will be acquired as you progress in the adventure. These skills will be represented by an icon at the bottom of the screen, through which it will be possible to select the desired power. The special features obviously won't last forever, but only for a limited period of time. As for the vital energy instead, it too is subordinated to the golden eye of the protagonist, so it will be enough to stay still for a while in order to recover health. This superpower is surely an ingenious invention; pity, however, that it is the only one, since otherwise the title of Electronic Arts looks like an old-style shooter, where the only goal is to kill all the enemies on the screen until you reach the end of the stage. If we then take into account a rough and poorly maintained AI of the opponents, it can be argued that the level of challenge offered is very low. However, there is a good control system to report, which makes versatility its best quality, allowing the user to manage even two weapons well at the same time (they don't necessarily have to be the same.) You will also have the possibility to stun an enemy and use it as a human shield so you get extra protection. All these little goodies unfortunately are not enough to raise the quality of Rogue Agent, who is afflicted by a decidedly flat and monotonous style of play Technical Analysis Unfortunately, the situation does not improve even on the technical side: the graphics sector really leaves something to be desired, being characterized by a low number of polygons, angular models and not very detailed textures, thus forming a rather meager visual picture. I am not exaggerating by saying that graphics of this level would not have found great acclaim even on a past generation console! The only positive note concerns a fairly varied level design of the levels, composed of various landscapes. But the overall judgment remains inexorably negative. The sound part, on the other hand, appears better, composed of effects sampled in a fairly realistic way, discreet dubbing and musical accompaniment appropriate to game situations. Comment Sorry to say it, but we're not there at all! The EA branded product fails to involve the player sufficiently to entertain him: the small flashes of genius initially manage to arouse a moderate interest in the player, but the extremely flat and monotonous game structure leads to boredom after a short time, and the desire to moving forward is almost nothing! Ultimately therefore, you would recommend the title in question only to hardcore fans of the saga, who could find in Rogue Agent a useful element to complete the collection of various 007 titles. For all the rest, however, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere. inclusion of special powers Versatile control system Cons Too linear game structure Unevolved enemy AI Poor graphics In recent years, the collaboration between the gaming world and that of cinema has become very close: various film titles have been ported to consoles, and vice versa, the series best known to gamers, such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider for example, have had their film adaptation. 007 is also part of these tie-ins, and after ups and downs in the past, he returns to the market with the episode Goldeneye: Rogue Agent. Will it live up to expectations?", "date": "2005-02-08", "grade": null}
