{"name": "Scene it? Luci", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scene-it-luci-camera-azione-recensione.html", "text": "The stranger At the same time as the policy of expanding its catchment area in the console sector, Microsoft must have understood that rather than adapting already consolidated genres to more accessible themes, it is better to invest in experiences closer to the commonly heard concept of game and perhaps take advantage of some good licenses . Thus was born this Scene it? Lights, Camera, Action!, video game adaptation of a famous board game - complete with DVD - entirely focused on the world of cinema and everything that revolves around it. There has been much talk of the long delay with which he approached our country, but the reasons behind this choice proved to be immediately valid: the more than 1,800 questions presented were reviewed and corrected thinking of the knowledge of the Italian public and also including many references to local productions. A quiz therefore, a more unique than rare subject on Xbox 360 where, until now, there had been a certain lack of thick products designed to fill evenings at home with friends. The Trumpet  Four thieves on the hunt for millions Taking hold of the substantial Scene it? package, the first curiosities are directed to the four push-button panels inserted: the style is very similar to that already seen with the various Buzz! on Playstation 2, counting a large central button - which also acts as a directional cross in the menus - and four colored keys, to which the answers are associated during the games. All strictly wireless and via infrared rays, so much so that the receiver is also supplied to be connected to the USB socket of the console. The general quality of the plastics is really good and the eight batteries included do not force, at least initially, additional expenses, while the choice not to exploit wireless technology must almost certainly be traced back to a purely economic evaluation. The tests carried out show that at a distance of six or seven meters the reception is still excellent, even if it is necessary not to place oneself in an excessively angled position. The proposed modalities are three, divided into the two regular matches, short and long, and in the group one. The former are the fulcrum around which the whole offer revolves, allowing up to four players to challenge each other in a series of rounds further divided into single tests, three or five: for each correct or wrong answer, a score is added or subtracted which it depends on the speed with which you spoke, with the exception of the first and last tests, in which there are no penalties. Group play, on the other hand, is an infinite sequence of events, to be carried on without any specific goal until one gets tired. Honestly, it is difficult to find reasons that can make it considered a valid alternative to what has already been described, relegating it to a mere extra. So if you manage to recover at least one friend there's really nothing to get bored, but the total lack of online multiplayer is a decidedly inexplicable defect, if not perhaps with the desire to prevent the invisible opponent from having the computer on his legs. But that's a weak reason. To ideally link each passage of the games, there is a sort of plot that sees the players satisfy the requests of a producer, performing the most disparate chores for him in the hope of being able to win his good graces and become a star. Nothing special but a few laughs are guaranteed and help to immerse yourself further in the atmosphere. funny games If the quantity of options is solid but not astonishing, the quality of the challenges that can be tackled is truly exceptional, a pleasure for all avid cinephiles. In total there are twenty-one and they manage to enhance the most disparate individual aptitudes: memory, logic and previous knowledge; listing them all would be too much, but some examples can perfectly illustrate what we are referring to. In Movie a clip is shown and questions relating to the film are then asked, while Sequel asks you to chronologically order the four titles displayed. Decidedly more particular are Sketch, with its drawings that gradually compose themselves and become more and more explanatory, Action, as before but with the poster that is recomposed piece by piece, or Quotes, where you are asked to complete famous sentences. The work done is really crazy, isolating end credits, dialogues, short audio clips or going to research more or less known curiosities, all with skill and without any errors of any kind being found in the translation from English to Italian - for example exclusion of a reference to E.T., renamed Alien for the occasion. Two drops of water-. There's no shortage of fun and all in all you don't need extraordinary knowledge to make a decent impression, even if many of the references designed by looking at older works, will be an obstacle for many. I remember, yes, I remember All those who are afraid of being able to draw the same questions continuously, know that each time the previously selected ones are excluded, until they are exhausted: calculating that a round in Long Game mode includes 25 questions, there are 72 different rounds or many hours of content unique. Speaking of variety, many film genres are treated, with special attention to Hollywood for foreign films but truly exemplary for Italian ones - there is everything, from the best to so-so, from Tot and Mastroianni to Moccia -. Graphically the sketches between one test and another are certainly not the state of the art, but in their very short duration they are acceptable and can be interrupted at any time, perhaps when they start to repeat themselves too frequently. The interface is better, extremely clean and, as for the controls, easy to learn even for those who are not particularly comfortable with pads and the like. Unfortunately, the film clips are not in high definition, but the audio-video quality is still at more than good levels. Thumbs down for the absence of rankings, which in the absence of support for online gaming would still have suggested a remote competition. There is a reference to the Marketplace, which currently contains only the demo but in the future could welcome some of the most famous expansions and variants present in the United States. Comment Given the particular nature, give a univocal and absolute judgment to Scene it? it is quite complex. Lovers of the seventh art will love it madly and in fact there are many reasons to do so: the questions, whether they are international ones or others specially created for Italy, are many and above all linked together through intelligent tests of great variety . The push-button panels are also good, definitively justifying an expense that will be amortized thanks to the many evenings in company. To regret it is not so much the graphics sector that can be improved or the few other flaws, but the total lack of online, in the form of matches but also rankings, which would really have been a further step towards excellence. The vote therefore remains indicative, a suggestion inseparable from personal taste. If the topic is to your liking and you think you can guarantee the best playing conditions, the purchase is highly recommended. Pros Movie buffs will love it Nice questions divided into beautiful evidence The four included button pads are well done Cons Nothing online Graphically simple Xbox 360  Achievements 42 goals divide the usual cake of 1000 points. The task of collecting them all is truly within reach, requiring no particular effort: reaching a certain score or correctly answering a certain number of thematic questions do not prove to be particularly difficult obstacles, making Scene it? one of the most lavish titles of achievement ever.", "date": "2008-03-05", "grade": null}
