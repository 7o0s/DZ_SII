{"name": "Age of Empires 2 Deluxe Edition Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-empires-2-deluxe-edition-mobile.html", "text": "We are now close to the consecration of the mobile phone as a play device. On the technical front, there is little left: displays with QVGA resolution (320 x 240 pixels) are a reality that also belongs to some popular-priced terminals, processors are almost always able to guarantee accurate rendering of graphics and steps are also being taken towards a more accurate and ergonomic input system. On the playful front, things are even better, by now the choice of available titles is really wide and for all tastes, from extreme arcades to more complex productions such as Age of Empires 2, a real-time strategy game that allows you to try your hand at epic and immersive campaigns, previously accessible only using the PC. From the main menu you can decide to play a quick game or to start the campaign, made up of various missions that can also be accessed individually, after having finished them for the first time. The game allows us to get used to the control system and mechanics through a tutorial, but also thanks to a level of difficulty that rises gradually and that sees us using the more advanced functions only after a few stages. Using the numeric keyboard to move the cursor and the FIRE (or 5) button to give input, we will have to move our troops on the scenario with the aim of pursuing the objective declared at the beginning of the mission. Sometimes we will simply have to rout the enemy troops, and in that case it will simply be a question of organizing a good group of soldiers who can numerically prevail over the enemies. In other cases, we will have to scrape together gold, wood or metal in the required quantities. These three elements can be collected by ordering the simple inhabitants to interact with trees and mines, then it will be possible to build a whole series of buildings which in turn will produce goods (whether they are soldiers of different types or weapons). The technical realization of Age of Empires 2 is really excellent, with a faithful reproduction of the sprites already seen on PC and animated in roughly the same way. Moving a large number of characters on the mobile screen often results in noticeable slowdowns, unfortunately, so you'll need to have a device of a certain power if you want to enjoy the game action as smoothly as possible. The work done by the developers actually does not seem enormous, in the sense that we have limited ourselves to transporting ready-made objects in another resolution, but the result is still very enjoyable. The sound commentary is well made, and consists of a couple of catchy tunes that don't make a difference but don't disturb the games either. As far as the control system is concerned, an excellent compromise has been found to insert all the actions of the game and the only drawback is perhaps represented by the fact that the cursor cannot be moved precisely with the joystick in the presence of diagonals, therefore using the numeric pad is often a must.
