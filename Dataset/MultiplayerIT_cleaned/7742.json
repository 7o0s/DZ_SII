Capsized is in fact an indie game that made its debut on PC as early as April 2011. A product conceived and developed by just two people: the graphic designer Jesse McGibney and the programmer Lee Vermeulen. Only now, in the summer of 2013, after two years and a well-deserved success with audiences and critics, does the Alientrap game also find space on Xbox Live Arcade and on the PlayStation Network. How much has the alien experience lost and gained in this move to home consoles? Alien Excursions Published by Namco Bandai, Capsized is presented as a two-dimensional shooter / adventure where we are called to impersonate an astronaut who survived the crash of his ship on an inhospitable alien planet. It will be our task to venture into the surface (and into the tunnels) of this unknown world in search of our fellow survivors and spare parts useful for repairing our vehicle and finally ensuring our escape from the planet. Venturing through the splendid 2D environments, it immediately catches the eye how the levels are finely characterized by a style halfway between the wild jungle and the indefinite organic mass, in a crescendo that gives its best visually even in the more advanced stages. Furthermore, each of the twelve levels is characterized by its own dominant color which amalgamates the scenario, accentuating the idea of being immersed in an unknown and hostile environment. The level design never shines for its complexity but always does its job well, giving away narrow ravines and secret areas to discover. The endowment of our alter ego is also aimed at exploration, starting from a sort of repelling ray useful for jumping higher (do you know the rocket jump of Quake?) or to ward off the alien threats that get too close to our suit space. There is also a grappling hook, which is so reminiscent of the Bionic Commando's mechanical arm in use, which can be used to reach distant areas of the map or even to move heavy objects and which even allows you to grab the same enemies with the possibility of hurling them away. The gameplay of Capsized is in fact heavily impregnated with the use of physics, well implemented in the game mechanics. The use of the grappling hook also becomes essential to have full control of the character in the aerial phases, considering how the inertia of the jump is very reminiscent of the very light one of the moon jumps made famous by the Halo series. In these situations and especially when we find ourselves surrounded by hostile creatures, the ability to move with perfect freedom in mid-air is the difference between life and death. Capsized intrigues and recalls the classic two-dimensional shooter on several occasions We come in peace Along the levels it is possible to recover various useful objects, starting from the fuel for the jetpack which further increases the mobility of the character. Of course, a worthy arsenal to face any kind of danger cannot be missing. Starting from a miserable pistol supplied with low offensive potential, our inventory is reset at the beginning of each new level, the new weapons and ammunition must in fact be collected along the explorable areas, sometimes by squinting (perhaps helping us with the torch) to find the entrance to one of the many secret areas always full of weapons, extra lives and fuel. The number of trinkets of death available is varied and heterogeneous, in particular each weapon also boasts a secondary fire mode that it is good to learn about in order to know how to exploit it properly against the enemies more vulnerable to it. The host of alien creatures that infest the planet is also well characterized, alongside which an insidious local indigenous tribe will also oppose us, which represents the biggest challenge to be faced in the game. There are also some elementary puzzles that never manage to worry the player, often based on the extremely trivial use of game physics using the tractor beam of our grappling hook. These are short variations on the decidedly more action theme that accompanies the Capsized adventure but they certainly don't impress for their anything but ingenious realization. The player's skill is certainly tested more by the shootings, especially in those situations where it is required to think and act quickly to avoid being overwhelmed by an excessive number of opponents. In such situations, it is felt that this port has not helped in the transition from the use of the mouse to the console pad. The crime is regrettedMouse activity as a pointing method, instead of the right analog stick and also the weapon change entrusted to a single key sometimes generates confusion when there are more than two or three weapons in our inventory, making us lose precious moments. Even the use of all the other, indeed many, skills mentioned above do not seem to marry in the best way on the mapping of the pad keys, but the latter is more a matter of habit which is compensated for with hours of play. Xbox 360 goals The twelve objectives available require you to first get 20, then 40, 60 up to a whopping 100 rating stars. Other points are obtained by discovering secret areas and by killing enemies. More specific and demanding are the ~pacifist~ achievements which require you to complete a level without killing anyone and in particular Hard to Die which consists of finishing a level without dying (while 80 are the points if you finish the entire campaign without losing any life). A few extras In total, the campaign mode settles on a duration of about 5/6 hours. By finishing the levels with good evaluations, obtainable by not dying and by finding all the secret areas, you get stars that are useful for unlocking the arcade modes, among which a kind of survival stands out where it is necessary to survive growing waves of enemies within the same area. One of the evaluation parameters is also the time taken to finish the single level, so that the most competitive players can replay them from a speedrun perspective. There is also a co-op multiplayer sector both locally and online but at the time of writing the article the servers are obviously still empty. During our game sessions we ran into an annoying bug that stuck the character in the seabed inexplicably causing his death, this error cost us a couple of lives but it must be said that it was a unique case and never recurred during the test. Other small uncertainties are given by the physics of the objects which, albeit sporadically, can get stuck in unwanted positions, but overall the rendering of the physics within the game is more than convincing.", "date": "2013-07-09", "grade": "8.2"}
