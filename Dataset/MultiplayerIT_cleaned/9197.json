Playing with its past, history, myth, deconstructing it, distorting it and bringing it to a new essence. On the wave of enthusiasm generated by the latest incarnation of Pac-Man, the Japanese company decides to give a DX version also to Galaga Legions, already a remake of a true classic of vertical shooters. Made by the same developers, this new edition follows the same process with impressive consistency, emphasizing the frenzy and achieving the perfect score. Let's see it in detail. My first thirty years Galaga Legions DX features 9 areas, each of which is divided into five relatively short levels, each characterized by several waves of enemies, still in the shape of an insectoid, intent on tearing our ship to pieces. The goal, unsurprisingly, is to clean up the screen, but it's how the operation is set up that makes all the difference. Everything is in the name of style, exasperation and frenzy. Our vehicle is no longer limited on the horizontal plane, but can move freely around the screen, a practically necessary condition given the spasmodic amount of enemies that invade the area. The hordes are punctually anticipated by video suggestions, which diligently indicate position and trajectories. The primary purpose is to identify the nerve center of the swarm, represented in an easily recognizable manner, the destruction of which will involve the elimination of the entire group. It is easy to understand why, since it proves physically impossible to wipe out the industrial and suffocating quantities of enemies in such a confined space. However, all of this was already present in Galaga Legions, including the small Galaga that can be captured to increase the range of fire. The changes that characterize this sequel are to be found mainly in the different management of the satellites, small shuttles that fight alongside us. If in the previous chapter the latter could be positioned at will on the screen, in the DX they remain permanently hooked to our ship, but we can vary the direction of fire. The result in this way is significantly closer to the Geometry Wars twin stick shooter school. Xbox 360 goals Galaga Legions DX features the classic 12 Live Arcade Achievements, for a total of 200 Player Points. Most are achieved by finishing each of the 9 areas, while the rest are tied to the Championship mode and the timed one. The most coveted is the 70-point one, which requires you to pass all levels on hard mode. Given the high accessibility of this game, it won't take long to get them all without major problems. Fun for everyone It is a change that considerably modifies the approach established by the previous edition, but Namco has gone much further, breaking the untouchable taboo of the danger of death and reducing the typical evasion ability of a shooter. A useful algorithm slows down the action whenever our ship gets dangerously close to an enemy projectile, greatly facilitating the player. Fans of Pac-Man CE DX know this feature very well, it is clear that the focus shifts to achieving maximum scores and having fun away from the typical frustration of those who are not accustomed to the genre. This does not mean that we are dealing with an excessively easy game, but one that is surprisingly eclectic, and whose mastering (again: scoring) requires considerable skill and reflexes. In line with this philosophy, there is no longer a real campaign, it is possible to freely tackle each of the 9 available scenarios, or a championship mode totally based on scoring, and even timed. A feature that will certainly be very welcome to those looking for instant entertainment, less so for those who prefer a concrete and lasting progression. Technically Galaga Legions DX is a real jewel, one is often left speechless in witnessing the wonderful swarms set up by the developers, ferociously spectacular, psychedelic, with tasty references to the masterpiece of thirty years ago. There are many different graphic styles, both for those looking for a technical sector in step with the times, and a bitmap revival. The music moves on the same level, alternating classic jingles with frenetic techno tunes, in a perfectly dosed and pleasant mix. There is no multiplayer, Xbox Live is used exclusively for the management of online rankings, an element that ultimately represents the true balance for the longevity of this pyrotechnicor sequels.", "date": "2011-07-04", "grade": "8.0"}
