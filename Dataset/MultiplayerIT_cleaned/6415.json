In Europe, on the other hand, it is generally not widespread, even if there are realities such as Italy, where the top tournament is called the Italian Baseball League, and the Netherlands, where it is practiced at good levels. It should therefore come as no surprise that in recent years even the electronic simulations dedicated to this sport have reached the shelves of our shops with a certain frequency. This is the case of MLB 15: The Show, developed by San Diego Studio for Sony Computer Entertainment, the new chapter of the popular video game series of the same name which for almost ten years has been giving fans of the Major League, the famous North American championship, the opportunity to have fun in the shoes of their favorites. Will he do it again this year? Let's find out together.It is Major League Baseball returns to PlayStation 4 with the 2015 edition of Sony's popular franchise The big baseball Following a bit what is the trend of many sports simulations, MLB 15: The Show does not present substantial innovations compared to the previous edition. There have been some changes to the game mechanics, a couple of new modes and the existing ones have been enriched with more options, but nothing that has been done significantly distorts the overall gaming experience. The game modes are typical of any self-respecting sports simulation, and range from the classic friendly competitions alone or with friends, which can be accessed quickly thanks to the Play Now menu, to entire championships to experience with your favorite team , without forgetting a whole series of quite entertaining mini-games. Obviously the fulcrum of the experience in MLB 15: The Show remain those more complete modes, that is capable of engaging gamers dozens and dozens of hours in grueling challenges for the final victory of a tournament, such as Franchise (with the alternative options Seasons or Online). This allows users to take the role of a general manager involved in managing a team, from training to developing tactics, from managing contracts to scouting players in the minor leagues. All under the watchful eye of the ownership of the team and that of other companies, with the former demanding results, otherwise it is also ready to fire the manager, and the latter ready instead to engage the latter, especially in the event which shows some talent. Another very interesting and engaging mode is as always Road to the Show, where thanks to the special editor, really very complete, it is possible to create a player from scratch and then guide him in his ascent towards the MLB Olympus, starting from the minor fields up to to get to the World Series, following a growth path of the parameters that recalls that of other sports products with similar methods, such as the various FIFA and PES. This section of the SCE San Diego Studio title is quite interesting, and the career of the invented athlete unfolds quite believably, to the point that as he becomes famous he can even get personal sponsors and receive from them personalized gloves, signed clubs and even Nike boots. To complete the offer there is then the now classic Diamond Dynasty, which as always mimics the Ultimate Team of EA Sports sports games. In this mode you can therefore build the team of your dreams through the use of special player cards, and challenge the artificial intelligence or other players via the internet in various situations. The section is simple to use, so much so that it can be extremely fun to play even without immediately buying the various cards useful for making your team progress. Here too you can in fact buy or exchange cards, and upgrade those in your possession. Furthermore, you can also use the redundant ones to improve the player created from scratch with the editor. Diamond Dynasty obviously takes advantage of the online, an area to which the development team claims to have given great importance. From this point of view, some improvements have been made to the sector to try to eliminate lag and server instability from the start, but not all of these problems that had already afflicted MLB 14 have been eliminated, and on several occasions during our tests they happened to us some annoying delays and a couple of forced disconnects. However, online aside, MLB 15: The Show remains a truly content-rich game, and it will hardly bore fans until after months and months of games and championships. Playstation 4 trophies MLB 15: The Show offers twenty-six trophies, including secret ones. In thedetail are 10 bronze, nine silver, 6 gold and 1 platinum. To get them you have to engage in the various online and offline challenges, for example by playing in the Diamond Dynasty mode, or by eliminating three opposing batters in the course of a single inning, winning a championship and so on until you collect them all to get the coveted platinum. Overs Closed the parenthesis dedicated to the different game modes, it's time to talk about gameplay and games. Before going down to the pitch, however, it is possible to take advantage of a rich menu from where you can practically change the setting of everything, acting on functions such as the general difficulty level or on the individual aspects of a match. For example, one can decide to be assisted by artificial intelligence in all phases of the match and therefore have fun without too many worries, or to be helped only on certain occasions, so as to be able to concentrate on elements such as the direction of the throw, the timing of batting or defensive recovery and plays, leaving everything else to play, and so on. Clearly the title gives greater satisfaction if, knowing the rules of this sport and the gameplay of the product, you use the semi-assisted or even manual controls, so as to have total control for better or for worse over the fate of your team. In any case, this opportunity to intervene on the various game parameters also allows beginners to play right away and then learn slowly, choosing the learning curve that best suits them. Once in the game, it becomes quite essential for the gamer to work a little on his team's schemes, also analyzing the global parameters of the team and those of the individual athletes, to choose the most suitable strategy both for the players in the squad and for the opponent of shift. In fact, being able to perfectly manage one's actions on the mound turns out to have a very important function on the economy of the game, as well as the fact of knowing how to take advantage of the batting turns properly. In the first case, with the team in defense, if the pitcher fails to eliminate the opposing batter, it becomes crucial to act dexterously with the rest of his men arranged in coverage in different points of the field, to try to get the ball to a base before the batter himself. Conversely, when you are on offense and therefore at home plate, you need to be quick but not hasty in hitting the ball adequately with the bat. In this sense, it is not necessarily necessary to make a home run, and indeed it is often more intelligent to touch the small sphere just to direct the ~shot~ where it is more convenient in relation to the moment or the strategy adopted, making adequate use of the new feature implemented this year by the developers which gives the gamer greater control over the intensity of the shot itself and the direction to give to the ball. After all, the aim of the hitter is to score by advancing counterclockwise on the four bases placed at the corners of the diamond and then returning to the starting point. Whether he can do it comfortably using a home run or more difficult by running faster than the ball and opposing defenders is in some ways the same. In any case, the movements of the players reproduce those of their real counterparts with extreme fidelity thanks to an improved artificial intelligence that seems to take better account of the various physical and technical parameters of the virtual athletes, and in general the phases of throwing, defense management , batting and running between the bases offer the right balance between realism and fun that has distinguished this production for years now. Another important novelty is then to be found in the graphics sector, which records a series of aesthetic improvements to the polygonal models, textures and animations of the virtual athletes, which seem more real than in the previous chapter, and to those of the public, very varied in composition, dynamic and participatory compared to what happens on the diamond. Then there is a real-time lighting system that even exploits a day/night cycle and credibly takes into account the movement of the sun during matches to generate dynamic and natural lights and shadows. Not least are the television-style direction and the sound, which in turn contributes to making the matches more realistic thanks to a series of samplings carried out in the various stadiums of the Major League, and then integrated into the game in such a way as to also have there reproduced all the festive atmosphere of the fans. Finally, the soundtrack is only discreet, which does not shine for variety.", "date": "2015-04-15", "grade": "8.0"}
