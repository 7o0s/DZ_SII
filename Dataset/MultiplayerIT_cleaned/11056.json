{"name": "Legendary - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legendary-recensione.html", "text": "Old Griffin What appears to be a catastrophe resulting from a simple theft attempt will soon take on much more complex traits. As we progress in the game we will discover that the good Charles Deckard is nothing more than a pawn in a game bigger than him as he finds himself dealing with the Black Order and the Council of '98: two secret organizations very interested in the Vase and its immense power , but while the first will have very unfriendly intentions with the protagonist, the council will offer full support to Charles in an attempt to put an end to the disaster. These developments with a conspiracy flavor will drive the story from the streets of the American metropolis to overseas, in London, also under the attack of terrible creatures. The main feature of the game is precisely the eccentric variety of opponents that we will be called to fight. Seeing a huge golem made of debris from buildings and cars wandering around New York, or being in front of the Big Ben tower surrounded by griffins certainly offers spectacular views that help keep the pace of the action and involvement high. The bestiary is as varied as it is stereotyped and draws directly from myths and legends of ancient civilizations. In addition to the aforementioned golems and griffins, we will have to deal with werewolves, minotaurs, Fire Drakes (fire-breathing lava beasts) and demonic putti that seem to come straight out of Doom3. The care in creating a credible attitude for each different creature is appreciable: each opponent attacks following different behavioral routines, forcing us to adopt different tactics in the hope of getting the better of them, as in the case of werewolves which, once killed, must be decapitate to prevent them from coming back to life. accessory intelligence This appreciable variety and diversification of monsters is not accompanied by an equally high care placed in the creation of the human opponents of the Black Order. Clashes with military forces are always a formality for the player: the soldiers' artificial intelligence is embarrassing, so much so that it is not uncommon to see them shoot wildly with bad aim and remain motionless while being riddled with bullets. Even the behavior of our allies suffers from the same serious problems so as to make the companions appear more like frame elements rather than an integral and active part in the game gameplay. Even the animations that give (or rather should give) life to the various individuals are far from exceptional, appearing very wooden and not very harmonious in the movements. From the mark stamped on Charles' left hand comes the second defining feature of Legendary. This stigma left by the Vase on the protagonist's skin is a useful component in the gameplay of the game, it allows us to absorb and accumulate ~dark energy~ from defeated creatures that we can reuse at will. However, we soon realize that this much-vaunted skill in the game is nothing more than an ingenious method of caring for the character that sacrifices the accumulated energy to restore one's health while the offensive implications of the brand are reduced to the use of a sort of force push that temporarily stuns creatures and has no effect on human opponents. Murphy's Law Legendary's narration seems to fully reflect Murphy's law theory. This law, manifesto of optimism, reads simply: ~If something can go wrong, it will~. And this is precisely what happens during the unfolding of the events experienced in Legendary: the screenwriters never miss an opportunity to apply this theorem by filling the whole adventure with catastrophic scenes bordering on credibility, often even predictable. The linearity of the campaign is perplexing, heavily scripted in each of its components from start to finish, which conveys the feeling of not being so decisive for the development of events. All this reveals the idea that the interesting narrative cue around which the game gravitates has not been exploited as well as it deserved, it is clear how the potential of the script has remained largely untapped and it is a real shame given that Legendary had all the credentials to offer a truly engaging campaign. In the rare phases of calm between one fight and another Legendary tries, with not up to par results, to scare the player by resorting to trivial expedients by playing with the light or with the roars of the creatures, but these attempts only leave the player dumbfounded player, in the end the whole campaign always runs smoothly without any real twist in spite of the drama of the scene that the game would like to convey. Add tomoci that the longevity of this Legendary is really at the limit of sufficiency, offering just 8 chapters that hardly reach ten hours of play, and with an accessory multiplayer where the only note of color is given by the presence of monsters in the deathmachs that affect as a third force commanded by the CPU capable of destabilizing the balance of battle. Legendary? Spark Unlimited relies on the granite Unreal Engine 3 for the graphics sector of Legendary, but the result is far from what one might expect from this magnificent engine. Every scene that we will experience in the game, however spectacular and epic its direction is, will be partially neutered in its visual thickness due to low resolution textures and often poor polygonal models, only the modeling of the creatures is saved which reaches good levels of care and complexity. The environments are mostly reduced to corridors now bordered by rubble, now by burning cars, restricting the player's freedom of movement as much as possible. Despite the small spaces, there are far too many low-quality textures, which deprive the landscapes of that sense of wonder that perhaps they could have enjoyed in the apocalyptic context that Legendary offers, transforming everything into an almost grotesque spectacle. The feeling that the weapons transmit which, once shouldered, does not shine with the exception of the ax which is the most useful and fun weapon in the game is also not very engaging. Comment Legendary betrays in its attempt to offer an immersive experience that deviates from the banality that afflicts much of the fps genre. Despite the excellent premises and the captivating basic idea on which the story is based, it is clear that Spark Unlimited has not treasured the mistakes made with the previous and disappointing Turning Point. Legendary seems to want to mimic exponents of the most renowned genre: a little The Darkness, a little Resistance, without building its own identity, giving up pushing and developing those strengths that could have elevated it to something more than the usual shooter . It remains a product that can make sense if you are looking for a simple fps to play lightly and without too many pretensions, especially in terms of technical implementation, or if you have a particular influence towards mythological creatures in general. but given the illustrious competitors that have entered the market in this period, it is frankly difficult to find a space in which to place this Legendary. Pros Funny mythological creatures to face Good bestiary realization Cons Overly scripted and trivial campaign Longevity too low Technically insufficient Xbox 360 - Goals Completing the Legendary campaign on a normal level will unlock almost half of the 1000 points available without problems. Most of the remaining points are to be unlocked in multiplayer games or by collecting hidden messages around in the form of palmtops.", "date": "2008-11-14", "grade": null}
