{"name": "Tanti giochi in uno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cranium.html", "text": "Usually board games are distinguished by the type of tests that the player must pass. There are those who focus on the composition of words, others who push the accelerator on memory, still others who enter the particular branch of the glance. However, board games that contain multiple ~genres~ within them are rare, as Cranium does. Distributed by Hasbro and quite popular in the USA, this product was born precisely from the need to submit different tests to users within a single context, so as to increase the variety of the action and, consequently, the involvement. Given the success of ~casual~ titles on mobile phones, EA Mobile has seen fit to transform this famous boardgame into a game for Java-compatible devices, trying to carefully reproduce all its facets and also adding some elements that could take advantage of the new media disposition. The result is a nice and fun product, which lends itself as much to single games as to the classic ~pass and play~ multiplayer, with the possibility of replaying your favorite minigames after having unlocked them, through a special mode. As mentioned at the beginning, there are four characters within Cranium who will submit to us the various tests to be overcome in order to reach the final score and end the game: Capa Tanta, an alien in a space suit, will submit us to three types of general knowledge quizzes multiple choice; Pitto Gatto, a painter with feline features, will ask us to commit ourselves from the point of view of visual memory; Stella la Star, a starfish with artistic ambitions, will take care of our musical education with an eye towards rhythm; Alfa Baco, a worm with a brilliant intellect, will finally delight us with a series of minigames based on spelling and word construction. The single game mode is based on the collection of points necessary to reach the planet Cranium, in this case we will have a total of fifteen rounds to score forty-five points. Each passed minigame is worth from one to four points, depending on the speed of completion, so as well as skilled we will have to try to be shrewd and quick as well. The tests based on general knowledge and on the construction of words are initially very simple and their degree of difficulty increases as we pass the stages, while the sections dedicated to visual memory turn out to be a little more complicated. Clearly, rhythm-based rehearsals have little to do with the musical accompaniment of the game and mostly involve pressing the right key at the right time. Each character offers three different trials, for a total of twelve quite varied and entertaining minigames. This new EA Mobile production is immediately presented in the best way, with very nice graphics and characters designed with an impeccable style, whose presence is enriched by transition effects that do their job very well. The interface, which is essential for this kind of title, appears very well organized and legible, with the colors representing the types of minigames and the control system (based on the d-pad and the 5 key) which responds accurately and reliably to inputs. The sound is composed of a series of good quality MIDI music, which have the undoubted merit of being cheerful even if they soon end up being repetitive.", "date": "2009-03-30", "grade": "S.V."}
