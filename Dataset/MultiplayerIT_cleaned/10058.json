Seeing Racing Mania immediately brings to mind, for those who have had the opportunity and luck, great automobile classics of the past with a bird's-eye view, starting, for the writer, from that Gran Prix Simulator with the steering infinity~ in the arcade, passing through transpositions in an isometric view such as Super Off Road up to relatively more recent productions such as Micromachines and derivatives. At an attractive price of 1.59 euros, the title developed by Dracoders, which sees all Italian representatives inside it, really seems to be a strong reference to this kind of games, which have their key aspects in immediacy and fun. In this case of Racing Mania the aim is, guess what, to compete against 9 other cars through fifteen circuits in turn located in three different settings, on dirt roads, cities and in a futuristic context. Acceleration and overtaking As mentioned, the view is from above and the graphics are in two dimensions, the iPhone screen in a vertical position, with steering, brake and accelerator control delegated to special icons on the lower part of the screen. Bronze, silver and gold coins are scattered throughout the track, which if collected allow you to accumulate the money needed to repair the car in the event of damage suffered, but also to enhance its speed and acceleration, parameters necessary to compete profitably in advanced races. The progression of the game is in fact entirely entrusted to the completion of the tracks in the first three positions, to the strengthening of the car and therefore to races made more demanding both by the ability of the opponents and because by increasing the technical parameters of the car it is necessary to be more precise in tackling the curves and the risk of crashing into the sides of the track and the opponents, losing precious seconds, is much easier. In addition to the arcade mode there is a section dedicated to practice, the possibility of choosing cars with different parameters and a local multiplayer via Bluetooth, which allows players to challenge each other within the same race. In its foundations, the gameplay of Racing Mania therefore works quite well, tackling the two-dimensional circuits is fun and the increase in the level of difficulty is well balanced. However, there are several problems of no small importance, starting from a reduced longevity to the bone as the Arcade mode runs out rather quickly, is not very varied and is not supported by other incentives to replay the title. If then, as mentioned, the impact with the game is rather amusing, it should be noted how, for example, the realization of the physics on the collisions with the edges of the track and with the other cars is rather crude, with reactions on the one hand not very credible, and there could be even stay, but sometimes even deleterious and ~crazed~, which undermine the very playability and force you to waste a lot of time not for lack of skill. Dulcis in fundo the tracks, although present in good numbers, certainly do not shine for complexity or variety in their realization, it would certainly have been desirable, for example, to use shortcuts rather than more articulated branches, in such a way as to increase the challenge.
