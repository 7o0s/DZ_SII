Borderlands is that type of work that has been able to move on that imperceptible thread for about ten years, at least as regards the chapters developed by Gearbox. The Borderlands 3 review is as simple as it is thorny, because it requires putting a tested and perfected formula on the plate, which collides with the will of a revolution that has never really been indulged. How then to judge the latest effort of the Texan team, a game that is loudly debated for the most disparate ethical-economic reasons? We have decided to move in a direction that is as simple as it is sincere: that of having fun playing Borderlands 3 constantly for a week. We assure you that, apart from a few slight snags, we would like to return to the Borderlands even now, as we write this piece ! The Story of Borderlands 3: The Calypso Twins and the Vaults Historically, the Borderlands series has never shone for storytelling. The pretexts with which the various groups of crypt hunters set off for their raids, only turned into a multitude of tasks scattered throughout the maps of Pandora, the planet that until this third chapter was the backdrop to the events. It is also true that the second game had expanded the bases and put a villain at the center of attention that will forever remain in the minds of millions of players. Precisely in comparison with Handsome Jack, the Calypso twins are called to clash, new super bad guys moved by always too random motivations and who, even when totally revealed in the last stages, still fail to leave their mark completely. The Gearbox guys, probably aware of where to replace an all too loved character, have chosen the path of subtraction, showing them little or nothing in the first half of the campaign and then focusing on ~social~ personalities strongly related to today's society. Calypso are to all intents and purposes the equivalent of today's webstars, who do live streaming for their fans and who aim ever higher to satisfy the desire of their viewers. This element, if nothing else, represents a not totally ignorable cross-section of society, which also clearly shows us another important detail of Borderlands 3. In spite of what one might think or what some would have us believe, behind the power and the irreverence of a writing that doesn't stop, hides a story that touches on mature themes ranging from the importance of the group to family sincerity, passing through what it means to be a leader and also for the management of mourning. The thirty hours needed to conclude the story by dedicating the right amount of time to it, albeit trying in vain to reach cinematic epic moments, struck us for the way it puts the woman at the center (as it has always been in Borderlands) without placing her on the pedestal of doing good. Just as interesting is the choice to stuff a central section with a series of missions that lead to finding many old acquaintances, without turning them into useless NPCs in an instant. In short, you will hardly find yourself at the end of Borderlands 3 thinking that you have lived a dull and sloppy story, certainly less well-maintained than some current videogame productions, but no less busy for this. A detail above all that highlights the strength of the writing of this chapter compared to the previous ones, is the care with which the infinite secondary missions present have been elaborated. It goes without saying that not all of them reach structural and narrative fullness, but we are talking about a load of tasks (at least sixty) that have some bigwigs among their ranks. Completing them means opening direct channels with the background of an entire galaxy. From the personal follies of mentally burned individuals to distress calls to even the possible discovery of ancient civilizations, side-tasks are the very essence of an otherwise rather dull exploration. Far be it from us to anticipate in detail some of these moments to be experienced but it is clear, in the light of the history of the series, how important it is to be encouraged to wander around the Borderlands. The gameplay perfected If at the narrative level Borderlands 3 has taken a big step forward compared to the past, it is in terms of gameplay that the formula has been fully perfected. In the past months we have told you several times about how the game had not pushed in the direction of the revolution. Playing Borderlands 3 for those coming from the previous chapters of the series is in fact as simple as it is immediate: everything is in its place, from the main menuale to inventory management, passing through the choice of classes and the growth of each individual character. These elements also constitute, at the same time, its best and least successful features. Despite a game system that still works today after ten years and which gives further value to the past intuitions of the Texan team, there is no doubt that the choice not to change anything turns out to be somewhat conservative. In this decade, almost two generations of consoles have come under hand, and still finding yourself wandering around maps divided by horrendous invisible and literally ~clickable~ walls is the least immersive you can find in a video game at the dawn of 2020. to this are also positioned the strong lack of interactivity with the environments and a disproportionate series of essentially empty maps, which do not encourage the search for the few types of collectibles, if not for the sake of listening to yet another recording with a very high level of humor . The paucity of artificial intelligence is almost obvious: despite the physiological steps forward, Borderlands 3 remains a looter shooter and, as such, I certainly do not focus on the intellectual qualities of the infinite cannon fodder that it throws at you on the screen. Since we really have a lot to say regarding the positive aspects of the game, we close the parenthesis on the lightness of the development by talking about the management of the menus. There have been very few changes compared to the second chapter, and this is how we still find ourselves navigating an awkward and not very intuitive interface, without any kind of customization, and with the feeling of having almost saved on work, rather than for a precise choice to maintain structural coherence. Managing your inventory is just like hell years ago, with the consequence that, unless you ~lock~ the objects, you risk ending up selling or throwing away even the equipped ones. The same goes for the map, still not very navigable and, although here enhanced by the instantaneous teleportation without going through the special gadgets, it is hard to believe in the impossibility of teleporting directly to one's teammates' parts, especially in the light of the introduction of the rapid movement within their own vehicles. Except for these elements, we cannot hide that the rest is all there where it should be, including a structure of the quests which, however basic, always tries to put different locations and motivations on the plate. What works best in this sense is precisely the differentiation, valid both for the types of enemies and for that of the four available heroes. The antagonists respond to a series of specific classes, and consequently must be faced more or less head-on. However, within the single category there are a myriad of subclasses, which expand the more the degree of difficulty of the game increases. Each of these can have three different types of energy: the vital one in red, the armor in yellow and the shield in blue. The different elements and some specific perks of the weapons that we will find in the game will prove to be more suitable for one or the other, adding that pinch of strategy that never hurts. Speaking instead of the characters that it is possible to choose, these have proved to be extremely more detailed than has ever been cared for in the past. Each of them can grow as they see fit in each of the three available branches. These allow you to acquire a single active skill, to be equipped according to the possibilities of the chosen class, followed by a whole series of underlying active and passive skills. Their activation will modify not only the class skill but will radically change the structural aspect of the build for one's own character, instructing him towards the most disparate tasks. There is no limit to the possible choices, except that dictated by the current level cap attested to level 50. As always, it is also possible to decide to cancel all the points spent and redistribute them, at a variable cost based on a percentage of money available. We spent about 45 hours in command of Fl4k, the tamer, spending instead another dozen equally divided among the other characters. The differences proved to be substantial not only by changing the hunter, but also by trying to strongly modify an already created build, perhaps transforming a melee character like Amara into a totally elemental Siren and able to fight even from a long distance. This differentiation is one of the most cared for and improved aspects of the title compared to the past. We conclude this discussion on the gameplay by applauding Gearbox for the way it treated the factual play areas. The intuition of adding a slide in game (which by the way can prove to be a very faithful weapon by equipping some specific relics) has allowed the game to reach a considerable maturity. This element combined with a renewed and very fluid gunplay, made of jumps and lead like never before, allow Borderlands 3 to prove to be an experience capable of generating addiction. ENDGAME Borderlands 3, like all members of this genre, must necessarily live in the long term, giving players an exciting and essentially infinite endgame. We will certainly come back to talking about this aspect when we have studied it even more, but in the meantime it is necessary to illustrate how such an important component works and is articulated. Once the campaign is over you have the possibility to choose two different options: one requires you to further raise the difficulty level and repeat the whole journey again; the other allows you to continue roaming the lands of the game but normalizing the level of the enemies to yours and adding ever-changing modifiers. These can be positive or negative and radically change the way you play. The activities purely related to this phase do not include real raid bosses, which will be added later, but the introduction of the so-called ~testing grounds~. These are literally special coordinates that can be found during exploration on the various planets, and which open up to further areas of the galaxy. In essence they are real additional maps in which to clash against a series of opponents up to the boss on duty. For now they are a handful and they certainly don't shine by design, but they stretch the infinite amount of activities present in the game. A couple of free contents have already been announced that will arrive by the end of the year, such as the one that will probably be dedicated to Halloween and which will be added to the four main DLCs planned. Speaking of endgame it is impossible not to mention the ~Guardian Rank~. It takes the place of the old ~badass~ and is nothing more than a growth in experience further to the one that leads to the character's cap. Unlike in the past, therefore, it will not be necessary to complete specific tasks, but it will be enough to play to unlock tokens which can then be spent on some parameters chosen at random by the system. In fact, there are three different specializations: Raider, Survivor and Hunter. Choosing to spend a token on weapon damage or shield total will permanently change the percentages of your account and not just the specific hunter. This choice is especially important in order to push the campaign to be replayed with all the different characters, continuing to gain ranks right from the first levels of the game. Continuing to rank up and spend tokens will also lead to unlocking a number of specialization-specific skins and perks, calling you beyond rank 200 to complete the growth. Graphics and sound We come to the last point regarding this Borderlands 3 review: the technical aspect. We have actually already talked about it previously and for this reason we are only interested in pointing out some issues better observed during the many hours of testing. From a purely visual point of view, Borderlands 3 is a feast for the eyes. The amount of elements on the screen, the frenzy and the colors that distinguish it, represent a brilliant mix that alone would be enough to attract players. Even where some textures don't convince, an extraordinary cartoon style takes care of smoothing the limits and giving the game an applause aesthetic character. The step forward compared to the past is clear and tangible and we challenge anyone to say the opposite. Less good as regards optimization, an element that still has clear elements to solve and which however does not limit the experience, at least on PC where it we tested it. There is certainly some frame drop in the most agitated situations and above all in the first moments after entering a new area: that is, when the game is slowly loading all the assets of the environment. On the other hand, the loadings were positive which in our case, thanks to the installation on an SSD, proved to be practically non-existent. Last praise to the sound, with an apt choice of music, extraordinary audio effects for both the weapons and the environments and a dubbing in Italian which, despite too many repetitions in the voices, increases the involvement and perfectly renders the madness of the world of Borderlands.", "date": "2019-09-20", "grade": "8.8"}
