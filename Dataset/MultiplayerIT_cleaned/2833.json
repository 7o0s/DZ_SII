{"name": "Pikmin 3 Deluxe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pikmin-3-deluxe-recensione.html", "text": "We can only open this Pikmin 3 Deluxe review by communicating the ambiguous feeling we had while playing it: on the one hand, Nintendo has done everything possible to make the game more accessible. On the other hand, no one will take away the idea that this, for Pikmin, is a sort of last chance: this brand needs a large budget to be carried forward as it deserves and, so far, no chapter in the saga has ever sold more than two million copies. Now it's accessible, versatile, and has a huge installed base to draw from  let's hope it gets the success it deserves, to avert rather bleak future prospects. However, we have some doubts that Pikmin 3 Deluxe could cause the sales of this series to explode because, and also in this case we hope to be wrong, it could be its very nature that does not allow a comparable success, to name a random name, to that of Splatoon. Pikmin is a saga that talks about space conquest, environmentalism, but above all it offers a bucolic narrative made up of small heroic acts, traumas and conflicts involving weak miniature beings. It requires a particular sensitivity to be appreciated, both in terms of themes and as playful mechanics. Pikmin 3 Deluxe is the Nintendo Switch version of what many - including us - consider to be the best episode of the series. The former introduced the concept of the saga, but was too limited by time constraints; the second, which added a second protagonist, focused too much on randomly generated caves which, in a title of similar refinement, were crude and inadequate. This third episode, while not making a definitive leap in quality compared to its predecessors - which perhaps will never arrive - completes its ambitions. But let's go slowly. The basic mechanics If you necessarily want to attribute a label to Pikmin, it would be that of a real-time strategy, flashed in the mind of Shigeru Miyamoto while he was blissfully observing the ants in his garden. It is a strategic game with a strong action component, given that the player is entrusted with the control of a character, the commander, who in turn must lead, through the aid of a whistle, an army of pikmin (small vegetable creatures). In Pikmin 3 Deluxe there are three commanders: Alph, Brittany and Charlie. They are from the planet Koppai, and have come to PNF-404 (an Earth where humans are basically extinct) to search for food resources. Their home planet is no longer able to support them, given the unmanageable demographic development to which Koppai has been subjected (as we said earlier, the issues are current). The three captains at the beginning of the adventure, not by their will, act separately; once reunited, alternating control, they give the player many alternatives in managing the day (and, last but not least, they allow you to solve certain puzzles that are impossible for a single commander). In Pikmin 3 Deluxe, as in every episode of the series, the daily limit is insurmountable: you have to reach your goal before nightfall, and every pikmin left free, not brought back to base before sunset, is condemned to certain death ( tends to be nibbled by some hungry animal). It's a timed game, even if it's not a stringent constraint: every day you have to pick fruit to survive, but food is plentiful, and you'll hardly ever find yourself perceiving their picking, except in rare moments, as an urgent necessity .There are three commanders, while the pikmin (in the main mode) are five. Reds, yellows, blues, rocky and winged: each with their own distinctions, each with their own abilities. It is very important to understand their characteristics well, so as to understand which is the best combination based on the day's objective: if the mission is not clear, the reds (for example) should always be carried around. They are the strongest, and the most skilled in combat. In some cases, however, the game requires unusual pairings, such as winged and blue pikmin, which is the only combination able to survive the watery missions (the former skim the surface, the latter can dive... all the others cannot swim, and tragically drown). Main mission Pikmin 3 Deluxe's main mission, ~the story~, call it what you like, consists of four areas... plus one. The exploration of these areas, except in certain phases, is free: there is no precise order in the fruit picking. Based on familiarity with the game mechanics, and whether or not you want to scrape together each food, the adventure can last from eight to twenty hours. It deals withof a relatively short, but beautifully crafted game, and we're not sure that making it bigger or longer would have improved the experience. The enemies of Pikmin 3 Deluxe are divided into various types, and each one has an ~ideal~ way of being faced: however, this is not a puzzle game, and very often it is possible to win, albeit with greater losses, even by following the most intricate. As an indication, we could identify four groups of opponents, from the weakest to the gigantic (if you are tiny beings...) bosses, with intermediate measures between the two. The fauna is well varied: it is not a peculiarity of the third episode, but one of the reasons why Pikmin - historically - is so appreciated. The enemies are hungry living beings, they have nothing ~bad~: defeating them is therefore not like jumping on a goomba, it is not an action without ethical implications. Despite this, it is necessary to do so to continue, just as it is necessary to transport their corpses to the spaceship: by inserting bodies (and other objects) inside the ~onion~, the latter will process them, generating new pikmin. Checks On Nintendo Switch, everything possible has been done to simplify the controls as much as possible, and the result is extremely satisfying: there are fewer variations and nuances than in the past, but interacting with the environment, thanks to the fast lock-on, is easier than in any previous Pikmin (including the original edition of the third). Expert players will probably find it even better by activating the gyroscope (just access the menu), but it was essential to find a system that would simplify the approach to the game, and that would allow it to be enjoyed even with just one Joy-Con. Still with a view to helping novices, visual aids have been included - only upon request. Playing Pikmin has never been as simple and intuitive as in this version, and all without affecting the depth of the work. News and multiplayer We imagined that the game would turn out to be exactly as good as it was in 2013, both for the intrinsic quality of the title and for the lack of direct competition; instead we were very curious to understand the value of the additions to the story mode. These additional missions, absent in the 2013 original, concern Olimar and Louie, the protagonist captains of Pikmin 2, who act in parallel with Alph, Brittany and Charlie (and their paths, in part, already intertwined on Wii U). Although these grafts are quite substantial - we are talking about more than an hour of play, which in proportion to the length of the story is not very little - we were rather disappointed by their nature. Although they are part of the main mode, they are much more similar to ~challenges~: detailed timed missions which, however interesting they may be in terms of difficulty, do not go well with the bucolic and naturalistic breath of the game. They are well made prostheses, but they add nothing, narratively or playfully, to the main story. The other important novelty concerns the cooperative multiplayer mode, which can be tackled - as stated - even with only two Joy-Con. The split-screen is used, with a captain for each player: despite the division of the screen, which takes away a little atmosphere and breath from the adventure, it is a pleasant introduction, capable of giving dynamism to the events. In case the two players are both very skilled, it allows - let's imagine - to speed up the action times. Thanks to this addition, we assume that speed-runs will become much shorter compared to Wii U. The cooperative mode joins the competitive mode, Bingo, in which two players - within the same area - must be able to obtain certain objects, randomly chosen from the game, before the opponent. Just like the challenges, which measure the execution time, these missions turn out to be a pleasant diversion, but they are not comparable to the main mode: this is because they empty Pikmin of its evocative, tragic and poetic component, isolating only the playful framework. Good that there are, but they certainly don't add anything substantial to the experience. Graphics and sound Visually, albeit with a few too many angularities, Pikmin 3 has aged very well. The glance is still enchanting, and although the gap between the realistic settings and the grotesque characters is quite strong, it exudes a valuable overall cohesion. Pikmin is beautiful, in the purest and most candid sense of the term: flowing water, plants in the foreground, cobwebs, animals that move here and there regardless of our presence. Within this natural landscape, it is really exciting to admire the movements of the pikmin, especially when, all at the same time, they do something different: without the framerate ever have an uncertainty, the small vegetables carry objects and bodies from one point to another, like a small army of ants. The soundtrack of the game is appreciable, for how it narrates without ever being in the foreground. It is consistent with the aesthetics of the work, aimed at enhancing the nature that hosts the events. The music is adequate, where Pikmin 3 Deluxe excels however is in the sound effects: the shouting of the pikmin, their expressions of fatigue and suffering and joy, represent one of the most memorable characteristics of the experience. Listening to them panting because they are carrying a heavy load is something that breathes life into the whole adventure. It is no coincidence that Hajime Wakai, who has always been the audio manager of the series, has been chosen to manage and coordinate the sound effects of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.", "date": "2020-10-28", "grade": "8.8"}
