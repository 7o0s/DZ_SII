{"name": "Kingsman: The Secret Service", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingsman-the-secret-service-la-recensione.html", "text": "The words ~tie-in for mobile platforms~ may be enough to scare away even the player with a good mouth and with the best predisposition, but in this particular case we advise you not to run away immediately and try to go beyond appearances to discover a game which actually has something to offer, beyond a film license to exploit in some way. Kingsman: The Secret Service, the protagonist of this review, is an atypical tie-in: first of all because it is based on films that do not exactly represent the latest blockbuster of easy appeal, moreover the two cinematic chapters were already released a few years ago, therefore these are ~old~ products from a marketing point of view, exculpating the mobile game from accusations of easy commercial operation without a soul. Matthew Vaughn's films are based on a comic series by Millar and Gibson, which already makes them interesting works and the video game draws from these subjects in terms of story and characters, but focusing on aspects that go somewhat beyond the narrative. The graphic system adopted, also for convenience in technical terms, is a sort of cartoonish stylization of the original characters and settings, but there is little room for cuteness here because the violence is very present, although tempered by the type of representation chosen . It's a curious mix because it proposes decidedly mature themes and situations but filtered through humorous graphics, which contributes to the surprise that can be felt by playing Kingsman: The Secret Service. At first glance it might seem like a sort of simplified action platform for mobile controls, but in truth it's anything but: it's a sort of stealth adventure with even strategic elements, based on the timing of the moves and the correct use of the various gadgets to spy supplied to Eggsy, the protagonist. At first the control system appears rather cumbersome, focusing more on a quick planning of the choices to be made than on the precise and immediate response to the commands, but once you understand that you are not dealing with a classic action or platformer but with a title which also partially looks at turn-based strategy, then the need to adopt a different approach becomes clear. The leaping spy Eggsy is controlled with a virtual stick to impart the direction and speed of movement, while the other actions depend on the tool used and the context in which it is located. The basic equipment includes shoes capable of making the protagonist make extraordinary jumps, which can be activated by touching the screen and setting the preferred trajectory. This has both the function of moving the protagonist quickly from one part of the screen to another, and allowing an evasive maneuver in the case of clashes with enemies, making us leave the line of fire and allowing us in turn to attack from a raised point using at a sort of bullet time. Weapons and gadgets can be activated with a simple touch on the controls on the screen, while most of the actions concerning the interaction with the scenario are contextual, with the appearance of the icon once specific objects and points have been reached. This creates an interesting mix between the dynamics and rhythms of the typical adventure for touch screen platforms - in the style of Tiny Thieves - and elements traditionally belonging to stealth action, but with more reasoned and almost turn-based strategic actions. The story has elements in common with the one told in The Golden Circle, the second chapter of the film series, but these are above all somewhat vague references and in general the narrative component is not properly explored in the game. This is also a pity, because the source material is very interesting and perhaps a greater characterization of the characters and a more complex development of the plot and dialogues could have enriched the experience more. Strangely, being a tie-in, the developers YesGnome instead wanted to go in the opposite direction, leaving out the transposition of the story into a video game to focus above all on the game itself. The main element is therefore the gameplay, evidently resulting from a certain study on game design, given the rather original solutions that the team has come up with based on eclectic inspirations. A cumbersome defect, on this front, is given by the control system, which works quite well as regards jumps, use of gadgets and contextual actions but has the classic weak point in the virtual stick, now chronic with regard to video games on touchscreens.", "date": "2019-05-09", "grade": "7.4"}
