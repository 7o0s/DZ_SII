{"name": "Off-Road Dirt Motocross", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/off-road-dirt-motocross.html", "text": "There are many car games on mobile phones, and among the best is undoubtedly the Asphalt series by Gameloft. However, the French company has rightly identified a decidedly less traveled territory in the motorcycle variant, and therefore more accustomed to welcoming a new product of this kind with interest. And that's how Off-Road Dirt Motocross was born, a game dedicated -precisely- to motocross where finishing first isn't the only thing to take into account. Yes, because the programmers have well thought of recovering the concept of a classic of the past, Road Rash by Electronic Arts, adapting it to the present day. And so in Off-Road Dirt Motocross they fight, and a lot too; the various courses available are littered with opponents to be knocked down mercilessly, kicking or using ~accessories~ such as bars, baseball bats or chains, thus eliminating them from the race to the finish line. In reality, the aggressive and combative component is only one of the variables considered by the programmers; in perfect harmony with the game structure of similar Gameloft products, the main arcade mode is in fact made up of 7 different settings scattered throughout the world (Arizona, Siberia, Great Wall of China, Sahara...), each divided into 4 individual trials. These can be races, in which it is important to cross the finish line first, but also challenges on the best time, Road Rage in which it is important to eliminate a certain number of competitors, and Freestyle. The latter is based on the evolutions that can be performed on the occasion of the highest jumps, which by simply pressing a button allow its pilot to launch into spectacular acrobat evolutions. There is also a challenge with the ~boss~, which once beaten allows you to get new bikes or spare parts; in fact, there is also a tuning component, which offers the possibility of improving the performance of your vehicle by purchasing engines, brakes, tires and so on. The money can be collected through bonuses scattered in the tracks, or precisely through evolutions and placements. So if on paper it seems that Gameloft's effort lacks nothing, unfortunately this is not the case. The parts necessary to make a valid game are all there, but the final result is not satisfactory due to a series of far from negligible defects. First of all the control system, simplistic (and this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing in an arcade game) and which makes the bike run practically on tracks. The result is a behavior of the medium that recalls the portable electronic games of the 80s, and in the same way the poverty of the animations makes everything more bitter. The artificial intelligence of the opponents is also disappointing, practically non-existent, to the point that repetitiveness is not long in coming. And lastly weighs a hackneyed game structure, without surprises or news. From Gameloft we expect much more.
