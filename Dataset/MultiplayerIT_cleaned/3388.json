In detail, Just Dance 2020 represents the eleventh iteration of the entire franchise, the first chapter of which debuted in the now distant 2009. Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, even if on balance in the last five years the production has is shown to be extremely conservative, and Ubisoft particularly reluctant to introduce substantial innovations. So let's try to understand both how Just Dance 2020 is structured and what's new in the main offer. The gameplay and the first steps The first steps on Just Dance 2020 immediately reveal how the Ubisoft title is, this year in particular, the simple re-proposition of an already known product, with the minimum and necessary updates of the case. The initial menu is identical in all respects to that of Just Dance 2019 (the writer also reviewed the previous appointment, be patient and trust me): opening titles, logo, the player is reminded that for their children there it's Just Dance Kids with new proposals, I invite you to warm up by holding a single Joy-Con firmly in your hand, and then everything is ready to get serious. Noteworthy detail: Just Dance 2020 will identify the save data of Just Dance 2019 already present on the console, thus welcoming you back and bringing with it a small part of the contents already unlocked (but only the aesthetic ones). The player's level restarts from 1 instead, in order not to ruin the progression system. Already by starting the reproduction of the first songs present, it is clear that Just Dance 2020 has not changed the usual gameplay, not even partially. The player then has to start dancing again by imitating as closely as possible the funny characters and mannequins moving in the background (even their design hasn't changed), accumulating points after points and thus filling the bar on the left side of the screen. It is possible to obtain from one to five stars, and in cases of notable skill even the word Superstar, with the maximum number of points allowed. Each score is recorded locally on the console, so that healthy competition can be maintained between different profiles of different players. We remind you that to play Just Dance 2020 you can once again use multiple control systems: the Joy-Con, or download the App for Android and iOS mobile devices. Nintendo Switch probably remains the perfect console for this type of experience, both for the responsiveness and accuracy in registering the movement of the Joy-Con, and because ... well, you can always carry Just Dance with you, and even play it around in tabletop mode, although you will probably attract the attention of passersby. The tracks If Just Dance 2020 chooses to remain in all respects faithful to last year's version from the point of view of the user interface, menus and gameplay, the proposed songs obviously (and dutifully) change. At your disposal you will find 43 unreleased tracks, each of which also features variations and remixes; necessarily below we report only the main ones: 365 by Zedd and Katy Perry, 7 Rings and God Is a Woman by Ariana Grande, Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life, Bay Shark by Pinkfong, Bad Boy by Riton & Kah-Lo, Policeman by Eva Simons ft. Konshens, Taki Taki and many more. Clearly you can evaluate the purchase also considering to what extent these songs may interest you, because otherwise nothing prevents you from holding Just Dance 2019, perhaps investing the price of the new game in the purchase of the annual subscription to Just Dance Unlimited (and there would also be some money). Why yes, as you can imagine beyond the 43 songs featured in Just Dance 2020 there are another 500 waiting for you, but only if you choose to subscribe to the service just mentioned. Just Dance Unlimited is offered with daily, monthly, quarterly and annual subscription packages (the latter costs around 25 euros), and is once again the definitive experience of the Ubisoft title. Too bad that spending around 60 euros for an unreleased video game offers just 43 songs and a free month of the pass: perhaps it would be appropriate to increase either the total number of unreleased songs or that of the free subscription months included in the package. Graphic and technical sector Little or nothing to report regarding the graphic and technical sector of Just Dance 2020, substantially unchanged compared to Just Dance 2019. However, we have noticed a greater care for the backdrops and in the details of the choreography: by carefully observing the backgrounds, thisthese latter appear sharper and more definitive, and generally satisfy the eye more. But it's really the only note of note that it is possible to provide. On the other hand, the feedback from the Joy-Con on Nintendo Switch is excellent, both in TV mode and in tabletop mode: Ubisoft has obtained a significant boost from the technology made in Nintendo. Finally, we note the presence of a new very marginal game mode, which is added to the single-player and online experience (which remains asynchronous): the cooperative mode. Basically two players in the same game will stop competing for the highest score, but will collaborate in filling a single bar of stars. Unity is strength, as they say: even in dance.", "date": "2019-11-06", "grade": "7.5"}
