{"name": "Wang  tornato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139590-shadow-warrior-wang-e-tornato-ancora-una-volta.html", "text": "Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter with a classic feel, one that brings to mind the era of Doom, Blood and Duke Nukem. It is no coincidence that the original Shadow Warrior, from which this remake draws its inspiration and main character, was created by 3D Realms which was queen of that era, also thanks to the duke, with irreverent, agitated and bloody titles. This new version starts from the same concept even if the bitmap models have obviously disappeared and this time Lo Wang, the egocentric protagonist, has to do without vehicles. But the 3D Realms spirit hasn't disappeared between irreverent jokes, tremendously self-centered characters, eighties atmospheres and bucketfuls of blood. There is no shortage of colossal bosses, huge and robust creatures to be faced with a precise strategy. All classic, in short, apart from the progression system which includes healing powers and upgrades unlocked by spending the Karma obtained by killing enemies or the Ki Crystals found by exploring the maps and capable of exponentially amplifying Wang's fighting potential. All topped off with a specialization system that allows you to unlock bonuses in relation to each individual weapon, allowing us to concentrate the money obtained from killed enemies only on the instruments of death that are most congenial to us. The combinations are numerous and it is also possible to maximize the defenses, physical and magical, to go around with a heavy firearm in each hand. But between lightning-fast dodges, lunges, spectacular melee moves and acrobatics, the intent to enhance the use of the katana is evident. And to ensure that the experience is unforgettable, enemies are slicing, hopping on their unsevered leg screaming, heads flying, crippled animals and uprooted monsters. The result is an intense and increasingly rich gameplay that is enhanced in a frenzy of slides, spells and lightning dodges. The next-gen consoles are tinged with red with the arrival of the bloodthirsty Shadow Warrior Xbox 360 goals The absence of multiplayer means that almost all of Shadow Warrior's objectives can be unlocked simply by completing the title on normal difficulty and using Lo Wang's entire arsenal to slaughter tons of enemies. But there is a tough challenge and involves completing the campaign on heroic difficulty. Eighty points that are difficult to conquer and without which it is impossible to obtain the 150 points that are obtained by completing all the objectives. Who wants some Wang! In terms of polish, storytelling and technological structure, Shadow Warrior cannot be compared to Wolfenstein: New Order, new champion of classic shooters. But the Flying Wild Hog title still has something interesting to tell us. The sword tip gameplay is really well done and is well suited to the pad which is more intuitive than the keyboard for performing dodges, lunges and special moves. Furthermore, the progression system is decidedly varied and there are even some noteworthy narrative cues. Lo Wang is one of the most talkative shooter anti-heroes in memory, equipped with a veritable arsenal of double entenders, bad taste jokes and self-aggrandizing catchphrases. Variety and irreverent attitude are less than in the original but the frequency with which the protagonist verbally underlines his exploits in English with Italian subtitles has increased. And although the plot is nothing short of pretext, the narrative system reserves us some memorable moments, in full Hong Kong fantasy thriller style, complete with a pain in the ass demon who makes us stronger but never fails to torture us with riddles and teasing. Furthermore, the bosses reach truly spectacular dimensions and are well differentiated also thanks to the peculiar design of the areas in which they are faced. In these cases, melee gameplay loses part of its charm both due to the difficulty of approaching such large creatures without suffering damage, and due to the lack of tangible effects of sword blows on the body of beings that cannot be sliced. But the variation of the gameplay breaks the rhythm avoiding the risk that everything becomes too monotonous. A danger, this, made not too remote by a graphic layout that risks tiring amidst Spartan models, square buildings and fake reeds. While full of secret areas to find and objects to destroy, the classic old-school shooter levels are, in essence, the greatest weakness of Shadow Warrior. Fortunately, there are several good quality effects to rejuvenate everything, the action is frenetic, the frame rate is stable and in some situations the developers wink at us by placing scaffolding from film sets.graphic and other meta references suggesting the intent to create a modern staging of an outdated classic. But this is not enough to save the map design from a not particularly flattering judgment, weighed down by the lack of any improvement compared to the PC version that came out more than a year ago. The appeal of Shadow Warrior, however, is not affected much by the technical shortcomings. The ubiquitous irony elicits more than a smile and gives the title a very special atmosphere that fits perfectly with a gameplay that is not perfectly finished but varied, gruesome and above all tough. In Shadow Warrior there is no automatic recovery of lost life energy, there are no miraculous saves that make you indestructible and the powers are activated by keystrokes that must be performed in the middle of the action. In essence, the challenge is tough even if you choose the normal difficulty and some bosses can be frustrating. This choice, which could be frustrating for those accustomed to modern shooters, is part of the concept of a title born in the spirit of the classic, in which the high degree of challenge is not a means of lengthening the broth and coping with the poverty of content . Longevity exceeds ten hours even at the minimum difficulty and this without counting the additional modes that do not include multiplayer but offer us an opportunity to replay the title with a different interpretation. The Ex mode makes things easier by allowing us to keep all the advancements unlocked during the first game. The Heroic, however, takes the challenge further by introducing permanent death. Finally, to close, we find the classic survival mode that allows us to test our skills or to give vent to all the possible violence without distractions. In short, content for all tastes, provided you appreciate the classic attitude and plenty of challenge.", "date": "2014-10-24", "grade": "7.8"}
