In recent times the situation has relaxed a bit, also given the dismantling of specialist videogame culture in favor of mass culture, but for a long time being the anti-Blizzard was a source of pride, almost as if proposing to do better than American developer automatically sold more copies. The time elapsed between the launch of Diablo II and Diablo III has greatly increased the desire of some to find valid alternatives and the market has not been found unprepared. The story of Titan Quest fits perfectly into this highly competitive atmosphere. Developed by Iron Lore, a software house founded by Brian Sullivan, ex-Ensemble Studios (Age of Empires, Age of Mythology), it was originally released in 2006 with little success, despite the release of an expansion, Immortal Throne, the year following. In reality, success slowly came, but too slowly to prevent the failure of Iron Lore in 2008. However, over time Titan Quest has become a benchmark of the genre and some former Iron Lore have founded a new company, Crate Entertainment , making Grim Dawn which, released in February this year after a period spent in Early Access, had great success and is considered by many to be superior to the discussed Diablo III. But back to Titan Quest. In a surprise move a few days ago THQ Nordic, which owns the rights to the brand, released the so-called Anniversary Edition. It is a new version of the game designed to celebrate its tenth anniversary, which was given as a gift to those who already owned the original on Steam and which was sold for a period with a 75% discount on the base price. We tried the Titan Quest Anniversary Edition, find out how it is by reading our review Remastered or not? What is the point of an operation of this type on such an old title? A lot, given that it still managed to sell a few thousand more copies and made the historic buyers happy. Of course, if he had wanted THQ Nordic he could have flaunted it as a remastered edition and sold it at full price even to those who owned the original, but he chose to take a different path, avoiding the accusation of wanting to exploit the fans. Yet there are many new ones. But let's go in order and describe it briefly for those who don't know it. Titan Quest Anniversary Edition is a third-person action RPG with a mythological setting. The player takes on the role of a hero or heroine with a mission to save the world from gorgons, minotaurs, harpies and other unfriendly creatures who have fallen into the employ of the titans. All this translates into the classic getting quests in the cities to then go on an adventure in the large maps that make up the game world. As genre goes, you fight most of the time by collecting the items left by corpses to strengthen yourself. Each enemy killed and each quest overcome earn experience points, which accumulated in the right amount level up and allow you to face the most difficult challenges with serenity. In short, the basic formula is the classic Diablo-like one, from which Titan Quest does nothing to deviate. The Anniversary Edition also includes the aforementioned Immortal Throne expansion, which adds several hours of gameplay. Let's say that to conclude it you will have to spend at least seventy hours on it, which become many more by replaying it at the highest difficulty level to discover all its aspects and find the best objects. As we will see, the Anniversary Edition also adds new features, making the title replayable even by those who have already finished it and thought they had definitively archived it. The news of the Anniversary Edition With the Titan Quest Anniversary Edition, THQ Nordic has done an excellent expansion and restoration operation. The gameplay has remained the same, but there are so many new features. Meanwhile, the game interface has been completely revised, both in terms of graphics and functions. If you wish, you can keep the original, but you can choose the size, scaling it according to the selected resolution. This is a function that is particularly useful precisely because of the addition of various advanced resolutions among those that can be selected. In this way it is possible to enlarge the interface together with the image, without ending up with elements that are too small. The new resolutions have also made it necessary to add new zoom levels, which allow you to have a more panoramic view of the action. This is particularly useful when playing co-op online, but it will also appeal to thesolitary players. Speaking of online, some features removed from the original have been restored, such as internal voice chat. The connectivity has also been improved, so as to have less lag problems and a new anti-cheater system has been implemented. And the game itself? Well, it has been overhauled as a whole, making official some fixes to items, skills, damage and community made sets to rebalance the gameplay. We've also increased the challenge for larger parties on higher difficulty levels, who can now aim for better rewards. An excellent job has also been done in terms of content, with the addition of heroes and bosses to meet. In fact, so much stuff was added altogether that THQ Nordic could have sold it all as DLC and nobody would have complained about it. On top of that, support for Steam Workshop and mod creation has also been added, which will ensure fresh content for months to come. In short, you couldn't really expect more from a reissue.", "date": "2016-09-09", "grade": null}
