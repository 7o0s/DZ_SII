{"name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shin-megami-tensei-lucifers-call.html", "text": "Infernal pokemon Shin Megami Tensei is probably one of the most atypical RPGs you will ever play, and thank you that for this new appointment Atlus has abandoned the classic first person view, leaving the task to a more banal, but also functional, third person camera to observe our explorations. The random clashes are inevitable, which here are resolved in fights that are actually quite monotonous, during which you will simply have to select the attacks of our fighters, aware that by choosing them in the right order you will get a sort of extra turn. However, it is the actual gameplay between one fight and another that makes Shin Megami Tensei decidedly more interesting than it seems: halfway between Pokmon and Jade Cocoon, we will be able to try to recruit our own enemies, bribing them with items or talk to them during the fight, and if we're lucky our little army will grow by one more element. Once we have obtained a new monster, we will be able to use it in combat, and as it acquires experience points with us, its skills and potential will also increase, even up to evolving into a new creature. And that's not all, because at a certain point it will also be possible to play with these infernal creatures, combining them to generate new beings that will inherit some characteristics and abilities of their ~parents~. The game system therefore turns out to be more intriguing and varied than expected, leaving the fighting a marginal entertainment role between an exploration and a genetic combination. At the same time, another element that makes the progression of our alter-ego in Shin Megami Tensei quite unique is the so-called Magatama: explaining it in words is not simple, but in summary we can say that through these objects it is possible to obtain the new abilities of the protagonist, whether active or passive; in addition, depending on the Magatama equipped at the moment of the fateful level-up, the new statistics and abilities of our alter-ego will change accordingly. In short, we must carefully plan the growth of our ~hero~, taking into consideration the skills we want to learn and the statistics we want to increase, perhaps using as many Magatama as possible to create a hybrid and extremely versatile character. A style not for everyone Technically Shin Megami Tensei presents a fluctuating combination of three-dimensional environments, deliberately crude and disturbing, and cel-shaded models. The carefully chosen and extremely spot on colors are probably what makes the visual aspect of Shin Megami Tensei truly special: disturbing, claustrophobic, gloomy and demonic. You may like it or not like the hallucinatory character design, it is perhaps a little too abstruse and bizarre for the tastes of us Westerners, but it is certainly a courageous novelty that breaks the clichs of the genre. Of course, the cel-shading is misleading: it may look like a cartoon, but it's not a children's show at all. Too bad in this regard for the rest: the woody and unnatural animations leave a bad taste in the mouth, and the special effects of the most spectacular attacks are a funny firecracker when compared to what we saw in Star Ocean 3, XenoSaga or Shadow Hearts 2. The camera , managed through the back keys of the Dual Shock, also tends to go a bit on its own, confusing the player especially in dungeons and more complex locations, that is, as they all tend to be from 50% of the game onwards: a round of applause Among other things, Atlus really deserves it for the structuring of these labyrinths, complex and full of puzzles and elements that confuse the player specifically to make the exploration less linear and more intriguing. The soundtrack is alienated almost as much as the plot and the character-design: the frequent and excellent rock songs are combined in a sometimes rough and sometimes refined way with j-pop music tracks that are a little less spot on, but which help to create that crazy atmosphere that it is the backbone of the product itself. Shocking Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call not only has a subtitle in bad taste, but also a series of factors which, overall, are a bold and risky move for us Western players. Beyond the anxiety that the cover of the game alone manages to arouse, Atlus hits the target by presenting extremely convincing playful-narrative atmospheres and situations, combining them with a game system that can seem not very varied and decidedly monotonous if bound only to the phases of combat, but which explodes in the beauty of the expansion of one's own group and its management: the recruitment of new creatures, their evolution and possible fusionwith others, they make the actual gameplay of Shin Megami Tensei really brilliant and very enjoyable. However, it remains a game recommended only for those who want to experience something relatively new, whose themes and some playful choices can leave you dumbfounded, but which are certainly worthy of attention and, often, even commendable. Pros: Intriguing and complex plot Technically more than good Gameplay varied and deep Cons: Some audiovisual problems The fights are decidedly monotonous The overall style may not appeal to everyone The Megami Tensei series was born on the NES more than ten years ago, inspired by a Japanese novel called Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, and since then its fame has grown from one console to another, from generation to generation. generation, always characterized by that bizarre video game that Atlus knew how to invent even before Disgaea. And yet, an episode of the saga has never seen the light of day in the West, except for the delightful ~spin-off~ series Persona, which arrived in America and was devastated by improbable adaptations that were not very faithful to the original script. With this Lucifer's Call finally Megami Tensei reaches not only the Yankee shelves, but also the European ones, and there's more: Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call is the European title of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniacs, deluxe edition of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne, therefore in this PAL version of the new Atlus title we find additional dungeons, new cutscenes, an extra difficulty level, five endings and, for some reason, also the presence of Dante, the protagonist of Devil May Cry by Capcom. Lots of irons in the fire for an adventure that, at least narratively, is perhaps too complex and hallucinatory: the protagonist is an anonymous (in every sense, since you will give him a name) Japanese boy, who while he is reaching a group of friends with the subway to visit a sick teacher in the hospital falls asleep and dreams of the end of the world. Eaten heavy? Perhaps, the fact remains that when our ~hero~ arrives at the hospital he finds himself in front of a deserted and disturbing place, in which he will learn that his dream was more real than the peperonata eaten for dinner the day before: the so-called ~Conception~ is about to occur. , a catastrophic event that will destroy the world and then resurrect it. In short, as this unfortunate chosen one, we find ourselves sleeping again after receiving the mysterious ~Magatama~ and upon our awakening the world as we know it no longer exists: in full ~Conception~, the new ~Vortex World~ it is a crossroads of ghosts, demons and supernatural creatures, and to make matters worse we ourselves have become demons capable of teaching others and making them fight for us. At this point the adventure really begins, and it will be our choices that decree the end or the beginning of the cosmos.", "date": "2005-07-28", "grade": null}
