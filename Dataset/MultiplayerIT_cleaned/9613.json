{"name": "RAGE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82633-rage-irabbia.html", "text": "In part a splendid commercial gimmick, in part a marvelous technological virtuosity, Rage arrives on iPhone and iPad after generating tons of hype and having stimulated the interest of a large part of the videogame population for the fundamental presence of a John Carmack, technical guru of id Software, which once again did not hold back from praising Apple's portable peripherals in an all too theatrical way. Before going into the details, however, it is necessary to point out that Rage is available on the App Store in two versions: a classic one compatible with all iDevices on the market and the other, the HD one subject of this review, able to offer textures at resolutions higher and installable only on iPhone 4, iPad and fourth generation iPod Touch. The contents are absolutely identical and the price difference is evident given that the high-definition version costs twice as much: 1.59 compared to 0.79 for the classic edition. But what exactly is Rage? The simplest answer is to define it as a first-person shooter on rails: the character moves automatically within a scenario following a predefined path and the player remains free to aim (even moving the view slightly when touching the edges of the screen) and of course to fire at enemies and other interactive elements. By touching the appropriate icons on the screen it is also possible to perform a small sprint while the protagonist is walking or to dodge the blows of the enemies (both thrown objects and close-range blows), reload the shouldered weapon and finally change it. It sometimes suffers from the lack of a melee attack which in fact will force you to continuously press dodge when surrounded by mutants while trying to hit them with projectiles with a rather depressing result in terms of ease of use. Rage can also be controlled in two different ways but there are pros and cons for both. It is possible to use the accelerometer to manage the movement of the viewfinder or devolve everything to the touchscreen. In the first case, you will immediately find yourself limited in accuracy and response speed also due to the enormous frenzy of the game action, while managing all the interaction via touch you will have to deal with the usual problem of partial coverage of the screen at finger work that is especially noticeable in the most agitated moments when the enemies are at the corners of the monitor and even afflicts the iPad despite the much larger visual area. But is there any good? Don't misunderstand the above lines which would seem to describe a game notable only for its deficiencies. Rage also and above all has a lot of good, especially from a conceptual point of view. If the shooter-on-rails mechanics could make the fanatics of id Software-style gameplay turn up their noses where freedom is the master or open the side to the criticism of repetitiveness, just spasmodically repeating the levels of the game is one of the key points of the experience. Rage for iDevice is in fact focused on the fictitious TV series Mutant Bash, a sort of leveled arena that will also be an integral part of the nextgen version of the game. The goal is to earn as much money as possible by killing all the mutants that appear on the screen, hitting some targets scattered throughout the arenas and collecting the objects (ammunition, energy and bags of money). Each time you hit an enemy, an on-screen gauge fills up representing the bonus multiplier applied on each subsequent hit. In this way it is possible to boost one's score by a x2, x3 or at most a x4, a bit along the lines of what we see in the various musical rhythm games. Taking headshots fills the meter faster (and offers more points), maiming an enemy by hitting him once he's dead too, putting new ammo into the weapon can be a source of money if you take full advantage of the active reload Gears of War style and etc. On the contrary, missing a mutant empties the indicator to a small extent and, in the unfortunate event that you are hit, the bonus is completely reset. The consequence of this precise design choice is a mechanic that dramatically stimulates replayability in an attempt to reach an ever higher score by literally memorizing the spawn points of enemies, the positioning of targets and ammunition and managing ammunition and timing properly of reloading weapons in the last attempt to achieve perfection in the scenario: to land every single shot while avoiding being hit. Everything works very well in the first minutes of the game but unfortunately two elements promptly castrate the excellent attempt of id Ssoftware. A few shortcomings and a lot of wonder First of all, there is a concrete lack of variety linked to a poverty of contents: we find only three levels (which simulate three different episodes of the first season of Mutant Bash) which, although differing in settings, are a little too similar in terms of design choices related to mandatory routes. In short, we are unable to appreciate great differences in the scenery that surrounds us as we walk in an abandoned asylum, we make our way through a ruined building or wander through the narrow tunnels of a bunker. In addition, there are only three weapons available: a pistol with infinite ammo, a machine gun and a shotgun, all available immediately. If on the one hand it is true that in half an hour you will have seen everything that Rage can offer, on the other hand the style of gameplay that strongly pushes the repetition of the levels falls within the scope of mitigating this content poverty. But here comes the second problem: the game does not offer any type of online component, not even a simple ranking and at the moment it does not support Apple's Game Center (although id Software has reassured that it will implement this feature as soon as possible). This deficiency unfortunately dampens the feeling of challenge that could benefit so much from direct comparison with the results of friends and other players around the globe. Obviously, it is also necessary to spend a few words on the technical aspect of Rage. The game is wonderful: the high definition textures are incredibly detailed both as regards the setting and for the models which, although reduced in number (there are quite few types of mutants) are animated very well and have an excellent polygonal composition. Everything then runs with a disarming fluidity regardless of the presence on the screen of excellent special effects and good anti-aliasing and all this contributes to restoring a great sensation of graphic cleanliness. The tested version is 1.0. Warning, in this version the game doesn't start if you don't set the English language. Price: 0.79/1.59 App Store links", "date": "2010-11-25", "grade": "8.9"}
