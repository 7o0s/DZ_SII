It goes without saying that we will have to face a new adventure with the aim of saving them, exploring eight different ~worlds~, for a total of over one hundred stages, full of enemies who will try to eliminate us. In the role of the young protagonist, we will be able to defend ourselves from their attacks by brandishing a sword and various firearms, with a view to an arsenal that can be upgraded based on the experience accumulated but also by spending the tokens that are collected around in special shops. thus adding extra functionality to pistols, rifles, machine guns, lasers, rocket launchers and so on. Developed by an independent team of just two people, Cally's Caves 3 is the latest installment in an action-platformer series that made a name for itself on the App Store for its traditional mechanics, which hark back to classics such as Bionic Commando, Mega Man and Turrican, as well as for the excellent pixel art graphics. Aspects that in the third chapter appear substantially improved, testifying to the achievement of a certain degree of maturity of the production: the visual sector is colourful, defined and flawless, the musical accompaniment is engaging (although focusing a little too much on tight rhythms, strictly 16-bit style) and a great job was done in terms of balancing the difficulty. The game is also completely free in its basic structure, with small and harmless banner ads only on the pause screen. By making in-app purchases (2.99 euros for a single element or 4.99 euros for the bundle of the first two), however, it is possible to unlock two new modes: the New Game Plus and a fun Survival. Setting the freemium component in this way seemed to us to be extremely honest on the part of the developers, who in practice allow anyone to play and complete their title, and then possibly invest a small amount to get something more from the experience. Cally's Caves is a solid, challenging and fun title, which refers to the great classics of the genre Jump, shoot, slice In short, the philosophy behind Cally's Caves 3 does not obey the logic of the market, nor the evident impoverishment of the gameplay that is easy to find in many mobile titles. The game control system uses a generously sized touch scheme with few frills, reactive and precise: two arrows on the left side of the screen to proceed in one direction rather than the other, accompanied by three buttons arranged in an inverted ~L~ in the right side to jump, shoot and strike with the sword. By touching the display at the top it is also possible to change the equipped firearm or enter the pause screen, from which you can access the checkpoint control map or the inventory, for example to consume food that can restore our life energy. We have previously mentioned the balance, which appears very well studied: there are checkpoints (which can be recalled at any time) only within certain stages for each area, therefore it is not always possible to start over from where we left off before game over, according to the terms of an approach that tries not to trivialize the experience while remaining within the confines of frustration. In short, do not expect a title that is completed within an hour, also because the more than twenty types of enemies arranged within the scenarios will be able to give us a hard time, often forcing us to shoot from a distance in order not to be hit and to plan the our maneuvers. In the same way, the bosses, hard at the right point, will require precision and timing to be able to take advantage of the double jump to avoid blows and sink ours at the first opportunity. In short, we are faced with an ~old school~ action platform not only in the graphic style but also and above all in the contents, decidedly solid and competent, and moreover free.", "date": "2015-08-01", "grade": "8.5"}
