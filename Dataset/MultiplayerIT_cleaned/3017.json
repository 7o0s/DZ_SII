Were you waiting for nothing but to put the Sony headset on your head to transform yourself into your favorite superhero? Before diving headlong into the adventure, why not read our review of Marvel's Iron Man VR? We are well aware that in these cases one more opinion cannot make the difference, after all the ingredients of this new game are already on the public square, good and captivating enough to attract the attention of every Marvel fan, but there is something to say it's still. Starting from the origins of the concept, it is impossible not to mention what is the clear source of inspiration for this Marvel's Iron Man VR: we are naturally talking about Megaton Rainfall, a game with a winning idea and a wonderfully powerful title, but created by a single developer and in a rather bland. Nonetheless, Megaton Rainfall was the first virtual reality game to achieve what everyone has always dreamed of: flying. You raised your arms to the sky and took flight, far beyond the stratosphere, until you reached space, to then return to Earth and with your fists point to a new destination, a new city, a new battle. The nice thing about that game is that the fights often took place in the surroundings of inhabited centers which in the heat of the battle could even be completely destroyed, which invalidated the final evaluation. Here, precisely this last feature, or one of a similar nature, would have done absolutely no harm to the gameplay of Iron Man VR which is still a quality game, a rich product by the standards of virtual reality, but far too flat in the offer . The pleasure of flying As already anticipated in the preview phase, the flight model chosen to replicate the versatility of the superhero created by Stan Lee and Larry Lieber in 1963 is absolutely brilliant. Just like in the comics/films, the reactors under the boots of Tony Stark's mechanical suit will keep us constantly in flight, while those positioned on the palms of our hands will allow us to control the direction. Thanks to the PlayStation Move, we will have total freedom of movement of the upper limbs, and this will allow us, for example, to shoot with one hand while with the other we will be able to continue moving at three hundred and sixty degrees; of course we will be able to use both hands both to move faster in one direction, and to concentrate more firepower towards a target, or hit two different ones at the same time. And it's fantastic, we assure you, to slowly get the hang of it, as it is to attempt increasingly risky and complex maneuvers, as we move from one objective to another trying to avoid what often becomes a veritable avalanche of enemy shots. The better and faster we are at cleaning up biomechanical threats, the more the game will reward us, also giving us the opportunity to improve weapons and armor once we return to Tony Stark's amazing Malibu villa. Exploring the wealthy inventor's home isn't mandatory, but much like in the seminal Batman Arkham VR, it's where fans will find the most surprises. Marvel Cinematic Universe or almost Note that while Marvel's Iron Man VR isn't based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it clearly follows its stylistic cues. The armor of the hero, his way of speaking, the different characters that will appear on the screen (Friday, Nick Fury...) all seem reproductions bordering on copyright of the characters we are used to seeing on the big screen, a bit like takes place with Square Enix's Marvel's Avengers. We are not condemning the choice, on the contrary: it is right to go beyond those actors and it is equally right to take advantage of the great success achieved in the cinema. After all, this Marvel's Iron Man VR seems to aim precisely at the youngest, who are the ones who will have less problems wiggling for hours with a viewer on their head. The Camouflaj Studios game in fact requires quite a bit of movement, and it is strongly recommended to face it standing up rather than sitting down, a posture that is still possible but which will often interfere with the movements necessary to fly and fight well. The way the action is structured, it is also recommended to often shoot on the spot, in order to face the enemies who will hide behind us, but as always happens with PSVR, these movements will often affect the accuracy of the viewer and controllers. A console to the limit We are used to this by now, but it is undeniable that the limits of the tracking system are becoming increasingly stringent, and above all less and less bearable given that technology has made great strides in the meantime. And the same can be said of the PlayStation 4 hardware, instill able to surprise with normal games, just look at The Last of Us Part II and Ghost of Tsushima, but now in water at the throat when it comes to virtual reality. Despite the enormous creative efforts of the development team, to which a well-deserved applause goes in any case, these limits cannot fail to have also affected the design of this game. What Marvel's Iron Man VR offers at the beginning, in its first levels, is already the maximum it can aspire to, which is why the eight hours needed to get to the end credits might seem even too much to some. It is no coincidence that when Camouflaje Studios try to do more, by setting certain battles in the center of Shanghai for example, the graphic quality collapses together with the frame rate, which should never happen in a virtual context.", "date": "2020-07-03", "grade": "7.7"}
