{"name": "Frank Herbert's Dune", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frank-herberts-dune.html", "text": "Emotions? This ~Frank Herbert's Dune~ is presented as an action game in which exploratory elements are mixed. The missions of which it consists are divided into two types. In the first you have to ask your friends for information, look for precious objects, plan strategies to attack the enemy, etc., while in the second it will be a kind of stealth game that will dominate. In this last phase, in fact, some small similarities with Kojima's masterpiece, or Metal Gear Solid, immediately catch the eye. But don't get too excited! Too bad there are differences and they can be seen from a distance. Anyone would notice the flaws affecting the Wide Games product. These are to be found above all in the scarcity of actions that can be performed by Paul and secondly in the simplicity of the puzzles, reduced to the usual ~pull the lever and open the door~. Precisely in these elements lies the mediocrity of the title, combined with a not too high care in programming. In short, a pity. The technicalities of the case The cosmetic aspect of the product alternates sets of highs and lows. It is sad to note that in many circumstances there is a certain poverty of the settings in spite of a fairly good quality of the textures. Another negative finding is the update of the graphics engine which often struggles to achieve a good level of fluidity. In fact, after a few moments, you go from a frame rate of 30 fps to one of 15. And because of this defect we really don't believe that it is to be found in the hardware... (programming anyone?). Some nice graphic effects such as lens flare and good lighting and the play of light and shadow. With a little more care, a lot more could have been achieved. A missed opportunity at Wide games. A game for true aficionados The gameplay, as already mentioned, suffers from an exaggerated simplicity. Note that to hide behind a wall (Snake-style), just get close to it. This is very annoying when it happens unintentionally as you move near it. For maniacs of the genre it is important to underline that in this game it is essential not to be discovered by the guards of the Arkonnen buildings. We therefore recommend a good use of the supplied dagger (the Cryss) and a lot of silence when walking Not shooting at random with the weapons available is a good method. These are the most interesting ideas of the product distributed by Cryo Interactive. Unfortunately some small defects undermine not only the playability, but also the structure. Sometimes it happens that you are unable to kill an enemy at more than close range. And I assure you that the aim is not to blame... If there had been a few more small tricks, even in terms of variety, this would certainly have been a more attractive title. It should be emphasized that the dubbing is entirely in Italian (the language can be selected when loading the disc). This stands at discrete levels, a pity that the lip of the polygonal faces goes on its own. The sound accompaniment of the game deserves a positive mention, which contributes to giving the atmosphere that is breathed in the film in an excellent way. The longevity is discreet and average for titles of the genre (albeit with many dialogues). In conclusion, a wasted opportunity for the French company that should have added a little more and eliminated a few too many defects. Not a bad game, mind you, but nice and unpretentious, recommended to fans of Herbert's story and the beautiful cinematic porting. The others wait for March 8th and win the first copies of a certain Konami masterpieceMGS2?. Of course! Pros: Compelling storyline. It's the video game port of Dune! Cons: Arcade to the bone. Game structure too simple. Lots of dialogue and little gameplay. A faithful tie-in It is the year 10191 on the planet Arrakis, better known as Dune. The house of Arkonnen, malignant and power-hungry, assassinates the progenitor of the Atreydes and defeats his army. The spice, primary source of survival, falls into the hands of the bad guys. Luckily Paul and Lady Jessica, respectively son and wife of the late emperor, escape the threat and bring their little bottom to safety. It is here that the adventure begins, the sole purpose of which is to restore Arrakis to its rightful heir. To do this will require a close alliance with the Fremen tribe and a lot of courage. The protagonist of the game is Paul Atreydes, who will take over the reins of Dune and restore peace to it. Essentially from the big screen to video games", "date": "2002-01-17", "grade": null}
