{"name": "A Monster's Expedition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-monsters-expedition-la-recensione.html", "text": "The puzzle game is perhaps one of the most covered genres on Apple Arcade, but it is not easy to find, as we see in this review of A Monster's Expedition, a perfect combination of style, light intelligent humor, atmosphere and excellent puzzle mechanics. We had already seen something very similar in A good snowman is hard to build, and it is no coincidence, given that it comes from the same development team, but in this game a good puzzle mechanism is also associated with a particularly enjoyable, which while remaining marginal to the gameplay stimulates exploration and pushes us to move forward from island to island. Here too the protagonist is a clumsy monster with a rather dreamy and intellectual air, who instead of building snowmen devotes himself to observing archaeological finds linked to ancient human civilization, now finished and lost for many centuries. There is no real narration, but traveling from one island to another, the monster can find inscriptions and objects on display as in an open-air museum, which illustrate the typical characteristics of the curious human civilization. This bizarre point of view paves the way for numerous brilliant jokes about the everyday life, habits and popular culture of humanity, with a particular inclination towards sarcasm for British society. The reconstruction that the new civilization of monsters has made of the ancient human vestiges, or rather of the land they call ~Englandland~, is in fact often distorted in a comical way, perfectly making fun of many aspects of our reality and thus resulting in an apt parody and very bright. All of this is just an outline to the puzzle that is the basis of the gameplay, but it works well as an engine for the exploration of the environments, also because the game is based on a large non-linear map that can be explored in various directions and discover all the islands thus becomes a game within the game. To strengthen the immersion in this strange world there is also the same relaxed and melancholic style that we had already appreciated in the previous Draknek game, which here is also enhanced by a general improvement in the graphics with the addition of details and effects. A game of trunks, stones and museum exhibits The mechanism behind A Monster's Expedition is very simple: it involves moving logs by rolling them in various directions, in order to create bridges for passing from one island to another. However, a simple concept is followed by a rather complicated execution, as befits the best exponents of the genre: the cut trunk can be moved in two different ways, or by making it roll if pushed to the side or by raising it vertically and lowering it again if moved longitudinally. While this last movement allows the trunk to be moved one unit of space at a time, by making it roll it instead continues the movement for all the available space until it reaches the water if it does not encounter obstacles, and if the position is not exactly the one required to act as a bridge we can only press the key to restart from the beginning of the island and try again. It is therefore a question of studying the directions in which to push the trunk by exploiting the elements of the scenario such as protrusions and rocks to block its rolling in a strategic way, so as to get the piece of wood precisely where we need it, following more or less twisted paths . The game is all here and even continuing the basic mechanism remains unchanged, with the only additional complication of having to deal with more complex scenarios, which increase the level of challenge, but as in traditional puzzles there are no substantial changes to the gameplay. On the one hand this makes the experience compact and coherent but on the other it inevitably brings out a bit of monotony, which however is balanced by the sympathy of the texts found when exploring the islands and by the non-linear progression which occasionally allows choose the path to go by solving the puzzles even in a different way to open new paths. An element that particularly stands out is the ability of A Monster's Expedition to immediately insert the player into its mechanics without explaining anything: there is no tutorial but the solution of the puzzles emerges in a logical way simply with practice, as well as the refinement of technique comes from a careful study of puzzle design that becomes complicated in a gradual and perfectly sustainable way, making the progression really pleasant.", "date": "2020-09-18", "grade": "8.0"}
