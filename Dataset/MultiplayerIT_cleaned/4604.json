An action adventure like we haven't seen for some time, featuring many elements common to many other games but graced by a truly sublime artistic system. The proponent of all that magnificence is the good Joe Madureira, a well-known Marvel and Blizzard artist with a great passion for video games. After the premature end of THQ and the substantial disappearance of the brand, Joe did his utmost to open Airship Syndicate together with his brother and some old collaborators: an independent studio without excessive aims but nevertheless determined to continue producing titles with a particularly refined visual appeal. Rather than looking for a publisher and risking seeing years of work vanish again, our people decided to go through Kickstarter, giving life to a project with very simple mechanics but which in a short time, either for fame or for the credibility of people who worked there, managed to get the necessary funds to be financed. The media tam tam quickly attracted new investors including THQ Nordic, which offered to publish the title on the major platforms, however leaving total control to the US studio. From a project initially designed for PC, Battle Chasers had become an all-round multi-platform, including Nintendo Switch. We have played the PlayStation 4 version for a long time and the time has finally come to give a definitive assessment of the title, improved just in the last week by a repair patch that fixed the imbalances and crashes. Gully, Calibretto: I missed you Battle Chasers: Nightwar is not a totally new brand to be honest, since it has its roots even in the 90s when Mad conceived and produced a series of comics where the adventures of a fatherless girl and the magic gloves given to him were narrated in inheritance, in an included epic that left several question marks open. The comic was not a resounding success, to tell the truth, and taking up the story again after almost twenty years must not have been an easy choice to make. Would old fans still be interested in the adventures of Gully and Calibretto? And would new players have shown interest in an unfamiliar series? Fortunately, the responses were both positive. Battle Chasers: Nightwar does something smart right away: it moves away from the comic storyline to narrate a new parallel adventure, however placing itself on a later timeline than what was read on paper. The members of our group already know each other, they have already made friends and it will be up to the player to find out about the background of each individual protagonist. After all these years, a story based on the past of the heroes would have made more sense as a starting point, just to put old and new fans on the same level and then expand the discussion from there. In fact, it is a bit difficult to immediately identify with the narrative, with so many holes left by a plot that takes a large number of elements for granted. It is not known why our brave travel together or why they are bound by such a deep friendship, especially during the early stages of the game. A little disoriented, you then take for granted everything that happens on the screen without fully understanding it, and if you are new to the series you will advance for the first ten hours clinging to the small insights given by the glossary and the notes scattered throughout the game world, making but it's hard to fall in love with the protagonists. The situation is destined to improve after a good ten hours of play when this new adventure also begins to get going. The keystone is the arrival of Alumon, an unpublished character designed specifically for the video game which brings with it a turning point in the entire plot and represents the essential step to allow the title to mesh properly. The whole second half of the adventure runs smoothly and begins to become interesting, also putting interesting antagonists on the plate and letting us glimpse increasingly difficult and stimulating clashes on the horizon. Playstation 4 trophies It will take you dozens of hours to platinum Battle Chasers: Nightwar. In fact, it won't be enough to finish the title just once but you will also have to complete the adventure in New Game Plus. In addition to this, there is the search for all the collectible pages scattered around the world, fishing and crafting: an extreme farming that only more assiduous players will be able to complete. By playing the campaign you will collect about 30% of the trophies, for the rest you will be required to commit and dedicate yourself! A matter of clashes Airship Syndicate is a relatively small studioOnly his first draft and the structure of Battle Chasers makes it even more obvious. Hidden under an incredible artistic side, capable of leaving you dazzled by the beauty and complexity of the animations, is actually a very classic turn-based RPG, which takes us back to the glories of the first Final Fantasy. Of the six characters available, only three will be the ones that we will be able to take into battle each time, guided by an Active Time Battle inherited directly from the Square titles. In fact, each skill has a cost in mana and a casting time, from very fast to slow, which affects the attack order of all the characters involved in the fight. The strategy is basically based only on this element and if you are a big fan of role-playing games you will soon notice how a whole series of elements usually used to increase the depth of the combat system are missing. Battle Chasers: Nightwar also adopts an overload system, which can be accumulated with each standard attack, which will provide you with an additional energy reserve to be used to launch skills without affecting the mana bar. If on the one hand this thing favors the use of spells, on the other it pushes the player to abuse ordinary attacks, making him play substantially in a repetitive way. In our opinion, there are few interesting interactions between the abilities of party members and there is a lack of attacks to combine or summons. It's risk-free gameplay that works brilliantly in all respects but sadly doesn't really bring anything new to the genre. Yet you find yourself wanting to continue playing, to continue in the story and to explore every possible dungeon, perhaps even replaying it at the highest difficulties to find ever more performing equipment. The difficulty curve, as well as the growth of the characters was recently fixed through the first big patch, with improvements that make the progression now much smoother and more balanced. The serious crashes that risked corrupting your saves have also disappeared completely and the damage of the final weapons has been adjusted, now no longer so devastating. The last-minute additions arrive as a corollary of a solid game system, made to maintain the agreements with the Kickstarter backers: crafting and fishing are clearly elements added later and clash with the rest of the production. They are not particularly incisive and could easily be eliminated from Battle Chasers without finding yourself with an incomplete or deficient product. The interface, on the other hand, is good and simple, with menus that are easily navigable even from the console, with the only regret being that the party management is not exactly functional. In fact, to equip the various heroes it will be necessary to keep changing the active members with those in reserve, which can only be done before a dungeon or inside the tavern, an incomprehensible choice and which will most likely lead you to choose three characters and play only and exclusively with those for the rest of the adventure, partly out of pure laziness and partly so as not to be forced to level the substitutes from the field. To be left open-mouthed What Battle Chasers does very well is all the visuals, really impressive. The guys at Supergiant Games have always been given credit for being able to create atmospheres of incredible quality but Airship Syndicate is certainly no less. We may not have worlds as deep and visionary as those seen in Pyre or Bastion but we have a gold medal trait and character design. Everything from the chosen color palettes to the weapons and armor that change appearance when replaced help to leave a wonderful and lasting impression on the player. The variety of enemies is very good and the dialogues and dubbing are also of very high quality, with particularly accurate interactions between the various protagonists during the various dead moments in the tavern. The dungeons are also truly excellent, which can last up to two hours each, full of traps and environmental puzzles, simple to overcome but sufficient to make the player's brain work even in the most banal exploration phases. Too bad then for a soundtrack that fails to leave its mark, the only drawback of a skyrocketing artistic value.", "date": "2017-10-18", "grade": "8.0"}
