{"name": "Escape Goat 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/130645-escape-goat-2-non-si-smette-mai-di-belare.html", "text": "If the media attention of the press and fans is focused on Goat Simulator, the absurd title that promises the public to impersonate their own personal gaming goat, the sequel to Escape Goat has also carved out its own space in this spring period. Double Fine had promised, in the release of its multifaceted founder Tim Schafer, that it would take care of helping some independent developers to get out of the nest and take off for success. In this case it happened to MagicalTimeBean, an indie developer who had brought to light his puzzle game back in 2012, and is now trying again with a respectable following. Goats, on the other hand, are particularly stubborn animals, the kind that use their heads to get out of trouble. Never was an animal more worthy of representing a very nice action platform in which the goal is to solve, room after room, the various puzzles that appear in front of our nice friend. The graphics, this time in HD, go perfectly with all configurations and can be installed on any operating system that natively hosts Steam: Linux, Mac and PC. The dynamic light effects manage to immerse the player in the different atmospheres that recall different environments such as forests, mountain caves, steampunk constructions, ancient tombs guarded by dangerous guardians and so on. The pastel colors that paint everything that moves on the screen, rigorously colored by hand, seem to come from the mind of a child, but each element has been placed with cruel lucidity by the developer, to make us rack our brains at every step. After Goat Simulator, Escape Goat 2 also proves that 2014 really is the year of the goats A bleat will bury us The game world is made up of a map made up of tiles, each of which represents one of the rooms that we have to unlock along the way. In each scheme we will have to try our hand at finding a key to unlock the door that will allow us to move on to the next stage. In addition to being able to take advantage of the double jump upwards, the dash forward and a nice goring to interact with objects in the scenario (destroy crates, move rocks and so on), we will be able to count on the company and the inspiration of a nice little mouse, recallable on command with a key, which will search for buttons in the surrounding environment or will diligently position itself on top of the mechanisms, letting us quickly slide to the next step. Along all the more than one hundred puzzles you will know friends and enemies (some really tough) while escaping or overcoming some traps will require not only the gray matter, but often also an adequate quickness of reflexes to face the immediate danger. Whether it's for miscalculating a jump, or for realizing that lightning can fry you and fire burn you, death will come more often than you imagine. In some cases, for example if you have positioned some game platforms incorrectly or moved some elements that cannot return to their original position, you could be the one to invoke it directly from the game menu, reloading the current layout. Each time you will have a renewed spirit and more confident in retracing your steps. The overall duration of the entire experience can vary from one to a maximum of three hours, considering that there are secondary areas and crossroads that may require your attention more than others.", "date": "2014-04-14", "grade": "8.0"}
