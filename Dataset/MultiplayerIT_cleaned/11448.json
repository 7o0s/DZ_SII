{"name": "Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Dash!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-dash.html", "text": "Created by SEGA in 1993 as a response to Mario as Nintendo's most iconic character, Sonic debuted on the MegaDrive with a fast-paced, fast-paced platformer that set new standards for the genre. Characterized by bright and colorful graphics, but above all by long sessions of supersonic racing, the game contributed significantly to the sales of SEGA consoles and produced an incredible number of sequels and spin-offs. As per tradition, in addition to the protagonist, numerous side characters have been introduced, all with peculiar characteristics, as well as an ever-present nemesis, in the person of the mad scientist Dr. Robotnik (or ~Eggman~, if you prefer). With the transition to polygonal graphics, and even more to a truly three-dimensional sphere, the series has tried to maintain its strengths, with not always exciting results, but has had the merit of renewing itself so much as to still be present on current systems from game... mobiles included. Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Dash! comes after the conversion (made in two parts) of the first episode of the series, by the same team of developers. The work done so far has been excellent, after all it was enough to make a series of intelligent choices for the quality of the original game to be felt. Just as Sonic 2 on MegaDrive resumed Sonic's structure and gameplay, in the same way the new title published by Glu proposes what has already been seen in the two previous transpositions. Is it bad? It's hard to say, after all there are video games that have gone on for years essentially proposing the same things and gathering acclaim with each update. In this specific case, we have a single game mode available, which later allows us to resume the game starting from the last stage reached, rather than introducing a saving system historically inappropriate for the series. We will be able to use only Sonic initially, later also Tails, to explore a series of locations full of rings and power-ups to collect, but also of enemies and traps of various types. Our character can run very fast, jump and charge a spin attack. They are all skills that we will have to manage in the best possible way, both from the point of view of the fights (even with the bosses) and to discover all the secret areas of the stages. As far as the control system is concerned, the setting adopted so far has been maintained, which however does not fail to raise some doubts: the joystick is responsible for Sonic's movement, but also for jumping, while button 5 is only used to load the spinning attack. An at least questionable choice, given that assigning the jump to the 5 key could have made things much easier for those who own cell phones equipped with a poor control system in terms of practicality and sensitivity. In terms of technical implementation, this conversion performs well, even if it would have been possible to do more. The sprites are the original ones, with animations taken practically in full and therefore without particular cuts. The same goes for the settings, characterized by an excellent use of colors and the typical design of the series, with fast sections that contrast with slower and more reasoned areas. What makes the nose turn up a bit is the poor fluidity of scrolling: we don't know if it was a technical necessity, given the speed that is reached in some phases, but the final result does not hold a candle to other titles produced by Glu (much slower, though). The audio sector makes a fine show of original music, very catchy and nice, also equipped with an independently adjustable volume. PRO It's Sonic Playable and fun Graphics and sound faithful to the original AGAINST Slow scrolling The control system could have been better Very similar to the episodes already available", "date": "2008-04-30", "grade": "S.V."}
