First of all for the great atmosphere in which it is able to immerse us, encouraging the player to explore forests, lands and camps often inhabited by hostile and mysterious creatures. To tell their story, the developers of Blackpowder Games were inspired by the events of the Roanoke colony, which in the early 1600s saw its entire population, about ninety people, vanish into thin air without a trace. A situation very similar to the one encountered by the protagonist of the game, apparently the only survivor of a shipwreck, who is attracted by a sort of ghost dressed in red in the heart of a setting that at first seems rather dense but then opens, revealing huge expanses, hills and rudimentary gatherings. The experience, completely in first person, is strongly characterized by a precise stylistic choice: resetting the saturation of the colors to obtain black and white graphics, in which the elements highlighted in red stand out all the more, such as objects collect or interact with, as well as the many enemies we will have to face armed with a bow, musket, pistol and tomahawk. Betrayer is a very interesting adventure, full of hardcore elements but also obvious limitations Prepare to Die Several people have compared the gameplay of Betrayer to that of Dark Souls, for a simple enough reason: the title of Blackpowder Games can be damned difficult. Our character can get a bow and arrows by checking the corpses of killed enemies and in the same way get hold of various types of muskets and pistols, but each weapon has flaws that should not be underestimated (for example long reload times) and therefore the fights they are often resolved with an immediate victory or with the game over and the restart from the last checkpoint, which can also be quite distant from the area in which we died. Recovering the coins we had at the time of defeat is possible, but you have to go back to the exact point where we were, and this is not always a trivial operation, on the contrary. Betrayer's approach in this sense is damn hardcore, given that it provides us with a map and indicates our position on it, but otherwise it limits itself to providing very few indications on the compass, forcing us to remember the hot spots of a map that often extends for hundreds and hundreds of meters, and that we are encouraged to explore far and wide; not only to eliminate the enemies present, but also and above all to interact with the environment and get hold of documents and objects that can help us solve the mystery of the missing colony. Let's say that the first impact with this type of interpretation is quite hard and it is difficult to be fascinated both by the combat system and by the countless dead times between one find and another, but already from the second map one begins to assimilate certain mechanisms well and to therefore take advantage of the save and fast travel points, the water sources (for recharging vital energy) and the merchant on duty for the purchase of weapons (the best ones are rather expensive) and ammunition. Nonetheless, we would have expected more variety and attention aimed at avoiding so many unnecessary walks. Noir, but not necessarily The transition from Early Access to the final version has brought with it a series of changes, both on a structural and narrative level and on a purely technical one. As regards the first two elements, we note a more accurate direction, where previously some quests were introduced a bit at random, and an attempt has been made to provide consistency to the mechanics of finding objects and interacting with spirits. This last operation is performed after ringing a sort of ~magic bell~ which projects us into the dimension of the dead, also full of threats but generally of lesser magnitude than the ~conquistadores~ who scour the plains during the normal exploration phases (Skeletons fall apart after a single gunshot, unlike armored soldiers...). From a technical point of view, the options available for graphic adjustments have instead been multiplied, with the selection of individual items and depth of field, but above all a menu has appeared (also accessible in-game, rather quickly) which allows you to switch from ~official~ black and white to something decidedly livelier, increasing the saturation and managing the brightness as we see fit. Playing with ~color~ Betrayer on one side makes maggihours justice to the graphics, in particular to the excellent realization of the grass that moves according to the wind, even if the definition of the textures is never amazing; on the other it inevitably ends up distorting the original intention of the developers, who had opted for a ~modified~ grayscale (see the presence of red) to obtain a certain type of atmosphere and push on the horror element conferred to the title by the presence of spirits and dark creatures. However, it's always a good thing that users are given the ability to choose how they prefer to enjoy the experience. The absolute lack of spoken dialogue probably also falls within the category of stylistic choices, but in this case it didn't seem like a great idea in terms of involvement and from the perspective of a relatively essential audio sector. The controls can be customized in various ways, both using the mouse and keyboard and the Xbox 360 controller, but in the latter case, unfortunately, a predefined layout is missing and we will have to do various tests to obtain an effective solution.", "date": "2014-03-28", "grade": "7.0"}
