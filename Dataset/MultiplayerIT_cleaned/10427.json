The aim of the game is to help ours to pass all the levels while avoiding traps and monsters. How to do since we can not control it directly? At the player's disposal there are a series of gadgets that must be placed on the screen and which produce very different effects. For example, the sling launches our forward, the stairs and beams allow it to overcome the ditches while the bombs destroy pieces of the scenario, including enemies. Around the levels there are fireflies that must be collected. Once a certain amount is reached, bonus levels are unlocked, generally more complex than the normal ones. Not all fireflies are immediately reachable and in most levels they are positioned in such a way that you need to pass them multiple times in order to collect them all. After all, Sofi doesn't help, since she is only able to walk forward and doesn't care about anything, except for the mailbox which is at the end of each scheme and which contains a postcard. Shiny but jammed The game expresses itself at its best, while showing all the problems it carries with it, in the advanced levels, given that the first ones are quite simple and can be overcome without too many worries. Unfortunately, the control system is too buggy and ruins the gaming experience. The problem is that the gadgets don't move smoothly but each movement corresponds to a click on an ideal grid. The design of some levels is not very inspired Probably designed not to make life too difficult for those who play Lucidity with a joypad, those who use the mouse will find more than a few difficulties in positioning the gadgets, given that paradoxically a little precision will be lacking. While in the first levels you don't pay too much attention to it, the woodiness of the tiles becomes a glaring defect in the levels where speed of reasoning is required and where it is necessary to position many of them to overcome obstacles or to make Sofi perform complex movements, perhaps by interacting with them while is in the air, i.e. having little time to do everything. Furthermore, in some cases, the cursor freezes and the gadgets disappear from the screen, forcing you to shake the mouse to make it reappear and regain control of the situation. For whom does the bell toll? Two factors partially save the situation: the first is the extremely low price at which Lucidity is sold (less than ten euros). The second is the highly sought-after audiovisual style reminiscent of children's book illustrations and which is well suited to the underlying theme of the game. Although we cannot cry out to be a miracle, technically speaking, it is still true that an excellent job of characterization and composition has been done. Too bad for the fluctuating structuring of the levels, in some cases inspired while in others decidedly subdued, which often clash with the atmosphere itself.", "date": "2009-10-28", "grade": "6.0"}
