{"name": "Pocket Love!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pocket-love-recensione.html", "text": "Valentine's Day has now passed, but if you're still in the mood for romance, it might be interesting to discover the game we're examining in this Pocket Love! review, because it's practically a small management game for couples. It's almost difficult to define it as a video game in the most traditional sense of term, because here we are faced with a sort of very light pastime that wanders around the Tamagotchi as a type of entertainment, entirely centered on the contemplation of one's virtual creatures rather than on significant interaction, but one must also understand that one it is a product aimed at those looking for a structured and complex experience. In many respects it could fit into the vein of Farmville and similar apps that have become famous on Facebook, but perhaps we are at an even lower level in terms of gameplay, if it can be defined as such. Pocket Love allows us to build a dream home in the company of our partner and any puppies to adopt, but beyond the aesthetic management of the house and the characters there is practically nothing else. therefore based on the purchase of objects and on their placement in the house or on the expansion of this, aiming at the creation of the perfect love nest in a continuous race to improve and accumulate furnishings and customizations to choose from, to then enjoy your own tiny dream mansion in all its glory. There is very little to play but it is undoubtedly a mechanism that can easily capture predisposed users, thanks also to a really well-kept and pleasant graphic characterization, a real fundamental basis of the whole experience. Digital dollhouse Pocket Love!, a screenshot from the game It starts with a simple but satisfying editor that allows you to create your own avatar, that of your partner and any pet and then immediately jump into the mechanics of the game, or rather the embellishment of your own house. This is represented with an isometric shot from above that allows you to see clearly all the elements that are placed inside, essentially focusing on the classic principle of the ~dolls house~: the whole mechanism of Pocket Love is based on natural pleasure which arises from the contemplation of a microscopic ideal house, to be entirely customized with a truly impressive amount of furniture, objects and variations. From a certain point of view, the reference to Animal Crossing and similar titles is evident, which leverage the general cuteness and the sweet atmosphere to facilitate escape in their perfect little world, but in this case the interaction is practically nil, relying almost exclusively on the contemplation of virtual life, as a sort of digital model to be continuously modified. The only substantial change that can be made is the expansion of the house, but for the rest it is simply a matter of buying new objects and choosing how to position them, perhaps trying to give a particular style to the house in general or to every single room that composes it. In Pocket Love! we find ourselves continually buying new items on the ~Amazing~ store There is a system of progressive objectives which, if nothing else, directs the player towards some specific actions to be performed (always concerning the customization of the avatars or the house, of course), which also allows you to obtain various rewards, but it is small hints that always play on the same elements and which, moreover, lead to rather small rewards, pushing dangerously towards microtransactions to see clearer progress. Compulsive buying is in itself a fundamental element of the game: all the objects, furniture, clothes and elements of the house can be purchased on a virtual shop called Amazing, which is clearly a reference to Amazon, which is certainly nice but which also makes us a little dubious about the idealization of consumerism that clearly emerges from the game.", "date": "2022-02-19", "grade": "5.8"}
