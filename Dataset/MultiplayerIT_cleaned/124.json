{"name": "Tetris Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tetris-mania_a.html", "text": "Mania grandeur The characteristic aspect of Tetris Mania is, paradoxically, the absence of the original version of the historic puzzle game. EA Mobile, with a far from wise decision, has in fact preferred to bet everything on three different variations of the formula which - frankly - absolutely do not hold the comparison with the classic mode. Not that they are bad, of course: but their presence would have been more welcome as a side dish to the ~old~ Tetris rather than as the only components of a new product. First for classification and quality is the Cascade Mode, which pushes the user to build formations in order to concatenate as many chains as possible: essentially, when a line is made, the remaining pieces fall into the spaces below, and you have to make sure that this movement generates other lines. Instead of worrying about keeping the screen clear, the player must therefore build real ~castles~ of blocks, trying to get the greatest domino effect. Then there is the Sticky mode, in which the various pieces are often composed of units of different colors: these are more affected by gravity, and therefore tend to fall towards the bottom. The leitmotif in this case is trying to join at least 10 squares of the same shade (which literally stick together, hence the name of the mode), so as to make them disappear together with the formation of the classic lines. Finally we have the Fusion Mode, definitely the weakest of the three. In this scenario, the simple pieces of Tetris alternate with so-called atom blocks, which cannot be eliminated via lines and which must be arranged next to each other and then detonated thanks to small squares called fusion blocks. Even difficult to describe in words, the Fusion mode is also the most difficult to assimilate, creating an evident paradox being associated with the name of one of the most immediate video games ever. All three variants can be used in two ways: Mania, the most classic of free play, or Challenge, which sets some goals and time limits. The choice by EA Mobile to automatically save the game status every time a game is interrupted by returning to the phone menu, which allows you to resume from the exact point where you left off, is definitely apt. From a technical point of view, as it is easy to imagine, Tetris Mania certainly cannot offer sensational elements: however the EA Mobile product proves to be pleasant thanks to the use of bright colors and some tasty visual effects, while on the sound level the situation is truly reduced to the bone, with very short jingles and effects relating only to the composition of the lines. On the other hand, the loads are inexplicably long, which for the first game reach almost 30 seconds.
