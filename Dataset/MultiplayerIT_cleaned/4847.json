The idea of a video game based on Tarantino's classic can't help but prick up the ears of the most hardened cinephiles, but also give them a few cold shivers. The violence, the over the top dialogues and the characterization of simple but spectacular characters, not to mention a decidedly unique management of the timeline, made the film a contemporary classic and partly defined the director's figure. However, we know what usually happens when movies become video games. The long distance from the original could bode well for a project designed without haste, however know immediately that even this time the well-made tie-in cup will have to remain in the cellar to collect dust. Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days tries to bring the charm of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs to PC, will it succeed? Bloody The idea of the game is to take up the basic concept of the film, i.e. a group of violent, resolute robbers who don't trust each other and multiply it by a series of hits, gradually giving us control of a greater number of characters, with slightly different characteristics. There is the fastest in grabbing the money, the most accurate, the one that collects the damage better and so on. Obviously these characters are none other than Mr. Brown, Mr. Pink and so on, however forget even a vague resemblance to the original cast. The only real link between the film and the video game are the clothes and some quotes scattered between the dialogues and in the loading screens, otherwise the game could be set in space like among the gangsters of the 1920s. Visually quite poor, Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days presents a shot from above and a playability in the style of Hotline Miami, but with much less artistic inspiration behind it and a repetitiveness of situations that is quite wearing in the long run. Basically all we have to do is enter a place, grab all the money possible and make our way through dozens of policemen with not particularly good aim and poor artificial intelligence, which almost always leads them to approach even when we are only equipped of white weapons. The result is that it will often be enough to lurk behind a wall with a stick to resolve any situation with few hitches. Erase & Rewind Despite a rather widespread mediocrity, Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days has a rather interesting idea. Since we'll have to control each character, we obviously won't be able to do it at the same time. Therefore, once all the moves have been made in real time with the first hyena we are commanding, we will be able to rewind time and move the second one, while the first performs exactly the same actions as before. This allows you to bypass the most complicated obstacles and get out of practically any situation alive, just simply try to plan and learn from mistakes. For example, if with Mr. Brown we kill two henchmen of a rival gang, but a third guy arrives behind us armed with a machine gun who starts shooting, just press the space bar, rewind time and use Mr. Pink to eliminate him before he may harm our partner in robbery. The times will always be dictated by the first hyena, therefore each action of the following ones takes place in the period of time that passes between the moment in which the action began and the one in which we pressed the space bar. This mechanic will prove to be particularly useful when we have to complete a task in a very short time and we can't count on just one robber. For example, when we have to rob a bank vault in less than thirty seconds, for the rest we will have to adapt quickly to the situation. The idea is not bad, but except in rare particularly complicated cases, most of the time we limit ourselves to neutralizing almost all the threats with the first hyena, exploiting a not particularly brilliant artificial intelligence, and then having it followed by the others. The other big problem with the game is that, basically, that's all. Yes ok, if we want we can level up and unlock new and more lethal starting weapons, but basically there is no real sense of progression, since the additional characters, with no real characteristic traits, are unlocked simply by continuing to play and we will almost always have enough money not to have to worry too much about scraping together more to access the more difficult missions. Furthermore, lacking any possible reference to the real characters of Reservoir Dogs, all the ~coolness~ of Tarantino's protagonists is completely lost, there is no atmosphere, there is no inspirationaction, we are simply faced with a top-down shooter with a very light dose of strategy that repeats its trick endlessly.", "date": "2017-05-26", "grade": "5.5"}
