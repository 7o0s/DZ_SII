But one thing is now evident: without physical keys and a means of movement control, such as the directional cross or the analog stick, the device produced by Apple forces you to use every single neuron to make up for these shortcomings and invent something new, perhaps using the accelerometer, or to rework some old ideas. This last line is the one followed by the dozens of small developers who have taken over good old tower defense gameplay, in great dust in its simplicity: hordes of enemies to be killed by placing a few traps and little more, a perfect concept because it is smart in combine great frenzy and dynamism with a few well-reasoned interactions. The examples would be many and among the many valuable titles - Geo Defense and Star Defense, to name two - Knights Onrush also stood out, a small but suggestive variant on the genre. A man and his gate Conceptually it is difficult to imagine something simpler: a castle to be defended to prevent enemies from breaking through the perimeter and therefore penetrating inside the walls. To resist a series of weapons mounted along the walls - fireballs, rocks, crossbows, cannons and wacky flying columns - all controllable using the interaction between the finger and the touchscreen, with always possible, while the above tools are charging, the similar option of picking up and throwing opponents into the air, who can also be thrown into special fiery pits or hung on hooks waiting to be torn to pieces by a dragon so as to earn Sacrifice points. To make the overview more appetizing, each of the twelve main levels is divided into several waves, after each of which you can access a special shop to buy upgrades and other amenities useful for facing increasingly powerful opponents who, coherently with the style adopted fantasy, they vary from simple soldiers in armor up to knights, passing through catapults and other infernal machinery. The campaign is therefore not lacking in variety and occupies more than a few hours, with an all in all well balanced level of difficulty and a lot of fun thanks to a sensible use of the mechanics in different perspectives, maximizing all the potential of an interesting but itself a bit thin. Endless madness In addition to the main mode, Madness and Endless Siege provide some more cue of madness with hordes of increasingly violent and uncontrollable opponents, in an attempt to resist as long as possible and then upload their records online, comparing them with those of other players around the world. No multiplayer option has been foreseen currently, arrived at version 1.1, and you will hardly see something like this. Graphically, the work done is excellent and the few screens that adorn this review are a clear mirror of it: the contrast between the cartoon drawings and the violence it represents always has an exhilarating effect, also thanks to a work on the remarkable details even if not supported by such care in animations. The tested version is 1.1.", "date": "2009-06-23", "grade": "8.2"}
