The studio was born thanks to Bud Spencer & Terence Hill: Slaps and Beans, the beat 'em up starring Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, but for this game the tone has become decidedly darker. The Darkest Tales, in fact, is the story of a teddy bear who comes to life to rescue his now grown up owner from a world where nightmares have come to life and there is nothing scarier than good old fairy tales in the style of the Brothers Grim. From a wolf-thirsty Little Red Riding Hood to a Peter Pan willing to do anything to stay young forever, many villains will be familiar to you, but for all the wrong reasons. modern-day games like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Will of the Wisp, taking a lot of what was done right and tailoring it to fit the story Trinity Team wants to tell. In this review of The Darkest Tales we will tell you what struck us about this title made in Italy, between quotations and innovation. A (little) creepy story Don't trust Little Red Riding Hood Nightmares have come to life in Alicia's mind and her dream kingdom is infested with evil and disturbing creatures that threaten to harm her. To help her, the spirit of the little light bulb that kept her company in the dark nights of her childhood needs a paladin who can enter the girl's mind and defeat the hosts of demons that now populate her. Who better than her childhood favorite teddy bear to accomplish this mission? Too bad that after years spent in a trunk and forgotten, Teddy (the protagonist) isn't exactly inclined to lend a hand. After some bickering, the little light manages to convince the teddy bear and the mission to save Alicia begins. The journey of the two protagonists begins in the most classic of fairy-tale worlds: forests, medieval-style villages and a girl, with a red hood, covered in blood who sets a pack of wolves against them. The little light and the teddy bear argue about what to do, but soon realize that this version of Little Red Riding Hood is a distorted memory from Alicia's childhood and their mission is to eliminate it to purify that section of her memories. After a very simple fight that ends the tutorial phase, the mission is successful, but this is only the first stage of a journey that will take Lighty (this is the name of the little light) and Teddy to explore and defeat many characters from childhood fairy tales now go crazy. It would be a shame to describe here who is hiding at the end of each level because some of the funniest moments in the company of the game were when, after a few clues, we figured out who the final boss was. Trinity Team has done a good job of sending our childhood fairy tale characters down a spiral of madness. Simple yet layered combat The combat and exploration of The Darkest Tales is very similar to that of Hollow Knight To defeat the hosts of nightmares that populate Alicia's dreams, Lighty infuses with his magic a pair of scissors, with a decidedly rounded tip, which Teddy wields as if he were a corsair with two swords. This is just the first weapon in your arsenal which will get richer and richer as the game progresses. First you will receive a bow, which will unlock the category of ranged weapons, and then an ax that will give you access to heavy weapons. As you progress through the adventure, you will unlock alternate versions of these weapons (a boomerang instead of a bow or a spear instead of swords) in order to customize your fighting style. If you have played Hollow Knight, you will immediately be familiar with the working of the magic of The Darkest Tales. Teddy has a life bar divided into sections and a mana (energy) container that fills up as you defeat enemies and hit bosses. Mana can be used to restore a section of the life bar (a full sphere will restore about 4) or to charge weapons with energy doing more damage or to create an overshield to protect against blows. Then, as in Team Cherry's souls-venia, there is a system of runes and slots: 24 passive upgrades are hidden between the levels, but you will have to choose carefully which ones to equip because there are only 6 spaces available and they are unlocked with the progress of the story. Timely healing is essential to survive the toughest fights To thecontrary to Hollow Knight, however, you won't be able to skip many moments of combat against weaker enemies. As you enter certain sections of the levels, barriers will appear that won't be destroyed until you've eliminated all enemies in the area. If the task becomes too difficult, you can always change the difficulty level. We recommend starting from medium to be able to lower it to easy in case of frustration or raise it to difficult for a more intense challenge. With some runes missing and playing mostly on medium difficulty it took us a dozen hours to complete the game. We also recommend using a controller on PC as combat is much more intuitive with the pad in hand. Level design intriguing but already seen The Darkest Tales levels are fun to play but not very original in aesthetics and structure To recreate the fairytale and messy atmosphere typical of a child's bedroom, Trinity Team has mixed the aesthetics of illustrated storybooks with the material sensation of stuffed animals, even slipping a few Lego pieces here and there, a real touch of class. The color palette is very reminiscent of the Ori series, mixed with Child of Light watercolors. The lighting management, however, makes some sections in the dark almost unplayable in daylight. To explore the levels and face enemies you will have the classic set of movement skills of 2D platformers: jump, double jump, dash (to which you are immune), clinging to walls (wallclimb) and a grappling hook with the most generous timer of gaming history. In fact, in the middle of a platforming session, you can remain suspended in the air for almost 2 seconds flat by spinning your grappling hook waiting to hook a handhold. As in Hollow Knight, hitting an enemy resets the available actions after leaving the ground (2 jumps, a dash, 1 grappling hook) making exploration really fluid. Unfortunately, in the variety of environments and in the design of the enemies, the quality drops a bit: the levels are very linear, especially at the beginning, and the opponents are few and repetitive. Particularly annoying are flying enemies that require an exaggerated amount of arrows to be shot down. Luckily all of Teddy's skills can be upgraded via a talent tree with points that you will receive as you level up, just like in an RPG. Thus you will be able to increase the damage of weapons, unlock new powers or improve the effectiveness of magic. In boss battles, then, we found ourselves faced with combat phases that didn't restart after dying or damage mechanics that didn't activate, but nothing that a restart of the game didn't fix. These technical issues will be easily fixed with a patch and will not detract from the overall experience.", "date": "2022-10-13", "grade": "7.5"}
