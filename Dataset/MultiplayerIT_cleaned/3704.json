{"name": "Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragons-dogma-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "It has now been seven years since Dragon's Dogma hit the market. Capcom's highly successful experiment, which combined the pulsating basis of the western action rpg, with some extremely oriental gimmicks, has gained more and more followers over time. While we await the increasingly probable announcement of a second chapter (we know that Itsuno simply chose whether to make Devil May Cry V or Dragon's Dogma 2 first), we returned to the lands of Gransys to see how the port on Nintendo Switch fares. Net of the past time, the title remains a little jewel that is never too acclaimed, and the possibility of playing it on the move is always a great added value. The legend of Arisen For those who are not familiar with the events behind the deeds that we will find ourselves performing, know that an Arisen is played in the game. This particular category of beings are those who have had the misfortune to cross paths with a dragon, but also the good fortune to be reborn stronger and more angry after the latter decided to cut and take away their hearts. This event binds them inextricably to the dragon in question and the only mission to which they are dedicated is revenge against the gigantic winged being. After passing a decent editor, which allows both quick and painless creation and complete customization of the traits, you move on to choosing your own class. The title allows you to change your category even in the course of its development, passing from basic to advanced classes through the simple consumption of experience points. Each of these allows the equipment of specific weapons and armor, including the release of certain skills related to the class itself. These elements are the basis of a combat system that still surprises today, thanks to the skilful union of RPG elements, hack 'n' slash action and some features even taken from Monster Hunter. Capcom's great productive gimmick was, at the time, precisely that of uniting three great producers together, so as to create a unique title of its kind. This action rpg hybrid gives rise to a series of fights of a superfine quality, supported by a depth in the mechanics that only after several hours can you really appreciate. It is in this way that the clashes with the gigantic bosses that populate the boundless lands that make up the freely explorable open world loudly recall the mechanics of the most famous hunting title on the market. On the contrary, the fights with less tough enemies give the sensations of a classic action game dear to Capcom. The structure of the title is linked to the completion of a long list of missions, divided between main and secondary, which it is possible to complete in the sequence that best suits us, up to the conclusion of a storyline that can take between thirty and sixty hours, based on the amount of optional assignments you complete. The gameplay of the pawns Dragon's Dogma is a strictly single player title, but it brings with it a mechanic that allows it to combine the idea of a party controlled by artificial intelligence with a very interesting asynchronous coop. The community of pawns represents, in the lore of the title, a typology of not totally human beings, because they are unaware of the idea of will and free will, intent on binding themselves and dedicating themselves body and soul to their leader Arisen. Through this interesting idea, the game allows you to expand your party up to four elements, one of which is main and impossible to replace, flanked by two others that you can recruit and dismiss at will. These elements bring a whole series of useful tips in battle and the right assortment of fighters and classes is what allows you to really make a difference in battle, turning a seemingly impossible battle into a health walk. To add a further level of depth there is the possibility of enlisting the main pawns shared by other online players, able to teach you something you did not know yet and which, if it is yours that has gone away, could return with new equipment and increased in level and ability. It is therefore easy to understand how this mechanic, unique and unrepeated of its kind, represents one of the great strengths of the title, functional and appreciated even seven years after its release. What about the Switch port? We come to the very reason for this third review of Dragon's Dogma: porting to Switch. Specifically, the Capcom title has experienced ups and downs from a technical point of view. The first version for the older generation was plagued by noticeable frame dropsrate, in the face of such a large world, but also managed through a series of uploads between the different areas. The arrival of the remastered on current consoles had solved most of the fluidity problems, and eliminated the annoying black bars that prevented the vision of portions of the screen on day one. At the same time, despite this massive dose of work, the title still did not exceed thirty frames per second, thus placing itself in second place behind the PC version. This further adaptation work has denied some of the fears generated over time, which wanted it again to be afflicted by particular problems of fluidity. On the contrary, during the hours of our test, we have never suffered from these limitations, except on some very small occasions and only in fixed mode. When, on the other hand, it is played on the move, the Dragon's Dogma port does not feel any kind of problem, once again showing the wonder of playing AAA titles on a six-inch screen. Certainly the thirty frames per second remain, impossible to expect the opposite where not even PlayStation 4 and Xbox One had succeeded. Instead, we did not notice any differences in terms of the purely visual aspect, with models, textures and animations anchored to what our memory had guaranteed us.", "date": "2019-04-22", "grade": "8.0"}
