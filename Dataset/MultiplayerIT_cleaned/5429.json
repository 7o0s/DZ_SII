Among these, precisely, the greatest were the Three Kingdoms, the Wei, the Shu and the Wu, who fought for years for the reunification and domination of the country. If the story itself, handed down to us by the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms written in the 3rd century by Chen Shou, is already a dizzying succession of wars, alliances and betrayals, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, written instead in the 14th century by Luo Guanzhong and which is a real monster of 80 chapters and 800,000 words, it adds to a faithful reconstruction a series of events, in fact, fictionalized, focusing among other things on the personal stories of the heroes of this period with all their load of honor, drama and romance. Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the video game, is inspired by both, and from here you can already guess the enormous amount of content that the player faces. Discovering Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a rigorous and fundamentalist historical strategy Three kingdoms and seven hundred heroes Although it is relatively unknown by us, translated a few times into English and mostly in its PC versions, an environment objectively more suitable for a strategic one, Romance of the Three Kingdoms is actually one of the pillars on which the success of the well-known is based Koei, who really knows Far Eastern historical settings. The first episode dates back to 1985, and it is precisely because of the thirtieth anniversary that Tecmo Koei has decided to localize the new iteration: the point is that, if the gameplay of a strategy game is already very rich, to this are added some questions specifications. The first concerns the historical and literary setting, the emphasis placed not only on the various state entities but also on the characters: between the historical ones and those of the novel there are as many as seven hundred (not counting the possibility of creating them from scratch) to impersonate, each featuring an impressive set of stats that can be leveled up RPG-style. The second is instead the complex Chinese bureaucratic system of the times - indeed not very dissimilar from the current one - reproposed with a certain fidelity through a mechanic of accumulation of merits and passage of ranks, eight to be precise, and as if the possibility to theoretically interact with all contemporaries: however, it is not enough to click, as in Civilization, on a foreign city to speak to its governor. You will have to go personally to the place (don't forget that we control a character, rather than a state or a city) and in any case you will only be able to speak directly with someone you already know, developing the knowledge with whom through an equally complicated Bond System, made up of dialogues , requests, gifts, favors and rewards, you will open up various possibilities: first of all you will gain an ally or a faithful follower to possibly place in the chain of command of your government, you will be able to be taught what is the discipline in which your friend excels, you will be able access his personal knowledge through a letter of introduction and you can even get married with the aim of having an heir, necessary because the Campaign goes on for two centuries and the life span is realistic. And again, there is the fact that, in thirty years and thirteen episodes, Romance of the Three Kingdoms is still the same game to which, however, a new element is added from time to time, a new dynamic that enriches and complicates things , but at the same time it hasn't undergone that process of refinement of the interface, of ~streamlining~, the British would say, which instead has made today's western strategists much more accessible than those of twenty years ago, without making them lose in complexity. The result is that trying to explain Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII is an almost more improbable undertaking than starting to play it totally unfamiliar with the saga. Playstation 4 trophies A good 43 Trophies await the fearless conquerors of ancient China, divided between 26 Bronzes, 14 Silvers, 2 Golds and Platinum which is obtained after having earned all the others. Many of these Trophies, especially the Bronzes, are linked to progress in that mammoth and already difficult tutorial that is the Hero Mode, but the juiciest ones are obviously reserved for those who will successfully undertake the Campaign in its various versions and with different characters, in order, among other things, to participate as a protagonist in all the historical eventsyou reproduced. If you like, it's just another layer of complexity added just like that, because it could. Chinese torture Fortunately, the Hero Mode comes to meet us, the big news of this episode, a sort of huge tutorial divided into fourteen events (plus additions through DLC already programmed) that retrace some of the most important episodes of the novel and true story, each of the which dedicated to a particular aspect of the gameplay. Here then we gradually learn how to dialogue and develop knowledge with the other characters, how to climb the ranks and how to behave when we are subordinates and when instead we control one or more cities, how to take care of the prosperity of these and how to move from one to the other on a map of China to be zoomed to different levels in real time, like checking the passage of time through a hybrid RTS system similar, so to speak, to that of Europa Universalis. We learn to forge alliances and to patrol the cities to eliminate criminals and bandits, and in this regard we are offered two very similar mini-games based, needless to say, on the Chinese pen, one for debates and one for duels, and obviously, because then the The ultimate goal of everything is to reunify the country one way or another, we also learn how to replenish our troops, train them, move and deploy them always making sure that the supply line is clear, and finally how to move them into battle. And yes, because in addition to the enormous strategic part, the surface of which we have just scratched above, there is also a whole tactical part that concerns the single fights in an even more specific map, where we will control the armies individually, whether they are infantry, cavalry, archers or, another novelty, naval. Battles that we will be able to face both as the attackers and as the defenders, with relative different techniques concerning, for example, the sieges of cities, and although the feeling is that it is enough to set up a large army and then attack with this head down to always have the upper hand, it must be said that there is no shortage of epic moments, thanks to the presence of duels which in the middle of the conflict transfer the emphasis for a few minutes to a dramatic personal confrontation between two commanders. Epic moments of absolute satisfaction that in truth are not lacking at all in the whole game, which on balance turns out to be truly complete, exhilarating and exciting, provided however that you overcome a first (but also a second and a third) truly unsettling impact and a steep difficulty curve like no other. In this, even the well-deserving Hero Mode sometimes proves to be incomplete and a bit enigmatic, and the control via pad certainly does not help, which increases the cumbersomeness of the already many steps necessary to perform a single action. Among the rewards that await the most patient strategists, an entire scenographic system which, despite being little supported by graphics at the levels of the previous generation for polygonal detail, texture quality and the presence of a lot of aliasing, is however extremely spectacular in the beautiful 2D representations of PG and environments, in the camera movements and in the effects on the occasion of the verbal clashes and those with white weapons, in the computer graphics films that liberally cite all the Far Eastern cinematic imagery from Kurosawa to Bruce Lee, and in music exceptional halfway between the Chinese tradition and the peplum of the 50s, supported by a recitation of the many dialogues, in Japanese and Chinese, undoubtedly convincing even if it is not very understandable. Finally, it doesn't help, but it was really hard to expect the opposite, the mere presence of the English language for the lyrics, which are really well written, very mature and sometimes full of surprising humor.", "date": "2016-07-05", "grade": "7.8"}
