{"name": "Un salto in avanti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/124615-skylanders-swap-force-un-salto-in-avanti.html", "text": "Skylanders is a series capable of moving, to date, about 10 million copies of the ~Starter Pack~ alone in its various multi-platform releases. If you add up to these numbers the sales of the individual characters, the statuettes that have driven collectors crazy and emptied the wallets of parents from all over the world, it doesn't take much to understand the value of a brand that actually represents the most classic of hens lays golden eggs for Activision Blizzard. Just to give you an idea, in the financial report of the second quarter of 2013, the US publisher revealed that total sales had reached the monstrous figure of one and a half billion dollars. Snubbed by hardcore gamers who soon dismissed it as a despicable commercial product without a soul for kids, and even hated by Spyro fans for its original - and now almost completely abandoned - connection with the purple dragon, Skylanders has instead been able to reveal itself in the eyes of the less biased as a brand supported by an indisputable underlying quality. Now in its third chapter, Swap Force constitutes a sort of turning point for the creature created by Toys for Bob and now handed over, for this occasion, to Vicarious Visions. Skylanders Swap Force represents a concrete step forward for the series I want them all! Just like in several other series from the annual publication, with a frequent practice at Activision Blizzard, also for Skylanders it was decided to support two teams from this episode onwards, destined to alternate in the development of the franchise with the required timing. If Toys for Bob, which gave birth to the first two releases, is therefore intent on working on the project for 2014, this year the ball has passed from hand to Vicarious Vision, a very long-lived group with great experience in the portable. A sort of promotion then, but at the same time a testing ground for those that make your knees tremble. Fortunately, the overall result can easily be said to be perfectly successful, if not even better than expected. Let's start by saying that obviously Skylanders Swap Force doesn't even think about distorting or revolutionizing the cornerstone on which the brand's success has developed; we are obviously talking about the union between portal and statuettes, the stroke of genius that ignited the interest of kids (and not only) from all over the globe. Snobs who look with disdain at store shelves full of packs of the most disparate characters should probably make an effort and imagine how nice it would have been if the heroes of their childhood, the toys that filled whole afternoons in the bedroom, could magically come to life on your TV screen in an instant. That the formula is obviously aimed at profit does not rain, but Skylanders is also a good game, with great production values; which, in the context of titles for children, is anything but obvious. In summary for the less informed, there are these statuettes to be placed on the ~portal~, a sort of luminescent platform connected via USB to your console; the operation allows you to see that same character replicated in the game, who then becomes the protagonist of the adventure. The beauty is that this protagonist can be exchanged at will at any time, simply by replacing it on the portal with another statuette in one's possession. Beyond the purely aesthetic differences, each Skylander has unique abilities and powers, and also enjoys an affinity with an element; some doors, which give access to secondary areas of the levels, can only be crossed by the characters of that given element, thus providing further stimulus for the expansion of one's collection of heroes. The continuity between the various episodes is guaranteed by the fact that all the statuettes of the previous titles are always and in any case compatible with the subsequent episodes of the game. But if last year the ~novelty~ was made up of the Giants, or larger statuettes, this year the focus is on the Swap Force. These are new characters (initially sixteen) that can be separated, dividing the upper part of the body - basically for attack - from the lower one - basically for movement; hooking and unhooking are managed by a very simple and immediate magnet system. The purpose of this operation is to allow the player to combine the different parts of the different heroes, so as to create new statuettes that possess the skills and attributes of both. Among other things, the same skills can be expanded by purchasing them in special upgrade areas, spending the coins collected in the levels. In short, it is a good ideata, which increases the need for manipulation of the Skylanders, thus balancing the ~real~ and ~virtual~ elements of the game. The figurines then keep ~in memory~ all the qualities, levels and accessories with which they were customized, allowing you to take them to a friend's house and play with your ~private~ heroes even on different consoles. I'll break you in two But it's not just in the figurines that Skylanders Swap Force brings news; on the contrary Vicarious Visions has decided to go and substantially modify the game mechanics through various additions that prove to be very useful within the economy of the gameplay. The most important is undoubtedly the ability, for the first time in the series, to jump; it may seem laughable that such a basic possibility should be counted among the brand's innovations, yet so far Skylanders had limited itself to guaranteeing a very linear and simple level of navigation of the environments which inevitably had reduced its versatility and variety. Thanks to the jump, however, the levels are now much, much more fun and challenging to visit, and offer design situations that make good use of this addition, thus introducing platform elements and greatly extending the exploratory element. Skylanders is therefore evidently a series that is growing together with its users, and with Swap Force it can be said that we have concretely arrived at having a fun and enjoyable game even for those who have long passed the teenage age. Along with this addition, however, there are others, such as the possibility through the Swap Zones to access mini-games scattered within the levels, which are the prerogative of the characters with that precise movement ability (for a total of eight); these are very different challenges from the basic gameplay, based on flight mechanics through rings, or vertical climbing, or running on a track and so on, which further increase the overall variety. Up to now we have only described part of the innovations introduced by Skylanders Swap Force, but overall Vicarious Visions has done a really good job of reviewing and refining the original mechanics, thus creating a product that is simply more fun and enjoyable. The same goes also for the graphic component, heavily renewed and which can now count on a much more consistent complexity and level of detail; certainly there are flaws, such as a little pop-up and a slight blurring of the image, as well as a camera that is not always perfect, but nevertheless the world of Activision Blizzard production is much more vibrant, alive and fun. The writer has only some doubts about the character design of some new characters, less inspired and incisive, but here we fall within the sphere of personal tastes. More questionable, however, the impossibility of saving during the course of the levels; considering the particular vastness of the same, which in some cases can occupy even for an hour, it seems to us an absence capable of creating some problems. The plot is weak, which could have enjoyed a better development, and some rather trivial boss fights could also be improved. On the other hand, the audio accompaniment is excellent, with applause especially for the Italian dubbing. Finally, the usual assessments regarding the price: to see all that Skylanders Swap Force has to offer, you need to incur a total expense of more than two hundred euros. Certainly not motes, very true, but let's be clear: even if we ~satisfy~ with investing less than half (starter pack plus a couple of extra characters) we assure you that the hours of fun and the game possibilities are remarkable.", "date": "2013-10-22", "grade": "8.5"}
