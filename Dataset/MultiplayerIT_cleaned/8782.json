It all begins with a fistfight between petty thieves and us who intervene in favor of one or the other contender. The character we have just saved will show us his gratitude by welcoming us into the ranks of the organization to which he belongs, giving us some dirty work to complete and then rewarding us with a sum of money. Using the nest egg collected by shooting some infamous, stealing some cars or settling some accounts we will be able to get new weapons and clothes, but keeping in mind the nature of the product, bound by the ~diamonds~ and/or by the level of experience of our alter ego. As always happens in freemium games made by Gameloft, in fact, it is possible to spend hours running around the city and completing a certain number of missions to level up and thus gain access to new equipment, new vehicles and so on. or choose to put some (real) money into the operation and accelerate progress substantially. Do you like that weapon? Do you like that car? Buy some diamonds and you can get it. Grand Theft Freemium In short, the assumptions of Urban Crime suggest a production that is certainly not very original (not a novelty for the French house, on the contrary) but with a large number of qualities. Unfortunately the truth is very different: the sandbox structure, with the city map and the missions that are displayed inside it, which can also be accessed via a simple touch, is exploited worse than the already controversial Six-Guns, and in particular the thickness of the experience, which too often shows the side to simplistic and ill-conceived implications. The challenges are too hasty, designed for quick use which, however, has little to do with a game of this kind, and it is difficult to define them as ~fun~ considering the general repetitiveness (kill that guy, steal that car, cross the finish line first in a clandestine race) and the presence of a cumbersome control system, which does not behave badly in the sections on foot but requires manual adjustment of the view (even during fights!) and gives its worst when you start driving of vehicles. In fact, the default setting provides that you steer by tilting the device and therefore taking advantage of the integrated accelerometer, but the results are nothing short of bad and fortunately it is possible to opt for a solution with a virtual double lever, not perfect but at least usable without crashing always against a wall. The aforementioned limits of the freemium setting, i.e. the obligation to reach a certain level of experience or alternatively spend real money to access certain content, often conflicts with the gameplay itself, because it limits the freedom of action that should instead be in first place in a sandbox. It will often happen that you will not be able to steal a particular car because it is still blocked, perhaps just when we quickly need a vehicle with which to get away from the area because they are being chased by a rival gang or by the police. Finally, the technical sector turns out to be well below expectations, with a relatively vast scenario but poor in terms of detail and afflicted by an annoying pop-up effect that characterizes, in particular, travel aboard a car.
