{"name": "Pokmon: Let's Go", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-recensione.html", "text": "Here we are at the review of Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, probably the pair of Pokmon games that have fans most discussed. In fact, since the first rumors about the logo, the two chapters that mark the debut of the Game Freak series on Nintendo Switch have aroused doubts and discontent, as never before in the history of the brand. The reason? The presence of that ~Go~ in the title, obviously, a clear reference to the mobile spin-off which has led to hypothesize not only a simplification in the mechanics to mimic those of Pokmon GO, but also a free-to-play drift that could have epochal repercussions on the competitive landscape. Fortunately, however, reality turned out to be quite different and the Let's Go, Pikachu! that arrived on our Nintendo Switch has shown an unconditional love for what are some of the key elements of the series. Even if not everything went perfectly. The story: from Giallo to Let's Go Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokmon Let's Go, Eevee! they are in all respects remakes of Pokmon Yellow. This means that in terms of setting, story and mechanics there are so many points of contact with the fourth version for Game Boy, starting with the return of the Kanto region as the undisputed star of the adventure. However, there are also numerous elements of discontinuity with the original. First of all, the protagonists are different and move on an alternative timeline, where Professor Oak managed to invent the Pokdex a few years later than what had happened in the first generation titles. This translates into a whole series of events and meetings that wink at historical fans, eliciting more than a smile of complicity every time one manages to catch one of the many references hidden in the lines of dialogue. However, the narrative remains in the background: it guides the various cities of the region through the main moments of the fight against Team Rocket (with the return of Jessie, James and a Meowth that does not seem able to speak), while each trainer builds one's story one battle and one capture after another. The character editor is new, but borrowed from the most recent chapters: just like on Nintendo 3DS it remains rather simple, allowing you to choose only the gender and skin tone of the avatar. The choice of the starter, or Pikachu or Eevee depending on the version purchased, then follows new methods, giving greater importance to the relationship with this exceptional Pokmon. In fact, Pikachu and Eevee do not limit their particularity to not wanting to stay in their Pok Balls, but they also have unique characteristics, such as increased stats, perfect individual values and the ability to learn spectacular exclusive attacks and hidden techniques, which replace the various moves to be used outside of battle, such as Slash or Fly. All of this merges into a title with a good longevity, which opens in a fairly rich end game made up of rematches, encounters with formidable new trainers (the so-called Master Trainers, but not only) and, obviously, the completion of the Pokdex, through the trading and catching what is considered the most powerful Pokmon in the world. Revolutionary gameplay? Some of the most common fears about Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokmon Let's Go, Eevee! are those related to the gameplay and, in particular, to the elimination of fights during encounters with wild Pokmon. A legitimate concern, but which proved to be inconsistent when tested: the capture mechanics a la Pokmon GO proved to be fresh and fun with all the control systems, including the Pok Ball Plus: the little monsters in fact move with particular patterns and the need to make good throws in order not to miss the rarest ones adds that extra pinch of adrenaline, which in the previous chapters was given by the risk of knocking out the opponent. By the way, not all Pokmon can be caught without fighting. Some particular monsters attack as soon as you interact with them, starting a challenging battle with a time limit, which recalls the raid battles of Pokmon GO and reverses the approach to legendary monsters: if before, in fact, you embarked on exhausting fights to minimize the number of HP before launching Ultra Ball at will, now you have to defeat the Pokmon quickly to access the capture screen, which at this point represents a real additional minigame. One could argue about the possibility of these mechanics coexisting in all encounters, but the fact that the battle is limited to certain Pokmon in a sense increases its uniqueness: after all, theThe developers' choice may therefore not have been as ill-advised as it seemed at first. However, the real revolution concerns the way in which you get to the capture screen: for the first time in what is to all intents and purposes a main chapter, or almost, encounters with Pokmon are not random. The monsters appear clearly visible on the screen, they are almost always easy to avoid and, above all, you immediately have an indication of the appearance of each one. Thus, it is immediately understood, for example, if we are dealing with a chromatic version, or a specimen with anomalous dimensions and therefore capable of giving more experience points. Catching Pokmon also earns experience for all Pokmon on the team, and in Let's Go, Pikachu! and Eevee! the amount of points received is linked not only to the species, but also to the quality of the throw and, precisely, to the fact that the little monster is particularly large or small compared to the average. The sharing of the active experience even after the clashes does not affect the balance too much, leaving the difficulty level always in a pleasant middle ground that does not allow you to turn off your brain during the fights. However, returning to the absence of random encounters, it should be noted that in this way the duration of the adventure becomes particularly variable: if until now it was necessary to spend a large part of one's budget on Repellents to move undisturbed, now it is theoretically possible to cross entire routes and forests without encountering a single Pokmon, thus drastically reducing exploration times compared to Yellow. However, it is difficult to consider this a negative point: for years now a modernization of the encounter system has been required, which in this way guarantees an important change of pace and, above all, allows the player to give the adventure the rhythm he prefers. First generation multiplayer The combat mechanics of Pokmon: Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, on the other hand, remained the classic ones of the series. The clashes take place in turns, with the order of the attacks as always governed by the speed of the user and the possibility of alternating up to six Pokmon in each battle. Then there are some balance changes that affect the effectiveness of some shots and now you can access the box to change the composition of the team directly from the backpack. However, what changes profoundly, and negatively, is the complexity and variety of builds available for Pokemon. The system of IV (individual values) and EV (training points that are assigned to each statistic after the clashes) fortunately remains, but their management through very rare caps and candies to be obtained with captures is not completely convincing and is less immediate of the expedients seen in the last chapters for 3DS, such as the Super Virtual Training or the Isolotto Buonalena. On the other hand, the abilities and the possibility of spawning disappear completely: with a swipe of the sponge, the whole competitive sector is gone, which remains the prerogative of Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon on Nintendo 3DS and of the new Pokmon chapter coming out in 2019 on Nintendo Switch. Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Eevee! represent a reference to Pokmon Yellow in this too, but the choice is far from explicable with the need to remain faithful to the original mechanics, given that the Game Boy Advance remakes, i.e. Fire Red and Leaf Green, had already cleared all these elements. In addition, the presence of all the Alola versions and all the Mega Evolutions related to the first generation Pokmon eliminates any justification, leaving only one possible evaluation open: Pokmon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Eevee! they are titles with a trivialized management system, which reduces the possibilities of customizing one's team and the effectiveness of many Pokmon. Just think of a Koffing without Levitation that suddenly becomes vulnerable to all Earth-type attacks, or an Arcanine without Arrogance; but the list would be much longer. However questionable, the developers seem to have made this decision with awareness, given that the online options are scarce and incredibly reduced: matchmaking for exchanges and fights, single or double, is absent, with the ability to connect to others limited by a rather anachronistic code system. If anyone thought that the new Pokmon could help push the paid online service, well... they were simply wrong, because from an online point of view Let's Go represents not only a step backwards, but a real return to the age of stone. On the other hand, there is no shortage of possibilities for having fun in local multiplayer. In addition to fights and scambi with those who own another copy of the game on Switch, Pokmon Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee! in fact, they introduce an unprecedented cooperative mode. This allows a second player to hold a Joy-Con or another controller and immediately enter the game, making his contribution in battles, where he controls a second Pokmon on the team, or in the capture phase, where he can throw a Ball with the right timing to have better chances. Sure, the system is limited and the second player doesn't even have the power to interact with Pokmon, but it's a nice addition and capable of properly connecting different generations of trainers. The connection with Pokmon GO Unlike what the title let us imagine, the connection with Pokmon GO is very weak and linked only to a single structure in one of the last cities in history. It is therefore not possible to transfer Pokmon from Pokmon GO before you already have your team at a level higher than that of the monsters present in the mobile game. For all the features, however, we refer to a later study, given that at the time of the review it was not yet possible to connect the two games. A separate study will also be dedicated to the Pok Ball Plus, which really offers many secondary functions. The most beautiful Kanto ever The first impact with Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee! leaves some disappointment for the absence of dubbing, which is no longer attributable to space limitations as on a solely portable console. It would not have been bad to have at least the voices of the Japanese and English-speaking voice actor of the Professor, also by virtue of the declared references to the animated series. All in all, this is a secondary lack, but one that goes hand in hand with some inconsistencies in the entire audio sector: an excellent soundtrack, which re-proposes modern versions of the original themes, is in fact still accompanied by the re-propositions of the verses in 8-bit of practically all the Pokmon of the lot. In fact, therefore, Pikachu and Eevee are the only dubbed characters in the entire game: considering that one or two voice actors would have been enough to create various verses for all the little monsters, this is a missed opportunity to give greater uniformity to the whole sector sound, especially given the importance that these effects have among the functions of the PokBall Plus. Returning instead to the graphic aspect, Pokmon Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee! mark a decisive step forward compared to what was seen on 3DS: the Pokmon models are well done, the effects are numerous (some recall those of the attacks of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) and the frame rate is finally stable in almost all circumstances. The Kanto map is faithful to the original one in practically every square of grass and returns a colorful and always pleasant glance, both on television and in portable mode. Of course, the textures are a bit flat, the scenarios not very animated and the shadows a bit too sharp, but overall we can be satisfied with the work done by Game Freak, even when the transitions between environments and attack turns are slower than necessary. The customizations Finally, all the customizations and aesthetic additions designed to delight the fans deserve a separate mention. In Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee! in fact, you can choose between different outfits and accessories for the avatar, which can in turn be coordinated with those of the partner Pokmon, with this it remains perched on the player's shoulder for the duration of the adventure. You can then play with Pikachu or Eevee in a special screen, feed them with berries and, in portable mode, use your fingers to change their hairstyle. A second Pokmon can also be brought out of its sphere and, depending on the species, this can walk next to the protagonist, or carry him on his back to speed up movement by land or sea. Apart from extreme cases such as Venusaur's controversial frog step and some difficulty in movement, it is always a pleasure to have a Pokmon with you, which also helps to find some hidden tools.", "date": "2018-11-13", "grade": "8.0"}
