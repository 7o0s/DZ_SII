Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. As Tobey Maguire taught us in ~Spider-Man 2~, delivering pizzas is not always a pleasant job, quite the contrary. Even the girl protagonist of Cool Pizza comes to the same conclusion when, during a delivery, she discovers that her skateboard is possessed by spirits and that hordes of demons from beyond the grave have poured into the Earth to kill her. This is the unusual incipit of the action game developed by Secret Library for iPhone and iPod Touch (only compatible with models equipped with Retina Display, however) and available for free on the App Store. The game can only surprise you at first glance, given the peculiar graphic style adopted: the background is completely black, with only a few lines representing the flow of the road, while the character we control and the numerous monsters that attack her are drawn with shades of grey, to recall a noir atmosphere which is however brutally broken by the introduction of four acid colors (initially purple and yellow), which highlight on the one hand the terrible weapons that will be launched against us, on the other our special power, which in based on the combos made, it can ~grow~ and transform from a simple jump to a devastating projectile, from a barrier to a smart bomb that clears the screen of all enemies. To infinity and beyond Although the structure is typical of survival games, i.e. a ~one-off match~ in which you try to get as far as possible and beat previous records, being careful never to get caught because otherwise it's game over, the gameplay of Cool Pizza immediately recalls that of the classic Space Harrier, with only one important difference: the protagonist cannot fly, while her opponents will fall on her from above. To remedy this lack, we will have to try to make the most of the ramps that frequently appear on the ground and which allow us, in fact, to make mighty leaps and reach the monsters that the infernal forces have unleashed against us, executing our attacks simply by touching the screen and trying to exploit the ~boost~ generated by each kill to stay high and move on to the next target, in an orgy of combos and punches. The forty-two hordes we'll face will get stronger and tighter, proposing a bestiary that goes from tentacled one-eyed creatures to swarms of assassin bugs, from flying coffins (which open and throw the bones inside at us ) to huge severed hands, equipped with a large mouth in the palm. Fortunately, the control system, which uses a mix of touch screen and accelerometer, proves to be sufficiently precise and reliable, allowing us to survive even in very complicated situations, tilting the device to move left or right. Finally, the action is accompanied by a ~laptoppunk~ soundtrack created by Tettix, engaging at the right point and definitely adapted to the context.", "date": "2012-10-20", "grade": "8.0"}
