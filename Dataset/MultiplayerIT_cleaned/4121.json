Fortunately, from time to time to rebalance things, courageous productions such as 1979 Revolution: Black Friday pop up; games ready to remind you that the videogame medium can say a lot, in many different ways, and with excellent educational possibilities. For example, it can help to disseminate, or present in a different light, important events of the collective past, even the very recent one. How many of you, before having casually glanced at the title of iNK stories and N-Fusion Interactive, knew at least in general terms the events of the most important Iranian revolution in contemporary history? 1979 Revolution: Black Friday tells what happened, and does it through a fast-paced, enjoyable and rather ambitious narrative adventure. Now it is also available on consoles, ready to please amateur historians, but not only. The Iranian Revolution marries interactive drama To say that 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is an interactive adventure with a historical background does not do justice to the work of the developers: the courageous indie published by Digerati is not a video game built around an event from the recent past to propose a gameplay or an idea of particular game, as much as the attempt to tell a precise story with the most suitable means. And what better method to tell a story than to adopt interactive drama? Important exponents such as the works of David Cage and those of Telltale Games have demonstrated how the events and characters are the real protagonists of the game, while the player has the (limited) task of deciding which words to pronounce, which important choices to make, and above all what fate they have to meet. 1979 Revolution: Black Friday tells what happened between 1978 and 1979 in Iran, focusing on this last year in particular, but with frequent flashbacks that make the whole story understandable even to those who have leafed through the last history book in Iran. school. Among other things, the events of contemporary history are also treated superficially in secondary schools, therefore titles of this kind are always useful also for enriching one's personal baggage of knowledge. The 1979 revolution was a fundamental event for the birth of modern Shiite Iran: after a long period of nationalist-style social and military reforms and the worsening of the living conditions of most of the citizen classes, the revolutionaries deposed the last Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty; after the oppressive regime fell, the Islamic Republic of Iran was born. The event attracted the attention of the main world powers (especially America) and tensions continued for a long time even after the proclamation of the Republic, and it cannot be ruled out today that they are at the basis of the continuous conflicts in the Middle East. The player is called upon to interpret (and monitor) Reza Shirazi, a photojournalist who returned to Iran in the summer of '79 after a long stay in Europe: a very different country awaits him from the one he had left when he left, where the life have worsened and the authoritarian drift of the Shah has now reached the point of no return. Over the course of the twenty chapters in which the main plot is articulated, Reza will experience the main events of the revolution, clashes with the armed forces, non-violent actions, he will see with his own eyes what Iran has become, and in the end (depending on the player choices) will act in a certain way within the revolutionary movement. Both he and his companions can die, suffer or win, with the good dose of replayability that titles such as Detroit: Become Human and the Telltale Games games usually offer, obviously always remembering in this case it is an indie with high potential, but also with very limited resources. Playstation 4 trophies 1979 Revolution: Black Friday lands on PlayStation 4 bringing with it a large number of Trophies, including the coveted Platinum Trophy. Obtaining them all will not be particularly difficult, nor an excessively long operation considering the small duration of the main adventure. It will be necessary to complete the story at least once, obtain all the collectibles relating to all the historical insights of the title, and then cooperate again and save the various supporting characters. Revolution on PS4 - a very good conversion Speaking of its indie nature, 1979 Revolution: Black Friday was released two years ago on PC, and after a long conversion period it now also arrives on consoles. The writer had the posability to deal with the PlayStation 4 version, which apart from a few small graphic glitches proves to be decidedly solid. The minimum actions related to the gameplay have been entrusted to the analogs of the DualShock 4, exactly as happens for titles such as The Walking Dead and Tales from the Borderlands by Telltale Games: during the exploration phases the left analog is set to move the character, during the QTE sessions must be tilted in the precise direction indicated on the screen to prevent the protagonist from crashing into a car or ending up in the clutches of the Iranian police. Most of the situations proposed in 1979 are resolved, precisely, in the rapid execution of precise commands, and during the dialogues in the selection of one of the four possible answers it shows on the screen. Here the problems are basically two, but they become one: first of all, the title has been subtitled in several languages, including European ones, but unfortunately not in Italian. In itself nothing new under the sun, except that the response time is decidedly short, and that most of the time we live with the anxiety of not being able to read, understand and select the correct answer in time of the four present. A flaw that is not too invasive but annoying, also because 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a valid title, which among other things tells the revolution in an objective and historically accurate way, giving the possibility to delve into more than one aspect of situations, events and characters of those tense years. Provided, yes, that we are able to live with a technical and visual sector that recalls games for PlayStation 2.", "date": "2018-07-30", "grade": "8.3"}
