{"name": "Apple Knight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/apple-knight-recensione.html", "text": "Apple Knight's review takes us back to the origins of the action platform genre, both because of the excellent retro-style graphics created for the occasion by the guys from Limitless, and for a solid and engaging two-dimensional gameplay, which does not miss anything in spite of the gratuity. The game is in fact available for free on the App Store and Google Play Store, characterized by a decidedly permissive freemium model: it is possible to play for as long as you want, provided you watch short advertising trailers at the end of each stage and when game over occurs. Or when, deliberately, one chooses to break a special box which, in exchange for a few seconds of promotional videos, will deliver coins, apples and extra items. Furthermore, by making any in-app purchase, all the advertisements will disappear. The formula developed by the developers therefore draws on tradition, while allowing itself some references to the now classic Celeste but without proposing the same type of hardcore approach in the slightest: it is possible to select one of three different difficulty levels at the beginning of the game, with the intermediate one giving us three hearts for the health bar, two checkpoints to unlock within the levels and a fairly rich set of continues. Gameplay and structure Apple Knight puts us in command of a young knight determined to save his kingdom from the invasion of an army that counts, among its ranks, mercenaries and wizards but also bats and other creatures. The campaign develops within a limited number of scenarios, which however are enriched week by week with new stages: what is presented before our eyes is therefore an open construction site, which at the moment does not require much time to be completed but which, from a future point of view, boasts an undoubted potential. Wanting to find fault with the production, it can be said that the artificial intelligence of the opponents appears very basic and schematic, so much so that the mercenaries often remain stationary even when we attack them, making things a little too easy for us. The touch controls are excellent, responsive and well organized: the character can single or double jump, cling to walls, attack with the sword or throw an object at enemies (be it an apple, a fireball, a a bomb or something else: it depends on the upgrades), as well as making a leap forward which can also be valid from an exploratory perspective. In fact, the settings develop in all directions, often vertically, and include hidden areas that can be accessed to obtain new treasures and close the level with a higher amount of coins. The latter are used to buy new and more powerful swords, change the throwing object (as already mentioned) and possibly unlock armor capable of improving our characteristics of strength, speed and resistance: some of them are available as an in-app purchase . Apple Knight natively supports Bluetooth controllers, and it goes without saying that playing with physical controls makes the experience much more consistent, although as mentioned the touch controls work very well. On a technical level, an excellent job has been done with the pixel art: the characters are well drawn, the animations fluid, the scenarios detailed but differentiated only in terms of the worlds, which strictly end with a boss fight. The music is less brilliant, which is catchy but tends to repeat itself a bit too much, while the sound effects suffer from some slip-ups: when more coins are collected together, the sound is really too loud and annoying.", "date": "2019-12-05", "grade": "8.0"}
