The link between chess and the videogame/computer world is incredibly deep, not only because the very first videogames developed include several reproductions of the aforementioned game, but also because of the famous man-machine challenges which, especially at the turn of the 90s and the beginning of 2000, they compared the world champions of the time with very powerful computers, able to ~stand up~ to the wonderful human brain. The duels between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov, or those between Vladimir Kramnik and Deep Fritz 7, are engraved in the history of this ancient and deeply complex board game, whose rules have developed - in small steps - over the centuries and have reached a definitive dimension around the XIX. To someone however, this ~immobile~ in the dynamics must not have gone too well and, after having confronted for over three years with experts and passionate chess players, also through an open forum, finally decided to make Chess 2: The Sequel. You read correctly, this is not the classic ~sequel~ of videogames or cinematographic memory, but that of the game/sport of chess as such. A burst of modesty that will have made more than a few luminaries turn in their graves and gnash their teeth in a good part of the upright professional chess players, nevertheless behind this bizarre (and extremely ambitious) project there are some brilliant ideas hidden. If you haven't already fled in the throes of intolerance and curiosity devours you, you just have to keep reading. Chess 2 is not the classic ~sequel~ of videogame memory, but that of chess as such Chess Fighter 2 Simple to learn but extremely complex to master, chess is generally associated, at the highest levels, with brilliant mathematical minds, capable of juggling the 64-square chessboard with elegant and often surprising moves, prepared even after hours and hours of study and reasoning . Despite the abnormal amount of variables on the field, the game, which is symmetrical in nature, enjoys great balance when faced by players of a similar Elo level, i.e. the ranking basically based on performance. For a radical renewal, while also keeping the genuine balance unaltered, an equally brilliant mind capable of conceiving it is therefore necessary: and who, if not a game designer graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Techology (the prestigious MIT) in mathematics and business could try his hand at this daunting feat? David Stirling, even mentioned by Forbes magazine, is a genius of the gaming world with experience in balancing fighting games (Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix) and puzzle games, as well as the creator of some intriguing card games with moderate success. The idea of renewing the game of chess came to him by observing the matches between professionals, which he considered far too long and characterized by a completely disproportionate percentage of draws. The first ~intuition~ in the development of Chess 2: The Sequel was therefore to introduce a new rule - to be added to checkmate - to obtain victory, a choice that fell on overcoming the middle line of the chessboard with the king. Through this simple but irrepressible rule, not only is the piece given greater importance, generally defended with nails by the ~checks~ in the rear, but the concept of the so-called openings is also completely distorted. The matches are thus more dynamic, fast and above all usable online, where the study on the sacrifice of the pieces, to favor the advance of the king, offers new food for thought and even entertainment. The second novelty introduced in the basic rules are the so-called stone duels, which players can wager when one of their own pieces is captured. In simple words, the attacked player can invest one or two stones (or bluff) and, through a system comparable to that of rock, paper and scissors, in case of victory, he can in turn capture the attacking piece. At the beginning of each game, players have three stones which can reach a maximum of six by capturing opponents' pieces, and the number of stones needed to win duels is also influenced by the quality of the pieces in play (a pawn, for example , needs more stones to capture an attacking bishop than ithe opposite). This is a novelty that further amplifies the thickness of the game, the balance of which, however, can only be fully understood by the most expert chess players and after countless games. At an amateur level, we can say that it is certainly an interesting rule to study and that it can be a harbinger of great satisfaction. These two important basic introductions are already more than enough to overturn the normal game dynamics, but David Stirling and Ludeme Games, publisher of the title, wanted to go much further, proposing as many as six distinct armies equipped with specific moves and properties, with the possibility of unprecedented asymmetrical comparisons. The King is dead, long live the King The first army available to players of Chess 2: The Sequel is the one defined Classic, where the pieces and relative moves are completely identical to the normal game of chess: the only differences in a comparison between two classic armies are attributable to the two new basic rules we talked about earlier, which obviously profoundly influence traditional tactics and strategies. The second army of the game is called Empowered and is characterized by the ~teamwork~ possible between knight, rook, and bishop. When two or more of these pieces are adjacent, horizontally or vertically, they share specific moves with each other, and so, for example, a rook can make an L-shaped move and a knight can move diagonally like a bishop. In the Empowered army, the queen, called Elegant Queen, loses all her traditional power and can move one square at a time exactly like the king. In the Two Kings army, there are precisely two warrior kings and no queen: the two kings not only enjoy an optional extra movement, but can perform the so-called Whirlwind Attack and capture both enemy and friendly pieces in all squares adjacent. The bizarre Reaper army provides a piece to replace the queen (reaper) and one of the tower (ghost): the former can teleport to any square on the board and capture what he wants - with the exception of the king - while the latter can teleport freely but not it can capture nothing or be captured, merely acting as a physical obstacle to advancing enemy pieces. In the Animals army, the horse is replaced by the wild horse which moves like a bishop and can also capture allied pieces; the bishop is replaced by the tiger which can move only two squares diagonally and returns to its starting position after a capture, while the rook is replaced by the elephant, which can capture everything it encounters in a range of three squares. In the last army available, Nemesis, the queen is replaced by the nemesis which can only capture or be captured by the opposing king, while the pawns are influenced in their movements by the proximity of their own king. As you may have guessed, these are completely new, sometimes bizarre ingredients that distort the game of chess as everyone knows it, making it even more complex in certain situations, also by virtue of the asymmetry of the clashes. Deciding on the balance of the game is currently a real gamble, given the considerable basic complexity and the need to fully assimilate the innumerable variations proposed; nevertheless, the innovations introduced, appreciated by many players, have transformed an immortal classic into a new strategic product, more frenetic, dynamic and sometimes fun. Despite the great concept work elaborated by David Stirling, it must be said that Chess 2: The Sequel, just landed on Steam but released at the beginning of the year on Ouya, has very few options, no video settings, poor artificial intelligence and a matchmaking to be refined, as well as the impossibility of challenging a friend. The developer has announced that several improvements will be introduced over time, however, currently, having to spend 23 Euros for such a poor and, above all, peculiar title, can represent a major obstacle to its diffusion. From a graphic point of view Chess 2: The Sequel is spartan but pleasant, considering the total absence of settings, while the rather interesting musical accompaniment is composed of classical pieces ranging from Beethoven's Elise to Bach's Aria on the fourth string .
