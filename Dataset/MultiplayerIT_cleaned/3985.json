Lucas Pope, to whom we owe both, is a master of emergent storytelling, perhaps one of the few true authors left in the world of video games, capable of expressing his poetics in the relationship between game mechanics and representation, without having to explain it in other ways . Where Papers, Please was able to effectively tell a system of power, transforming the player into its bureaucratic emanation, Return of the Obra Dinn, behind the appearance of an investigative adventure, is instead a gigantic fresco of the descent into madness of human being, outlined through the causal and non-linear reconstruction of a series of key events. The drawings of one of the passengers are essential to define the identities of the 60 passengers of the Obra Dinn. Investigation mechanics In Return of the Obra Dinn, the player takes on the role of an East India Company insurance investigator, whose gender is chosen randomly, who must shed light on what happened to the ship Obra Dinn, which set sail for the East in 1802, with a on board two hundred tons of goods and sixty men, including crew and passengers. The ship had been reported missing after six months at sea, when she hadn't reached the Cape of Good Hope as planned. On 14 October 1807 however, she reappeared at Falmouth Harbour. There is no one on board and the goods have disappeared. Our goal is to estimate the damage and find out what caused it. Once on the ship we will have two tools available to conduct our investigations: a compass with a skull engraved on it and a book divided into ten chapters, but with completely blank pages, apart from the index, the crew list, some maps, drawings and a useful glossary. To understand the function of both, it is enough to find the first corpse: observing it, the protagonist takes out the compass which starts to vibrate. By pressing the interaction key we access the exact moment of his death, frozen in time and space. Here we can literally explore the scene by moving inside it, to identify the characters involved and to notice some details useful for the investigation. Each memory explored brings up content in the book, basically files that summarize it and which include the portrait of the dead man, the point of the ship where his body is and an image of the moment of death. Our goal is to define the identity of the corpse, selecting it from a list that includes the entire crew, the reason for its death and the possible killer. This is where the real game begins: reconstructing the destinies of the entire crew by crossing clues and looking for new ones by exploring the individual scenes several times. Deducing is the key word, because Return of the Obra Dinn helps the player very little in the investigation, providing him with all the tools useful for reconstructing what happened, but leaving him free to make his own reasoning and to make his choices and in the case of err. The only concession that is made, if we want to call it that, concerns the blocking of three correct destinies at a time (two in the final stages), which obviously ends up reducing the possibilities of choice, making it progressively easier to determine the remaining destinies. Some seemingly insignificant details can help reconstruct the fate of one of the crew members. Gameplay Obviously Return of the Obra Dinn requires an average intelligent and attentive player to be enjoyed as it deserves. To determine a destiny, in fact, it is necessary to evaluate many different elements. The clues are many and often only make sense by unlocking other sequences, so it is very important to retrace your steps to refine your reasoning and verify your intuitions. Everything can help in the reconstruction of an identity: work done on the ship, position on it at the time of death, clothing worn, the short dialogues audible at the beginning of each memory, ethnicity, gender and so on. To give a very trivial example, a man of fatigue will certainly not be the captain or one of the officers on board, while a character who provides medical care to others obviously has a well-defined role. However, the interface does not completely abandon the player, giving him some suggestions. The book fills up as we explore the memories. For example the portraits in the book remain blurry until there are enough clues to pinpoint their identity. When they are brought into focus, i.e. they become identifiable, an indication of the difficulty of the deduction to be made appears above them. In this way the systembut it helps us at least to follow a certain order in determining identities, implicitly advising us to reveal the simpler ones first and then the more complex ones, so as not to get stuck. After all, sometimes it's enough to re-observe the right memory to grasp a detail that had escaped us and be able to move forward, so you can proceed as you wish. Overall, the system works so well and is so balanced that we can define Return of the Obra Dinn as the best investigation game ever made, one of the few that truly respects the player's intelligence, leaving him time and way to conduct his investigation. investigation without taking it at every step. Examining a character from memories we are shown next to his portrait in one of the drawings contained in the book. Another great intuition of the game is not to completely reveal its history. Let's say that the ten chapters of which it is composed form an understandable, but in fact incomplete story: it is the player who has to put the pieces together by accepting the fragmented nature of the story itself. To many it will seem absurd, but the presence of holes is preparatory to the very concept of investigation. Indeed, the investigators aim to put events back together as precisely as possible, knowing however that the reconstruction will never really coincide with reality and that something will inevitably remain out. In the same way, Pope is very careful to modulate the narrative in such a way as to communicate the existence of facts and circumstances that took place outside the memories that are shown, making the entire gaming experience even more convincing and engaging, which thus travels on two tracks: on the one hand there is the story and on the other a continuous reflection on the ways of accessing it which represent its objective limit. The compass allows you to access your memories. Graphics and longevity Coming to more mundane matters, another prominent element of Return of the Obra Dinn is the graphic style chosen to represent the game world. In an era in which even the testicles of horses are animated, Pope wanted to focus everything on a vintage bichromatism, despite the graphics being completely in 3D. This extreme choice not only gives his game a very strong personality, but also allows you to effectively mask some limitations, especially in 3D models. In general the adventure takes place in a very small environment, (the Obra Dinn) reconstructed however with great attention to detail, despite the extreme stylization. The research work done on the scenography and on the crew itself is truly impressive and we can guarantee you that the result is excellent, especially in motion (2D images make very little). The only technical quirk of the work, if we want to call it that, is represented by graphic filters that allow you to change the color palette, to imitate those of very old systems. The story is full of dramatic moments. In terms of longevity Return of the Obra Dinn has an extremely variable length. It takes about four hours to unlock all the Memories, but to piece together the entire chain of events by giving each crew member a destiny takes a huge amount of playing time. We took just under eleven hours to finish it, but considering that the deductive part is predominant, it is clear that the time required to get to the end is greater or less depending on the player's investigative skills. Finally, we want to praise the excellent Italian translation, which does not look bad in the face of the original English texts.", "date": "2018-10-26", "grade": "9.2"}
