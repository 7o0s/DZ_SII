{"name": "Kartrider: Drift", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kartrider-drift-recensione.html", "text": "It is strange to note that no one has yet stolen the secret from Nintendo of how to build a perfect kart game for 30 years now, yet even the review of Kartrider: Drift only certifies this situation. It is not a question of zeal or awe, because at this point it would also be anachronistic to want to defend Mario Kart's superiority at all costs over all the rest of the offer which is now beginning to be substantial, but it is the simple truth: there have been interesting projects, rather valid alternatives that have also managed to build a certain following (such as Crash Team Racing), but in all cases we are talking about looking up at mariesco racing in all its glory. really speaks of an upstart: KartRider Rush, the first chapter in the series of the Korean/Japanese colossus Nexon, has millions of users all over the world and a similar fate will probably also await Kartrider: Drift, if only by virtue of its distribution on a free. It is in fact a free-to-play that does not have particularly aggressive monetization policies (even if we can at least note the push towards the purchase of paid premium battle passes) which can lead in a short time to a very large user base vast. And this seems to be already ready, considering the ease with which it is possible to find ready online matches on any game mode and despite the fact that the title has not yet been officially launched on consoles, being currently available only on PC and mobile platforms. undoubtedly a substantial production behind it, which is reflected in an interesting characterization and a good amount of content, but at the moment Kartrider: Drift is still far from the best standards of the genre: even without bothering his majesty Mario Kart, we can easily turn to the Sonic All series -Stars for a more satisfying driving model game, or to Crash Team Racing for a more sensible integration of power-ups and racing. The Nexon title, however, has the possibility of being downloaded for free and of being easily playable even on mobile platforms, which can make it an extremely accessible and widespread title. The basics of arcade kart racing KartRider: Drift, the characterization of the characters is nice The gameplay is based on the fundamentals of arcade-style karting games, i.e. fast and very unrealistic driving combined with the tactical use of power-ups. The driving system follows the one that has now become standard, with the choice of the right moment in which to accelerate at the initial traffic light to obtain an additional boost, the wake effect that we can obtain by being behind the opponents and the inevitable skid capable of giving a extra acceleration if done correctly. The problem is that every single element of the driving system appears as a sort of general simplification of the principles of Mario Kart: the sprint at the start does not change based on the characteristics of the driver or vehicle, the drift system is quite convincing but is mortified by the track design often too simple and the fact that characters and cars are the same, except for the aesthetic aspect, significantly reduces any tactical element. All these aspects make it a game particularly suitable for mobile use, so much so that Kartrider: Drift can also be played semi-automatically, leaving the player with the only task of steering and using power-ups, but even in this mode it is difficult to compete with the charisma and immediate playability of Mario Kart Tour, which also represents in itself a considerable simplification of the formula. Driving system and powers, on the other hand, derive directly from the tradition of the genre, both in terms of the behavior of the vehicles and the effects of offensive and defensive weapons, with some sporadic original introductions. KartRider: Drift, the tracks are pleasant but a bit anonymous In general, even in the modes more focused on the use of power-ups, these are only partially effective, never going to change the race set-up too much: this could be an element in favor of the game, if only the design of the tracks and the driving system proved to be a little more stimulating and able to make the players' skill prevail more clearly. Kartrider: Drift is undoubtedly designed also taking into account the mobile platforms and also the simplification of the driving system and the paths derives from this fundamental point. The semi-automatic control system works quite well on smartphones and tablets, even if it is less intuitive than that of Mario Kart Tour, but it is above all the good reactivity in termsof loading and matchmaking to make it a particularly enjoyable game on the move. Methods and progression KartRider: Drift is very much about customizing your drivers and vehicles The amount of content is a feature in favor of Kartrider: Drift, which presents us with a considerable variety of activities in each game to take part in, in an integrated way with the progression system with objectives. In the game we can take part in standard races based on speed and boosts, focus on challenges based above all on speed, participate in timed races, organize custom matches or dedicate ourselves to unlocking the various ~licenses~ that allow access to new levels. Each mode then contains variants based on the type of multiplayer, with the possibility of choosing between total confrontation or team play, resulting in a significant amount of possible combinations that determine different gaming experiences, although all set according to the same mechanics of gameplay. This branching structure integrates with the progression system, as is often the case with free-to-play games. Also in this case we are faced with a battle pass (here appropriately called race pass) with progressive objectives, divided between free and paid, with the latter obviously richer and more interesting than the other. This difference appears quite evident from the first games, given that the standard objectives run out rather quickly, obviously showing much greater attention to the paid battle pass (whose prices start at 6.99 euros for the standard premium). The prizes concern only cosmetic elements and have no influence on the gameplay, however it is clear that these represent an effective push to progress, therefore their conquest is considered important in the game economy. In any case, the structure seems less predatory than seen in many other titles based on similar models (even from Nexon itself). Characterization, graphics and design KartRider Drift's power-ups are derivative but still well done The graphics of Kartrider: Drift is simple but at the same time clean and pleasant, thanks to a childish anime-style characterization that always works very well on this type of game, which is also aimed at a very wide audience. This is also reflected in the excellent design of the characters and vehicles, which are functional to the entire progression system based precisely on the customization of the pilots and the vehicles to be deployed on the track. Although everything seems a bit anonymous compared to other kart games, it is at least taken care of to the point of making us want to unlock new content to show off in the race, and it's no small thing since the whole system is based on this a bit gameplay. Despite the pleasant aspect, perhaps the weakest element of the package is precisely the design of the tracks, which is often trivial and not very stimulating. One of the features that have most contributed to building the myth of Mario Kart, the construction of the tracks has a fundamental importance for the gameplay of such a game, but in this case we are faced with rather trivial and flat solutions. Although the scenarios are varied, colorful and well designed, in general they contribute strongly to that lack of general charisma that characterizes a bit all of Kartrider: Drift, with the aggravating circumstance of negatively affecting the gameplay itself, in this case.", "date": "2023-01-23", "grade": "6.5"}
