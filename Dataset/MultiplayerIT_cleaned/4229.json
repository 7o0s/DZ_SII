In fact, it seems like yesterday that we were discussing the expectations for PlayStation VR, when in reality, after the summer, the Sony viewer will already blow out two candles. In these two years, the Japanese company has not lacked its support for the peripheral, gathering important external collaborations to bring you important titles such as Resident Evil 7 and Skyrim VR, but also producing special exclusives. Although the latter have not always succeeded in achieving the expectations placed on them, it must be said that Sony has not lacked the quantity. Even today we find ourselves talking about an exclusive for PlayStation VR: in fact, it's up to the Chinese team Internet Stars VR to show us its Animal Force, a ~puccioso~ strategic game that has been available for a few days on the PlayStation Store. A panda friend Animal Force puts us in the role of a group of little animals with superhero powers, committed to countering the alien forces who intend to make a clean sweep of the humans on the planet. To succeed in their intent, our friends can move on a spaceship with which to go in search of enemy forces, intercepting their spacecraft to face the battle and stop the invasion. Each of these battles obviously corresponds to a different level, proposed in increasing difficulty. As things get complicated, it becomes possible to count on the different types of characters present in Animal Force, each of which is equipped with a particular ability. We find for example the panda, capable of firing shots that inflict significant damage, a rhinoceros that can also shoot, but doing less damage in favor of the possibility of slowing down opponents, a bird that allows those around it to count on a defensive shield, and so on. Before each level it is possible to choose up to three different types of animals, thus making their management the main factor of success within Animal Force. The player's objective - in addition to not losing all the members of the team - is to prevent the aliens from reaching the planet, by bringing a certain number of abducted humans back into the spaceship. By eliminating enemies, you can earn other animals to add to the team (always taken from the types chosen at the beginning of the level) or, once the maximum number of usable forces has been reached, stars to be used to obtain upgrades. Accompanying the single player campaign are three different types of local multiplayer modes, where the player wearing PlayStation VR can compete against others equipped with DualShock 4 up to a maximum of four users in total. Although the addition may be nice at first glance, these are mostly rather simple mini-games, which will hardly attract you to the point of calling some friends over to play Animal Force. Playstation 4 trophies Animal Force has a total of thirty-two Trophies. The usual Platinum obtainable after unlocking all the others is accompanied by six of the Gold type, five Silver and twenty Bronze. To collect most of them it is necessary to get busy especially in the campaign mode, but those who want to get to one hundred percent will also have to deal with the three multiplayer modes, calling together friends to help them in the enterprise. Defense animals The dynamics of Animal Force are close to those of the tower defense genre, putting, as we have already said, the player in the position of having to prevent the aliens from penetrating the defenses to get to the planet. Each enemy follows a set path, along which the player must strategically deploy their pets. To do this we can count on only one of the two PlayStation Move controllers, which in fact offers us everything we need: by touching the animals it is possible to magnetize them to the movements of your hand, stacking them to create a sort of floating tower or unhooking them to place them in a certain point on the screen. In the early stages the formula manages to convince, but continuing with the game you end up giving in to the confusion generated by the presence of so many elements on the screen: managing creatures with touch becomes a little less simple, and requires a good amount of concentration to be able to successfully complete the battle. Unfortunately, variety is not Animal Force's forte: once you have discovered all the types of animals available, you find yourself faced with levels that are more or less always similar to each other. There are also boss battles, which unfortunately still fail to get noticed in a particular way. In stylistic terms Animal Force does its dutyand, presenting minimal but quite nice graphics, especially as regards the ~pucciosi~ protagonists of the game.", "date": "2018-05-30", "grade": "5.5"}
