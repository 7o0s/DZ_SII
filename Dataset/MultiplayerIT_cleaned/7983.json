The first two, three hours seem to be faced with the worthy heir of Dungeon Keeper, then the problems that were dampened in the simpler game levels begin to take shape becoming preponderant, while the merits end up in the background finally disappearing in the magma of bugs and confusion that reigns from a certain point on. It hardly happens to find a playful experience in which one passes from almost euphoria to complete disappointment, but this is definitely the case with Cyanide Montreal's latest effort. The protagonist of the game, who will be presented to us in the introductory film, is a failed and somewhat touched demonologist, Oscar Van Fairweather, who awakens a funny-looking demon in spite of himself, called Baal, with whom he wants to conquer the kingdom of Ardania by starting from underground. Its aim is that where there is good, evil wins, where there is love, hate arrives, where there is order, chaos reigns and that the sellers of Nutella sell only chard. In short, he is the usual scirocco to whom women never gave it and for this reason he developed a deep hatred for everything and everyone. Unfortunately, he is also quite incapable, a fact that one realizes by watching the various cutscenes and which has no reflection on the gameplay. However the plot is the least of the problems. As we have already said, some dialogues are funny, but with the umpteenth demonstration of weakness and stupidity by the good Fairweather, one feels like leaving him at the mercy of his enemies and seeing him tortured in the most ferocious way possible. There is no shortage of trashy moments with tavern jokes and others of an almost embarrassing baseness. But so far we are in the ordinary administration and after all no one will tear their clothes if a strategic does not make a lot of narrative. But now we come to the game ... unfortunately. Let's still believe it As we said, Impire promises well at the beginning. Dungeon Keeper meets an RPG, one would almost have to shed a tear for the emotion. The first few minutes are spent learning the rudiments of gameplay, then you learn how to dig tunnels, accumulate resources, create troops, manage them and so on. The tutorial is very clear and reveals everything you need to know to start playing effectively. The player has a dual purpose: build and defend a dungeon and explore other dungeons for resources and quests to complete. Both phases are very important, but in order not to lose immediately, you must first of all learn to defend your kingdom from the attacks of the heroes on duty, who arrive with increasing frequency as the difficulty of the missions increases to make us happy. So you have to pay attention to the ladders that are occasionally lowered in the corridors and which herald the arrival of the local dudes in search of glory. You will understand that the better the troops produced, the more likely they are to defend themselves effectively by turning them into warnings for other unfortunates. At first, you'll only have low-value creatures, but as you progress and explore, you'll unlock powerful minions. From time to time it will be necessary to carry out missions outside the dungeons, sending the grouped troops to raid specific objectives. In the latter case, these are actions that take place beyond the control of the player, who is only given the burden of selecting the troops to send. So far, no major problems seem to arise. In reality, we could mention some flaws in the controls, with too many mouse clicks that go in vain, and we could also say that already from the second map we notice a certain cumbersomeness of the game action, with the troops forced to go back and forth between dungeons. But, after all, we end up believing that the teleportation compensates very well for some slowness and that the advanced levels could reveal some big surprises. The harsh reality We soon realize the real drama of Impire: all the best cards are played right away and soon the game becomes a simple repetition of the same actions over and over again, with the dungeon to be recreated from scratch each time and the one to explore that invariably resembles the previous. The environments are all the same, the actions to be performed are always the same and the variables are minimal. In this the single player mode betrays the design designed for multiplayer very much, with the dungeon intended exclusively for the gestation of the army with which you must start the conquest. Unlike Dungeon Keeper, where many varieties of rooms could be built, here we are limited to a few infrastructures, all automated. In short, after building there is almost no need for player intervention, except in defense with buildingof some traps. You will understand well that such a scheme gets tired after a while, especially when the missions become long. For example, after a mission played for more than an hour and a half ... but what happens? The desktop? You don't see any jaguars to pick off, so it must have been a bug. Not bad, we restart and... do we have to redo almost everything? Autosaves work really bad, but we don't give up. After all, it will be enough to save by hand ... no, even manual saves record predetermined moments and, in the event of a defeat or a bug (unfortunately frequent), one is forced to replay long sections already passed. Things are not going well at all. Still? Going forward in the missions, the sense of discouragement becomes stronger and stronger and the stimuli to continue melt like chocolate milk in the summer. Even the role-playing elements, such as the DEC points, to be spent to purchase equipment and to unlock troops and rooms, which can be earned by carrying out missions and special actions, are of little use to improve the overall picture. At the beginning, choosing what to unlock can be interesting, but over time you understand that you just need to follow a precise pattern to always have the upper hand. The customization possibilities are reduced to the bone and getting to the end of some maps, knowing that in the next ones you will have to redo exactly the same actions, is alienating. Create workers, build rooms, create army and repeat until death do you part with the mouse. The exploratory parts do not improve the situation and, on the contrary, aggravate it, given that the interactions are very limited and we are reduced to exploring, eliminating enemies, opening chests, reaching the objective of the turn and the end of the story. The fights lack any strategy. The troops start charging as soon as they see the enemies and it is really difficult to manage them in the meantime, so you just assemble the armies (four troops for each grouping, for a maximum of five groupings) and send them to the boarding, replacing the fallen each time in turn. The only variant is that every now and then the exhausted creatures have to be ordered to go and refresh themselves in a kind of tavern, to recover morale and energy, an obligation which greatly interrupts the action. In short, having reached the sixth mission, one begins to wish that the agony would end and despair of seeing a striking and captivating novelty appear on the screen. It is clear that nothing will happen. Until the end.", "date": "2013-03-01", "grade": "4.2"}
