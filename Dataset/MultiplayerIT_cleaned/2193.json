{"name": "Monsters & Co. Scare Island", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monsters-co-scare-island.html", "text": "A world of fear! Designed to conquer a large slice of the market, the creation of Monsters & Co. was studied to maintain the taste of fun savored in watching the Disney&Pixar movie unaltered. The story of the film is brought into the game through scenes from the same retold in clips and original dialogues made with the voices of the voice actors of the film. In Monsters & CO you will take care of Boo, a little girl who mysteriously finds herself in a world of monsters and you will have to be able to get her back home before she is discovered. For the record, the world of Monsters & Co. is made up of the elite of monsters who produce and transform screams to frighten children who are left alone in their beds in the dark when night falls. One of the best terrorizers of children is certainly Sully, a green-furred monster with purple spots, a friend of Mike, a small one-eyed green monster who also acts as his assistant. Children are a threat to monsters and for this both they and anything human are banished from the world, but one day a little girl manages to enter it. Your task: save Boo Players will essentially have to complete missions by collecting items such as food, discarded screams, scream baskets or finding special objects such as manuals or keys through the various levels in an attempt to save Boo and prevent the destruction of everything by Waternoose players. To do this, you will have to wander around the scary factory collecting keys to open doors that will allow you to access new areas, find new opponents or experiment with tangled mini-puzzles. Each puzzle will require a frightening skill to solve, which is Sully's best talent. In the first mini-game Sully will have to scare five monsters before time runs out. Sully control is very simple and easy to manage. So you can easily walk, run, jump, scare, open doors and talk to other creatures. All the creatures will always be very helpful and friendly with Sully and will try to help him with the exception of that hyena Randall Boggs, a chameleon. Regarded as the second best monster scarer in the company, Randall will try in every way to hinder the good intentions of Sully. Mike appears as the second main character in the story and also sometimes serves as the narrator. With Sully and Mark in the factory of terror! The graphics of Monsters & Co. are essentially based on the film. The game includes many cutscenes from the original film with which you can follow the evolution of the plot. The characters in the game are made with precision and care and are modeled after their counterparts in the film. Sully is recognizable by his funny green fur and unmistakable purple spots while his assistant Mark will soften you with his big glittering eye. The settings are obtained in the ~terrifying locations~ that follow one another inside the frightening factory. The sound is pleasant and many background music take up the soundtrack of the film. The sound effects have been carefully crafted and fit perfectly into the atmosphere of the game. The end of a ~nightmare~ Monsters & Co. the island of the scare is a good platformer with several elements that make it a good adventure to enjoy on PS2. However this title, with a decent gameplay and bright and colorful graphics despite the game being set in a gloomy factory that produces screams, is especially recommended for a very young age group of users. The Monster & Co. characters will above all be able to capture the attention of the little ones and project them into a singular adventure created for the big screen by Disney & Pixar and transported by Sony thanks to the development of A2M on its magical black box. Pros: All the characters from the film Discreet and detailed graphics Enjoyable sound compartment Simple and easy to understand gameplay Cons: An adventure that may not be of interest to more experienced gamers due to the ease of gameplay A game for a young audience! The PS2 is a console capable of providing entertainment for all age groups including that of younger gamers who can find in some types of platformers with colorful graphics and simple gameplay a reason for fun and interest in the popular Sony console. One of these games is certainly the latest platform developed by the guys from A2M which features the characters of the famous Disney&Pixar animated film entitled Monsters & CO.the island of fear. Given the moderate success of the film which received good acclaim from film critics, Sony has seen fit to produce the game for its 128-bit console to ensure that the adventure begun in the film can continue on the televisions of those who purchase the fun platformer.", "date": "2002-03-18", "grade": null}
