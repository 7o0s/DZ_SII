The title was in fact originally released in 2017 on PC and PS4, and then landed on Xbox One and Nintendo Switch always maintaining its original free-to-play setting, albeit behind the fifth something definitely changed when the development team was bought by Ubisoft. In reality, the acquisition of the studio by the French house has done a great deal of good for the project, which instead of losing spontaneity or focusing more convincedly on microtransactions has seen the organization of a series of more or less important collaborations and given life to a vibrant and passionate eSports scene. Gameplay If you know the Super Smash Bros. series, you will need very little to familiarize yourself with the gameplay of Brawlhalla. In fact, we are talking about a product clearly inspired by the Nintendo franchise, which is based in practice on the exact same formula, mixing fighting game-style action and platforms to create frenetic and spectacular fights, in which points are scored when you manage to send the opponent off screen. One major difference is the weapons and a very particular approach to the hitboxes. The former are projected at regular intervals within the scenario, it is possible to collect them and perform different attack combinations depending on the button and direction, as well as other aspects related to the controls. The second ones, on the other hand, do not wrap the characters' appendages in their entirety, but only precise points, which must be learned and memorized to avoid hitting empty. Precisely thanks to these peculiarities, Brawlhalla proves to be a surprisingly technical game right from the start, capable of involving us in fights whose outcome remains in the balance from start to finish, given the approach to vital energy and the ring out: the successful blows push the opponent further and further away, until it is no longer possible for him to regain the first available platform with a double jump and uppercut. Even the numerous scenarios thus become part of the gameplay: some are static, others change their connotation dynamically in the course of the match, literally taking the ground out from under our feet as we try to combine the need to inflict damage on our enemies and not fall into the void: an eventuality that in the initial games appears far from remote. Structure Speaking of competition, Brawlhalla does not include a single player campaign and is therefore completely devoted to PvP modes, starting with a classic all-against-all for four participants and then moving on to one-on-one or couple duels and arriving finally to extra modes with special modifiers and personalized rooms, for a greater number of users: from six to eight. Also enriched on mobile by cross-play, i.e. by the possibility of challenging users who play on other platforms (strictly using a Bluetooth controller in place of touch controls, albeit discreetly implemented), the Blue Mammoth Games title really does not miss anything and is presented on the App Store and Google Play Store in its best form, the most updated and refined ever. Personages As mentioned above, weapons have an important influence on our approach to the game in Brawlhalla, but in the same way the characters can substantially change the experience, being characterized by different values as regards the effectiveness of the quick attack and of the heavy one, resistance and speed. The roster currently has over fifty fighters, most of whom can be unlocked by playing and collecting the necessary amount of gold, or by purchasing a package of around 20 euros to get them all immediately. However, the weekly rotation involves eight warriors and provides a fairly precise idea of the variety and inspirations that the development team has put in place, sometimes reproducing figures belonging to the imaginary of anime, cinema and comics in an all too obvious way. Technical realization If from the point of view of the mechanics, the variety of the roster and the available modes Brawlhalla cannot reproach itself for anything, arriving as mentioned at the appointment with mobile devices strong from a long process of improvement and refinement, from the point of view of the technical realization the title by Blue Mammoth Games does not gridare at a miracle and indeed often leaves a little dumbfounded. The drawing style of the characters is in fact reminiscent of flash games, and the shots from a great distance do not help to enhance the aesthetics of the fighters, in many cases rather derivative and not very original. The animations are functional to the action but even there it would be necessary to work, while the scenarios generally appear bare and dull.", "date": "2020-08-11", "grade": "8.0"}
