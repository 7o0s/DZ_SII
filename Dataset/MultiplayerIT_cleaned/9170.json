If only for the long-awaited return to PC. The last appointment with Ryu and associates in chronological order, however, involved the most atypical of the incarnations, the iPhone one, which with Street Fighter IV Volt updates an already interesting offer from a content point of view. Will it be enough to justify a second purchase? Online in progress Anyone who is already familiar with the touch version of Street Fighter IV will find in Volt a carbon copy of the gameplay tested last year: the virtual stick is the same and the control scheme identical, deliberately simplified compared to the original one but perfect for the potential of Apple devices in terms of inputs. In short, if the purists may not like it, everyone else can enjoy some well-chosen design solutions as well as a technical sector of exceptional quality. The only real novelty in terms of gameplay is represented by some new characters who join the roster of those previously available. However, Balrog, Cody and Vega don't have the only advantage of widening the range of fighters, moving away from the classic shoto in terms of playability and indeed proposing peculiar styles whose lack was a deficit now filled. If the additions of this package are marginal when you look at the game from the fighter selection screen onwards, the choice of options and modes now appears much richer. First and most importantly, the addition of the possibility to challenge other users online via wi-fi is the precise answer to the requests of many players, who can both actively seek a match and relax in the Arcade Mode waiting to be hooked by someone else . It is therefore a pity that at the moment the quality of the net code can be defined as anything but spectacular, with frequent cases of lag and some disconnections - in our case, among other things, the gaming experience was only partially plagued by the slowdowns, but there are several testimonials from players having major problems completing a match. A pity, given that the effort put into creating additions such as the Wandering Warrior avatar system, a persistent profile whose stats grow match after match, or the challenges, objectives to complete while fighting online, would need a solid foundation to succeed in the its intent to entice you to devote yourself to the application on a daily basis. Waiting for a patch that at least mitigates the current difficulties that can be experienced in multiplayer, Street Fighter IV Volt is the best version of the fighting game that has appeared on the i-device and anyone who hasn't done it with the previous incarnation can without too much delay proceed with the purchase. The question is more intricate for those who already owned the previous release: the paid update formula would have been better but, given its absence, it is perhaps better to wait for the problems to be resolved before paying the requested 5.49 euros to Capcom.
