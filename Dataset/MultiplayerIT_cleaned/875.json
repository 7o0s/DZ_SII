{"name": "Sudeki", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sudeki-3.html", "text": "Companions in misfortune Let's start then from the narrative plot which, although it contains the seed of inspiration in itself, ends up losing many of the best ideas along the way, without ever being able to adequately investigate the most important backgrounds in order to fully involve the player. The result is a mix of now obvious macro-elements, such as the contrast between light and darkness in which the umpteenth series of crystals with which earrings are normally made actually plays a crucial role thanks to its miraculous properties. It is therefore a matter of defeating the darkness, generated by the ego of the creator god of the earth Tetsu and to do so a quartet of heroes conscripted under your orders comes into play. Each of them has particular aptitudes that determine their usefulness in the combat phase or during the course of the adventure itself. None of them is characterized in a particularly original way, while the attempt to somehow imitate the classic heroes of Japanese adventures prevails, without however going too far between Western design and the tradition of anime and manga. We could divide the group on two fronts, where on one side there is the Tal/Ailish couple, he is a master in the use of the sword and therefore a brutal fighter, she deploys all her experience as an enchantress, while on the rear they complete the Buki fresco and the scientist Elco. As in the most classic Bulki scripts, the feline-woman is lethal in hand-to-hand combat while Elco has clearly devised the solution to stem the problem of the world of darkness which advances imperiously. Path of Heroes The adventure in the world of Sudeki follows very marked standard lines since there is no free exploration of any kind, but you go from one peaceful location to another colliding with all kinds of evil along the way. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is a perfectly acceptable fundamental choice, provided there is no lack of incentives to continue. In this sense Sudeki is of fluctuating quality, since not all phases of the adventure keep the narrative involvement high, but on the other hand there are countless characters to talk to and a certain variety of landscape. The type of interaction granted with the surrounding elements is not very wide, but you can switch from one character to another at any time to take advantage of their skills, such as Ailish's ability to reveal invisible objects. Furthermore, within the villages, in addition to enjoying chats based on multiple choice answers, you can accept more or less interesting sub-missions to complete the exploration of the game and reveal some subplots. Of course there are treasures to find and lots of shiny weapons to buy, because in an RPG, enemies are known to infest every inch of the traversable wasteland and for this you will have to carefully choose the upgrades for the weapons and the skills in which you want your characters to play. become more specialized as experience progresses. in the world of Sudeki fighting takes the form of furious clashes in real time, where the strategic aspect of turn-based confrontations gives way to frenzied key pressing Path of Heroes These are important precautions, since in the world of Sudeki the fights take the form of furious clashes in real time, where the strategic aspect of turn-based confrontations gives way to the frenzied pressing of the keys. Even if only one character at a time is controllable directly by the player, you can switch from one to another in real time managing memorable team actions, considering that the computer-managed party members do their duty well. During the offensive phases the game mode is substantially different between the Tal / Buki couple and the Ailish / Elco couple; the latter are skilled gunslingers and when you take control of them the view switches to first person, transforming the action into a furious shooter. In contrast, the two melee fighters use only two buttons to perform their techniques, even if they can make combinations of three buttons to bring about devastating combos. It is important to underline right away that the clashes are the beating heart of Sudeki and the best it has to offer when compared with the exploration phases or with the uninspiring development of the story. In addition to being extremely fun, the fights are often very long but end up increasing the desire to meet enemies without falling into boredom. Not all donuts come out with a hole Sudeki is a title with a lot of potential that is partly simply not exploited, perhaps due to the inexperience of the developers. Compared with the exhilarating fightsthe exploration and puzzle solving phases are so trivial that it is not clear where the challenge for the player lies and one ends up considering them a simple diversion from the linearity of the path. Fortunately, the alternation of locations diversified in style and with numerous well-crafted enemies keeps the presentation of the game high, which makes use of numerous effects for managing shadows and lights. Beyond a better visual impact which is not too pronounced, there are no substantial differences between the PC and XBox versions of the game. Too bad for the fact that in an attempt to imitate the Japanese style of manga, without fully succeeding, this Sudeki is depersonalized and ends up with a hybrid design that struggles to fully convince. This does not mean that it is a misstep by Climax, on the contrary there are many good intentions and the capabilities of the development team can be glimpsed, but the necessary maturity is still lacking to be able to establish itself in this segment of the market, where names like Tales of Symphonia dominate the scene. Comment This Sudeki is damn average in all respects. The fights are well done and fun but we would have liked more so as not to have to spend too much time entangled in the unexciting story or in solving puzzles bordering on simplicity. Too simple and too linear, a little son of KOTOR and a little son of the Japanese tradition of RPGs, which however does not capture the essence of success. All in all, nice to look at and easy to complete, it remains a title for enthusiasts who want an appetizer before the main courses, which will soon hit the shelves. In the meantime Climax can build on the experience gained and prepare to churn out a new product worthy of the main courses of the other world-renowned developers. Pros Beautiful to look at and full of eye-popping VFX Fights are a godsend Cons: Story loses its charm due to bland narration Ends too early to be an RPG City sections don't hold a candle to the fighting Puzzles to forget Climax in Japanese school Sudeki, long announced by Climax, has already cooled the spirits of XBox users and is certainly not among the most anticipated conversions, but since this genre of games does not crowd the bulletin boards of PC users, we welcome it anyway. It is worth emphasizing that Sudeki is very much a Western product, although it tries to wink at the almost unlimited trend of Japanese RPGs, such as the now popular Final Fantasy saga. Too bad it only manages to reflect its intentions, remaining a somewhat bland hybrid although solid in some respects, which however are not enough to launch it towards the peaks where titles of the magnitude of Dragon Quest reside. In our opinion, the main elements of a gdr of this type should be the narration, the characters and the clashes, while for the rest everyone can have their own personal tastes and each game follow its own style, but the fixed points just listed constitute the solid backbone of a title that aspires to the experience offered by role-playing games produced in the eastern land.", "date": "2005-07-15", "grade": null}
