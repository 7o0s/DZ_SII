{"name": "Asphalt 9: Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asphalt-9-legends-recensione.html", "text": "Asphalt 9: Legends literally takes a handful of seconds to answer a couple of questions that mobile gaming enthusiasts have been asking themselves for a while now. The first is ~what happened to Gameloft?~ After the acquisition by Vivendi, the French house seemed to have disappeared from the radar, engaged solely in updating its existing applications and therefore devoted to a pure ~games as a service~ style approach: a policy that is the most popular on mobile , but which due to hectic times and rhythms needs to be refreshed from time to time. The second question instead concerns the technical evolution of games for iOS and Android, which does not seem to have made significant progress in recent years, despite the release of ever more performing devices. As mentioned, Asphalt 9 answers both questions eloquently: the Gameloft developers were busy making an absolutely spectacular game, capable of clearly raising the bar for mobile gaming in general and setting new graphical standards, which really take advantage the hardware of high-end smartphones and tablets. When we tried the first race on iPhone X, we sincerely believed that the game used a pre-rendered scenario, thanks to the default activation of the TouchDrive technology, which basically allows you to manage only the car's drift and nitro, letting really driving both artificial intelligence and transforming the experience into the maximum expression of immediate and accessible arcade, made up of some strategic elements but fundamentally devoid of a real challenge. This feature is instead optional, with two layouts (touch and tilt, but the first seemed to us not very precise and reliable) which allow you to effectively control the car beyond acceleration and braking, which remain automatic in full respect of the nature of a product that challenges us to face curves without fear, to charge the boost to use it whenever possible, to take alternative routes, collect objects and climb ramps useful for spectacular rotating leaps. A feast for the eyes, a real ~carousel ride~ that at the moment has no equal. Gameplay As mentioned, the gameplay of Asphalt 9: Legends refers to the tradition of the series and to the most famous exponents of the arcade genre, catapulting us into races characterized by drifts, jumps, tackles that eliminate opponents (enhanced by an engaging bullet time ) and nitro, which recharges every time we perform any special maneuver, allowing us to activate boosts on three different power levels. Each event has a recommended level of performance, and exceeding it by a wide margin translates into a generally modest degree of challenge, which only in the most advanced championships of the very rich career (made up of no less than sixty seasons, for a total of eight hundred races!) can create some headaches, mostly because at that point it will become a little more complicated to raise the money necessary to upgrade our cars. However, the plural is not a coincidence, because the management of the garage in Asphalt 9: Legends is closely linked to the freemium mechanisms of the game, which indeed has the traditional ~fuel~ that is consumed with each race and recharges over time, but considers it separately for each vehicle in our possession. This means that if we have four racing cars belonging to the same category available, we will be able to take turns driving one or the other to be able to extend the experience to the maximum without incurring forced breaks. If we add to this the fact that fuel is automatically restored when moving to a new skill level, it is clear that the new Gameloft title places very few limits on its use, leaving us free to decide whether to spend some money to unlock new cars, drawing on a roster made up of over fifty real models, or be satisfied with what we can get simply by playing and collecting the inevitable ~surprise envelopes~, each containing useful components for obtaining cars and special upgrades. Modes and graphics As mentioned above, the career mode of Asphalt 9: Legends is literally huge, featuring a beautifully crafted interface and a multifaceted and generous achievement system, which always keeps the interest high. There are seventy circuits in all, which are presented as separate sections of unique and spectacular settings, which will take us racing between the rainy coasts of Scotland, the ups and downs of San Francisco or the illuminated urban views of Shanghai, but not Alone. The gamero includes the now traditional club system, which allows you to join a ~guild~ and unlock cumulative achievements thanks to the achievements of each member, but also a fast-paced and fun multiplayer mode, divided into categories, characterized by quick matchmaking and solid performances, and a set of special events useful for collecting virtual currency and other content to be used in the single player. In short, there is a lot to do, with the promise of updates that will introduce further content: more than a simple game, Asphalt 9: Legends stands as a platform that Gameloft will enrich in the coming weeks and months, on the strength of a which is unlikely to make the title obsolete before a couple of years. In fact, the graphics are the tastiest ingredient of this experience, a mix of definition, attention to detail, fluidity and effects that give their best on high-end terminals, where it can also count on HDR to further enhance the lights and the colors of the scenery. The sharpness of the textures is surprising, and net of some jaggedness the developers have done an excellent job with the motion blur and depth of field, which in combination with the refractions and the rain effect create truly memorable sequences. The game is also available as an application for Windows 10, and we tried it on a powerful configuration to understand what it was capable of, however we were largely disappointed: there are no fine adjustments that go beyond the usual presets, the resolution can be artificially augmented (via supersampling) but on an Ultra HD screen the aliasing remains evident. Furthermore, the brevity of the races but above all the impossibility of activating the manual brake and accelerator make the game difficult to compare with any other racer available for PC. Further negative note: the lack of a universal account that can automatically transfer saves to different platforms, allowing us to continue our career regardless of the device used.", "date": "2018-07-30", "grade": "9.0"}
