{"name": "XIII", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xiii_b.html", "text": "XIII is multiplayer The three versions have different characteristics for the multiplayer section. Ps2 and Xbox allow online access to the various modes through their respective services. Xbox also allows you to connect two consoles via link cable. As for the shared screen Ps2 allows it for only two players against the four of GC and Xbox. In addition to the similar DeathMatch and Capture The Flag modes for all versions, Ps2 offers the Bonus mode - there are bonuses that shrink or make you invulnerable - Xbox the Ambush mode - you have to blow up certain points in the arenas while our partner covers us - and GC the Hunt mode - the goal is to hit a comic representation of death that runs singing through the level and that the more you shoot the smaller it gets-. Note how all the modes are quite boring making the multiplayer experience just enough. XIII is a noir comic This is the beginning of the beautiful and complex story that you will discover through the various black and white Flash Backs that will appear in certain places and situations. And it is also the beginning of a game that mixes two seemingly irreconcilable concepts such as the brutal genre of first-person shooters and the soft and delicate features of the Cel Shading technique. The result is precisely the use of the expressive technique of the cartoon, animated and divided into tables, during the cut scenes necessary for the narration of the story. While playing, however, the peculiar characteristics of this stylistic choice are decidedly more felt, or rather seen! Your enemies will look like they came out of a beautiful cartoon, the level of detail of the models is very high for the style used, the animations are varied and accurate and the characterization is excellent as well as the variety. The characters will express themselves through the classic Baloons, translated and dubbed in an excellent way also in Italian, and through the various symbols indicating astonishment (!), curiosity (?!) or the classic screams (AAAAAH! or NOOOOO!). At the gameplay level, this involves displaying the Tap Tap emitted by the footsteps in order to be able to identify an enemy even without seeing it, or to be able to assist in a special table to what is happening in another location such as, for example, a enemy lurking behind a corner. XIII is cross-platform The graphics of the three versions look a lot alike. The Xbox version has a clear advantage, which manages to guarantee a fluidity and a cleaning of the image superior to its counterparts. In fact, Ps2 and GC do not enjoy an Antialaising effect which, combined with the massive use of black lines of Cell Shading, leads to embarrassing results. On GC some uncertainty in the video update, playlists and undesirable effects heavily undermine many locations especially indoors. Note how in the external levels the phenomenon does not weigh making the Xbox and GC versions absolutely identical. On Ps2 the Textures have a lower resolution which seems to give a more cartoonish and perhaps more pleasant appearance, a pity for the lack of animated tables in the game replaced by simple static tables. The control system turns out to be more immediate on GC thanks to a more logical arrangement of the keys while on Ps2 there is a greater inaccuracy of the Dual Shock and the implementation of a bad self-aim effect, although it can be deactivated. XIII is a first person shooter The above are the only ways the game takes advantage of the comic to influence the playful side. Unfortunately it doesn't do anything else, limiting itself to having an unusual visual impact, but leaving the many paths that the comic technique could have opened unexplored. Yes, because the same game could have been easily represented with another style of graphics, perhaps photorealistic. In fact Thirteen turns out to be a very rigorous and realistic shooter. And what a shooter! Plundering with both hands from the greats of the past - there are machine guns at Medal Of Honor or Castle of Wolfenstein, infiltration missions at GoldenEye, crossbow in Perfect Dark, cable car in Perfect Dark, mountain base in Perfect Dark, there's Metroid Prime's hook beam turned grappling hook, some short Turok-like jump sections etc. - Ubisoft have done their theme very well by optimizing and updating already used but still current ideas. All yesturns more linear than exploratory. It may not be very original, but it is solid, fun and challenging. Far too challenging... At times it reaches frustration given the difficulty and the clear superiority of speed, accuracy and perception that the enemies can boast in some points. If it takes us about three seconds to reload a weapon, it will take them just a blink of an eye to take us out, to give an alarm or to identify us and launch a missile at us. XIII is a good game... ...But with some flaws. For example, the checkpoints are too often badly positioned - just before a long cut scene or a long corridor - forcing you to redo useless portions or entire bosses such as the doctor of the asylum. The enemies have fluctuating artificial intelligence: they see the corpses left on the ground (!) and sound the alarm, but even if they hear a machine gun they continue to hum the latest radio hit undisturbed. If at times they are decidedly stupid and struggle to track us down even if we are clearly discovered, at times, as already mentioned, they have the behavior and reactions of supermen. Graphically speaking, the external environments are beautiful and evocative, while the interiors are most of the time too bare and not very detailed even for the Cel Shading Serious lack in the control system which does not allow you to use the analog sticks at will forcing some (including the ) to re-adapt to the game system as best as possible, throwing away years of training with FPS. However, one can console oneself with an excellent sound sector characterized by always spot on and atmospheric music and an excellent and well-characterized dubbing. Comment XIII is undoubtedly a game that knows how to amuse and entertain. However, a bitter taste remains in the mouth for a limited mention of the potential of using Cel Shading. It doesn't deviate too much from all the other similar productions on the market from which, among other things, it draws ideas and situations with both hands. What must be said is that in any case the quality level is very high from practically all points of view. The atmosphere that permeates the game is excellent and the comic quid is felt. XIII resembles a student who has learned his lesson excellently, but by heart, not putting too much of his own and not personalizing the subject. Pros: Innovative and cool image Technical realization on good levels Very fun and challenging Cons: Sometimes frustrating Little use of the characteristics of comics and Cel Shading Few original ideas Many believe they have a recurring number that accompanies them from birth. And you, do you remember yours? What is certain is that you do not remember why the number thirteen (XIII) could have been so important that it was tattooed on your chest. Besides, what were you doing on that boat? Why did you wake up munching on the sand on a beautiful beach in the company of a worried and beautiful BayWatcher? Of course, maybe if you manage to reach the bank marked on this key in your pocket, you will have answers, but will you manage not to end up like that poor beach watcher who lies riddled with bullets in her cage?", "date": "2003-12-10", "grade": null}
