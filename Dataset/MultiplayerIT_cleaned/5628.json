But football and video game fans can experience all the excitement of the matches of that tournament right now, thanks to a special free DLC released by Konami for its Pro Evolution Soccer 16. This package, in fact, on the one hand contains the update of the squads of all the teams present in the video game, plus new faces, the shirts of various European and South American clubs , including Udinese, Empoli, FC Groningen, Espanyol and Flamengo, boots such as NIKE's Hypervenom Phantom II, Hypervenom Phantom II NJR, PUMA evoSPEED SL and PARA Mexico Lite 15 HG JP, or the official balls of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA EURO 2016. On the other hand, it also proposes all or almost all those elements that will form the basis and outline of the event that will take place in France this summer, a country that has already hosted two editions of the event in the past, respectively in 1960 and 1984 But let's proceed in order. UEFA EURO 2016 brings all the charm of the European Football Nations Championship to our screens Curiosity UEFA EURO 2016 is available for free as DLC for all owners of an original copy of PES 2016. A sort of stand-alone edition of the year of the game will arrive at the end of April, exclusive to PlayStation, featuring Gareth Bale on the cover, and including the package on the European football championship, all the new additions with the various DLCs and in addition some bonuses for the MyClub. Methods, licenses, stages and groups The update published on 24 March is therefore characterized above all by the UEFA EURO 2016 content, which in this way adds 16 new licensed national teams to Pro Evolution Soccer, the graphic elements of the tournament of the same name, as well as the mode and the official ball of the event . In addition, the stadium where the final will take place, the Stade de France, is introduced. However, only fifteen of the twenty-four football teams participating in the tournament are fully covered by an official licence: these are Germany, Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Northern Ireland, Albania and Wales, while those of England, France, Croatia, Turkey and Portugal, not to our disappointment, will be released via free DLC before the start of EURO 2016. Russia, Poland, Belgium, Ireland, Sweden, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Switzerland, however, will not they have official jerseys and logos. The UEFA EURO 2016 competition has also been updated in its structure, which in this 2016 edition, with the expansion to twenty-four participants for the final phase, includes six elimination rounds instead of the usual four, the introduction of the round of 16 in the direct elimination, and direct qualification to the round of 16 for the top two, with repechage of the four best third places. Once you enter the UEFA EURO 2016 mode, you are greeted by a series of colorful menus, specially recreated using the competition's logos and graphics. As with the others, here it is possible to choose teams, schemes and formations, set the game options as you like and once you have selected your favorite national team, launch yourself into the heart of the tournament. And it's just as soon as you enter the field that you can appreciate the work done by Konami: the Fox Engine reconfirms itself as excellent in managing every detail of the race event, which is reproduced quite well apart from a few small flaws in certain surrounding elements. thanks also to a television-style direction. The latter shows in the mode under examination a series of screens and statistics not unlike those that will accompany the real cup matches on TV in the summer, which helps to recreate the atmosphere of a real match in the best possible way. The entry into the field of the teams is accompanied by a myriad of colored confetti, by the chants and choreographies of the fans in the stands, ready to support the national anthems and then in the following ninety minutes and beyond the team of the heart. The close-ups of the players who, on the notes of the various musical marches of their country, arrange themselves side by side, the flashes of the photographers, the updated shirts of the national teams complete with the official logo of the cup, the dynamic lights, nothing seems left to chance to give back to users the atmosphere that will be breathed on the turf of UEFA EURO 2016. Among other things, the polygonal models of many athletes seem to have been slightly retouched and improved both in terms of proportions and for the similarity with the real counterparts. In this sense, one hundred and ninety-nine new faces have been reproduced for as many players (Gareth Bale, Andriy Yarmolenko, Ilkay Gundogan, just to name a few), and even the existing ones appear more defined as regards the meticulous reproduction of details such as hair, beard and accessories, as well as for the realistic skin tone. Technical aspects and realism on the pitch But the innovations that arrive together with the new competition, albeit sensitive, do not only concern the visual aspect of UEFA EURO 2016: in fact, the update of the statistics on the state of form of all the athletes in relation to the their latest real performance, and the usual Player ID technology. In this way, during the match, you can see a perfect reproduction of the movements and technical characteristics of the most famous players. As always, these can count on animations, even ball and chain, which are very natural even in changes of direction and in shots, especially compared to those who do not enjoy the same treatment, who instead from this point of view still appear a bit stiff in certain movements. Luckily, at least at the higher difficulty levels, their individual artificial intelligence works quite well, especially if combined with team intelligence, managed as always by Team ID, the system that allows virtual eleven to operate with greater variety in the composition and construction of an action, and to move and act like its real-life counterpart. In attack you can see intelligent movements and functional overlaps to the scheme adopted, while in the coverage phases the defenders almost always react convincingly to dangerous situations. Everything doesn't always work properly (the physicality of some athletes is still predominant in the resolution in their favor of the contrasts), but despite this, the playability is overall pleasant. In any case, a further degree of realism to further immerse the gamer in the atmosphere of the competition is guaranteed by the audio sector which during the actual race boasts chants, whistles of disappointment or roars to accompany every single action that takes place on the field. The only flaw, perhaps, is the lack of variety in the songs for the national teams. Some news instead for the commentary by Fabio Caressa and Luca Marchegiani, which obviously remains basically that of Pro Evolution Soccer 16, but which is enriched by some ad hoc comments for UEFA EURO 2016. Our ~older~ readers will remember that many years ago several versions of PES/Winning Eleven came out on PlayStation 2, especially for the Asian market, and often between one and the other, even after a few months, behind imaginative wordings like Final Evolution and a content package apparently the same as the predecessor, small but important gameplay changes were hidden. Of those who maybe didn't immediately catch the eye, especially the less trained ones, but who were in fact present and became more and more perceptible game after game. Well, this situation does not occur in UEFA EURO 2016, given that after several challenges we have not found any changes to the gameplay of Pro Evolution Soccer 16. But who knows if Konami does not intervene in this sense with some refinements for the retail version of the game, waiting for next month. In any case, the playability of UEFA EURO 2016, net of a few binaries, as mentioned before, is at good levels, managing to somehow return, pad in hand, good sensations from a simulation point of view, especially if you use , or largely, the manual settings. Ultimately a good DLC, which apart from being free, is worth getting for the technical updates and for the new mode. And then you want to add the pleasure of leading the Italian national team to the final in Paris?", "date": "2016-03-26", "grade": null}
