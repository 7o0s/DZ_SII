{"name": "Round 1: Fight!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/75520-street-fighter-iv-round-1-fight.html", "text": "Street Fighter IV is first of all a heartening product, the proven proof that it is possible to make a ~premium~ game for the iPhone, if the limited cost of 7.99 euros can be defined as such, without this being a car title or some ~freely inspired~ product by GameLoft. It's doubly heartening, to be honest, as the Capcom's nobleman manages to successfully perform a reverse double pike that is difficult to think of on paper but beautifully executed in practice, with only a few sketches lifted from the body of water on the finish. The fundamentalists of the series and of the 2D fighting games can all stop reading now, this project can definitely not pluck their strings, while all the others, enthusiasts and not, will find a valid port of what is appreciated on consoles. Small but bad Eight fighters available to the user - Ryu, Ken, Bison, Chun-Li, Blanka, Guile, Dhalsim and Abel - for a roster that focuses on the mix of inevitable characters with others able to give a little variety to the action, despite some choices and therefore shortcomings are felt, Sagat and Balrog above all. The skimming compared to the selection that can be made in the other versions is to be found, obviously, in the desire to take the best that could be adapted to a control system based on a stick and four virtual keys, with the first rather generous in size and the seconds smaller in number but sufficient to guarantee an experience of good complexity: punch and kick are present with a single button each, leaving the task of Focus and Special to the others. The combat system is successful overall and the choice to combine the classic execution of the special moves with another one, simplified to meet both novices and the lack of physical controls, does not allow this Street Fighter IV to enter the olympus of competitive games but, much more important, it still manages to recreate the complex ballet that every 2D fighting game stages, with the primary attention of each player aimed at controlling the spaces and knowing the right strategy to respond to the opponent's initiatives. The amount of options made available by Capcom is more than decent and if it weren't for the presence of multiplayer only locally, via bluetooth, there really wouldn't be anything to complain about: the usual tournament with its four difficulty levels won't be missing to entertain for a long time despite the fact that there are no characters or bonuses that can be unlocked over time, while among the backup modes, the Dojo is the best show of itself, with its lessons designed to introduce the main concepts of the game - even advanced ones, such as crosses up - and this iteration specifically. The controls respond quite well and being able to arrange them at will on the screen, also selecting the level of transparency, is an addition that somehow limits the possible annoyance due to the double attention to be paid to what happens on the battlefield and to the positioning of the fingers , which especially at the beginning can be found out of reach of sticks and keys. Graphically, the three-dimensional models of the fighters have been replaced by sprites of excellent quality and perfectly animated, for a result that, also thanks to the good backdrops, is very close to its next-gen counterparts, albeit with the necessary proportions. Several effects are missing and the Ultras are not the same as the original show, but all in all the best possible result seems to have been achieved and, on the iPhone 3GS used for the test, the game runs fairly fluid. The tested version is 1.00.00 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-16", "grade": "8.5"}
