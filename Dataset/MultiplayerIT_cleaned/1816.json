This title is an incredible concentrate of markedly Yankee stereotypes, a hymn to exaggeration and self-harm. You are catapulted into this atmosphere right from the adrenaline-pumping presentation, complete with pilots exalted by the strong slang language and video clips of acrobatic evolutions, and you understand its essence by admiring the numerous range of disastrous falls with which our brave heroes are provided From the main menu (which sees fire and flames as protagonists, elements that distinguish the game in all its parts) you can access the usual game modes: Circuit (a sort of career that represents the fulcrum of the game), the classic Single Race (to be played mainly in multiplayer thanks to the split-screen), Freestyle (where the goal is to accumulate as many points as possible by performing tricks) and finally Freeride, where you can practice and learn the most useful shortcuts to use in other modes or where to improve your records. Graphically the title looks very good. The sensation of speed is excellently rendered, thanks also to the 60 frames per second that characterize it in any type of situation and the resulting fluidity. The textures, although not excellent, remain on a sufficient level, while the panorama that can be admired during the most daring jumps is striking, which reveals how much the SSX polygonal engine has been optimized. The only graphic defect that can be found is a slight flickering which manifests itself as a trembling of the elements of the seabed. The audio sector is subdued (excuse the pun), characterized almost exclusively by rock tracks which, although they adapt perfectly to the type of atmosphere that the game reproduces, can be tiring in the long run. The sound effects are also average, among which a not exactly spot-on engine roar stands out. To underline the most agitated phases of the match, the usual speaker takes care of it, generous in giving comments on the player's performance. Super Sick Trick! Excellently implemented the control system of our vehicle. Although the first games may seem like a continuous exhibition of rider falls, with a little practice the controls turn out to be punctual, precise and, ultimately, make the motorcycles decidedly controllable. Fortunately, landing on rocky surfaces or, more generally, unrelated to the actual circuit does not coincide a priori with a flight to the ground and consequent loss of time, a choice probably adopted by the programmers to compensate for the high difficulty of the title. The execution of tricks is not purely accessory, but it is the key element on which the gameplay of the EA Big product is based: by managing to complete a stunt, in fact, the ~boost~ is increased by which the speed of our motorcycle and, consequently, make him perform higher jumps and even more articulated stunts, possibly connected to form a sort of combo. The stunts are also essential for completing the Freekout Meter thanks to which you can perform a further special trick that sends the our pilot, in fact, in Freekout, a ~super turbo~ with a special effect similar to the Bullet Time already seen in the Matrix. Through the Circuit mode, the true heart of the game, it is possible to unlock new circuits and new characters, each equipped with different motorbikes and uniforms. With the bonus points acquired, you can also improve the characteristics of your driver in order to adapt him to your driving skills and to be able to face even the most demanding challenges. However, there are some flaws that undermine a title that, up to now, seemed to have mainly positive aspects and that diminish its final enjoyment. First of all, the excessive duration of the races. In fact, the circuits are decidedly long, exaggeratedly long, so much so that the time required to complete a track reaches up to seven minutes. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence of the opposing drivers is regulated in a questionable way, so as to prevent them from being considerably outdistanced despite clean and impeccable driving. Given the length of the tracks and the poorly calibrated difficulty, it can easily be deduced that a single mistake at the end of the last lap can be fatal, frustrating even the most shrewd player's efforts and inviting him to use the game disc as a kind of frisbee. especially in races where finishing first is imperative. Comment The initial idea was excellent. The universe of motocross, in fact, adapts perfectly to the styleand arcade game adopted, but some flaws in game design such as the AI of the opponents, the excessive duration of each single race and more generally the too high difficulty will end up making even the most experienced player give up. And this is definitely a shame given the care with which the product has been packaged, especially in the graphics and pure gameplay department. To all this, it should be added that Freekstyle does not represent anything significantly innovative compared to SSX. Ultimately, this game is recommended for lovers of the genre and for those with infinite patience. Pros + Excellent technical realization + Well studied and calibrated control system + Exhilarating in multiplayer Cons - Poorly calibrated difficulty - Excessively long tracks - Accumulating a considerable advantage over your opponents is quite difficult Freekstyle is included in the list of ~SSX~ games, i.e. arcade driving games based on the execution of stunts with the aim of increasing the ~boost~ degree, allowing your vehicle to reach very high speeds; after the snowboards of SSX and the snowmobiles of Sled Storm, this time we are called to maneuver the bombastic motocross bikes.", "date": "2003-01-11", "grade": null}
