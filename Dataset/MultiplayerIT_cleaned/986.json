At this address you can find the complete version in streaming and in high resolution, dedicated to Premium Gold subscribers. We have all acclaimed The Sims 2 as the new miracle in the field of simulation. The data confirms it, the flagship title of the Maxis division in EA has managed to break through even the rosiest sales projections in a few months. A success in every sense that could not but be followed closely by the inevitable expansions that had given the first chapter of the saga a record also in this respect, in fact there had never been so many expansions for a single title. As we write this article we already know that MAxis is working on a new expansion whose release has been scheduled for next fall, in compliance with the project to churn out expansions at the rate of one every semester. Anyone in da house? But let's get to the point and let's go into the analysis by taking advantage of the new features offered by this title full of surprises. The Sims 2: University throws us into the middle of the campus life so praised by famous blockbuster films. What we happy inhabitants of the Bel Paese lack to fully understand the philosophy of life of an overseas college is precisely the absolute lack of similar experiences within our borders. The typical American university offers students the possibility of living away from home in a village that lives for the purpose of the university, making facilities of all kinds available to students and professors, from those more purely related to study to areas dedicated to entertainment and leisure. Another myth of the American college is the fraternity, a veritable triumph of student autonomy, often referred to as a totem of goliardic philosophy. Who can forget the absurd house of the Alpha Tau Chi occupied by Bluto Blutarsky, aka the late John Belushi, in the legendary film Animal House. In the collective imagination of us Italians, therefore, this myth of university life based on parties, alcohol, women and toga parties remains (the famous parties in which one participates strictly dressed in Roman toga, brought to glory by the same film mentioned above) . University offers the possibility of enriching the already fantastic experience offered by The Sims 2 with this interesting aspect of the life of a young Sim, in full compliance, however, with the rules imposed by the ~politically correct~. University life, all roses and flowers? Once the expansion is installed, we will immediately notice that the main game remains practically unchanged in terms of aesthetics. However, once the map relating to one of the cities is open, it will be possible to access the area dedicated to the university campus, which in a nutshell consists of an independent map uniquely connected to that of the main city. Choosing the university category closest to our tastes (three different types of universities are available, but it is also possible to create your own totally personalized ones), the time comes to create the cheerful company of students that we will have to control, or to choose one among those already available on the map, and finally place them in one of the dormitory houses, which from that moment will become the scene of our adventures. One of the revolutionary features of The Sims 2 was the implementation of the age factor, which changed the appearance and needs of the characters. University creates a niche in this reality by expanding in a certain sense one of the age groups already present in the original title. University students therefore belong to the category of ~Young Adults~, during this phase, which lasts about four years (i.e. the average duration of a degree course), the temporal parameters that up to now marked the passage of a range of age and the other are replaced by the progress of our Sims' studies, who will thus have to deal with the deadlines dictated by the exam sessions in order not to be rejected by the university and thus have to return to everyday life. Among the innumerable new actions introduced in this title we find the possibility of having our Sims carry out tasks. Doing homework is essential not only to increase your level of preparation for the semester exam, but it is also one of the safest ways to receive money from the university subsidy. There are other opportunities for a young student Sim to earn some decent money, such as learning to play a rock instrument (a new skill introduced in this expansion) and performing in front ofto friends, who generously will give ever higher tips based on the quality of the songs played, or it is possible to find a job in one of the public buildings of the campus, perhaps as a cook at a fast food restaurant or as a waiter in a cafeteria. The study It's a job! The work is here replaced by the choice of the university course. A freshman will thus have the possibility to choose the direction of his studies, thus laying the foundations for his future as an adult Sim. In fact, the choice of study subject affects the Sim's job prospects once the four years of university have been completed and returned to everyday life. The courses available are many and varied, and each of them require specific studies and the care of particular skills in order to obtain the degree; among them we find Psychology, Drama, Art, Philosophy, Biology, Economics, Literature, Mathematics, History, Physics and Political Science. Remaining in terms of occupation, it is worth remembering that this expansion adds four new jobs that add to those already present in the main title; Graduated Sims will in fact be able to access a career in the Paranormal, Entertainment, Art and Naturalistic fields. A logarithm says to an exponential: It's time for you to integrate! The ability to aggregate has risen to a fundamental role in the game, so much so that an indicator of influence on other Sims has appeared next to the aspiration bar, indicating popularity among friends and acquaintances. The higher the popularity, the greater the possibility of being able to convince the other characters to perform actions at our suggestion. This completely innovative aspect fits perfectly into the typical climate of a highly ~social~ environment such as the one represented by the campus, where the influence on other people plays a decisive role in relationships. Parallel to the weight given in the original title, where the number of friendships is essential to access the tier levels of the career, at the university the Sims can use their knowledge to exercise powers over those around them and, for example, convince their friends to carry out more thankless tasks in our place. Therefore, the wishes related to aspirations (in this case in the purely university context) are accompanied by the wishes related to influence, such as creating increasingly popular parties or getting noticed for the achievement of ever more ambitious goals. Just as with the points accumulated for aspiration wishes, which allow you to buy special items (such as the ~money plant~), the points earned with influence wishes are spent on persuading other characters. Like every young person in the real world, our student Sims also have a secret dream, represented by a wish chosen randomly based on their life aspiration, precisely called a life wish; once this wish is fulfilled, the aspiration bar will reach the platinum level and will remain in this state forever. The difficult coexistence University Sims have at their disposal three different categories of accommodation. The cheapest and most versatile are the dormitories, which however limit the unbridled freedom of the most enterprising Sims. The next step, and more expensive, is that of the private residence, equivalent to the house in the main game, in which, however, it will be possible to choose the cohabitants, perhaps removing those less compatible with the tastes of one's characters. A greater availability of funds can even allow you to live alone, in total freedom. The last chance is that of the University Clubs, the fraternities so well known through the films we mentioned above, the right compromise between economic convenience and aggregation opportunities; to access a university club, however, it will be necessary to have good knowledge and to enter into the good graces of the students who are already part of it. Objects and wardrobes have been renovated for the occasion to faithfully reproduce the typical climate of the university environment. So make way for banners of the favorite team to hang on the walls of the rooms or objects dedicated to moments of aggregation, such as the vending machine for drinks (strictly non-alcoholic in compliance with the politically correct, so fashionable in the states) or the bubble machine (which in all and for everything it brings to mind a calumet of ~hemp~ memory, but which is only able to supply soap bubbles with controversial ~exhilarating~ effects). Much more trendy and captivating clothing also makes its entrance, much closer to the tastes of a student, as well as extremely youthful hairstyles and transgressive tattoos. They are not missingstrange objects, in full Maxis style, such as the much acclaimed cow-plant, a horrendous laboratory mutation capable of engulfing Sims less attentive to its care. The new objects are related to the numerous new actions present among the behavioral options of the Sims, many of which revolve around decidedly goliardic modalities. Thus, once a fire sprinkler is installed, which could save the life of a careless student several times over, it is also possible to activate the jet of water simply by lighting a lighter under it, or perhaps limit oneself to more innocent pranks, such as triggering a water balloon warfare. Maxis, I love you! Running towards the end of the article, it is worth remembering that, although great strides have not been made from a technical point of view (apart from a slight tweak to the rendering of the characters), this expansion has the advantage of giving increased longevity to the game, fitting perfectly into the continuity of the original title. Enhanced soundtrack, signed by the always very valid Mark Mothersbaugh, complete with pop songs sung in the now popular language of the Sims (obviously incomprehensible, but full of non-verbal meaning), frames a general enrichment that can only bring new honors to one of the most prolific divisions of EA. However, a certain increase in the level of difficulty represented by the innumerable new actions and parameters to be constantly monitored is to be noted, but in the end who ever said that staying at university could prove to be a grind? The new aspects of the management of the social life of the Sims, combined with the new perspectives on the working career and the numerous features introduced make us clearly understand that we are once again faced with a must, who believed that nothing could be obtained from The Sims 2 else will have to change his mind, we have already done it. Comment Difficult to find a vote that can fit perfectly with a title of this caliber. The vote of this expansion fails to reach the original title by a single decimanle point only because it is not possible to overshadow the quality level of the main game, but we would still like to give honor to glory to this product which, after all, is almost a game of stands alone. Congratulations again Uncle Will. Pros: Many new activities for our Sims Exhilarating as always Reached considerable maturity in relational modes Cons: So many things to do and so little time! The space required for the installation and the hardware demands are starting to be impressive Complementary filmography For once we allow ourselves the luxury of diverting your attention for a few moments to a complementary topic to the video game: cinema. These two branches of entertainment often share a lot, drawing heavily from each other; for this to fully understand the spirit that pervades The Sims 2: University it is necessary that we stop for a moment to talk about one of the films that have contributed most to creating the myth of ~campus life~, thus resurrecting a must of the comedy-demented genre. We are talking about Animal House (aka National Lampoon Animal House) a film born from the brilliant and fervent mind of John Landis, in which an amazing and much lamented John Belushi appears, in the part of the anti-model student par excellence. This film, which you can find in our online shop in the brand new DVD version (VM14!), is certainly the best representative of its genre, progenitor of a whole generation of demented films set in colleges, as well as the putative father of the myth of the ~Toga Party~. [C] The mythical ~Delta Tau Chi~ brotherhood of Animal House [/C] The Official Strategy Guide Multiplayer.it is currently publishing the Official Strategy Guide of The Sims 2 University, a 120-page color volume dedicated to all the secrets and features of the most amusing expansion of the year. The book follows the previous Guide dedicated to The Sims 2 by a few months. Both can be purchased online and in videogame stores at the price of 14.90 each.", "date": "2005-03-30", "grade": null}
