Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent. How many things can you do in a minute? The idea behind Bejeweled Blitz is clear: to offer extraordinarily fast and effective entertainment, usable in just sixty seconds ... even if, in reality, the PopCap Games action puzzle will steal a much greater amount of time, transforming at certain moments into a sort of videogame drug. But let's go in order. Virtually everyone knows the Bejeweled franchise: it was born in 2001 on PC and Mac, and immediately conquered a substantial slice of users, fascinated by its incredibly simple but engaging mechanics. There are few rules of the game: on a board made up of sixty-four boxes, you have the possibility of ~replacing~ two adjacent gems so that one or both go to combine with two or more objects of the same type, giving rise to an elimination and, thus, to the ~falling~ of new stones. Of course, the more elements are eliminated at the same time the more points are earned, a concept that over the years has been elaborated in various ways and which in this latest incarnation of the series translates into the production of ~explosive~ gems, multipliers score and so on. Bejeweled Blitz actually stands as an extreme of these ideas, given that the sixty-second limit imposes an uncommon speed and readiness, which in combination with a pinch of luck can help us establish a new record and make the envy your friends on Facebook, a social network with which the application synchronizes transparently but sometimes a little slow (and the uploads between one game and another suffer from this). Come on, tap here The mechanics that have always characterized the classic Bejeweled, as mentioned, are enriched in this new version of the game by the introduction of a series of variables and by an ~economic~ system which, as per tradition, winks at microtransactions. Don't be fooled, though: it's only a possibility, because Bejeweled Blitz can be downloaded from the App Store and played completely free of charge. without limitations and without substantial disadvantages compared to those who decide to dip into their wallets to purchase a hoard of coins. But what are the coins for? With each game we earn a certain amount and we can spend it to increase our chances of reaching a high score, by ~purchasing~ for a limited period of time a five-second extension, an extra command to explode special gems, a gem random extra, a ~shake~ or a multiplier gem. Luck undoubtedly weighs on the final result and it may happen that you score the best scores without using any bonuses but simply thanks to a favorable initial configuration of the board, while on the other hand the practice of spending many coins for upgrades may be made useless by less obvious combinations to our eyes and from a slower development of the ~stint~. In sixty seconds you don't have much time to stop and think, and in fact after a few moments the game automatically suggests a possible pairing, or we can ask for one by pressing the ~hint~ button at the bottom right. And if the graphics prove to be purely functional to the action, for once we have to applaud the musical accompaniment, really spot on and engaging.", "date": "2012-04-21", "grade": "8.5"}
