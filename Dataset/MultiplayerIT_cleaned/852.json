{"name": "Pro Cycling Manager - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-cycling-manager-recensione.html", "text": "When cycling means spending hours in front of a desk It's been a long time since a bicycle and a lot of desire were enough to be a cyclist... Today everything is pushed to the extreme, hours are lost viewing heart rate graphs in relation to the slope of the route, organizing training sessions, counting every single calorie in the diet, so much so that it's actually almost more time spent in front of paperwork (or the screen) than what is spent on the saddle. Fortunately, PCM does not go to these extremes, but it does not deviate too much either. If in the past edition there had been some complaints about the importance of the managerial component in the game, this time Cyanide has worked hard to dissect every single aspect of the activity of the manager of a cycling team and render it in the most likely way. But let's go in order Usually, it is expected that the procedures for starting a game are just a useless waste of time, put there only for beauty. It is therefore a surprise to be faced with a screen that recalls in a more simplified way that of role-playing games in which we are asked to distribute points to our skills as sports directors, with the possibility of accumulating experience points to spend by continuing in the game to improve them. The actual usefulness of these skills is still rather obscure, apart from the financial one that allows you to speed up the procedures for hiring free riders. Once the construction of our alter ego is complete, we must select the team to lead. Then the focus shifts to the first novelty of PCM: the definition of roles within the team. The choice is not easy at all, because each modification will be judged not only by the cyclist concerned, but also by his teammates, and this will affect their morale, an essential component for obtaining good results. When cycling means spending hours in front of a desk And we've finally come to the familiar news screen, which takes us into the actual game. First of all, as in any self-respecting sports manager, it is good practice to take an in-depth look at the 'roster', the squad of the team. Each cyclist is represented by a good number of characteristics which indicate his propensity for the various terrains and aspects of cycling. So if we want to choose the best formation to face the Giro d'Italia or the Tour de France we will have to make sure we bring with us riders skilled in the mountains and endowed with a great ability to recover from fatigue, but who also know how to juggle the stages at stopwatch; we must also not forget a couple of sprinters for the stages that will end in the sprint. If, on the other hand, we are preparing to face the Paris-Rubaix, we would do better to focus exclusively on those who do well on the cobblestones (for those not accustomed to the term, it indicates the streets paved with stone or cobblestones). Obviously we may also find ourselves faced with a lack in some sectors, or more simply we may want to strengthen the team, in which case we will have to look for whoever is right for us and try to buy him from his current team, or, if he were free , hire him directly. In CyM4 the cycle market was more like a lottery in which blind offers were made hoping to satisfy the interlocutor. This time however, as it should be, the other team will inform us of the amount they want to let the rider go (provided they are willing to sell him); pity, however, that it is not possible to bargain. The offer of the contract to the cyclist, on the other hand, is truly atypical for a manager, even if very similar to reality. In fact, first we will be informed of when he will be available to discuss our offer then, when the day of the appointment arrives, we will have to agree with him on three aspects (the monthly salary, the duration of the contract and his role in the team) within a limited period of time, but being careful not to go too far with attempts, because each refusal will cost us some of the precious time, after which the offer will be rejected. Even if we will satisfy all your requests, however this could take more time to reflect on the offer making us wait weeks waiting for the signature. When cycling means spending hours in front of a desk There are just many other things that need our attention as managers: the choice of staff (not particularly careful and of little importance to the game), applying for new sponsorships, buying equipment, and looking for young talents. Also in the latter case it is nothingparticularly innovative (the region is chosen and the scout is sent) and the budding champions discovered in this way are nothing overwhelming, so much so that almost always 3-4 years of training at maximum intensity would be needed to make them really good runners. We were talking about training Cyanide rightly preferred to leave the training system unchanged, perhaps not too realistic, but certainly the most comfortable and effective around: simply choose the type of training and set the priority between form (to improve of the cyclist in view of a race) and increase (to improve the characteristics). To this must be added the 'peaks of form' which allow to increase the physical condition of the athlete for a short period, therefore we must choose with the utmost care the periods in which to program the two peaks of form which are allowed within a season. Training a runner in order to improve his characteristics is a long process, but there is the possibility of increasing one for a few weeks by sending him to a training camp in specific locations. During the retreat period, unlike in the past edition, we will decide the intensity of the training ourselves: the more intense it is, the more results (i.e. bonus points) we will obtain, but only a runner in excellent shape will be able to sustain the training more intense and thus obtain the benefits. Just as there are training camps for the most important characteristics, there are also training camps to improve fitness (those for pre-season preparation) and to recover race points, which represent the number of days a rider can spend in a race, and are therefore fundamental to extend the season. Currently (i.e. patch 1.4A) there is an annoying bug that prevents more than 29 riders from being displayed on the screen for selecting who to send to the training camp, and this severely penalizes those who have a very large team, especially for 'free time' training camps which allow you to recover the race points. When cycling means spending hours in front of a desk If fitness is a key aspect of a cyclist's performance, so is morale: a depressed rider will go nowhere! Form and morale are two subjective concepts, difficult to define precisely, so Cyanide decided to hide them from the player, and only allow him to get an idea by talking directly with team members. To do this, we will have a simple screen available that will allow us to ask some questions through which we will be able to get a rough idea of the runner's form, or ask him if he is interested in participating in any specific race for the future, in which case our favorable response might improve morale, while a negative one might make it worse. Cute, even if one gets the impression that the cyclists (those in the game, of course) behave like spoiled children who stamp their feet if you don't please them and wholly deaf to the needs and organization of the team. This finally brings us to the last of our duties as general manager: defining the calendar for the season. The situation changes drastically if the team we are leading is part of the Pro Tour or the Continental Tour (see box), in any case the principle is always the same: when we get close to the start of a classic or a lap we can request of enrollment. If there are still vacancies and if our score in the international ranking is high enough, then our application will be accepted. In the case of the most important races and laps, however, this will not be enough, and we will have to submit a regular request to obtain one of the few Wild Cards available. Pro Tour (rules change) In the past it has happened that some important races have been shamefully snubbed by the most important teams because they had planned the season differently. In recent years this habit has spread like wildfire to the point of threatening some historic races to the advantage of others organized in more favorable periods or with more substantial prizes. To nip this trend in the bud, the international cycling federation has completely changed the regulation, forcing the teams that were in the most important category (which has been called Pro Tour, hence the international name of the game) to participate in certain specific races with own team. To be more precise: the most important races (including the Giro, the Tour and the Vuelta) have 18 seats out of the 20 available reserved for Pro Tour teams and only 2 and Wild Cards are available. For this reason, if a team also wants to participate only to une of these races without risking being ousted, she has to make sure she is part of this group of teams and, as a result, is forced to submit her riders to all the other important races of the season. On board the flagship Now that we have finished organizing everything and have chosen the races to participate in in the immediate future, the time has come to verify if our cyclists are really capable of riding a bicycle as their characteristics would have us believe. As was said at the beginning, the setting of the races is purely strategic: the cyclists are represented in 3D and framed by a camera that we can move as we please. Much more importantly, however, we can set the speed, so as not to waste time in calmer situations, or pause, to unravel the more agitated ones. The setting is completely similar to the previous version, only that a large number of functions have been added which make the control of the runners more precise and comfortable. The main commands allow you to assign basic commands, such as stay in a group, sprint, counterattack, sprint and stay on the wheel (only when approaching a finish line). Through the panels on the left we can check the conditions of our cyclists, the heart rate, the energy left and the level of fatigue. However, these panels can be replaced by others that allow for more advanced functions, useful for ordering one of our team members to cover a teammate so as to make him tire less (useful for sprinters if a sprint finish is expected, or for captains if they will be the ones to animate the race) or to set the attitude to keep in the sprint and check the energy that is left for the sprint. But what excites most in 3D racing is the unpredictability that the programmers have managed to achieve. You can play the same stage dozens of times, yet it will never play out the same way. There may be similarities due to the limited number of ~big~ players involved, but their actions will also be different from time to time. The sprints are also excellent, finally becoming realistic. Now it becomes very important to know the concept of ~train~ to launch a sprint and learn to apply it in the mechanics of the game in order to put your sprinter in the best possible conditions to win. Also improved the time trial stages, in which it is essential to always check the heart rate in order not to burst the runners. The ~chronoscalate~ (uphill time trial stages) are still a bit tricky, but in general what is always indispensable in this type of race is good tactics and great precision. The ~race vision~ is in fact the fundamental element to do well (exactly like in reality): if you miss the right moment or give the wrong command, you have lost a good part of the chances of victory. Technically Speaking PCM has made great strides compared to the previous edition. The graphics are much improved: the detail, not only of the cyclists, but also of the landscape, is very high, and the animations are fluid. Unfortunately, however, precisely for this reason, the game is particularly demanding from the point of view of the minimum requirements. We take the opportunity to give a warning about the minimum requirements: those indicated on the box are far below reality, especially as regards the video card (you need one with 126Mb of RAM to play decently), in fact if you try to play only with the minimum requirements, the game takes ages to load the stages and during the stages it jerks even with the minimum details. So be careful! The music has been entirely replaced from the previous version, but it's nothing special. It is possible, as in the past, to add your own songs to the soundtrack by copying them into the relative directory, but the game's internal player only supports .ogg files, and programs to convert audio files to .ogg are hard to find compared to very common converters for .mp3. The commentary is slightly better than last year's, mainly thanks to the fact that the most famous riders (Armstrong, Basso, Cunego, Ullrich, Valverde, etc) are recognized and called by their name when they perform an action worthy of Note. What's really wrong is the staggering number of bugs that are still present in the game. In a month and a half since its release, 8 patches have been released (1.1R, 1.2B, 1.2C, 1.2R, 1.3B, 1.3C, 1.3R and 1.4A; those indicated by the letter ~R~ are the official ones, the others are beta) of over 25Mb (each of which fortunately also contains the changes of the previous ones). Despite this, there are still fi", "date": "2005-08-29", "grade": null}
