Developed by the guys at Spiderweb Software and already landed on PC and Mac OS X a few months ago, this classic RPG seems to have remained stuck in the early 90s, leaving aside most of the evolutions that have covered the genre in the last 20 years. It's a raw role-playing game, with great references not only visual to the very first BioWare titles, above all Baldur's Gate, and which will keep you busy for no less than 30 hours provided you manage to digest all the peculiarities of its gameplay . For many? Definitely not for everyone! From an atmosphere and lore point of view, the work done by Spiderweb is certainly interesting even if not particularly original. We are on the continent of Lynaeus, in the middle of the classic fantasy Middle Ages and two factions are at war. On the one hand a series of desolate territories belonging to an old empire now in disintegration rich in warmongering barbarians, the Farlands, on the other the Pact, an agreement between five neighboring nations with the aim of keeping the neighboring invaders at bay. To manage this alliance and ensure that it is respected there is the black fortress of Avadon, a huge castle governed by the mysterious and ruthless King Redbeard who uses the help of a small circle of elected men called the Hearts, the Eyes and the Hands. The game opens with your protagonist being invited to the fortress to be invested with the office of Mano with the precise task of traversing the nations of the Pact to keep at bay any insurrections, conspiracies to power and more generally maintain the subtle regime of terror which seems to be the only thing capable of holding up the fragile alliance. Obviously in the long adventure there will be a handful of moral dilemmas that you will have to face and by delving into the lore that makes up the game you will discover that Redbeard and Avadon are not exactly frowned upon and a large part of the population's requests are suffocated in blood. But we don't want to reveal other details to you, it is enough to know that the narrative component in the game is predominant and sometimes even difficult to follow. Avadon: The Black Fortress in fact submerges the player with thousands of lines of text, real walls of words (all strictly in English, since the game is not localized in our language) that you will necessarily have to read to understand something of what is going on. happening in the world. Every quest but above all every dialogue with the dozens of non-player characters you will meet will force you to read for most of your playing time and, unless you are a great lover of old-style RPGs, this could soon bore you, especially considering the fact that the iPad is not exactly suitable for reading small white texts on gray backgrounds. Among other things, the narrative component already seems to highlight what is the main problem of the title: the minimal work of adaptation to the Apple device done by the developer during the conversion phase. Dialogue with NPCs and see the various answers listed numerically without any kind of feedback during the selection phase, immediately suggests the previous control via mouse pointer or through keyboard numbers. The game structure If it was still not clear from what is written or even just by looking at the images, Avadon: The Black Fortress is a classic RPG with an isometric view. The game action takes place in real time until you get involved in a fight. When this happens, the gameplay becomes turn-based forcing the player to manage his characters juggling between movements, attacks and special abilities, with the visual aid of a squared grid that offers indications on the space occupied by each character and enemy. And obviously what role-playing game would Avadon be without the usual and rather archaic, to be honest, management of the protagonist and supporting actors? At the beginning of the game we are given the possibility to select the class to which our avatar belongs among the four available. We will therefore find the classic armored tank, the Blademaster, a sort of thief fairly protected from the point of view of the armor, the Shadowwalker, the sorceress all damage and little protection, the Sorceress, and finally a hybrid between a healer and a medium damage dealer, the Shaman. It will not be possible personally your character from an aesthetic point of view (even the gender is blocked) while advancing in level it will be possible to spend points in the classic statistics of strength, dexterity, intelligence and resistance and unlock a series of skills, each with multiple levels of enhancement, all inside a rather simplified classic tree structure. The management is total and complete also as regards the companions that we will take with us during our adventure: it will be possible to have two belonging to the classes described above. Inventory management is also quite standard with a bag made up of 35 spaces that can be occupied by collected items (we will still have one per character) and 12 different slots on each fighter to equip what has been collected. If on paper all this goodness is rather tempting and promising, its practical realization collides with the approximate work done by the developer in the conversion phase. The game interface is in fact sparse and not very intuitive and in some situations it is even uncomfortable to use with the touch. For example, to see the stats of an item or how a skill works, you need to hold your finger down on the items in question. The problem is that the pop-up with the information appears right under the touched area, forcing the player to constantly move his finger to see what is written underneath, without however moving it excessively, otherwise he will select another object or magic, thanks to the reduced size of on-screen elements. And as if that weren't enough, the game doesn't offer a real loot screen nor does it allow you to collect items directly from the game screen. Instead, it is necessary to open the inventory every time to see what is on the ground in the immediate vicinity and it is not exactly pleasant to repeat the operation every time an enemy dies. Technically the title is literally reduced to a minimum. From a graphic point of view there is little that can amaze: the isometric view returns a rather flat and quite sparse scenario thanks to an artistic direction that is certainly varied but which clashes with the lack of details of a rather dated engine. There are no animations of the characters just to be clear and the protagonist with his adventure companions do not reflect the changes of equipment: they will always remain dressed in the same way from start to finish. There is no doubt that the thickness of Avadon: The Black Fortress pours everything into the beating heart of its gameplay and into the depth of the role-playing component but at the same time one cannot turn a blind eye to a graphic sector that seems to have remained anchored to the times of Latest Online. At the sound level, unfortunately, the almost total absence of musical accompaniments is noted, while the atmospheric noises and effects are present in good quantity but remain quite anonymous in their characterization.
