And the publishers realize it: in fact, the title in question is published on consoles and PC by Ysbryd Games, the same one that some time ago had believed in the exceptional and atypical World of Horror. No Place for Bravery is something very different and with slightly lower results, although still noteworthy. An epic adventure in a twilight world, a story of family bonds and willfulness, oscillating between beautiful pixel art graphics and ~soulslike~ mechanics. All condensed into the dimensions and possibilities of an indie, which on the other hand almost always leave a complete free field for experimentation free of any pressure from above. In the No Place for Bravery review, we explain its mechanics, report our impressions and also raise some constructive doubts about the entire work, so that you can better evaluate a possible purchase. The plot: a corrupt world The bold style of No Place for Bravery No Place for Bravery is divided into an initial chapter, which acts as a prologue to the actual plot, and then in a linear narrative that will keep you company until the end credits. This is not a particularly long-lasting adventure, since a handful of hours are really enough to complete it - of course, as long as you are able to immediately become familiar with its mechanics and avoid game over screens and screens. Many aspects relating to characters, areas and the dark-fantasy world itself that forms the backdrop to everything that happens will not be immediately clear, but will have to be reconstructed both through exploration and with the finding of specific collectible objects in the form of scrolls, the whose contents can then be easily read in the inventory. Not in Italian, the only major absent among many other European and non-European proposals. The protagonist of the narration is Thorn, a skilled warrior with Norse features (in general, the whole inspiration behind No Place for Bravery draws liberally from folklore of the Nordic countries) now retired to private life. Thorn still lives with the obsession of having lost his young daughter Leaf, probably kidnapped by dark creatures from the realm of the dead. In fact, the world is now collapsing, immersed in a melancholic but definitive twilight: the raids of the monsters are increasingly frequent and violent, people do not feel safe, the ~sense of the end~ distinguishes every aspect of daily life. But one day Thorn is visited by an old warrior, his comrade in arms in the good old days. And they begin to understand a little better what is happening to their world... Without going into too much detail to avoid invasive anticipations, we would like to underline how No Place for Bravery is a tormented story, especially from the point of view of emotional ties within a family. Apart from the particular situation of Thorn, who has lost a daughter and risks a new misfortune even with the new acquired child, the developers have confirmed that they have included events related to their own personal experiences within the narrative. There will therefore be moments in which the player will be asked to make, so to speak, moral choices: which will be able to partially modify the course of events, and the opinion of the other characters towards the protagonist. This is a really interesting aspect, but devoid of significant consequences and any ~karma~ system that could change the continuation of the adventure. Gameplay: a little bit God of War, a little bit Zelda and a little bit Dark Souls A fight of No Place for Bravery From the gameplay point of view, the situation of No Place for Bravery is sufficiently varied and peculiar, perhaps even too much; the immense contaminations and more or less faithful shots of titles such as Dark Souls, God of War and The Legend of Zelda will be immediately evident, both to the more experienced and to the newcomers. The first and simplest example that comes to mind is that of bonfires, save points where Thorn can rest, restore his health and consumable items, and finally spend money to buy and upgrade the skills of his weapons. When resting by a bonfire, all enemies eliminated up to that point respawn in their place. We don't have to point you to productions with similar mechanisms, do we? The developers have expressly defined the title as a ~2D top-down action RPG~. We agree that it is in two dimensions and that the supporting structure is also that of an action RPG - here too, between weapons, characters, and the protagonist himself accompanied by a little boy, it would be very easy to suggest the link with the most recent God of War. But we would like to underline the tactical and reflexive aspect of game actions. You cannot simply run against the various types of enemies and swing at random: the combat system is instead based on the solid alternation of attacks, parries and dodges, in addition to the presence of a final move that allows the execution of some particular monsters . In all of this, resources are collected along the way by upgrading Thorn, and different weapons are recovered, some also useful for modifying the surrounding terrain and continuing towards previously inaccessible areas. All this suggests a solid and fun production, moreover enriched by a truly wonderful artistic direction, both in the general glance of the play areas and in the highly inspired, deliberately epic soundtrack. Before the big and awaited patch, input lag (and other technical problems) on Nintendo Switch were very frequent and frustrating; we noticed much less of them in our session, even if from time to time some answers are not as precise as they should be. No Place for Bravery's general problem is actually another one: while it displays a sensible and valid variety of game mechanics, it never really insists on any of them in a meaningful way. The gameplay offers a pleasant but also very frustrating adventure, because all the enemies are always stronger than the protagonist, apart from some particular cases; and if this makes sense in a Souls, it makes much less sense in an action-RPG, where the balance needs to be carefully weighted instead. The art direction of No Place for Bravery is inspired And when you finally get the impression that you understand how everything works and the right way to act, well, you've practically reached the end credits, because the dimensions are what they are.", "date": "2022-10-03", "grade": "7.0"}
