It is a small-sized setting, which can be explored on foot, characterized by the presence of ferocious undead who guard a series of towers, as well as by the possibility of using a new weapon: the Spada del Trapasso.Before trying your hand at the fulcrum of the DLC, however, it is worth completing the new mission The God of Death, which is available in the deluxe version of the package. It is an assignment like many already seen among the main and secondary quests of the basic campaign, in which we will have to go to an underground place to clean up the area from hordes of crazier enemies than usual: a tribe devoted to a mysterious god of death , which we will obviously have the pleasure of dealing with in the final phase of the expedition. The interesting thing about this mission is that it finally clarifies what happened to the protagonist of the first RAGE, Nicholas Raine, eventually providing us with new, interesting components for the equipment. Enemies and structure As mentioned at the beginning, RAGE 2: TerrorMania is set in a new small map, a creepy and dark world where hordes of undead roam. These are really tenacious opponents, basically zombie versions of some of the strongest enemies seen in the campaign, rather resistant to gunshots and able to attack in the most varied ways. There are ninjas capable of deflecting our gusts , others who use a mace to throw grenades at us, still others who target us from a distance with very annoying homing rocket launchers, and there are also giants armed with a shield, which must be dodged and hit from the side. In short, we are talking about a very rich bestiary, which is presented in dense groupings near the so-called Towers of Bones: buildings on the top of which there is a passage that can transport us to another place full of pitfalls. There we will find a multitude of opponents waiting for us and a huge skeletal guardian who will have to be knocked down several times to get hold of the Necrodisco, one of the magical artifacts that can bring us back home. These areas refer to some of the settings seen in the original story mode, also in this case revisited in a horror key but above all extremely dense with respawn points for the literally infinite undead troops. Weapons and gameplay Trying your hand at the frenetic, complicated boss fights of RAGE 2: TerrorMania is not easy, indeed the level of difficulty becomes extreme if you try to complete these missions relying solely on the standard equipment and special powers of the protagonist. things to resort to the Sword of Death, which adds an unprecedented melee element to the fights and brings them very close to those of the excellent Warhammer: Vermintide 2, but alas without boasting the same thickness: the yield of the blows appears inconsistent and the lack of extra maneuvers transforms the fights in long sprint and slash sequences, a hit and run that in the long run proves to be rather repetitive. The same sensation unfortunately accompanies the general experience of this second expansion, which does nothing but propose a series of fights without particular ideas, tickling players looking for a new challenge but without offering anything really new beyond the graphic reinterpretation. We are also talking about a rather short package, which in the absence of game over (the real discriminating factor, in case you want to try the path of firearms) can be completed in less than an hour and a half: a narrow duration, even considering the cost of just 500 credits (4.99 euros) for the standard version DLC alone. Conclusions RAGE 2: TerrorMania tries the road of horror to offer us a simple sequence of fights very similar to each other, within a scenario of small dimensions and devoid of particular cues. The hordes of the undead are full of different enemies, however, all based on opponents that we have already faced in the campaign or in the first expansion. Beyond the new graphic interpretation and the Sword of Death, which pushes melee clashes without however shining in terms of yield, the unpublished contents of the DLC are therefore very few and the overall duration appears insufficient.", "date": "2019-12-04", "grade": null}
