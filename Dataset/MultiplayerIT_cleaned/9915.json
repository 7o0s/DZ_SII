Anyone who buys this type of software knows very well that they meet certain limits imposed by a limited budget, but in the case of Aqua Panic we are dealing with an excellent product whose weak points have nothing to do with the programmers' skills. With a hot summer just arrived, there's nothing better than a game in which water and the sea are the masters. Of course, if you are destined to spend your holidays in the city, it could also instigate suicide... We are three little fish... The idea behind Aqua Panic is incredibly simple. A vase will release a stream of water full of small fish that will flow rapidly towards a sea partially populated by ravenous sharks, leading the cute little creatures to certain death. The player will have to use various tools to manipulate the scenery and direct the flow and the fish to the safe portion of the sea. In words it seems very simple, in reality the first dozen levels work as a tutorial and are overcome quite quickly, then the game becomes decidedly difficult and features a really well studied and ingenious level design. The peculiarity of this funny cross between Lemmings and Loco Roco lies in the timing that will be required of the player who will have to deal with the unexpected developments of the situation. Water can fill a ravine and come out from an unexpected point, for example, throwing the small fish straight into the jaws of predators; some flowers could inadvertently grow in some places diverting the current and upsetting our plans, and so on. Each scheme must not only be studied before starting the dances, but it must also be tried and tested again if you want to save all the minnows instead of the minimum wage required to advance. If the first stages require you to operate in a very simple way, torpedoing the walls to open holes or harpooning small predators to save the fish, the situation soon becomes considerably more complicated by requiring the use of several tools at the same time and at the right moment: flowers that block water, shell-shaped faucets, egg-filling cracks, and other amenities. Color explosion The Aqua Panic interface is extremely simple and clean, even if it is a little difficult to distinguish the cursor in the chromatic marasma proposed by each stage and despite the various failures there is always the desire to start over and improve, perhaps to climb the online ladder-board that rewards the best players or collect the tokens scattered throughout the various levels to buy new tools needed to pass the tests in the optional game modes. Aqua Panic certainly does not make you cry out for a miracle, visually speaking, but it is one of the puzzle-games with the sharpest, cleanest and most colorful graphics we have ever played, thanks also to the native 1080p resolution. The design of the maps is extremely ingenious in the combination of two-dimensional visual elements that animate the scenario, a small triumph of colors throughout the hundred levels that make up Aqua Panic. The sound accompaniment on the other hand is pleasant but monotonous: it is a handful of songs probably sung by Alvin the Chipmunk and his brothers, which at the beginning are also nice and catchy but then inevitably tend to become a bit obsessive.", "date": "2010-07-08", "grade": "8.0"}
