The Protostar developers evidently have very clear ideas about it, judging by Checkpoint Champion, a top-down racing game that reduces the control system to a minimum and requires the user ~only~ to overcome short challenges based precisely on the passing a certain number of checkpoints within the time limit. Now, however, we will explain why the quotation marks... Small and bad The first impact with Checkpoint Champion is absolutely comfortable: the title welcomes the player with delightful and colorful graphics, cheerful background music and a Sunday afternoon cartoon interface and design. After choosing the car to start with by choosing between two different models in terms of speed, acceleration and handling, a short tutorial opens which explains the very simple controls and the even more basic play structure: the goal is therefore to reach all the checkpoints that appear on the screen before the timer expires, with the car accelerating automatically and that you have to maneuver by acting on the sides of the touch screen to turn in that direction and maintaining pressure with both fingers to activate the turbo. In short, Checkpoint Champion initially gives the impression of being a cute and cuddly racing game suitable for the whole family, but it only takes a few minutes to realize that the reality is very different: the game has an incredibly challenging level of difficulty, fomented by challenges that immediately become very grim and by a more technical driving model than one might imagine. The steering is very sensitive and correctly dosing the turbo requires coordination and quick reflexes, elements which by themselves are already enough to make every mistake made on the track fatal: however, a literally ruthless racing design will take care of throwing fuel on the fire, destined to make anyone aiming for the three stars that sanction the maximum score sweat the proverbial seven shirts. It goes without saying that Checkpoint Champion is not a title suitable for casual gamers, but rather for those users who do not hold back from the prospect of having to repeat the same test dozens and dozens of times before reaching the desired goal. Behind Checkpoint Champion's friendly exterior is a game that's tough as nails The Protostar developers were also good at making the most of the only two environments (an aerodrome and a desert arena, both characterized by a variety of surfaces that have direct consequences on the behavior of the car) currently offered by the application: for each of them there are in fact two sets of 12 challenges of increasing level, for a total of 48 trials that offer a maximum of three stars each. These serve to unlock the more advanced levels and the other two car models available in addition to the one chosen at the beginning of the game, but there are also different objectives that allow you to obtain new body colors. More stars can be earned by playing in the arena mode (in which you have to collect time bonuses and aim to go on as long as possible) and by participating in the daily events, for a package that is anything but stingy with content, especially if you they also consider welcome elements such as online rankings and the ability to instantly share videos of their best performances. Checkpoint Champion's approach to the free-to-play formula is also appreciable, which avoids infecting the player with in-app purchases at every corner, preferring to support himself with the advertising screens that appear on the screen at the completion of each challenge: it is a easily bearable compromise, but which the developers still allow to eliminate by paying the sum of  1.79 which also entitles you to special liveries for cars. All good, then? Almost: Checkpoint Champion gets a little carried away by his desire to be a ~hard and pure~ racing game, often crossing the thin threshold that separates a demanding playful experience from a purely frustrating one, with different challenges that really give the impression of being almost impossible to complete with the three stars in your pocket.", "date": "2014-12-13", "grade": "8.0"}
