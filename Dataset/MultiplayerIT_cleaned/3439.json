The review you are reading obviously refers to the updated version of the game, out in these hours. We talk about 'updated version' because we are actually facing its second launch: KeokeN Interactive independently published a substantially incomplete version in 2018, promising that the story would be concluded with a free DLC. The criticisms received and the low sales convinced the development team to pursue another path: having found a publisher, Wired Productions, the first version of the game was taken off the market to then be refined and relaunched with the aforementioned DLC already integrated. All in all, Deliver Us The Moon is now the game it should have been. In reality, the original project was decidedly more complex than the one that arrived on the market, with features that have been completely cut such as the possibility of exploring the lunar soil via jetpack. In any case, the important thing is not to cry about the paid feature, but to understand if we are dealing with a valid title as it stands now. History In recent years there have been several titles set in space that offer rarefied, almost metaphysical atmospheres in their relationship between human beings and the unknown. In short, it almost seems that after decades of pop science fiction, someone has rediscovered a more problematic way of looking at the cosmos, with strong references to classics such as 2001 A Space Odyssey or Solaris, but also to the more recent Arrival, Gravity and Intertellar. Talking about a generalized trend seems exaggerated to us, but there is no doubt that titles such as Observation and this one Deliver Us The Moon also arise from the desire to break with the reading of the more caciarona and fantasy genre, typical of the Star Wars saga for example. Deliver Us The Moon tells of a near future in which all the energy resources of planet Earth are exhausted. Humanity is in chaos. To get out of the crisis, the world powers found the World Space Agency with the aim of extracting a new source of energy from the lunar soil. For a few years things go well, at least until all communications with the lunar colony are lost and the energy produced is no longer delivered. Finding himself without resources, mankind begins its rapid decline. The only hope left is to send a lone astronaut to the moon to figure out what happened and reactivate the production systems. Is there still something to save? Where have all the technicians and scientists who ran the colony gone? Does humanity deserve salvation? Gameplay This and other questions will be answered in the course of our adventure, which begins in a space base on Earth where, in the role of the aforementioned astronaut, we must manage to board a rocket before a sandstorm destroys it, to reach the our beloved satellite. This is the classic introductory level in which to practice the basic systems and in which to get to know the protagonist, who can only run, jump and interact with some objects, either to solve puzzles or to learn information about the mission and the story. Later he will also obtain a kind of blowtorch with which he will be able to open some sealed access routes. Consider that for most of the duration of Deliver Us The Moon you do not meet a living soul: the protagonist is completely alone with his mission. His only travel companion is a small robot, a so-called ASE unit, which is unlocked inside the lunar base and which we can use to solve some puzzles. For the rest there are no human beings to talk to, or enemies to face, apart from some recordings of the ASE that allow you to see some reconstructed events that occurred on the base before and during the crisis. There are some dangers, such as the lack of oxygen when you are in areas without life support, or like flames coming out of short-circuited equipment, or even like crazed ASEs trying to electrocute us with electric shocks, but in general the Moon is completely deserted and the rhythms of the game are very relaxed. The puzzles From room to room, corridor after corridor, our astronaut must strive to achieve the objectives that will be proposed to him from time to time, in a strictly linear form. Deliver Us The Moon's puzzles are very simple and often repetitive: in most cases, to progress we are required to press buttons, insert large batteries to power equipment, or discover access codes for doors or terminals , almost always written on poorly concealed post-its. To avoid the player getting frustrated by the dover always repeating the same actions, the developers have added different things to do, trying as much as possible to create interesting situations. For example, in the second level you find yourself exploring a space station in zero gravity, with the risk of ending up adrift in space; later in the game we will instead be able to visit the lunar soil aboard an exploration vehicle, with the aim of realigning some energy towers (we will have to do it several times during the adventure, actually). There are also some sections in which we will have to take control of the ASE unit to reach otherwise unreachable rooms of the base and other sections which are real interactive movies, with buttons to press at the right moment in order not to die. Everything works quite well and the challenge is never insurmountable, but there is no doubt that limits will emerge in the long run. Deliver Us The Moon is finished in around 6-7 hours, with the playing time varying depending on how much you enjoy finding the documents. There aren't many reasons to replay it, apart from the desire to find what has been left out. We are dealing with an ecological thriller, if we want to call it that, which is essentially told through the passive use of the aforementioned textual documents and the aforementioned ASE recordings. Nothing too refined or elaborate. The plot isn't bad, actually, but it lacks a strong idea, such as making us experience the whole adventure from the point of view of an artificial intelligence seen in the aforementioned Observation, or the metaphysical depth of a SOMA and his ingenious handling of the protagonist's identity. In Deliver Us The Moon everything is simpler and more direct, almost telephoned in some situations, including the final. The ecological background adds a touch of current affairs that doesn't hurt, but in reality the theme is never explored as it deserves. The bottom line is that Deliver Us The Moon isn't bad and has its moments, particularly related to the fascinating scenery, but it doesn't really offer anything that could leave any trace.", "date": "2019-10-10", "grade": "7.0"}
