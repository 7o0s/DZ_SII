That's why this remake of Metroid II: Samus Returns arrives like a nice cool bottle of water after a walk in the desert, even if die-hard fans initially turned up their noses at some poetic licenses compared to the original. The story of this second chapter is known to most, but for those who are totally in the dark, let's summarize it: after having vanquished the space pirates and having discovered the mutagenic power of the Metroids, Samus is sent to the planet SR388 to investigate on this species and, of course, exterminate its components. The original was partly criticized compared to the first chapter because its structure was more linear and the playing area smaller and largely dominated by the figure of Samus, however it was also the one in which the arsenal was richer in novelties interesting. That's why the man responsible for the original, Yoshio Sakamoto, took care of this remake directly, assisted by a studio that has traveled through ups and downs to date, MercurySteam. The demo shown at E3 foreshadowed an interesting game that had the courage, or the recklessness, to deviate from the original by introducing new mechanics such as a melee counter-move and the ability to scan the map in search of secret areas. Characteristics that however had obviously raised perplexities in the historical fans, who saw in these novelties, especially in the second one, a betrayal of the original spirit and a useless facilitation. Now that we have had the opportunity to try the game far and wide we can draw some conclusions. Play it again Sam(us) There is little to say about the structure of the game, there must be a reason why this genre is defined as ~metroidvania~ right? So expect areas of the map that you will not be able to explore initially, a progressive increase in special powers that will allow you to reach secret areas and a constant getting angry because you forgot that thing you wanted to go and recover. Heat-resistant suits, wall-climbing Morphballs and grappling hooks, you've got everything you need for a slick adventure. The pace of the game is quite linear: basically it is a question of gradually expanding the explorable map by recovering the DNA of the Metroids that are in the area, all alternating with decidedly more demanding clashes with the boss on duty. To make moving around easier, over time we will unlock teleporters that will allow us to move between the various sections of the planet with ease, perhaps to get that bonus to the rockets we had left behind. Exploring the map is intrinsically linked to one of Samus' new powers, called Aeion. These new skills are recharged by killing enemies and allow you to obtain a series of advantages such as temporary shields, special attacks and above all a radar pulse that allows you to see the map around us for a short time and the walls that we can destroy. This choice was initially criticized because according to some it would have compromised the exploratory aspect of the game, but in the end it is not so true. Of course, in some moments of blockage it is undoubtedly an important help, but all it does is save us from the task of having to shoot every corner of the planet in search of platforms to destroy. The end result is the same and the thrill of discovering a new area remains completely unchanged, if it really annoys you, always remember that you can not use it. The 3D effect As far as 3D is concerned, Metroid: Samus Returns has an advantage over other titles, because the lateral point of view allows it to play on the depth of the corridors. In the long run, however, this effect could tire you and we already know that the most orthodox fans will immediately do without it. Back to the new world While maintaining some suggestions of the original game, for example in the statues that give us additional powers, the graphics have obviously been drastically revised compared to the monochromatic cubes of the Game Boy. Now Samus moves in a colorful and polygonal world which however remains closely linked to a two-dimensional point of view. Each area is full of details that help to define the atmosphere: strange green liquids that descend from the ceiling, vaguely Egyptian architecture, pools of deadly liquids and so on. Perhaps someone would have preferred a retrogaming and non-retrogaming aestheticwe feel we can blame him, but all in all we did not mind this new graphic design, even if perhaps it lacks a bit of vivacity and personality. If nothing else he visually distances himself from the fashion of the moment. Now let's talk about the combat mechanics, which together with the radar are perhaps the biggest quantum leap in the game: the new counterattack opens up a series of decidedly interesting possibilities regarding the simplest clashes, but also the complex ones. In fact, using it with the right timing we will briefly stun the opponent and obtain a damage bonus that will allow us to eliminate smaller enemies and expose the vulnerable areas of the larger ones. Also, completing a kill after stunning an enemy will grant us more life or Aeion. Compared to the past, we will also be able to shoot in any position, as well as remain in place to aim precisely at moving targets, an extremely useful detail when we want to freeze an enemy and turn him into a temporary platform. Both the counterattack and the free aim turn out to be pleasant and even necessary innovations in the end to make the game a product in step with the times. Between jumps, rebounds against the wall and propitious counters, the action takes on the rhythm of a deadly and satisfying ballet in the most excited moments that conveys all of Samus' skill in doing his job. Perhaps the purists will once again turn up their noses at these changes, especially the melee, but it is a non-invasive addition that does not penalize in any way the experience of those who simply prefer to shoot everything that blocks their way. Wanting to find an important flaw, the fights with the Metroids are quite repetitive and once you find a couple of tricks they will become a formality.", "date": "2017-09-12", "grade": "8.5"}
