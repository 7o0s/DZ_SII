Fresh, fun, passionate, fulfilling, Josef Fares' third videogame creature hits every possible mark: gameplay , atmosphere, underlying theme and genius are elements so beautifully intertwined as to be ingredients of an author with twenty years of experience. Instead Hazelight Studios, the talented Swedish team father of the project, has been around since 2013 and has released just two titles before this one. We are talking about an author who with Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons first and then A Way out was able to blend the western game design approach with the cooperative inventiveness typical of the Japanese, especially of Nintendo. Let's see together in the review of It Takes Two for Nintendo Switch if this port perfects the studio's audience-building ambitions. You need two Fire and Targets: It Takes Two crystallizes an exemplary approach to split screen The narrative pretext can be as sad as it is sparkling: a couple of parents are on the verge of divorce when their daughter projects them inside similar miniaturized fabric dolls inside the house. The goal of the magical book author of the crime is to get them back to work together and to ignite again the spark of love and affection necessary to get their story back on track. It is in this way that we take the Switch pads in hand, ready to dive into the adventure of Cody and May in a blaze of truly extraordinary couch (and online) cooperation. Fares and his associates have injected such a quantity of ideas and game design gimmicks that they embarrass much of the modern production of high-profile video games, often beautiful to look at and boring to play. We don't need to add much because you can find everything in the original review of It Takes Two: today we are here to tell you that the experience on Switch has been translated very well. Net of a technical sector that is certainly more demanding than expected - therefore scaled down for details, resolution and framerate - the title is perfectly playable on Switch. We tested thoroughly in docked mode: the resolution is 1080p in TV mode and 720p in portable mode, even if unfortunately all the pixels are counted on a 4k monitor, while the framerate aims at 30 frames, currently not always stable, but we are convinced fixable. The only sore point, on which we hope they work seriously, is represented by the loading times, unfortunately quite long. Above all else, the electrifying soul and spirit of a varied and balanced gameplay remains unchanged and an expression of a great talent of the Swedes. Love letter to Nintendo Ice skating is just one of the many imaginative gameplay solutions offered by It Takes Two Fares has said it several times during interviews and questions: It Takes Two condenses all his immense passion for Nintendo into a product that overflows with imaginative and fun gameplay. It is no coincidence that the exuberant Swede of Lebanese origins grew up with Kyoto's most iconic games and was inspired by them to painstakingly create his most recent success. Surely one thing can be said of the link between Switch and It Takes Two: hardly as in this case has having a portable console with two joy-cons to detach and play in coop had such a perfectly fitting meaning. Sure, taking advantage of the Switch screen isn't the best way, but it can be done and it's immediate, a not insignificant plus. Bringing a title like this, always constantly in split screen, with good physics management and a valid basic technical sector on Switch must not have been easy, but the team has done an absolutely satisfactory job. Despite the resolution and general asset compromises, It Takes Two on Switch remains a good sight even on the home screen. Animations, atmospheres, objects that are the protagonists of each sequence: Hazelight has managed to find a huge balance point in this port, satisfying the eye as much as possible without distorting anything on the gameplay and physics side. You'll simply be making the call to a mix of elements that are clearly less defined and detailed than PS4, as well as a frame target that's roughly half that. Of course, playing it on a small monitor or a modestly sized TV is not the winning choice precisely for a discussion of space and detail: we recommend the experience on large televisions, so as to be able to read each scene designed by a dignified team that looks like veterans and is instead just in the second game.", "date": "2022-11-04", "grade": "8.5"}
