{"name": "Octopath Traveler", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/octopath-traveler-recensione-pc.html", "text": "Almost a year after its first publication for the Nintendo console, the controversial Octopath Traveler (and its review) also arrives on PC with a good conversion that reconfirms the strengths and weaknesses of an RPG that we reviewed last year and which made critics and audiences discuss a lot before and after its release. Focused on the misadventures of eight distinct wayfarers, Octopath Traveler approaches the genre from a deliberately nostalgic profile, recalling a way of making video games from other times without disdaining a modern nuance that places the title of producer Masashi Takahashi in a very precise niche. In the next few lines we will summarize the aspects of the game already explored in the past, finally focusing on the quality of the conversion. Eight stories At the beginning of the game we will be able to choose which wayfarer to play first, but once his introductory chapter is completed we will be able to continue only in his campaign or start and continue at will also those of the other seven wayfarers. The eight ~campaigns~ of Octopath Traveler never intertwine, except through references to facts and legends that characterize the world created by the developer Acquire. The eight stories, each divided into four chapters, take place in parallel and have a perfectly autonomous beginning, central development and conclusion: only by completing a long series of completely optional secondary missions, after finishing the total thirty-two chapters, can the subtle connections that link the vicissitudes of the wayfarers to the surrounding world. Again, the relationship between the heroes who make up this strange caravan remains in the shadows, like a background noise bound to optional skits, called travel chatter, which are activated only under certain circumstances and which appear quite forced, especially if the characters comment on the very serious events that occurred shortly before while they were completely absent. Unfortunately, the continuous switching from one storyline to another breaks the tension and rhythm of the stories, tremendously spoiling the most compelling ones, such as those of Primrose or Cyrus, and the non-existent interaction between the wayfarers recruited diminishes the importance of their vicissitudes and the drama of certain situations. Since there is no main storyline, the developer treats the wayfarers as mere ~tools~ of the gameplay and offers us no reason why a brave warrior like Olberic or an upright and pious clergyman like Ophilia should help a lone thief like Therion commit a robbery. The player recruits the other wanderers in their starting cities as if they were anonymous mercenaries: once they join the group, the characters appear only during movements or fights, vanishing completely in the narrative interludes, without being recognized by the NPCs with whom they had interacted in their adventures personal. This does not mean that the eight adventures are unpleasant, on the contrary: the stories of the wayfarers boast a writing of a certain level - thanks also to the excellent Italian translation - and a series of thematic choices that elevate Octopath Traveler above the usual RPGs for teenagers. The title Acquire speaks of revenge, prostitution and sacrifice: it always does so in cautious tones, without insisting too much on the more gory aspects, and the result is stories that are perhaps a little predictable but nonetheless of great impact. The stories of Alfyn and Tressa are perhaps the weakest but they act as a counterpart to the adventures of the adults, composing an interesting narrative mosaic, albeit without a single direction. The combat system Unfortunately Octopath Traveler also reveals various weaknesses on the gameplay front, a mix of interesting ideas, individually, less overall than the experience. We've talked about the need to tackle the chapters of the eight stories in a certain order, if you want to optimize your time, and this means constantly moving from one city to another, often visiting the same locations over and over again to complete the chapters or side missions undertaken. The cities are separated by various maps to explore, where you face random encounters and open the chests that contain accessories and consumables. There are no puzzles to solve or levers to pull either outdoors or indoors: despite the multiple detours, the exploration remains extremely linear and soon becomes a repetitive comings and goings. The structure of the game, in this sense, is repeated exactly as it is over the thirty-two chapters: the player arrives in the city, watches the interludes, talks to some NPCs, goes to the short duty dungeon, faces the boss, looks at the last interludes and a new chapter beginstitle. While not always perfectly balanced, the game implements a form of scaling that allows the player to get away with resorting to some imaginative strategy. Octopath Traveler's combat system, in its simplicity, takes the lion's share: it is engaging and guarantees considerable depth thanks to the enemies' power-ups and weak points. If initially it seems that everything is reduced to setting aside the AP to launch devastating attacks once the defenses of the enemies have been overcome, that is, after having hit them using the most effective weapons or magic, in the final chapters you have to think more tactically, especially when bosses are faced with their own peculiar mechanics. The secondary class system, however, did not completely convince us: each of them can be associated with only one character, moreover the predefined roles leave little room for creativity. Once all secondary classes are unlocked, including the four special ones, there are still many interesting combinations to experiment with. On the other hand, many side missions are less interesting, which reward above all in money and consumable items. These assignments are often bizarre and require a good memory: usually the NPCs will ask us to meet someone or to retrieve some object or certain information using the Travel Actions that characterize wayfarers. The idea is actually very nice, but it soon ends up becoming redundant, forcing the player to make absurd rounds just to receive some money or potions in exchange. The reputation mechanic that should make this aspect of the game more exciting didn't completely convince us: once the attempts available failed, the player can simply pay a certain amount in the inn to restore the possibility of interacting with NPCs without suffering other consequences. PC conversion On the technical sector, however, we all agree: it is clear that to appreciate the Acquire effort you have to love pixel art. We are talking about a style aimed at a precise sphere of enthusiasts and nostalgics, it is true, but one cannot remain indifferent in front of the well-kept sprites which, tiny and summarily animated, still manage to excite us. The merit goes above all to the soundtrack composed by Yasunori Nishiki and to the sensations of urgency and drama that he is able to express through evocative, engaging and always spot on tracks in every situation. The fusion between old and new expressed through such retro sprites and polygonal scenarios, embellished with modern graphic effects, chiaroscuro and blurs, is truly fascinating and establishes a solid foundation on which to build a new stylistic line. We're still talking about simple pixels in Unreal Engine 4, so it was quite to be expected that the PC conversion wouldn't be particularly problematic. The game, in fact, returns the same, identical performance as the version released a year ago: it is essentially the same experience, enhanced by a stack of options that allow for a fair customization. During our test we did not encounter any bugs, crashes or other noteworthy problems: everything went smoothly and we can only hope that the release code is equally clean. Of course, you can decide whether to play in a window or in full screen and in which resolutions, you can activate or deactivate some graphic effects and configure the control system, choosing between keyboard, mouse and joypad. In short, it is a slavish conversion without significant additions or improvements, and for this reason we confirmed the vote assigned last year to the Nintendo Switch edition.", "date": "2019-06-07", "grade": "7.0"}
