The insight is found in the relevant paragraph, so if you don't want any anticipation you can possibly skip it. The story behind the development of Nioh is almost as fascinating as the setting of the game. In fact, we are talking about a title inspired by an incomplete screenplay by Akira Kurosawa and shelved twice by the producer Kou Shibusawa, dissatisfied with the form his creature was taking. Each time the work started from scratch; the last four years ago, when the project was entrusted to Team Ninja and took on the connotations of the ruthless action RPG with which we have been in very close contact in recent days, dedicating afternoons and nights to it for a total of almost forty hours that scratched much the full-bodied structure developed by the developers. William Adams, the protagonist of Nioh, is a skilled English sailor and soldier with the ability to see supernatural beings, who is separated from his guardian spirit during a furious battle and locked up in the dungeons of the Tower of London. The power of the ~fairy~ linked to William is in fact considered of great importance by Edward Kelley, a shady figure who wants to take possession of the magical Amrita stones and exploit their strength to influence the fate of the conflict that is consuming Japan at the beginning of the 1600s. exactly as it was said to have happened a few years earlier in the Anglo-Spanish War. Nioh undoubtedly stands as a courageous and convincing test in the field of action RPGs Same and different That our adventure begins in an underground prison is obviously no coincidence, just as the similarities between the title of Team Ninja and Dark Souls are evident: both designed to corner the player and force him to literally memorize the attack patterns of a boss to be able to defeat him after infinite attempts; both ruthless in granting even the most banal of opponents the ability to inflict huge damage on us, if not kill us; both dominated by a constant tension, although variable depending on the missions, because a terrible threat could lurk around every corner and above every hill. From this point of view, dying becomes an element perfectly integrated into the gameplay: when it happens in Nioh we keep all the collected objects but we lose the Amritas, which remain together with our guardian spirit (we will be able to unlock twenty in total, all with different bonuses and a devastating special mode that activates when the relative indicator is full) and must be recovered on the site of the last death or lost forever. Considering that it is a fundamental currency to improve our character's statistics in terms of strength, dexterity, spirit and so on, it seems clear how to get to the end of a stage, be defeated by the boss and then maybe run into a very banal game over falling into the water or being killed by a low-level opponent gives voice to intense episodes of frustration. However, this is only the appetizer for a game that in some situations can be really, really sadistic. In one of the first levels, for example, we are faced with a huge enemy capable of eliminating us with a single blow that must absolutely be dodged: a pity that the floor is gradually filled with ~holes~ in which it is easy to fall simply by avoiding the shots. Not a pretty prospect, is it? However, it must be recognized that the desperation that burns and grips in those moments makes any success incredibly satisfying, and it is on this front that the Koei Tecmo production has undoubtedly hit the target. On the first hit. The last samurai In an attempt to pursue Kelley, the protagonist of Nioh boards a ship bound for Japan and there he finds himself dealing with a country unknown to him, where spiritual activity is skyrocketing and forces move in the shadows. terrible. At this juncture another of the great strengths of the game takes over, namely its drawing liberally on Japanese legends and folklore: all the creatures we interact with during the campaign have a correspondence in the books dedicated to the subject, whether it is of peaceful beings like the funny Kodama, who once recovered go to crowd the sanctuaries where we can save the position and be reborn in case of death, emitting nice verses or even playing improvised trumpets with a leaf; or hostile like the yokai, among whose ranks various types of monsters can be distinguished rgruesome and dangerous. Even the bosses, of course, are inspired by the scariest creatures of the Japanese tradition: from the Umibozu, the huge sea monster we mentioned earlier, to the demonic Ogres; from the lethal lady of the ice to the flaming devil that awaits us at the end of the first mission; from the gigantic centipede of the ~venomous~ scenario to the terrifying arachnid-woman who can slow us down with her web or by spitting paralyzing venom. The landing in Japan and the meeting with a well-known leader also translates for William into the revelation of the hub from which we will be able to select the main and secondary missions, set in the same locations but with different objectives; as well as the ~twilight missions~, which are proposed in rotation and provide for a different disposition of the enemies, in this case all belonging to the world of spirits, therefore more tough and dangerous than the human soldiers with whom we will often have to deal in the initial stages of history. Also from the hub it is possible to access the sanctuary and its functions of enhancement, preparation of jutsu, assignment of the guardian spirit and selection of the blessing of the Kodama, in practice a bonus that allows for example to obtain more Amrita, more weapons during the loot or enjoy improved stats. Then there are the dojo, where you can complete the increasingly advanced tutorials, the Torii portal to access the multiplayer features (see box), the deposit in which to store excess objects that you don't want to get rid of, the ~hidden tea house ~ which allows you to manage the strategic substrate of the faction war and finally the blacksmith. The latter, in the form of a pretty girl instead of a grumpy master, gives us the possibility to buy or sell weapons and armor, to use the forge to modify the attributes of each tool, to make a fusion to obtain more powerful objects, to disassemble what we don't need in order to recover the materials and even to take advantage of a convenient coiffeur service to change the haircut or length of the beard. The various possibilities are quite clear and well organized, were it not for some misleading lack of the Italian translation which we hope will be fixed. Ready for everything The quantity of helmets, armor, leggings, gloves and trousers that can be found in Nioh is exorbitant, and as per tradition each of these objects is characterized by a level of quality, peculiar statistics, extra bonuses and a weight that affects the mobility of the protagonist: load too much compared to your strength and you will have the vigor of a ninety year old, emptying the Ki bar after just three hits; lighten up excessively and you can run like rockets around the locations, but you won't have a solid guard and each parry will also result in a depletion of physical stamina. As expected, this aspect of the experience exudes a certain degree of depth and allows you to draw, with a pinch of luck and attention, the ideal warrior for our approach to fighting. In this regard, the categories of melee weapons available in the game are five: katana, double katana, spear, ax (including hammers) and kusarigama, the fearsome chain scythe; while there are three categories of ranged weapons: bow, rifle and cannon. Each of these tools, which can be equipped in pairs (two melee weapons and two ranged weapons that can be switched at any time) has some possible main variants and, also here, an enormous number of different models, more or less effective, to be used for a certain period of time to fill up the familiarity bar and enjoy an additional bonus during battles. It is at this juncture that the most significant feature of Nioh manifests itself, namely the three positions that can be switched through a simple combination of keys: the high guard, which gives rise to powerful attacks but translates into a general slowness of movement; the medium guard, which is the most balanced solution between effectiveness and speed; and finally the low guard, which substantially limits the consumption of Ki allowing us to literally dance on the battlefield and dodge attacks with ease, however paying a steep price in terms of damage done. Just to emphasize the concept of spiritual energy, the developers have also introduced a further mechanism, the Ki Rhythm, which works in practice like the active recharge of Gears of War: immediately after having landed a blow, William will be surrounded for an instant by a halo of residual energy, and by pressing the R1 backbone at that precise moment we will be able to immediately recover a certain quantityty of Ki, so that we can perform further maneuvers or quickly get away from the enemy before he counterattacks. A concept that becomes particularly important when facing the most difficult opponents and bosses, given that it is enough for them to score a critical hit to reduce us to the end of life or worse. All these elements interface with a traditional control system, which assigns light and heavy blows to the Square and Triangle buttons, the X button to sprint and dodge, pressing the right analog on its base to engage the enemy and on the L1 backbone the parade. Ranged weapons allow precise aiming, very useful for taking out basic opponents with a single headshot, and are activated by using the L2 trigger to aim and R2 to throw instead. The cooperative mode Nioh includes an online co-op mode that allows two players to summon each other and tackle any mission together from those already completed (or still not completed, in case the second player is summoned while standing in front of a shrine, in the middle of a level). According to our brief experience in this sense, matchmaking and code work well, guaranteeing a fluid experience without particular problems. As expected, facing even the toughest enemies in numerical superiority makes life much easier, therefore it will be necessary to understand what limitations will be placed by Team Ninja in order to prevent the presence of the cooperative from debasing the high degree of challenge of the game. However, there will be further developments, as the team plans to release a competitive PvP mode after launch as well. The structure of the levels We mentioned above the main hub, the management of Amritas and the presence of shrines in the levels that serve as a place of rebirth. The level design developed by the Nioh developers translates into real mazes in some cases, therefore the lack of a map is very felt and in certain circumstances you could spend hours repeating the same path just to find the right way towards the boss. In such moments, one of the many objects that can be collected from downed enemies comes in handy, the placeholder talisman, which precisely carries out the function of signaling a specific position on the radar and thus allows you to orient yourself at least when, for example, you need to quickly find the road to the confrontation that closes the mission. After having come across the various closed doors, Resident Evil style, we will make loops that will take us exactly to the other side and we will be able to unlock these passages, which ultimately translates into the creation of a ~shortcut~ from the sanctuary closest to the boss, a journey which however could still include opponents to beat and with them the possibility of losing precious energy. To restore it we will be able to recall from the context menu (there are two, which can be switched by pressing the R2 backbone), with the d-pad, an elixir or an object with similar properties. We therefore dedicate a small parenthesis to a topic that deserves far more insights, namely the many objects obtained from the loot and those that we can create or buy: from the salt that weakens the Ki of the yokai to the stones that allow you to draw the attention of a single enemy, from the various explosive bombs to shurikens and ninja-derived kunai, passing through the numerous elemental talismans that give weapons a specific bonus that is all the more effective the greater the degree of vulnerability of the enemies with respect to this element. When we come across a sanctuary and decide to take advantage of the possibilities it offers in terms of upgrades and so on, the stage resets and all common enemies return to their places, which obviously is a factor that can be exploited in certain situations to carry out a little grinding and collect enough Amrita to enhance the specific skill that we think can provide us with the starting point necessary to defeat the boss on duty. The bosses Nioh's combat system boasts an extraordinary depth and many facets, all elements that the game puts into practice when it comes to getting to the point, at the heart of this type of action RPG experience: the boss fights. Fight them with what weapon, using what stance, with what items in context menus? Questions to which an answer must necessarily be provided, which however only comes by experimenting over and over again, dying in the most absurd and frustrating ways, taking measures against the enemy and memorizing every movement in order to react in the best possible way. There are traditional different stages for each boss, c", "date": "2017-02-02", "grade": "8.8"}
