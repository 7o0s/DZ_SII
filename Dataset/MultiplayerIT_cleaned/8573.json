{"name": "Prototype 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102292-prototype-2-azione-mutante.html", "text": "Prototype was one of the revelation games of 2009, at least as regards the category of products strongly oriented towards action, a certain comic violence, the exaggerated powers of its protagonist and the extreme spectacularization of the fights. Thanks to these elements, despite some defects, the title produced by Activision was able to gain the attention of the public at the time, to the point of convincing the producers themselves to focus decisively on a sequel, in the belief that with it they would give life to a new flagship series for their Company. The task of realizing this project was once again entrusted to Radical Entertainment, who for the development of the game decided to focus straight on the formula of the first chapter, without however remaining indifferent to the numerous feedbacks released by critics and above all by users, for improve every aspect and consequently fill the gaps. Prototype 2 therefore inherits from its predecessor an open world gameplay but at the same time extremely tight, rapid and violent, with a partially revised mechanics and made more easily manageable for users thanks to a more intelligent distribution of commands, a less confusing narration than in past and the introduction of shortcuts to activate special powers so as not to force players to go through tedious menus. In this sense, the gaming experience has been better organized also structurally, to allow different approaches to the action, so that the different missions, with the secondary ones often linked to the main adventure which serve precisely to deepen the plot by revealing other aspects, can be addressed differently depending on the need. New character, new powers However, going into detail and proceeding according to the canonical order which provides a hint on the facts narrated during the adventure, let's say that the story of Prototype 2 is slightly more accurate and certainly better articulated in the development than in the first chapter. Proof of this is the fact that the supporting characters are, for example, more integrated into the plot as well as being characterized with greater attention than those seen in the past. At the center of the story, however, there are once again the mutations of the Blacklight virus which has transformed and still transforms the population of what is now called New York Zero (NYZ) into monsters but ~gives away~ to some lucky/unfortunate human beings of supernatural powers. What changes instead is the protagonist, who here becomes Sergeant James Heller, determined to take revenge on the one he believes to be the culprit of the spread of the infection and of having caused the death of his wife and daughter: in a word, Alex Mercer . However, the latter infects Heller himself to turn him into his ally in the fight against the ranks of the Blackwatch, whose scientists hide terrible secrets about Blacklight. The developers' choice to introduce a new hero was not born only as a narrative expedient to tell the story through a different perspective, but also from technical needs, given that, as we mentioned in a previous preview, further enhance the already devastating Alex Mercer would have effectively generated several balancing problems within the game world, undermining one of the focal points of the title, namely the evolution of the character and his skills. The latter, linked as always to the mutations deriving from the disease that is devastating the Big Apple, are a mix between those used by Mercer and other unpublished ones, such as for example the tentacles that come out of Heller's body, useful for hooking up to vehicles and aircraft, but also to help him jump and cling to any ledge or to climb buildings. Precisely by exploiting this characteristic, together with the ~classic~ ones that allow him to glide, jump or climb, the former US Army sergeant can move to explore the city, divided this time into three macro-zones distinguished by different colors according to the rank of danger. Thus we have the yellow one, where citizens are checked and kept in quarantine, even if the virus still snakes its way through the streets to the dismay of the doctors who are trying to stem the infestation. Then the green one, the safest, and the red one, which is the most dangerous ever with thousands of mutants and monsters of various kinds. New York Zero The map can be explored more or less freely from the beginning, even if to have full freedom you need to proceed in the game until you unlock the air bridges that are used to automatically reach the various areas, but after a handful of hours spent wandering around pure curiosityity inevitably leads us to move more specifically in search of the missions that make up the adventure, available in a progressive manner and divided into main and secondary ones. An ~open~ structure like that of Prototype 2, in fact, lends itself well to proposing several of the latter type, obviously not necessary to complete the game (for example those linked to the Blacknet network) but which bring various benefits as a gift such as discovering new details on a series of characters or find new power-ups. Among other things, the latter are now not easy to obtain. In fact, Heller is enhanced on the one hand by making him level up normally and distributing the points acquired among the various items relating to his main attributes, such as health or regeneration capacity, on the other by absorbing new powers from particular characters to be terminated. In short, you cannot accumulate more experience points and immediately convert them into upgrades. Still on the subject of skill, the simplification of the controls also involves the selection of powers, which has become more intuitive for the occasion (they are assigned in pairs to two of the front buttons of the pad and can be changed from the appropriate wheel menu) and with a greater range of possible combinations available for the latter. Which is very useful especially when you are engaged against dozens of enemies in some virulent battle. The latter, thanks to an improved artificial intelligence of the opponents, among other things characterized by different skills, offer the gamer a greater level of challenge than Prototype, guaranteeing on balance a slightly more varied approach to the fight and pushing the user to use a minimum of strategy and any object, vehicle or living being to shoot them down. By virtue of an engine that manages physics in a more than good way, almost every element of the scenario can in fact be thrown against the opponents, or literally torn to pieces and reused. Helicopters sliced in two, individuals thrown into the air and real fatalities contribute to enriching the visual side of the action, a fundamental element of a title that makes spectacular violence and splatter its main cornerstone. In addition to the ease of control of the character, among the novelties in these phases the shield stands out, which plays a fundamental role allowing you to make counters capable of further enriching the action, together with an endless series of final moves, all different depending on the combination of weapon in hand and enemy defeated. Without forgetting the possibility of taking possession of the most disparate weapons and governing vehicles such as armored vehicles and helicopters. Another new element of the Prototype 2 gameplay is the hunter mode. Heller can release an impulse through a sort of sonar obviously derived from the mutation of the virus, and observe the behavior of the generated wave in space to understand where the target you want to hit is. The player thus has the possibility to follow him, sensing the places within the city where he is moving and then decide how to eliminate him. Playstation 3 trophies Prototype 2 offers 44 Trophies, of which 26 Bronze, 15 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. Most of them are linked to the fulfillment of some objectives imposed by the game, such as for example knocking down a certain number of enemies or destroying their vehicles using particular powers or combinations; others, on the other hand, are related to side quests, completing the main adventure on hard difficulty or carrying out some story missions. To get the coveted Platinum you have to scrape together all the others. Infiltrating what a passion If the explosions of blood and the mutations remain at the center of both the atmosphere and the action, the infiltration missions also assume no less importance within the game, finally conceived and remodeled in such a way as to be a little more interesting. As always, the whole concept revolves around the mechanics of recovering the memories of one's victims, ending their existence and assuming their identity to perhaps sneak into some enemy base or laboratory. Only this time it is properly supported by a greater attention to stealth dynamics, supported by a visual system that indicates which enemies are observing in the direction of the protagonist or his target, generally highlighted in red, and which ones can be attacked, signaled blank. The general improvements that we have talked about so far in relation to gameplay are also visible in terms of graphics. We have a good variety of templates and animations for various typesnages but also for the buildings, where the level of detail is decidedly higher than that seen in the past, where each skyscraper is finally well differentiated from one another, with the sidewalks frequented by passers-by modeled with more care, the crowded streets by credible traffic and the vehicles finally not flat. The interlude scenes can then count on an almost total restyling, with cinematic shots, more expressive faces and good lip synchrony during speech. What has just been described, together with a well-made lighting system that gives the visual sector a depth that is absolutely non-existent in the first chapter, and with a physics worthy of the name, finally allows the Prototype series, while not making a miracle cry, to visually become a title of this generation. Too bad only for the low quality of some contour textures, even if perhaps you couldn't expect much more from an engine that otherwise risked becoming excessively heavy in the presence of dozens and dozens of people and vehicles on the screen, to the detriment of the fluidity of action and general stability of the product. Finally, as regards the audio, strictly in Dolby and Dts, we have a good dubbing finally available in Italian and a soundtrack whose music is not memorable in many cases, but still does its honest job accompanying the various stages of the adventure with the right intensity, emphasizing the most important situations within the story.", "date": "2012-04-24", "grade": "8.7"}
