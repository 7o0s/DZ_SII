{"name": "Victoria - Un Impero Sotto il Sole", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/victoria-un-impero-sotto-il-sole.html", "text": "Patches and Modifications In addition to the historical depth of its titles, Paradox is known for the continuous and patches to which all its titles have been subjected: the price of complexity. Victoria is no less, and for several months now (since the foreign versions came out) it has been possible to read user complaints on the official forums with consequent releases of patches by the developers aimed at improving the gaming experience. With the release of version 1.3 (which is the same one that all Italian buyers will find in stores) the maturity of the product can now be said to be complete, even if the development of new Patches certainly does not seem to be finished. And if we are still not satisfied, it will always be possible to indulge ourselves by editing the game configuration files ourselves (perhaps by downloading already modified ones) and thus create new scenarios or customize the gaming experience by adding new victory conditions and historical events. History at our feet. The game setup of this Victoria is predictably very similar to other recent Paradox productions. Depending on the scenario that we want to undertake, we will first choose the kingdom to lead towards new and dazzling splendor and, therefore, we will be directly catapulted onto the world map divided, like a Risk, into almost 2900 individual regions belonging in turn to States or of the Kingdoms. The game takes place in real time: the movement of our troops and therefore takes place seamlessly and simultaneously with the moves from the kingdoms managed by the computer and, possibly, from the other human players. The same battles between armies will not be resolved in a normal game turn, but may last for a long time depending on the number of forces deployed on the field and the battle conditions. We assure you that already having your own infantry division exterminated little by little is a real trickle. The historical accuracy is immediately evident, depending on the period chosen, in fact, none of the more or less incisive protagonists of those years will be missing. The tools available to the player are innumerable and even disorienting at first. We will be able to decide the orientations of our nation on the internal political front: from the type of government, to social reforms up to financial ones. In addition to setting the level of taxation, other aspects can be decided, such as the level of freedom of expression, public expenditure invested in literacy and that spent on the army or public safety. Every reform and every aspect of social/political life will have a certain level of costs and benefits, the subtle balance between all these aspects decides the quality of life of our people and the consequent degree of wealth, culture, awareness and militancy of the different social classes which form it. Victoria, even before being a ~simple strategy game~, is a complex and profound historical simulation. History at our feet. Always at the mercy of our decisions are the level of production and industrialization, the development of infrastructure, the direction of technological research and military and colonial planning. As always, our ambitions will often be clipped by the meager budget and more than once we will be forced to decide between an expansionist and enterprising policy and one more directed towards the internal wealth of our Kingdom and our subjects. Even diplomacy, if well managed, will be an important means of achieving one's goals. Thanks also to the concept of ~Prestige Points~ (earned thanks to military, but also political or economic successes) even small to medium-sized nations will be able to stake the influence gained by establishing an intricate web of treaties and alliances useful for defending themselves against attacks by more powerful neighboring states and menacing. On the other hand, choosing the wrong friends could lead to wars that are as unwanted as they are harmful to the economy and morale of one's country. But the degree of detail certainly does not stop here, within the limits of the possible and the freedom of play left to the player, the developers have also well thought of reproducing all the events that, in one way or another, have outlined the evolution of history. Starting the game with the United States of Central America, for example, after a few months of the game we will be victims of the first street riots and the first riots organized in our provinces, for the achievement of independence, assisting helplessly - or almost - at the progressive crumbling of our kingdom and the birth of new independent national states of Central America such as Nicaragua or Costa Rica. This is one of theand the strengths but also one of the biggest handicaps of the game itself, at least for the extremists of the genre, those who - changing a little typology - playing Championship Manager (alias Scudetto) start with the team of the oratory to finish, after few seasons, to win the Intercontinental Cup against Boca Juniors. Victoria, even before being a ~simple strategy game~, is a complex and profound historical simulation, so we will soon realize how often history, given certain assumptions, always takes its course. Returning to the previous example, even knowing in advance of the occurrence of certain revolts in our provinces, we will hardly be able to avoid them with an adequate policy and, once we have taken note of the situation, stem their effects with the right military strategy, even if helped by the fact of already knowing a part of the ~future~, it will prove to be a chimera. This is because the initial conditions are well established and the range of roads at our disposal - however theoretically unlimited - is seriously reduced by the objective difficulties of the historical period and of the selected nation. In a nutshell: if you want to try the experience of hegemonizing the whole known world, we still recommend the good old Civilization. If all this is true above all with the smaller and more enterprising nations, using the great world powers instead we will not have the opportunity to feel like victims of this extreme historical realism but, on the contrary, we will feel like subti protagonists and, perhaps with the old high school history book in hand, we will be able to get to the heart of the delicate economic and diplomatic balances of the time, managing to give life to a series of historical What Ifs that cannot fail to delight every enthusiast. Taking command of the Kingdom of Sardinia and Piedmont and attempting Italian unification, also thanks to a wise foreign policy so as not to antagonize too many powers at the same time, and attempting a different approach to what happened in reality with Garibaldi's Thousand and his ~I obey  is an experience like no other. At least for the most demanding strategists. History of the Technique Technically Victoria does not present any particular surprise, agile and quick with obsolete systems to say the least, after the efforts required by the latest high-end FPS, the game requires absolutely no three-dimensional accelerator, while to enjoy the soundtrack (a series of motifs from classic works of the period) the integrated sound cards on most of the motherboards in circulation today are also sufficient. Also in terms of user interface ergonomics we do not feel like raising particular criticisms, if not for the sometimes boring lack of precision of the mouse (both in movement and pointing) and in the anachronistic choice to relegate some menu items to activation only via keyboard, like most informative statistic screens. At least in this field the Paradox still have ample room for improvement. The effort of the Italian distributor in having completely localized the game (both manual and text within the game) is to be appreciated, on the other hand it is a real pity to note how the manual supplied with the DvD Box turns out to be little useful and exhaustive, at least to clarify ideas about the more complex  and decisive  aspects of Victoria. Again from this point of view, the developers' choice of not having wanted to provide any type of introductory tutorial for the game seems inexplicable to us, especially considering that instead this feature had also been implemented in the less complex (and this is saying something!) Europa Universalis 2 . Comment In case any of you still have any doubts: yes, Victoria is the typical strategic swag who either deeply hates himself or loves himself madly. Functional graphics and decidedly unaccustomed to acrobatics of a purely aesthetic and almost non-existent sound character (the three hours of songs of the time are nice at the beginning, but after a few game sessions you just want to turn on the stereo) surround a a title that without too much forcing could be used in our high school classrooms by some enlightened history professor. If you are not really experts in this genre but you still feel attracted by the horizons it can offer to all players willing to waste some time, the advice is to jump into Europa Universalis 2 first. For all the others: don't get your hopes up that the experience of the two EUs can get you right into the heart of the action. Victoria is not a simple DataDisk with a changed historical period, but yet another evolution, at least from the point of view ofdepth of play. Yet, once the right mastery has been achieved, the satisfactions and the fun obtained will reward you for all the time invested. Victoria is a game that is discovered with each new game, a title so profound and complex that it is always able to offer new problems and always new solutions. If you want to deepen, rediscover and maybe change the history of the world this is the game for you. Pros: Unparalleled depth Unlimited game possibilities Fully translated Cons: Insufficient documentation Not suitable for newbies Game interface could be improved ~Victoria - An Empire under the sun~ is the latest effort by Paradox Entertainment, the software house that has known the limelight thanks to the strategic titles of the ~Europa Universalis~ series. After a projection to the recent past, during the Second World War, undertaken with the appreciated Hearts Of Iron, the Swedish group of programmers takes us a little further back in history, between 1835 and 1920 to be precise. When the so-called industrial revolution and the age of great colonialism prepared the field for all those historical and social changes that led to the First World War and, in a certain sense, to the modern world as we know it today.", "date": "2004-06-18", "grade": null}
