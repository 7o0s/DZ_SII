{"name": "Super-Bikes Riding Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-bikes-riding-challenge.html", "text": "The game After an introduction with a strong impact, Super-Bikes Riding Challenge discovers the group of its game modes: Free Ride, Trophies, Career and Multiplayer. Their content is quite clear, however the Multiplayer is limited to the challenge of two players and does not include online. However, this is a lack that does not weigh at all in the general picture, given that there is much more to enjoy. In fact, it is possible to try your hand at quick races or challenging trophies by adopting a ~fast~ approach to the game, or create a pilot and try your hand at the excellent Career mode. As is customary for racing games, Career Mode packs the thicker elements and offers extended entertainment. After creating your own alter ego, in fact, you will be able to face a series of competitions divided between category tournaments (naked, supersport and superbike) and championships. The number of tournaments and the length of each race, as well as the composition of the championships depend on the level of difficulty: starting with the ~Beginner~ level, working your way up to the ~Pro~ level. The commitment necessary to excel in each race increases in a real and decisive way as you go along, and so you will find yourself fighting against opponents you initially managed to give two seconds per lap... Peculiar characteristics As mentioned, the increase in difficulty within Career Mode is real. To counter increasingly smart and fast opponents, therefore, we will have the opportunity to access a growth system for our driver. An intelligent and multifaceted system: each of our performances is analyzed by the game according to a scale of four values, which translates into the attribution of a certain number of points. The pilot ~levels up~ every time he reaches certain scores, as happens in any RPG, and he is given bonuses to improve his characteristics. And here is the novelty: our character can be enhanced in terms of acceleration, braking, bending, concentration, intimidation and fall technique. If the first three characteristics are clear enough, it is appropriate to explain what is meant by ~concentration~ and ~intimidation~: staying in close contact with an opponent, when fighting to overtake him, affects his concentration bar. Once this is zeroed, the ~intimidated~ pilot drops the accelerator drastically to catch his breath, losing ground. The speed with which the concentration bar is consumed depends on your intimidation value: the higher it is, the more effective this technique is. Naturally, our driver will also have to be careful of intimidation by his opponents And it's not over Career mode still hides some secrets, in terms of extras and customization. The extras are, of course, the unlocking of new bikes to be used in the Free Ride and Multiplayer modes. And the choice will become embarrassing, given that Super-Bikes Riding Challenge allows you to ride more than forty real motorcycles, reproduced with great detail both in terms of aesthetics and ~practice~, i.e. behavior on the road. Behavior that can take on the tones of a rigid and ultra-realistic simulation or approach the arcade spirit (without compromising, however) based on the driving settings: manual or automatic gearbox, braking assistance, traction assistance and anything else that can make the game experience similar to a real motorcycle race, perhaps resorting to a change of view (there are four: immediately behind the motorcycle, a little further away, in absolute first person or really ~on the saddle~, complete with tachometer). In terms of customization, Milestone has reached an agreement with Dainese to include the clothing and accessories of the Vicenza-based company in the game. Unlike video games where this type of license is used for aesthetic purposes only, in Super-Bikes Riding Challenge the clothing and accessories are unlocked as you progress in Career mode, and you wear one helmet instead of another, a pair of particular gloves and a specific suit translate into real modifications of the characteristics of the rider, which we have already talked about previously. And so a strategic element is added in terms of enhancement: spending the three points earned from the level-up to improve the acceleration value, whereas we can improve the lean value by wearing a suit that has just been unlocked. Conduct of tenders and control system As anticipated, the game allows you to participate in naked, supersport or superbike races. The bikes change depending on the race, and before it startsre you are asked to select one. Opponents will, of course, be using the same vehicle. The number of laps to complete, as well as the degree of ~expansion~ of each track are decided by the level of difficulty: the further you go the more laps you make, we will also be able to see the circuits (which are divided into sports, urban and rural) in their entirety. The control system provides, in addition to steering, the forward and backward movement of the pilot. At first this solution seems to have been put there to allow you to wheelie every now and then, while slowly you understand that crouching on the straights drastically increases the final speed of the bike, while straightening up when braking improves the contact of the wheels with the ground. Not to mention the accidents that can arise from incorrect use of positioning: nail while crouched and you will do a nice somersault together with the bike; straighten up on a powerful bike, in low gears, and you can see the sky just before you chew the handlebars. The key to success in every race is to understand the curves you are dealing with, decide the best trajectory for entry and exit, dose braking where excessive slowing could expose us to the risk of overtaking. In general, however (and this is perhaps the only limitation of SBRC), once in the lead, all you need to do is put together a few good laps to create such a gap from your opponents that you can even crash three times and still remain in the lead. Conversely, when you fall behind and chase it is really difficult to recover, which could lead you to pause and start the race again in case of accidents in the first corner Technical realization Let's clarify one point immediately: the photos accompanying the article probably refer to the PC version of the game. On the other hand it is clear that they have been captured at much higher resolutions than those manageable by PS2, just take a look at the backdrops. However, Super-Bikes Riding Challenge on the Sony console is truly exceptional, and this not so much for the high fidelity reproduction of real bikes, but precisely for the locations. Everything is in high resolution, with some of the best textures ever seen. Don't be surprised if you can even read the road signs, or if the trees and buildings look very real to you. This title sets a new standard in this respect, and its only limitation is that so many elements are not handled equally superbly by an engine that works wonders for polygon count and texture definition, but which fails to move everything at 30 fps, still being very close to this value. The sound sector does everything to live up to the graphics, but it succeeds up to a certain point: the accompanying music is few and does not leave its mark, despite boasting excellent quality. The effects are realistic and functional, without particular notes of merit. Comment Super-Bikes Riding Challenge is a solid simulation that is very convincing and most importantly fun. Sometimes it happens that a game with excellent graphics and accurate control fails to involve the player, with the result of not being passionate and therefore having a minimum life expectancy. In this case, even those who are not passionate about motorcycling, or do not know 90% of the bikes that can be ridden, will be so taken that they will try in every way to complete the game. You really find yourself driving for the pleasure of it, and therefore we recommend the game to all enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts. Pros: Very good graphics Precise controls Full bodied and full of thickness Cons: A few fps more and it would have been a moving jewel Easy to lead, difficult to chase. How in reality? Sound not up to the graphics After the excellent Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo (SCAR), a driving simulator of great value with the addition of innovative arcade elements, Milestone has set to work to continue a discourse born on PC a few years ago with the Superbike motorcycle series. The target? Creating a new benchmark for two-wheeled racers.", "date": "2006-10-17", "grade": null}
