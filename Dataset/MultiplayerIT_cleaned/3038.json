Indeed, there was a time when the market was not dominated only by FIFA and PES, but there were other titles that set aside realism to represent this sport with a good dose of imagination. As we write the review of Super Soccer Blast our mind can't help but go back to those times, given the intention of the Unfinished Pixel development team to create an arcade soccer game in which fun and immediacy are the foundations. Certainly there is still room for a modern Sensible Soccer, given the not exactly exciting result obtained by other attempts, including the illustrious one of Dino Dini's Kick Off Revival. Thanks to the positive experience gained with Super Tennis Blast and Super Volley Blast, Unfinished Pixel therefore launches into the ~dangerous~ world of football with Super Soccer Blast. Let's see if this game really has what it takes to take us back in time. The modalities: nothing online The first aspect that stands out when navigating the Super Soccer Blast menus is the absence of an online mode, which therefore reduces the multiplayer possibilities to local experience only. Although the sofa is a timeless classic of the football genre, the idea of not being able to play via the Internet is highly limiting for Super Soccer Blast, which even in single mode offers few competitions in which to take part with the available teams. The latter are divided into nine clubs and sixteen national teams, obviously without being able to count on the presence of official licenses. However, the clubs are attributable by name and colors to the real ones, with the presence of Inter and Juventus as regards the Italian ones. Inside there are players with completely invented names, but at least familiar looking. Apart from the quick match and some competitions that mix things up a bit in their tournament or cup type formula, the options in terms of modes stop there. The gameplay: timed fun When it comes to taking the field, Super Soccer Blast looks as we expect. Immediate and with few commands, with the possibility of choosing a style similar to FIFA or PES as regards shooting and high passing. There are few keys to learn, those that are enough to pass the ball (there is also a through ball) or shoot when in possession, or tackle or slide when defending. While trying to understand what the weak points of the CPU are, the game also appears quite demanding, but in reality the time necessary to understand how to hurt opposing teams takes up a few games. Once you understand how to manage long shots and bicycle kicks, or how to take advantage of the fact that there are no cards, Super Soccer Blast becomes easily tackled even at the maximum difficulty level. The absence of bookings and expulsions is definitely felt, so such as the lack of even minimal team management, which allows for example to at least choose the module with which to take the field. But the thing that is missing most in the game created by Unfinished Pixel is, in our opinion, a component that makes it unique in its way of interpreting football, such as the spin shot of Sensible Soccer, for example, but also simply some particular animation such as those that are instead present in Super Volley Blast for shots. In short, the fun is limited to the initial few hours spent in the company of Super Soccer Blast, after which comes the feeling of having seen and experienced everything the game has to offer. Considering the price of 7.99 euros, it may even be okay, but to be able to really leave a mark, the effort should undoubtedly have been greater. Graphics and sound Super Soccer Blast's graphics are quite clean, with a style halfway between real and cartoony in which the players' features see the head a bit oversized. In these terms they recall the deformed style, without exceeding in this sense. For those who feel the desire to create new teams and competitions, it is possible to make use of the editor inside the game, quite nice and simple to use to the point of enticing the player to do some tests. Returning to the graphics in the game, the framing is the classic fixed one from midfield, from which we therefore see the two halves of the field in perspective. Only occasionally do players give the impression of being a little ~unstuck~ from the pitch, one of the recurring shortcomings of other soccer games similar to Super Soccer Blast. We report the presence of a small bug, fortunately abbastance rare, which allows players to teleport from one point on the field to another. Another bug we encountered is instead linked to the end of the game during a tournament: as soon as you return to the menu, it happens that you end up in the area dedicated to the competition, while other times you go back to the main screen having to re-enter the tournament to continue. There is little to report on the sound, while in the technical field another absence that is definitely felt is that of the replays after the goals.", "date": "2020-06-18", "grade": "6.0"}
