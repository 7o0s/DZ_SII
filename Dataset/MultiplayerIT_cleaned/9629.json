Specially designed for the touch-screen of the small Nintendo console, this brand has known only two episodes so far, but also the serious problem of repetitiveness: okay, the team that wins doesn't change, but it's also true that too much damage, to summarize in two trivialities the spirit of the spin-offs related to Pokmon, which are now really redundant and squeezed, edition after edition, to the last drop. If it is true that Pokmon Ranger is only in its third episode and there is still hope for a future that is not made up of clones and photocopies, it must also be said that Traces of Light does not try to be too convincing... Track that passes you Traces of Light does not differ in the slightest from the concept behind the series: once again our alter-ego will be a ranger engaged in a tough fight against a criminal organization intent on capturing pokmon for shady purposes. Unlike the mother series, in which players play a trainer hunting for pokmon, in Pokmon Ranger the Pok balls give way to the Styler, a particular device that allows rangers to temporarily tame pokmon by surrounding them with positive feelings so that they I trust humans. This mechanic, which all in all does not differ much from capture, is reproduced at the level of gameplay by literally tracing circles around the sprite of the pokmon on duty. However, he will not remain helpless and will try to counter us with his traditional attacks: the player will therefore have to operate carefully, avoiding receiving damage, otherwise the game will end. As in Shadows over Almia, also in this case it will be possible to modify and enhance the Styler with the points earned in ~battle~; moreover, it is possible to call for help one of the pokmon that make up our team to weaken our target, in case it is too fierce: in this case the traditional balance of elements of the GameFreak series comes into play, but this feature must be used carefully since if our partner is hit, he may abandon us and flee. In general, however, a very special Pichu armed with a ukulele is at our service: his music, which will be enhanced during the adventure, provides excellent support in battle, even if it would have been preferable to choose our partner as happened in Shadows over Almia. Monsters for friends The long-lived main-quest rattles off mainly through long explorations of the game world, but our road will often be blocked by particular obstacles that we will not be able to overcome without relying on our beloved pokmon. Basically, the powers of the various pokmon that will join us can be used to burn logs or put out fires, but once a pokmon's ability is used on the field, it will run away. Fortunately, Traces of Light is structured so that the pokmon needed to solve a given puzzle are never too far from it, making progression less frustrating than in the prequels. Furthermore, the powers of the pokmon are not only used to solve puzzles, but they can provide us with tactical support or other types of help, encouraging the collection of the little creatures in order to discover their peculiar abilities, so much so that at a certain point we will also get the trust and the support of some legendary pokmon that we can summon to overcome critical points. Unfortunately Traces of Light offers this formula for the entire duration of the adventure and despite the presence of short aerial or submarine sessions, at a certain point a bit of monotony takes over which makes the gameplay heavier than it should be. Fortunately, Traces of Light also has an interesting new feature for the series, consisting of a wireless multiplayer mode that allows you to download new quests and play them with up to three companions, controlled by an artificial intelligence or as many friends: in reality it is of really simple and fast missions, whose greatest attraction is represented by the possibility of obtaining some decidedly rare pokmon, such as Deoxys or Manaphy, and transferring them to the most recent generations of the franchise, HeartGold and Soulsilver or the triptych Diamond, Pearl and Platinum.", "date": "2010-11-22", "grade": "7.0"}
