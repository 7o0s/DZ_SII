This is the case of the hereby Colorblind - An Eye For An Eye, a platform developed directly by the British studio and available for a few days on the App Store: the game tells the story of a left eye, which discovers that it is colorblind following the kidnapping of his life partner (the right eye) by the evil pirates of the dust, bitter enemies of the eyeballs. A bizarre incipit that acts as a keystone for a gameplay based entirely on the exploitation of colors to change the scenario, and which gives us a pleasant title but probably not up to the best Nitrome productions. A bruschetta in the eye The adventure of the protagonist's left eye begins without getting lost in great tutorials, the game mechanics are so basic: the three virtual keys located in the lower part of the screen therefore allow the user to move the character left and right and make him jump to avoid obstacles and enemies who can defeat him with a simple contact. In Colorblind - An Eye For An Eye there is in fact no combat mechanics, and the design has entirely focused on the platform action and environmental puzzles to be solved through the use of color. The scenario is almost entirely in black and white, and the elements with which it is possible to interact are highlighted by immediately recognizable bright tones. Basically, passing over brushes of a certain color, the silhouettes of the objects of the same color become visible, so that they can be used to continue. For example, in order to walk over a bridge or platform whose outline is red, it is first necessary to look for the equivalent paint, a mechanism that also applies to coins which represent the only form of collectible available in the various levels. The challenge in Colorblind - An Eye For An Eye is therefore represented not only by the need to manage the various colors found within the scenarios (the protagonist can only recognize one at a time) but also by the waterfalls that strategically punctuate the settings and which wash off the dye when you pass through. Not that this makes the Nitrome title a hardcore platformer, on the contrary: the difficulty rate is definitely calibrated downwards, the solution of the puzzles is always very linear and the platform action rarely requires great precision in execution. Only the collection of all the coins can represent a small stimulus for the most savvy users, who otherwise will probably be able to see the end credits of Colorblind - An Eye For An Eye in a rather short time. In fact, the internships are not many and are in any case characterized by a reduced average duration, an aspect that for once makes the typical checkpoint ploy to be activated on average by paying currency in the game or viewing an advertisement completely superfluous. An uncommon oversight for Nitrome, usually very attentive to details of this type, which also got carried away in terms of the amount of commercials that interrupt the action, really massive and not entirely justified by the free to play nature of the title . As often happens, there is an option to disable them completely upon payment of a small amount of money, but it is a choice that we do not feel like recommending given the brevity of the experience and the fact that it is not exactly memorable. In fact, Colorblind - An Eye For An Eye behaves diligently and can be a pleasant pastime, but it is certainly not one of those mobile games that will make you drain your smartphone battery by playing games. The choice of a substantially monochromatic game world, then - however consistent with the gameplay - only exacerbates a feeling of repetitiveness that gradually becomes more consistent as the adventure continues. Even on the purely technical front, the Nitrome product does not show off that exuberance typical of the best releases of the British developer, putting pleasant graphics and sound on the plate but substantially without treble.", "date": "2018-04-17", "grade": "7.2"}
