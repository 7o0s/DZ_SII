Answer these two questions sincerely, then: have you played the first Danganronpa yet? Do you like visual novels? If the answer to the first question is yes, it probably is for the second question as well, and in that case we advise you to continue reading. If it is no to at least one of the two questions, we advise you to close this browser tab and dedicate yourself to something else. If you answered yes to the first question and no to the second, then you have a problem. One last option remains: you like visual novels but have never played the first Danganronpa. In this case, however, we advise you not to read further because Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a real sequel which, to be fully appreciated, requires a good knowledge of the characters and events of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. And if you like visual novels and haven't played the first Danganronpa, then this would be a good time to catch up. More cruel, more disturbing, more bizarre: Danganronpa 2 surpasses its predecessor The sun, the beach and blood Maybe it doesn't seem like it at first, but we guarantee you that Danganronpa 2 is hand-in-hand with the events and characters of the prequel: we are sorry to anticipate this detail of the plot, but it is essential that you understand how one cannot exist without the other, even because otherwise you would understand little or nothing about the ending. There's a silver lining: completing the story of Danganronpa 2 unlocks the visual novel Danganronpa IF, which offers an overview of the story and characters of Trigger Happy Havoc while depicting an alternative development and progression, a real ~ what if~ (hence the reason for the title) which will still appeal to those who have played the prequel. In short, there is no escape: to enjoy Danganronpa 2 you have to play the predecessor, released only a few months ago, or syrup its synopsis on Wikipedia. Which wouldn't be as fun, believe us, because if there is a field in which Spike Chunsoft (and the localization of NIS America, let's specify) wins hands down it is undoubtedly that of the script and dialogues. The story, moreover, starts from a premise very similar to that of the previous Danganronpa, with the pupils of Hope's Peak high school involved in a terrifying situation to say the least. The school welcomes the best exponents of this or that ~discipline~, but the protagonist of Danganronpa 2 - Hajime Hinata - does not remember in which he excels: his investigative skills, however, will allow him to solve the mysteries that will begin to surround him and the fifteen other schoolmates taken to Jabberwock Island for what will prove to be a horrific experiment. None of them will be able to leave the island, in fact, unless they manage to assassinate a comrade and get away with it. If the other students discover the identity of the murderer, he will be executed on the spot; however, should the accusations prove unfounded, the perpetrator will earn his freedom... at the cost of the lives of all his comrades. As we said, the premise is very similar: there is the protagonist wrapped in an aura of mystery, the perfidious and schizophrenic Monokuma and a selection of students who only apparently respect the stereotypes of Japanese culture, hiding unsuspected nuances and shadows. And there are also some incredible twists that will keep the players/readers in suspense, as long as they know English: not even Danganronpa 2 has been translated into Italian, in fact, and despite the English used being decidedly scholastic, who doesn't mastica could get bored immediately or have great difficulties especially during the more interactive phases of the game. PSVita trophies To collect the Danganronpa 2 trophies, it is not enough to complete the adventure, but also to maximize Hajime's relationship with his companions in his spare time, unlock the various skills, find all the collectibles and pass each test with the best results. As before, more than before From a gameplay point of view, Danganronpa 2 is practically a carbon copy of the prequel but has some improvements for the general benefit of the experience and the variety of situations. As in the first Danganronpa, life on the island is essentially divided into three phases: Daily Life is the moment in which the player is free to explore the island in search of collectibles and to socialize with his schoolmates to get to know them better and unlock various abilities that may come in handy in trials, while progressing through the story of Danganronpa 2. When you switch to Deadly Life, however, the going gets tough: in thesejunctures the game becomes a real investigative investigation in which you have to collect clues and examine each piece of evidence or crime scene to establish indicatively what happened and who could be the culprit on duty. Once you have reached a satisfactory amount of suspicions, you go directly to the Class Trial, the actual process in which the students of Hope's Peak get together and accuse each other. In this situation Danganronpa 2 becomes much more interactive: each process is a combination of mini-games that fully leverage not only the player's deduction and reading skills, but also his reflexes. Compared to the prequel, significant additions have been made aimed at making the processes even more engaging, starting with new mini-games entitled Logical Dive, Spot Select and Rebuttal Showdown. The first is a kind of snowboarding simulator in which you have to follow the right track based on the questions and answers of those present, in order to avoid falling - literally! - into the abyss of uncertainty. In the Rebuttal Showdown, on the other hand, the player must defend his hypotheses by slicing, with a swipe on the touch screen, the disputes of his interlocutor, taking advantage of the weak points in his statements to defeat him. Spot Select is the least interesting of the new minigames and relies on observation rather than understanding language. The other minigames have remained almost the same, but some have been slightly modified: the Bullet Time Battle, for example, is now called Panic Talk Action and requires more attention when building Hajime's accusations, while the old Closing Argument has been perfected to be clearer and more immediate. It follows that the processes, regardless of the outcome - which often turns out to be truly unpredictable and dramatic - are now even more compelling but also more complex, which is why the language represents an even greater obstacle for those who are not fluent in English, and not just in terms of general understanding of the story. As in Danganronpa, once the adventure is over, in addition to the aforementioned Danganronpa IF, the Island mode is also unlocked which allows you to ~experience~ the excursion of the boys to Hope Peak in total relaxation, like a sort of parallel dimension in which a drop of blood will be shed. In addition to this, Spike Chunsoft has even implemented a kind of ~tamagotchi~ mode and a bizarre stylized game, entitled Magical Girl Miracle Monomi, in which you control the rabbit-shaped puppet who acts as a creepy counterpart to the crazy Monokuma.", "date": "2014-09-03", "grade": "8.2"}
