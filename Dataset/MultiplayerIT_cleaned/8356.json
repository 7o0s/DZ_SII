{"name": "Tunic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tunic-recensione.html", "text": "It was originally called Secret Legend. Developer Andrew Shouldice started developing it in 2015, but only announced it at E3 2017, moreover with a new name, due to collaboration with publisher Finji. Renamed Tunic, despite being a small production, the material shown immediately aroused general interest, so much so that Microsoft came forward to obtain it as an exclusive console. The announcement of the agreement came at E3 2018. Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, the launch of the game has been postponed several times and for a few years the developer and publisher have wrapped it in a blanket of fog that never he let nothing more leak out to the outside, to the point that many even wanted it deleted. Luckily today you can read Tunic's review, a sign that it finally made it out. But was it worth waiting so long to be able to play this declared clone of The Legend of Zelda? History and legend All these years, but it was worth it, at least if you love Zelda clones Tunic's start is quite slow. The protagonist of the adventure is a fox shipwrecked on a strange island which is said to be full of great treasures, buried who knows where. It is a mysterious place full of strange creatures, structured like an immense labyrinth in which it is very easy to get lost. The fox doesn't have a map, all the writings she finds around are in a language that is incomprehensible to her (as it is to us players) and she doesn't have a real mission to follow. All she has to do is go around looking for something to help her get by, while studying how to reach the most remote areas of the island, the ones where the most precious possessions are supposed to be. In reality, it doesn't take long before he becomes the protagonist of a story linked to some legends of the place, told in a rarefied way throughout the entire game, through encounters with mysterious characters and the acquisition of skills that help him to better decode the place in which it is located. Meanwhile, there is the usual collection of objects with mystical powers, whose function is often mysterious, at least at first glance. We'll come back to it later. We mentioned The Legend of Zelda: Shouldice has never made a secret of what his main inspiration for Tunic was. The fox dresses similar to Link, wields a sword similar to Link, and uses a shield similar to Link. He also goes around cutting bushes and opening chests in a similar way to that of the protagonist of the Nintendo series, so much so that in some moments it seems to be faced with a kind of cosplay, rather than a character with his own strong identity. We will return to this point later. Inventory and map design There are plenty of mystical moments The impression of subjection to the Zelda series is enormous throughout the game, even in the moments in which Tunic manages to show off more. For example, there are objects with a similar function to some seen in the Nintendo series, such as bombs, or the aforementioned sword and shield pairing. Despite this, the progression is very different from the main source of inspiration, with the characteristics of the character changing according to the objects possessed. A decidedly original touch is that of being able to recover the pieces of a sacred book, which is nothing but a sort of official guide, created in the 90s style, complete with maps that greatly help one to orient oneself and explanations of many objects that are around, so you can better exploit their characteristics. Some of the explorable places are suggestive One of the strengths of Tunic is precisely the way in which the different regions that we will have to explore have been conceived. The basic idea of the map design revolves around the various checkpoints scattered around the game, the use of which is essential if you don't want to redo long gameplay pieces in case you get killed. Eager to frustrate the player, but not in the wrong way, Shouldice then rotated all the maps around the checkpoint statues, drawing continuous returns to them, so as to always give the player a way to save. But that's not all that makes them beautiful. Another reason of great interest in level design is the presence of countless secrets, which are found practically in every corner. Exploring is really rewarding and the work done in this respect is excellent. There is a bit of everything, starting from hidden chests that can be reached by following secret paths, to sections that require certain objects to be unlocked, to others that look like real mini puzzles. Combat system The feeling is that of Zelda The combat systemiment, on the other hand, is the weakest part of Tunic. It is essentially based on the alternation between parrying / dodging and attacking, where the player's skill lies in trying to find the right moment to hit the enemies. In reality, the former go down quite quickly, but advancing you meet armored creatures, others with shields and still others with attack patterns that require a certain skill to be neutralized. There is no shortage of flying monsters, turrets and all the other stuff that makes life difficult for action RPG heroes. However, what has annoyed us is not so much the system itself, essential but not contemptible, but how the enemy lock is managed, which has created more than a few problems for us. For example, one of the special objects that we will find during the adventure is a magic wand with which to cast spells (read ranged attacks). In theory with the lock, the fox should aim directly at the selected enemy, but we have often seen shots miss the target for mysterious reasons, even with the trajectory completely clear and even in the absence of evasion attempts by the victims. Another problem is the loss of the lock itself, which can occur during a fight for reasons that are not well understood, causing blows to fail, even those with a sword. What is hiding on this strange island? As often happens in these cases, practice amply compensates, but honestly we would have preferred a more stable system. Their enemies are not particularly smart and it is quite easy to come up with elementary tactics to deceive them. For example, it is possible to have them blocked under a ramp, or to have them end up on one of the many traps scattered throughout the levels, of which they seem to have no account. Basically they attack the fox head on, without considering what is around them. The bosses behave better, big and bad, who have complex attack patterns and offer a good challenge even to the most seasoned player. In particular some of the advanced ones are really difficult, even if less frequent than we would have hoped. They are not beautiful in characterization, apart from a few, but they do their job. Some technical notes During the game you collect the pages of a real official guide Graphically, Tunic is an excellent title. Needless to say, the scenario is very reminiscent of the Zelda series for colors, saturation of the same and for some stylistic choices, starting from those related to the appearance of the fox, to move on to that of the enemies. In short, despite the low-poly style and the use of depth of field to give an extra touch to the image, the feeling is that of being faced with a Zelda maybe even from this point of view. And perhaps this is precisely the main problem of Tunic, which prevents it from achieving excellence: as already mentioned, it lacks personality. It's a great Zelda clone. A loving and heartfelt tribute. Fans of the genre will certainly like it, but ultimately it leaves little or nothing and, after having finished it, one has the feeling of having lived a superfluous story, however well told.", "date": "2022-03-16", "grade": "7.8"}
