{"name": "Onde energetiche rabbiose", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72022-dragon-ball-raging-blast-onde-energetiche-rabbiose.html", "text": "Tested platform: Xbox 360After the disputed Burst Limit chapter, Namco Bandai retraces its steps and offers us a new game starring the super warriors born from the pen of Akira Toriyama, this time taking up and deepening the typical mechanics of the Budokai series which was so much appreciated in the past hardware generation. The intention of the developers with this Raging Blast was to propose a game that exponentially expands the features that have made the success of the Budokai episodes by focusing in particular on quantity and if at first glance one would think of the classic more of the same, pad in hand, one immediately realizes that, this time more than ever, there is really a lot of irons in the fire. First of all, let's start by analyzing Dragon Ball: Raging Blast as a whole: the game embraces the entire Dragon Ball Z animated series as well as many parallel sagas and some interesting alternative parentheses to the official story. Each strand of the narrative, characterized by the very famous super-villains, is divided into different clashes that follow the events seen on TV by thread and by sign, offering numerous fights in different situations and contexts so as to arrive at several hours of play to complete a macro-sequence. Adding to this the numerous alternative game modes to History such as online and offline tournaments or the various customized challenges, there are several clues regarding the completeness of the latest Namco Bandai effort. With shots of aura The heart of Dragon Ball: Raging Blast lies in the structure of its combat system so atypical that it clashes with the more canonical fighting games but which excellently reproduces the skills and dynamism that the famous animated series has made us known over the years. The meetings always take place in a canonical one-on-one in arenas whose very generous dimensions have no equal in any other fighting game, moreover, when narrative reasons require it, there are changes of characters in the middle of the battle so that a single fight can be continue even for several minutes, dividing into several parts linked together. Given the length of the clashes, the game requires the most reasoned approach to the action, moreover it is essential to establish a minimum of long-term tactics in order to be able to manage the energy of one's characters during the various scenes and obviate the advantage of the opponent who has a longer life bar. As per tradition, warriors have the ability to move 360 degrees along the scenario having the ability to fly and fight underwater without any limitation, if not the confines of the arenas themselves. All this makes the unfolding of the matches particularly dynamic and atypical, a sensation accentuated by the destructibility of the game environments, a feature that also has heavy implications on the gameplay, proving to be an excellent way to aggravate the damage inflicted on the opponent. On the battlefield you can resort to melee attacks, grips or the famous energy spheres which combined together offer a fair possibility of combos whose composition is directly borrowed from the action genre, the parry system that behaves is also particularly interesting in a different way depending on the different attack to be countered and the possibility of carrying out contextualized attacks on the environment that surrounds us, adding a further level of tactics to the whole, forcing the player to get to know the game environment thoroughly to exploit it to his own advantage. A depth and refinement certainly superior to the past therefore, cleverly masked behind that loud and confusing appearance typical of the epic clashes of the cartoon. Xbox 360 goals Given the many irons in the fire that the game offers and the considerable number of unlockable contents, the pursuit of the various achievements is also slow and demanding, in particular it is necessary to devote oneself to all the various types of game in order to obtain a decent hoard of gamerpoints. Kamehameha! Mastering the superhuman abilities of the characters does not prove to be a simple challenge for a neophyte of the genre, to complete a fight successfully it is essential to resort to the Super Attacks and Supreme Attacks typical of each wrestler who represent the most devastating and decisive offensive moves of the game and are entrusted to the four directions of the right analogue. These techniques can be performed using the energy of the aura, the latter can be loaded by hitting the opponent with standard attacks and combos or by using the down key of the directional cross, a faster but also risky method since it leaves your character defenselessduring the accumulation of energy, for this reason it becomes essential to be able to throw one's opponent away just enough to have the possibility of carrying out the right attack. A successful execution of these techniques is essential in the economy of the game, it is in fact prohibitive to complete the matches without their use, a feature that brings the game even closer to the work from which it is taken. Custom Saiyans Dragon Ball: Raging Blast offers a roster of 70 characters counting the unlockable ones and the various transformations. Each fighter boasts a unique fighting style that is reflected in the execution of special moves, in fact there are those who are more oriented towards energy attacks and those who are more oriented towards hand-to-hand combat, as well as the unique abilities of the various races they belong to. To increase this already enviable variety, a special editor intervenes which allows you to customize the parameters of each character through a checkerboard menu in which it is possible place certain pieces with different shapes and effects, and during the game there is the possibility of unlocking new super attacks that can be assigned to the right analog stick instead of the ones initially available. Considering that every single character has three different customization sets available, one can immediately realize how and how wide the ability to upset the balance and fighting styles of the game is. Much care has also been taken in the creation of different game modes in addition to the classic story, such as the numerous challenges that require the achievement of specific objectives, the dojo which also offers a tutorial as exhaustive as it is fundamental and the possibility of participating in and organizing tournaments both online and offline. To give further depth to the product, a fair amount of unlockable extras of any kind have been included, including, as already mentioned, new special moves to be used in combat. The feeling you get by playing Raging Blast is that of not having in your hands the classic homework carried out by the developers with the minimum effort to milk the fans of the brand but rather a product of undoubted concreteness, both in terms of content and mechanics. Furious animation If the spectacularity and dynamism of the clashes bring Raigin Blast very close to the Dragon Ball Z series, it is on the graphic front that the greatest progress has been made in this sense, so much so that by now the difference with the cartoon has become almost imperceptible. The modeling of the characters combined with the study of their movements have been excellently borrowed from those seen on television, including the ten available scenarios that reproduce the classic battle theaters of the series, only the rendering of the demolition of the rather approximate environments appears subdued. The rendering of the special shots is also of sure impact, enhanced by the direction that emulates the shooting of the anime, all done at 60 frames per second. Sore point instead with regard to the camera, which struggles to follow the frenzy of the action and sporadically loses sight of both the character controlled by the player and, much more often, the opponent, especially when the distances between the two contenders lengthen , which is far from uncommon during fights that can be negatively influenced in the outcome by the bad service that the camera offers to the player. The sound sector is of a completely different thickness, composed of original music and unpublished compositions created for the occasion, moreover the game offers the possibility to choose between the English dubbing and the original one in Japanese, which will certainly make you happy fans.", "date": "2009-11-09", "grade": "8.0"}
