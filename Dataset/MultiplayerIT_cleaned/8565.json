Released in Italian cinemas for a few days, the film narrates the spectacular battle between a hostile alien race intent on invading our planet and a heroic international naval fleet. The extraterrestrials arrive on Earth with a series of exploratory units, but during the landing their communication system is damaged and they are therefore unable to communicate with the planet of origin to coordinate further landings. To remedy the inconvenience, they decide to take possession of a station located in Hawaii equipped with a powerful space transmission center and activate a force field to isolate the area from any interference, without knowing that an important naval exercise is taking place a few kilometers away. which involves the most important nations of the world. Three destroyers, two American and one Japanese, remain inside the barrier and, once aware of what is happening, they launch an attack to thwart the invasion plans of the aliens. In the videogame the plot is basically the same, but for the Nintendo consoles (therefore Wii, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS) it was decided to entrust the development to Magic Pockets, the team that created some Bakugan tie-ins for DS, and to transform all in a turn-based strategy, thus renouncing the first-person dynamics that characterize the HD version instead. A choice in itself that is anything but negative, just think of the quality of titles such as Advance Wars, but which unfortunately has not been carried out with the necessary competence. It's your turn! After a short tutorial, Battleship throws us into the fray in a series of levels that will lead us to confront the alien fleet and unlock new ships to use in battle from time to time. The mechanics, as mentioned, are the traditional turn-based strategy ones, therefore we can move each of our units for a certain number of boxes on the map, more or less depending on their speed, and choose at the end of the maneuver whether to activate the defenses or attack a hostile vehicle in adjacent squares. The larger ships come with two types of attack, close range and ranged, plus the interesting ~duel~ mode. The latter involves switching to a first-person view in which we use the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote to deal the most damage possible to the opponent, firing the cannons on his turrets to prevent them from opening fire and destroying sensitive areas of the hull. In the more advanced stages, the ~duel~ mode becomes quite demanding and it becomes very difficult to finish it without taking damage in turn, while in general the accuracy of the pointer proves to be decent but not exceptional and it will happen more than once to miss the target despite the efforts. In each of the available missions our goal is generally to identify and eliminate enemy units, but there will be times when we simply have to reach a certain position on the map (perhaps clearly outnumbered) or resist the onslaught of a hostile team until upon the arrival of reinforcements. Within the scenario we will often find stations that allow us to release new ships of various types, from models expressly designed for battle to support ones, which provide us with fuel and ammunition. Struck and sunk The Battleship interface is controlled via the d-pad and the main buttons of the Wii-mote, so the infrared pointer is only used in the aforementioned Duel mode. The reasons for this choice, honestly, remain mysterious: making a turn-based strategy on Wii without taking advantage of its peculiar input devices is a bit like shooting yourself in the foot. Moreover, the arrangement of the buttons is not as immediate as one would expect, and so it sometimes happens to operate the wrong command at the end of the turn instead of simply passing the ball to the opponent. At least it is possible to speed up the sequences by activating instantaneous movements from the options screen, so as not to wait for all the pieces to be moved every time. Unfortunately, the single player campaign is the only game mode available, which means that once completed (and it won't take who knows how long, also thanks to a not very high level of challenge) Battleship will have nothing to offer other than the possibility to replay the missions already completed to get a better evaluation.The picture of a not exactly spectacular tie-in is completed by the technical sector, purely functional to the action and therefore unable to stand out in any respect.", "date": "2012-04-27", "grade": "S.V."}
