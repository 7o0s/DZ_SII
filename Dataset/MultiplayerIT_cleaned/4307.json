Eight years after the last numbered title, God of War III to be exact and a full five years after the last episode released on a home console, Ascension, considered by many to be the lowest point reached, in terms of quality, of the entire franchise . In this long, very long juncture, we have witnessed a change of generation (and a half if we consider the Pro versions of the consoles), the incredible success of Nintendo, a process of maturation, and perhaps even of flattening, of the entire gaming sector. 'entertainment. The productions have polarized: small independent jewels that seek to carry forward innovations on the artistic and gameplay fronts are opposed to the mega Triple A productions which, today more than ever, must possess certain production values and fulfill a whole series of expectations that the mass player, the one who does the numbers, has well in mind when he prepares to shell out 70. This preamble seemed necessary to better frame this review of the new God of War. Because ever since its astonishing announcement that shocked everyone at E3 in Los Angeles 2 years ago, it immediately became clear why Sony had decided to completely change a franchise that had made familiarity and the concept of ~more of the same~ of the characteristics of the product. But when you change everything, does nothing really change as a popular saying goes? In the opinion of the writer, this is not quite the case and even if this new God of War, made on PS4 as always by the boys of the Santa Monica studio this time with the direction of Cory Barlog, the director of the second chapter, is an exceptional title under many points of view, fails to rise to the rank of absolute and essential masterpiece. Plot and Characters: make way for young people In technical terms, the design operation carried out with this new God of War is called a soft reboot, and can easily be compared to what Ubisoft did with Assassin's Creed Origins. It is in fact, to all intents and purposes, a sequel given that in chronological terms and in terms of knowledge of the protagonist, the game assumes the existence of the previous chapters, but most of the basic elements of the gameplay, the setting and the narrative structure, forcefully depart from the tradition of the series. What we are faced with, at the start of the campaign, is an aged Kratos weighed down by age, with a long, thick beard. Olympus and the Greek gods are a distant memory because, in a sort of self-imposed exile, he decided to go to Norway keeping the utmost secrecy about his past and his troubled life story, confiding exclusively in his partner. Just the death of the latter will kick off the long journey of Kratos in the company of his son Atreus, along the lines of any road movie, through a part of the nine kingdoms of Nordic mythology. As it is easy to imagine, the situation will get complicated almost immediately forcing the Ghost of Sparta to have to deal with an antagonist of divine origins and the small gang in tow. In addition to a representation of lesser creatures, these too expertly drawn from the vast Norse literature. To keep this God of War review completely spoiler free, we will avoid saying anything else about the plot, instead focusing on the total change of register as regards the narrative and in particular the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. God of War in this respect respects and fully undergoes the ~Naughty Dog treatment~: the work done by the popular Californian software house on the Uncharted series and in particular on The Last of Us has in fact become a point of reference that many productions of the latter two generations have tried to pursue. A plot with deep dialogues, well-defined protagonists and supporting actors, narrative arcs that are easy to follow but still able to arouse emotions and above all a directorial cut capable of blending perfectly with the gameplay through cutscenes that enter and exit the game phases without solution of continuity. And it must be said: the result works because even if at the beginning finding a Kratos so profound, internally conflicted, able to express himself with words as well as with punches, often hiding behind an aura of impenetrable mystery displaced us, there is no doubt that for the whole adventure, it is precisely his stage presence and in particular the whole evolution of the relationship with Atreus, to always keep the player's interest alive. The link between the two is credible and coherent and we will see it go through many phases, all of them, however discontate, absolutely convincing. In purely informative terms, know that it took us just over thirty hours to complete the campaign. Unfortunately, in the absence of specific counters, we cannot be more detailed but taking into account the exploration percentages of the kingdoms, we feel comfortable in affirming that, to complete everything 100%, we would have needed at least another dozen hours. While it goes without saying, God of War is single player only and has a single ending. Setting: open spaces Let's start immediately with the age-old dilemma: is this God of War an open world or not? Depends. It depends on how you define this feature. If you are among the fundamentalists who see only The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild respectful of this feature, then no, it is not. If, on the other hand, you use the concept of open world to differentiate titles that do not offer a pure linear navigation experience, then God of War is certainly an open title, at times with various characteristics typical of open worlds. What is certain is that it moves away with enormous force from the past of the series and also from those hybridization attempts made, for example, by Naughty Dog with the latest Uncharted which in a couple of contexts offered much larger and freely explorable sections. Wanting to necessarily make a comparison, here we are from the parts of a Rise of the Tomb Raider. Outside of a strongly linear incipit and a couple of more guided sections, this God of War offers a very large and freely explorable setting with the classic Zelda-esque ploy that assumes that certain sections and treasures are accessible only after unlocking some power-ups through the continuation of the storyline. There is a lot of exploratory backtracking, there is fast travel (which is initially very limited), there is a means of locomotion that can be used at one's discretion (the infamous boat) and above all there are other additional maps, some unlockable optionally through collectibles, which broaden the game's setting significantly. This rosewater open world relies on a new mission system: alongside the main campaign, it is possible to carry out favors that are to all intents and purposes secondary quests and a very long series of collectibles which, alongside the more standard incremental tests related to enemies killed and how to execute them, they include treasure maps and various elements related to exploration and meeting with special bosses to face. All strictly optional but essential for grinding issues especially when you decide to increase the difficulty level. The inevitable RPG mode Today it is almost impossible to think of a triple A that does not have some role-playing element integrated into its gameplay and God of War is no exception to this great truth. We have access to three pieces of Kratos armor and a single Atreus robe, all of which can be purchased or produced by the two blacksmith dwarves who will follow us throughout the adventure and, on very rare occasions, recoverable from the chests scattered throughout the game. The equipment can also be upgraded and can sometimes house bezels where to insert spells, also the object of loot and sale. As for the Leviathan, the bow of Atreus and the only other weapon that we can find during the campaign, we have access to a single equipment slot (the handle of the weapon) and inserts for runes. All these elements contribute to the improvement of the six stats that determine the value in battle of Kratos. If we exclude strength, vitality and defense, which are quite self-explanatory, the other three values affect the damage and reload speed of special shots, and experience gain. Yes, because there is also the classic experience. In fact, if the whole part of crafting and upgrading relies on silver and the resources that we will be able to collect by killing the larger enemies or by facing the two extra activities included in the two optionally unlockable realms, the skills of Kratos and Atreus and the management of the runes, are related to the process of growing experience. The skills are divided into three trees that become four later and relate to weapons, unarmed and shield combat, and Atreus' proficiency with the bow and arrows. There is nothing particularly revolutionary on this front, but XP can also be spent on improving the runes equipped on weapons, forcing us to make customization choices in the intermediate stages of the game. Runes are fromlight and heavy type and represent, to all intents and purposes, special shots that Kratos can use in battle respecting their cooldown. These are attacks of great impact, often accompanied by slow motion and pyrotechnic graphic effects but which in no way alter the ~basic~ functionality of the equipped weapon. The difficulty levels of the new God of War In our review session we faced the God of War released in 2018 with the second level of difficulty out of the four available, the one marked as ~a balanced experience~. We initially tried to use the third one, but right away the challenge seemed excessive to us especially in light of the limited time available. There is a further degree, called ~the real God of War~ where, in addition to almost always dying with a single blow inflicted by enemies, the title significantly increases the attack patterns of enemies and their ability to dodge Kratos' blows or to become even more aggressive in simultaneous attacks. It is possible that those who decide to face the game at its maximum difficulty may find the limitations to the combat system highlighted in this review partially mitigated, due to the need to use every single tactic in an attempt to overcome the clashes unscathed. Fights and Enemies: When Everything Changes If up to this point it is practically evident how much this new God of War has been enhanced in every element with very positive results - it is bigger, longer lasting, more narrated, deeper, more customizable - it is in the moment in which we focus on combat and on the enemies that things become less univocal in the judgment. The total change of view has led the game to transform from a pure action, almost on the border of a hack & slash, complete with an indicator of the completed combos and a fixed camera, to a third-person tactical action with an unobstructed view over the shoulders , perfectly in line with current trends. The movement is slower, although never wooden, but it carries important limitations, such as the impossibility of keeping an eye on the entire battlefield, relegating the perception to the use of visible indicators and the continuous screams of Atreus blows coming from behind. For the rest, the mechanics are based on the classic elements that we find in action RPGs: there are the blows inflicted by the equipped weapon or from a distance through Atreus, the rapid dodge and somersault, the parry complete with a counter move if activated at the right time, the stunning of enemies indicated by a second bar alongside that of life and which is influenced by blows based on the type of resistance of the opponent. When the latter value reaches the maximum, the enemy can be taken by Kratos starting a small execution cutscene or a quick time event that allows you to inflict a certain number of hits before the enemy awakens. The problem is that, once you have matured a certain number of hours on the battlefield, you realize that the combat system is actually a hybrid that fails to fully satisfy the most demanding player. In fact, if that idea of Japanese-style action that tried to bring God of War closer to the various Devil May Cry, Godhand or Bayonetta has been completely lost, on the other hand this sequel does not even fully become a Souls like because the attention to the attack patterns is very small and everything is resolved in giving priority to the various targets by continuously dodging incoming attacks. The set of moves is limited and very slow in its growth and evolution and after about ten hours you will realize that you only ever need to use few attack combinations to continue. Nothing to say instead about the sensation of impact and the feedback of the blows, and more generally about the choreography of the clashes. Instead, the management of Atreus convinced us: the boy has quite aggressive behaviors and always participates in the clashes independently by distracting his opponents, strangling them to help us with the attacks and always being very effective in throwing arrows. These, in addition to being managed automatically by the character, can be controlled directly with the press of a button and are crucial both for allowing you to target and hit a specific type of enemy, and for slowing down and stunning all opponents. And we conclude the paragraph that will surely make you discuss more in the comments, with an analysis of the enemies that perfectly joins the criticalities of the combat system. In fact, where God of War sins unequivocally is in the variety of opponents and in the loss of that epic aura that permeated the clashes of the series. The", "date": "2018-04-12", "grade": "9.0"}
