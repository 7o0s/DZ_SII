And at the heart of CyberConnect2 has certainly remained Tail Concerto, an action adventure released in 1999 for PSone which laid the foundations for Solatorobo: Red the Hunter, indicated by many as its ideal sequel. The protagonist of this new adventure is Red Savarin, a bounty hunter who travels the world aboard the Asmodeus airship together with his little sister Chocolate, earning a living by completing more or less dangerous missions for those who can afford his fares. The world in which Red moves is very different from ours: people look like anthropomorphic cats and dogs, and the cities they live in are gigantic floating islands. In such a wonderful setting, it's hard to think evil could lurk; yet so it is: the powerful boss of a large organization has launched his troops on the attack to find a series of magical stones that could allow him to dominate the world. Red is hired by a mysterious boy, Elh, rescued during one of his missions, to recover these stones before the ~bad guys~ do. But what is Elh's secret? Why are these stones so important? What is behind all this story? We will find out through two distinct single player campaigns, each made up of ten chapters. Weightlifting There are two souls of Solatorobo: Red the Hunter: on the one hand the narrative structure, very well told, capable of conquering us after a few minutes and even of expressing some original concept within a genre in which everything has now been told; on the other hand the action phase, which is expressed in the missions that Red must complete to earn money but above all to level up, the latter element which in full RPG style becomes a fundamental requirement to be able to continue the adventure. As new characters and subplots are introduced, the scenarios multiply and with them the possible destinations of the Asmodeus, whose cockpit basically acts as the starting screen for our games, complete with a save option (but the save point in the title of CyberConnect2 certainly not lacking) and suggestions for the next step to take based on the latest developments. The peculiarity of the character we control is that he moves almost exclusively on board his powerful robot, DAHAK, equipped with mechanical arms that can deliver very rapid blows but reveal exceptional strength when it comes to lifting a heavy object. And it is precisely on lifting that the game's combat system is based: Red and his robot must from time to time avoid the attacks of the enemy on duty, then lift him by repeatedly pressing the A button (for a period of time that varies depending on the caliber of the opponent) and finally throw him to the ground. The maneuver is very simple, but it can be made more effective by ringing combos: if we make a jump before throwing the enemy, the damage inflicted will be greater; but we will be able to grab it again after it has touched the ground, taking advantage of its ~rebound~, and repeat the operation three times in a row. The same solution allows us to catch bullets on the fly and send them back to the sender, or use any object as a throwing weapon. The beauty of exploration The airborne cities of Solatorobo: Red the Hunter are full of mysterious areas, which Red can explore both aboard DAHAK and on foot. Throughout the story, the bounty hunter will come into contact with a series of characters that will allow him to collect various objects around, such as photographs or sounds, to use them respectively in the context of a gallery or to compose music. In the presence of a ~glitter~, therefore, we'd better get off the robot and take a look... The flea in the ear As new scenarios and new quests are unlocked, we will invariably find ourselves in the situation of having to level Red to reach a certain rank, in order to allow him access to a certain key mission. To achieve this, we will have to go to the local recruiter (always the same girl, whatever the city), check the available jobs and accept the one that best suits us. There are eighty missions in all, perhaps not many by RPG standards but characterized by a good variety and therefore certainly more fun than slavishly repeating the same sequences, even when they are ~disguised~ to look different. Completing a mission involves earning money, which Red can spend on purchasesKing new parts for his DAHAK and upgrade its strength, hydraulics, defense and mobility. The upgrade management system is very simple but prevents us from immediately becoming monsters, given that the various ~blocks~ that free up the positions for the upgrades must be eliminated by spending points that can only be found by exploring the maps well and opening each chest or trunk. Speaking of exploration, in some situations our character must necessarily be separated from his robot, remaining almost completely defenseless (Red only has a stun gun to slow down enemies). However, the puzzle stages that require this turn out to be short, just long enough to flick a couple of switches. From a certain point of view we are sorry that the developers did not take advantage of Red's vulnerability to design some more difficult than average situations, given that the challenge level of the game as a whole is far too low and one never finds oneself facing really complicated situations. The feeling therefore prevails that Solatorobo: Red the Hunter is a very ~light~ experience, undoubtedly very pleasant even if tainted by some largely avoidable limits (the dialogues, translated very well into Italian, are often unnecessarily long-winded and cannot be skipped) . On the technical front, however, the work done borders on perfection: the CyberConnect2 guys made use of the collaboration of first-rate names for the animated sequences (the Madhouse studio), for the character design (Nobuteru Yuki, who worked on Chrono Cross and anime like Escaflowne, Captain Harlock, Battle Angel Alita...), for the mecha design (Yoshitake Taniguchi, known for the Super Robot Wars series) and for the music (entrusted by Chikayo Fukuda and Seizo Nakata). The end result is stunning in some respects, among the best things ever seen on a Nintendo DS. The 'zones' shown on screen without loading aren't huge in size, but they boast truly excellent detail and style, with very little fuss when it comes to integrating with Red's movement within them.", "date": "2011-07-08", "grade": "8.0"}
