{"name": "FIFA 22", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-22-recensione.html", "text": "However it turns out, 2021 will be remembered as a watershed for sports video games. It will be the year in which Konami has broken the duopoly with FIFA, trying the path of free-to-play. It will also be the year in which two experiences were presented which aim to snatch a slice of this very rich market. In all this chaos, EA Sports remains immovable, thanks to the millions of gamers who trust it every year and guarantee it the necessary funds to assemble the most complete product on the market. This does not mean that the American giant and its Canadian division are sitting on their hands, only that for the moment, also due to their quasi-monopoly position, they seem to be the least inclined to embrace revolutions, experiments and the new trends on the market. In the FIFA 22 review we will find out how the development of the game has therefore been very linear and has mainly focused on trying to evolve and enrich what worked last year, with some corrections from the gameplay point of view and a further step forward from the technological point of view. We are essentially faced with last year's framework, enriched and renewed just enough to convince millions of players to invest their days and above all their hard-earned savings in Ultimate Team and other game modes. Personalization A custom stadium from FIFA 22 The leitmotiv of FIFA 22 is customization. For reasons of inclusion, given that in this way everyone is free to express their self within almost all game modes, a bit for commercial reasons. Between aesthetic objects belonging to the most famous brands and those dedicated to upcoming EA video games, the developer has managed to insert products for commercial purposes into the game in the most painless way possible. The classic two birds with one stone. Because it is true that in this way Volta has become a sort of digital catalog of the latest sportswear or the most recent sneakers, but this can only make the gamer happy who in this way can dress his soccer player (or soccer player) in the most imaginative and stylish as possible... or do like us and show the world a style worthy of the Derelicte fashion collection, the new brand from Magatu. In FUT, thanks to the ability to customize the stadium, EA has introduced banners and banners that praise Battlefield or its other games. Thus one can not only make one's stadium as crazy as possible, but one can also show one's tastes and tendencies in a completely free way. This is because you can both try to create something coherent with your club, but also try to make everything as crazy as possible. The options (especially for the original stadiums, with the real ones you have much less leeway) are many and rather imaginative and we are sure that more and more themed customizations will arrive in the coming weeks. Volta changes face Tennis soccer is one of Volta's minigames in FIFA 22 What was the breaking mode of a few editions ago, in FIFA 22 continues to make sense thanks to this renewed social side. Volta Football, in fact, around a structure of mini-games and fast-paced matches to be played on ~street~ pitches, has become the place where you can meet up with friends to have fun with football-themed party games and to dress up the own alter ego in the most stylish way possible. The attempt to include the ~street soul~ in FIFA 22 has somehow got lost: Volta's first game was played in the dusty alleys of a Brazilian favela, where the greatest carioca footballers honed their imagination and their technique. Volta's first match in FIFA 22 was played in a glittering ~stadium~ in Milan, with people with absurd names and dressed in an incredibly flamboyant way, as well as apparently very uncomfortable. Even ~football~ is no longer the heart of the experience, but a whole series of skill tests and mini-games to be enjoyed with other people. All fun and colorful, but they make it clear how EA is looking for a new path for this component of FIFA: for the moment it has found that of arcade entertainment, complete with superpowers to be activated after completing a certain number of dribbles and spells. Create a star A FIFA 22 soccer player prepares to shoot The development of one's avatar in Volta follows the same - renewed - rules of the Pro Clubs and of the Career Mode of a single player. In other words, the athlete's physical and technical abilities will no longer develop, which instead will grow based on the skills that arewe will block. There are 6 skill trees (plus one dedicated to goalkeeping) to choose from, allowing you to build each player's skills. By opting for skills of a certain type, you will end up corresponding to a certain archetype of footballer, something that will guarantee further specific bonuses. In any case, each player has perks that can be unlocked during the game that can enhance certain personal or team aspects. Defenders will be able to improve their teammates' defensive skills in the final minutes, while forwards will get shooting bonuses, and so on. In Volta, moreover, as we said, there are also special moves such as the super shot, the super speed and the super drive to give further spice to the games. The Pro Clubs are decidedly more simulative, where you can create a player (with a system very similar to the other modes) to face 11 against 11 matches with other human opponents. Again, customization is the order of the day, while EA has worked to make it a little easier to play and hang out with others. Career Modes continue on the track of what is expected of them, with some changes that improve the quality of life, such as more agile menus and a greater range of options available, such as the ability to customize the stadium for managers or the possibility of experiencing the locker room for the players. For the latter there are dynamic objectives to be respected in order to rise faster in experience and in the hierarchies of the team, even if they are not always very in line. Asking, for example, a central defender to score a goal from outside in his debut match, especially as a substitute, and give a penalty because we didn't succeed is not really the best choice to help out. Indeed, it seems an attempt to throw a spanner in the works. FUT The FIFA 22 Division Rivals will give prizes both on a weekly basis and at the end of a season As per tradition, the mode that has undergone the biggest changes is FIFA Ultimate Team. Which should come as no surprise, given that it is by far the most played and most profitable (and also the most targeted by Swedish regulators and players) of all FIFA 22. If the backbone is always the same and will ask you to gradually build a competitive team by buying and selling the stickers of the players in order to assemble the closest eleven possible, the way of playing FUT has radically changed. EA, in fact, wants to try to maintain the same level of challenge, while easing the time barriers. Prizes will continue to be won on a weekly basis and the Weekend Leagues will always be played on the weekend, but two great innovations have been created designed for those who have less time to dedicate to FIFA 22. The first is the introduction of the Seasons, something that it also allows those who don't play intensely every week to accumulate game prizes. The second is the ability to play for access to the FUT Champions playoffs whenever you want and not necessarily during the same week. In this way you can decide to face this appointment when you are sure you have the necessary time and tranquility to do it calmly. The same mechanism is also used for Squad Battles. The rest are less impactful changes, such as the introduction of an elite rank where the best players in the world will be able to challenge their peers or the elimination of fatigue from the FUT parameters, an element that is not very fun to take into account between one game and the next . The preview packages are also back, the trick that EA has thought up to try not to incur the wrath of legislators who are increasingly worried that their constituents' children spend too much money on microtransactions. In addition to worrying that the billions that EA earns do not enter (minimally) even in their pockets... On the playing field Also this year the FIFA 22 gameplay highlights spectacular stops and numbers like the one in the photo From a technological point of view, FIFA 22 is one of the best sports games on the market. Thanks to the improvements contained within the name of Hypermotion Technology, the game moves in a much more convincing way than in the past, thanks to a very varied and well-designed set of animations, capable on the one hand of giving more personality to the most famous soccer stars , on the other hand, to enrich the variety of shots available to all players, including goalkeepers. In fact, the extreme defenders are much safer than in the past and able to get their hands on many more balls, safeguarding the goal from the many incursions by the attackers. Unless using a striker with a very high shooting parameter (like Ronaldo or Messi): in thisIn this case the goalkeepers always get the little arm and score goals in a disarming way, with the ball passing a few centimeters from their body. As we have already said, in fact, from a gameplay point of view, the game has remained unchanged (and who would upset such a sold product?), with a strong emphasis on the offensive phase and the more spectacular side of the game. This means very fast and very precise passes, lightning-fast dribbling and a frenzied pace made up of reversals in front that make the midfield practically superfluous. We can try to remedy all this by acting on the renewed management of tactics - now divided between with and without the ball and modulated according to the attitude on the pitch -, pulling back the defense and trying to intercept the balls, but for a philosophical choice always rewards the attack and the possibility of scoring goals. This can be understood from the fact that the defenders, if made an out of time intervention, lose several meters of ground, while the attackers have the new explosive snap, that the containment seems to deliberately mistake the defender's position to leave the goal gap open for a shot or a dribble and such elements. The FIFA 22 tactics screen It is a philosophical question, which rewards asphyxiating the opponents with full-field pressing for 90 minutes (obviously effective only in the opponent's half), continuous running, passing networks, shots and dribbling. The only therefore, the way to defend is to try to do it yourself, closing the gaps that are created and trying to pressure the opponent to take the ball before it does too much damage. The gameplay, in fact, in attack is still very physical based with the most powerful players (Lukaku, but also CR7) who make the difference and get the better of practically any ball. In this case it is necessary to act on the instructions of the individual players to try to limit their runs in attack, hoping that once in a while they are between the attacker and the goal and not running after the latter. as we said, it is a very specific choice, a choice that shouldn't surprise the regulars of the series, given that it is on these foundations that the gameplay of FIFA has been based for many years now. Personally we would have liked a slower and more balanced gameplay, in which fatigue is felt and technical errors find space, more in line with the European style, but EA Sports wants us to score goals, as well as put the fate in the hands of the players of the match. From this point of view, FIFA 22 offers a lot of freedom, with the best players and with the most articulated fingers who will be able to do many things, such as protecting the ball, dribbling well, making high through balls, tensing, precision shots, stops following. There are many moves available, all very effective, but for a novice all this freedom could even be frightening, with the same key that can change the purpose several times in one action. It will always be possible to activate aids, but to play online you must necessarily learn to tame the controls. Those who do will be able to perform elegant dribbling, sumptuous field changes, also thanks to the renewed physics of the ball, much more realistic. Thanks to him, it will be possible to make new and more effective high balls and crosses, but you will also see more realistic carambola and more varied shots, even if almost always directed towards the goal in a powerful and precise way, it does not matter whether you try a volley shot or from 30 meters. However, there are anomalous behaviors on which EA still has to work. Elements that can certainly lead to frustration, such as defenders who are less reactive than one would expect, too effective crosses at the far post and a certain woodenness in the goal kick, which could lead to too easy goals conceded to the attackers. Technically speaking Kyllian Mbapp is one of the best played footballers in FIFA 22 The arrival on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S has allowed EA Sports to evolve its graphics engine, in order to give FIFA 22 an even more cinematic look. Excellent replays, close-ups and shots of the stadium contribute to making the experience even closer to what we see on television. The work with the faces and bodies of the most famous athletes is also valid, a pity that with all the other EAs it has not even tried and the gap between the players scanned and the others is embarrassing, with the former completely anonymous and almost unrecognizable. Good debut by Daniele Adani alongside Pierluigi Pardo in the commentary. The sentences are well acted and funny, too bad they tire after not long. Note of merit for the Italian edition of FIFA 22, fully dubbed and adapted in the", "date": "2021-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
