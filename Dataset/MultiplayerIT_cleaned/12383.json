After the little success Generals, even disowned by the fans of the series, the dear and old NOD brotherhood and the always upright and just GDI, their skirmishes and the colossal Mammoths were somewhat missed. Starship Troopers? So, after years of long waiting, the real sequel of the series has finally arrived, called Tiberium Wars, which really wants to take the nostalgics back to 1995 and, why not, emulate the deeds of the first chapter, trying to become the new milestone for future generations. Ambitious project? Never like that of the disillusioned Kane... The plot sees you return as an anonymous Commander in the distant 2047, when by now the NOD brotherhood was definitively defeated during the Second Tiberium War and the most total peace reigns over the world. Peace destined to last very little, when a sudden NOD attack reopens the old disputes to the sound of Ion Cannons and Nuclear Warheads: so far the classic plot of the series, but unexpectedly a new faction appears on the war scenario, the Scrin , unsociable aliens who have come from who knows where to bring about (coincidentally) the destruction of Humanity. One might wonder why these extraterrestrials hate the Earth to such an extent that they face a journey through the space of tens and tens of light years and endless queues at the toll booths, only to be eliminated anyway: Tiberium Wars does not provide us with answers to these interesting questions , but it limits itself to bringing a new playable faction into the videogame duo, to the delight of all fans. It must be admitted that the plot is certainly not something exciting, but the interludes shot using flesh and blood actors make their reappearance: EA, for the occasion, has enlisted an exceptional cast, including Michael Ironside , already seen in Top Gun, and Jennifer Morrison, the assistant of the sympathetic Doctor House: needless to say that for the over 90 minutes of high-resolution footage you will have the impression of being in front of a film, which, while not shining for scripting , undoubtedly allows for greater involvement and manages to convey that peculiar taste that made the fortune of the first Command & Conquer. Even the eye wants its Ion Cannon If seeing Dr. Cameron as head of GDI intelligence wasn't enough, you certainly won't be less impressed by admiring the quality of Tiberium Wars graphics. From a 2007 title one could not expect better; all clashes will be a riot of particle effects, debris thrown into the air by violent explosions and distortions caused by our ion weapons: a gratifying aspect, which will transform the battlefield into something colorful and truly pleasant to see, as well as giving you a little personal satisfaction when you see whole buildings collapse under the powerful blows of your army. It's just a pity that, with the precise intention of keeping the classic feeling of the series intact (and probably to mask a classic limitation of the SAGE engine), the minimum zoom is too little ~minimum~. That is, it happens on several occasions to feel embarrassed due to the impossibility of having a vision of the playing area from a greater distance. The same attention to effects has been placed in the modeling: the units are made with extreme care and, at the highest zoom level, you will be able to notice even the smallest details; for example, taking off your jet planes, you will not be able to notice the thin heat trails of the engines, which slightly distort the surrounding area, or observe the dust raised by a strong explosion. The reverse side of the medal are substantially high system requirements: although EA states that a 64 MB video card (ATI 8500 or NVIDIA 6100) is enough, in the most advanced missions with these configurations the title is absolutely unplayable, especially when many units are accumulated on the screen, thus dropping your framerate to historic lows: we advise you to have at least a 7800 or 1800 to be able to enjoy this chapter to the fullest and if you are considering replacing your GPU, Tiberium Wars is an excellent reason to do so. Words, however, do not do justice: to appreciate the excellent graphic quality, we invite you to see the videos made availableavailable in our Download section and the images in the Gallery. Back to the Past But the graphics are not the strength of an RTS: in terms of gameplay, this third chapter limits itself to re-proposing the same, identical game mechanics of its 1995 forerunner, without making any relevant introduction. It may seem like an unwise choice on the part of EA, especially in the light of the innovations brought about by recent strategists, but simplicity, if it doesn't fall into banality, isn't necessarily a bad thing: in the first place, a frenetic gameplay is reintroduced, which will hardly leave you rest for more than a few minutes, making game sessions truly adrenaline-pumping, especially if set to a high level of difficulty. Among other things, the missions will hardly reach the hour of duration, very often settling on 30 minutes and this makes the gameplay very tasty and immediate in its fun. In fact, do not think that C&C3 is a trivial ~gather resources, amass troops and rusha~, but you will be asked to carefully meditate on your tactical choices: victory will not be achieved by simply building the most powerful unit, because even an entire platoon of these can be blown away without much difficulty; then the tried and tested system of the Chinese morra is taken up and improved, which for years has been the backbone of any real-time strategy; you will therefore have to have in mind the primary objective of your mission and only after a quick intelligence work will you be able to choose the best composition for your army: the worst situation is to find yourself with dozens of expensive Mammoth tanks, quickly made pieces from enemy aviation... Wrong area... The more astute could already think of the evergreen ~mixed army~ (which is not a salad, to be precise), but also in this case the developers have put a substantial brake: the resources of Tiberium, the only resource present in the game, are limited, although they have a slow regeneration coefficient, closing you the possibility of amassing hundreds of units to face any possible situation. To demolish the latest style of play (after that of the rush and the storer), in C&C3 you won't even be able to armor behind a base full of defenses: first of all because you will need numerous and indispensable energy plants, terribly fragile to any attack, and secondly because the superweapons cannot be blocked (as instead happened in Supreme Commander): ~turtle~ behind dozens and dozens of missile launchers is therefore a dangerously double-edged sword: just destroy your plants to put kneeling the entire base, leaving it at the mercy of your opponents. The will of the developers is evident: to avoid, as far as possible, that the user gets stuck on a single style of play, allowing him to get out of any situation by always and only resorting to a certain strategy: and it is precisely this insecurity that makes each of the 35 extremely adrenaline-pumping missions. These computers are too smart... If the gameplay has not undergone changes over the last 12 years, a different story applies to Artificial Intelligence, on which EA programmers have particularly focused: while during the single player campaign this appears decidedly fluctuating, sometimes showing a unparalleled wit (luring your troops into some ambushes or looking for an unprotected entrance to your base), other times instead it shows real drops in style, behaving in a clearly irrational way: it is, on closer inspection, a flaw not excessively relevant, given that most of the time the AI will keep a fairly coherent behavior, also favored by the fact that it will always start with an advantage (with advanced bases already developed and several units available), while you will have to impersonate self-made man and build your own Rome in less than 1 hour. in short, to paraphrase Barilla, the old flavors of the past do not disappoint. Even if they are 12 years old These computers are too smart... Therefore, do not delude yourself that you have an easy life: you will often think you are foolish when you fall into traps cleverly constructed by the computer (how many Mammoths have I lost on minefields) and, although the writer is not a born Napoleon, until recently he considered himself superior to a foolish calculator (this is to say that Tiberium Wars will also make you ask existential questions). On the other hand, the situation for skirmish games is different: if after a few hours of play you feel tired of always having the upper hand, in this new chapter you will have the option to specify ~how~ you intend the AI to behave and which stratsegie will have to adopt: by setting it, for example, to the ~Attendant~ mode, the Artificial Intelligence will structure and build a truly impenetrable base, with many defenses and focusing solely on this aspect, waiting for the most profitable moment to launch its attack. If, on the other hand, you prefer the ~Destroyer~ mode, get ready to be literally submerged by a continuous flow of enemy units, always in greater numbers and more and more powerful: it is, ultimately, a nice introduction that allows you to further diversify your sessions skirmish, allowing you to set up to 8 opponents all with their own particular behavior, giving rise to clashes that closely resemble multiplayer games. Comment We have come to an end, and if our article had not transpired enough, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars hits the mark perfectly, proposing the excellent gameplay that has always characterized the series. A classicism that could scare many, it is true, but which instead manages to be perfectly integrated and blended into the gameplay offered by the entire project. This third chapter looks like a frenetic RTS, where all your strategies can easily be challenged by the evolution of the missions: the Artificial Intelligence will give you a hard time, while the engine will take care of making everything as spectacular as possible , giving you convincing war scenes from the future. In short, to paraphrase Barilla, the old flavors of the past do not disappoint. Even if they are 12 years old. Pros Fast-paced and addictive gameplay Excellent quality interludes Well-structured AI Amazing graphics Cons High system requirements No (but absolutely NO) innovations When is the fourth chapter? Hollywood in a game? If the former Top Gun Jester isn't enough for you, nor Doctor House's assistant Cameron, here are some other stars hired by EA for this game with dollars: we find again Joe Kucan, who has always interpreted the charismatic NOD boss , the beautiful Tricia Helfer and the shady Josh Holloway, already seen in Lost; in the GDI faction you will meet Billy Dee Williams, primary actor in Lost and in Star Wars: Episode 5 as Lando Calrissian and Grace Park, command officer in the successful series Battlestar Galactica.
