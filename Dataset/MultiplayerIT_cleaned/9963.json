In fact, if on the one hand many talents and unexpected pearls emerge, on the other it is unfortunately true that the virtual shelves of the iPhone and iPod Touch are clogged with incomplete experiments, trivial applications and despicable titles. At this point one would expect to read that Cubed Rally Racer is not like the others, that it is an exception, that perhaps it is even a small masterpiece in a sea of questionable games. Unfortunately that is not the case at all. The racing game developed by Jared Bailey was born as a clear tribute to RC Pro-Am and to all those old isometric racing games that populated the old 8-bit consoles. The player's goal is to travel longer and longer tracks in an attempt to reach the finish line by earning the most points. However, his life is complicated by the countless obstacles and pitfalls scattered along the way: between drawbridges, hedges scattered here and there, annoying cows and mischievous moles, you always have to be careful where to put your wheels. As if that weren't enough, every sharp swerve risks going off the track and falling off the course, while the fuel gauge drops rapidly, making it necessary to collect all the petrol cans along the way. A continuous off-piste What distinguishes Cubed Rally Racer is the absolute unpredictability of the levels: each course will be generated randomly, so that you will never find yourself in front of the same sequence of curves and obstacles. Once a track is finished, you can decide whether to repeat it to challenge your ghost or whether to generate a completely new track, where the points earned allow you to unlock new sections with longer races and new obstacles. Let's be clear, everything seems very nice and fun, until you find your iPhone in hand: the game doesn't just replicate the perspective and graphic style of the old racing games, but also tries to emulate the feeling and the control system. An on-screen key allows you to accelerate, while the two arrows are used to steer clockwise or counterclockwise; unfortunately all this translates into not very intuitive and very woody mechanics, which never give, even after hours of play, the sensation of having full control of the car. The car's poor driveability ends up making Cubed Rally Racer an all too frustrating game: most of the time you end up off the track due to a curve that is too tight or too wide, falling off a bridge or crashing into a hedge. Then when you are hit by a mole just a few centimeters before the finish line, the insults abound. Fortunately, if a track should seem too difficult and you get tired of starting it all over again, you can generate a new one at any time and try again. Despite a truly lively and colorful graphic style, the lack of musical accompaniment makes each race nothing short of dull, while the random creation of the tracks is not enough to remedy the repetitiveness of the game. In fact, the absence of any alternative mode or multiplayer option is felt: it is true that you can compare your score within the world rankings, but following a friend on the same track, trying to throw him off the track, would have definitely added more spice to the races. Furthermore, Cubed Rally Racer would certainly have benefited from a track editor, with which to indulge yourself in creating bizarre courses full of obstacles and then sharing them with other players. There are many small ideas that would certainly have avoided making a game that will be remembered only for its unbearable difficulty further dull, repetitive and inconsistent.
