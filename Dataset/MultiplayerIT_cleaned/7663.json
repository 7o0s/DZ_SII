Not a remote eventuality, considering that the developer, that Larian Studios known for its role-playing prowess, is based in the charming Ghent, Belgium. After so many years spent on the Divinity series and with Original Sin in production, recently financed by a successful fundraising campaign, it must have been liberating to be able to create something completely new without abandoning the fantastic universe shaped in over ten years of hard work : the result is a strategy with elements taken from numerous other genres which, although set in the world of Revellion, moves away from any previous experiment and tries to draw a path of its own. A gamble that from the very first games shows its side to numerous problems, but which all in all will amuse those players looking for something profoundly different from the usual, as well as unexpected qualities. On the other hand, there are not many titles that mix dragons, strategy, tactics and lots of dialogues. Divinity: Dragon Commander is an unusual but all in all successful mix of different genres A kingdom to pacify As a spin off of the Divinity series, Dragon Commander develops within the same universe as Rivellion, a fantastic world that here however takes on different shades, pushing very hard on the hybrid atmosphere with steampunk hues. On board your ship, the Raven, you must play the role of the bastard son of an emperor whose kingdom is now shattered and disputed, a land to be pacified and brought back under a single flag. The plot is standard but on the deck of the ship you meet representatives of the other races involved in the war and with them you will have to discuss alliances, plan your next moves and decide the fate of the game. Representatives of the undead, dwarves, lizard men, imps and elves will be welcomed and the most diverse economic but also political and social issues will be discussed with them, signing alliances and suffering the inevitable consequences of the enmities that will arise. Making a pact and perhaps ending up marrying a representative of the hyper-capitalist dwarven empire will lead to different situations than the path one would follow by embracing the theocratic culture of the undead. Each race has its own connotations and the long dialogue sessions, with all that they entail, are the most interesting part of the gaming experience precisely because they are extremely peculiar. There are many stereotypes and the judgments expressed are too clear-cut, almost caricatured, but this is the beauty of it. The result is a narrative component, which mixes very modern themes in a non-innovative but solid fantasy context, truly successful. The diplomatic manoeuvres, combined with those linked to the research and development of new technologies, materialize on the ~board game~ map divided into provinces. Regions to be conquered by moving troops, building structures and generally acting as dozens and dozens of board games have taught us. In this sense, Dragon Commander works fairly well even if it doesn't really invent anything new and in the long run it could lack a bit in terms of variety of experienced situations. The other strong point of the offer, however, are the battles in real time, what at least on paper should be the real beating heart of the experience. The Year of the Dragon Real-time battles mix strategy and action. You can play one battle at a time in first person, possibly delegating the others to your commanders, and how you get there in terms of units and special abilities depends on the choices made during the turn-based phases. The link between the two types of gameplay, in real time and not, can recall the Total War series and in fact there are points of contact, but the substance is very different. In fact, if the tactical map closely resembles a classic board game, the other has several strategic elements but also a substantial action component. During the battles, land and air units must be controlled as in any RTS, moved in order to conquer the territories and with the ultimate aim of destroying the opposing base. You can summon new troops and apply a large part of the strategies experienced in this genre of gameplay, even if you shouldn't expect the depth of titles like StarCraft and Company of Heroes. Here the beauty comes when the timer expires and you can finally take control of your dragon: as in any third-person action, we can move it in the air both to destroy enemy forces and for slightly more sophisticated purposes, for example sabotage opposing structures in order to slow down the sending of reinforcements. A gimmick iinteresting that however collides with a couple of problems that cannot be underestimated. After a while, in our opinion, the formula gets tired and, above all because of a non-stratospheric variety, the initial enthusiasm fades away. And then the control system, especially when trying to pilot the dragon and administer the production and management of the units, brings out excessive confusion and little intuitiveness. In general, the feeling is that Larian Studios wanted to do many different things without being able to give the right depth to each one. The multiplayer component mitigates but does not erase this general approach problem, which we would have felt less burdensome if it hadn't been for the price, 39.90 euros, dangerously close to that of many so-called triple A productions.", "date": "2013-08-19", "grade": "7.5"}
