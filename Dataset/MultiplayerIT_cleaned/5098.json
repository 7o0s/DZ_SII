{"name": "The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/178383-the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-il-paradosso-di-isaac.html", "text": "Afterbirth+ is the second expansion of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which comes out just over a year after the first, Afterbirth, and more than two years after the base game. On paper, the new contents, which go alongside the existing ones, are not bad at all: more than fifty-five new objects; a new final chapter; a new playable character; a new mode; the introduction of daily challenges; five new classic challenges; new Steam achievements; new bosses, including one for the new ending; new enemies; a hundred new rooms; last but not least, opening up to modders with tools and integration with the Steam Workshop. In short, it really seems like a work worthy of note and worth the asking price... We played Afterbirth+, the new expansion of The Binding of Isaac: find out if it's worth what it costs Did something break? Let's ask ourselves a very simple question: is the new content valid? Reviewing Afterbirth we stated that The Binding of Isaac is now a brand and that the anarchic spirit that had generated it was fading into the awareness of having a very salable product. Afterbirth+ shows exactly where that philosophy is leading the game, namely towards an accumulation of supplementary content that is quite useless and designed only to make passionate players spend more money, content that adds practically nothing to the gaming experience, but only lengthens it artificially. One of the new bosses: Recycles ideas from other bosses a bit too much We honestly struggle to find a new enemy, a new object or even a new mode introduced by Afterbirth + that is really needed, despite something vaguely interesting there is (for example the new transformations). Unfortunately, however, some additions break the balance that worked well before, while others are completely free and out of context, despite the highly surreal nature of the game's representation. For example, the dimensional holes, from which enemy after enemy come out until you destroy them, seem to have been glued to the whole without a real reason. Moreover, they greatly increase the difficulty, often incorrectly since they can be in hard-to-hit spots. When you don't have adequate firepower and the room starts to clutter with enemies, they become particularly annoying. Worse still behaves the champion Brownie, a giant poop boss who fills the rooms with leeches, making it almost impossible to kill him without taking damage in case you don't have a good supply of items. Let's be clear: The Binding of Isaac has always been a difficult game, very difficult, but at the same time correct, in the sense that it has always given the player the right readability of the action, even in the most chaotic moments. Some new contents ignore this correctness to the point that one thinks that they have been added just to make numbers and without a precise project in mind. Mods will save us The impression of an expansion created listlessly and without big ideas in mind is also strengthened by looking at the new bosses, which seem to be simple variations of others that already exist. The new area itself is very lazy, despite its generous size, as it is a kind of macro area with very difficult fights and a very disappointing final boss. The dimensional holes can be very annoying The number of playable characters grows Some will like the idea that the new ending explains the story behind the game a little better, but the question is: was it really needed? This is not a far-fetched complaint, but a precise question that arises from the observation that the final explanation comes after an uninspired area and which has evidently lost the narrative thread that had instead led to defining the style of the other areas. Nothing was ever gratuitous in The Binding of Isaac: every object and every enemy had precise mechanical and allegorical functions. Afterbirth had already sacrificed quite a bit of the strong narrative coherence of the game elements, but Afterbirth+ does it even worse: it ignores them. In some cases he still manages to propose something valid, but in essence the important thing seems to be just to make numbers. If we want, the same new Greedier mode, that is a difficult version of the Greed mode (an arena in which you face waves of progressive force which, once defeated, give coins to spend in a shop room and give access to the lower levels of the dungeon where you are), born from the same laziness: it is identical to the original, but you get less coins and the fights are harder. Otherwise, the differences are minimal, if any. The only really important innovation introduced byAfterbirth +, in this case precious, is the support for modders and the integration with the Steam Workshop for sharing mods. At the time of writing this review there are already nearly 150 mods available for download, a sign that the community is active and wishing they could get to work on the game. Nicalis also announced that it will make the best content official, selecting it on a monthly basis and integrating it through patches. For now there are mainly aesthetic additions, although there are mods that make small tweaks to the game, such as those that slightly alter the user interface. But soon it is likely that new rooms, new enemies, new items and so on will arrive. In short, only time will tell if users will be able to produce quality content. Final considerations Let me be clear: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth remains an excellent title despite Afterbirth+, which should make you understand the high level of work originally done by Edmund McMullen and Nicalis and the disappointment to see it treated so superficially by themselves. There are also new options for the game interface However, it must be said that the new contents add several hours of gameplay, which for a great fan with hundreds of games on his shoulders can be an excellent incentive to purchase, regardless of any other feasible consideration. Of course, it must also be said that the major criticisms of the expansion are coming from those who have more hours of gameplay on their shoulders, which ultimately makes any feasible consideration decidedly ambiguous. The substance is that we really expected much more in terms of quality from Afterbirth +, although we realize that it is really difficult to add content to such a structured title without touching its balance. Well, perhaps it would be appropriate to admit that we did a great job originally, a job however not designed to be expanded to infinity: we really don't want poor Isaac to end up like Phaedrus's frog which, by dint of swelling up to look like the ox died burst. If something can't be improved, leave it alone: you risk turning good memories into recriminations.", "date": "2017-01-05", "grade": null}
