{"name": "Midway Arcade Treasures 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midway-arcade-treasures-2.html", "text": "Two unaided words on the value of the classics Not equipped with a lot of extras, perhaps not exactly emulated perfectly but nevertheless many, many of the 21 in total of high level, and perfectly capable of entertaining today as yesterday. The games featured in Midway Arcade Treasures II are, in chronological order: Wizard of Wor (1980), Wacko (82), Kozmik Krooz'r (82), Timber (84), Championship Sprint (86), Gauntlet 2 (86) , A.P.B. (87), Spy Hunter 2 (87), Xybots (87), Xenophobe (87), N.A.R.C. (88), Arch Rivals (89), Cyberball 2072 (89), Hard Drivin' (90), Pit Fighter (90), Total Carnage (90), Mortal Kombat II (93), Mortal Kombat III (94), Primal Rage (94), Rampage World Tour (97). As promised, a clarification: ~a particular look~ on a title like Midway Arcade Treasures does not at all mean indulging in romantic defenses to the bitter end of the ~old games~, nor even sadly and seriously arguing that the ~old games~ are today unwatchable. None of the rules of the two alleged ~currents of thought~ are valid, which in fact have no reason to exist, otherwise today there would be neither people who play emulated titles, nor compilations like these, nor discussions on the value of games over time. And in evaluating a compilation it is not worth a vote that is a ~mix~ of these pseudo-attitudes that live only in a superficial glance. There is a reason, among others, why even after twenty years video games often receive little consideration, or at best condescension compared to more established arts (and cinema has gone through the same troubles), among those who don't know them Well. This is an error of incompetence by a large part of the critics (still immature), which unfortunately tends to recognize the video game as valid only in relation to technological advancement or contemporary proposals. It is an error that does not derive only from the absence of critical tools, but sinks into insensitivity. Saying that the graphics of an old game are bad or that Joust is unwatchable today that there is Splinter Cell is as serious as saying that the Odyssey is boring to read today that there is Stephen King, that a Visconti film does not hold up comparison with Carpenter or that expressionist films suck in comparison to digital cinema. Such rants prevent us from being able to recognize the value of games over time. And at the same time they would condemn us to laugh tomorrow at what we appreciate today, despising a title loved five years earlier (warp yourself to 2010: do you think you would say that GTA San Andreas is ~crap?~). It is a truism, but unfortunately such mistakes happen even in the best families. All the classics pixel after pixel Overall, the collection is more than decent, offering a wide variety of genres and above all of technological eras: even if most of the titles are taken from the late 90s, some of the titles are much further back in time, while Rampage World Tour it goes back to basically not too many years ago. Wizard of Wor is a fairly typical experience from the heyday of maze games, blending Pacman with a good deal of shooting (as in the old Alien) and the most useless radar in gaming history, but still a decent title . Kozmik Kruizer is the weakest title among the ancients, with a weak gameplay that is played as a botched mix between Space Invaders and Frogger. Wacko is one of the strangest titles in the combo, and it works as a mix between a shooter (again, space invaders) and Memory card game, where finding an equal pair (in this case, monsters to hit) causes the elimination. Even Timber is not joking in terms of originality, given that it is a timed challenge played by a woodcutter against trees that are in danger of collapsing on him, employers from union denunciation and beehive-throwing bears: however, leave the time he finds. The happiest genre fans could be lovers of fighting games, or at least in part: Mortal Kombat II, depth limits recognized, still remains a masterpiece; Mortal Kombat III is decidedly more complex, and while not reaching the level of certain Capcom or SNK titles, it remains superior to many overrated polygonal versions; Pit Fighter, on the other hand, which originated the idea of the photorealistic pike-picker, remains a very weak and even too fast title in this emulated version; and Primal Rage may have photorealistic monsters, but it's light years away from King of The Monsters. For continuity, let's add to these considerations a title that basically has little to do with fighting games: Rampage World Tour, a deluxe version remodeled in ACM style of a great timeless classic. [C] Wacko N.A.R.C. Hard Driving [/C] Speaking of timeless classics, swe highlight the fantastic maze/shooter/adventure with a top-down view Gauntlet II (among the first titles to institute the progressive numerical enhancement of the characters) and the beautiful maze/shooter with a B-movie setting Xenophobe, not very enjoyable on small screens as intended for multiplayer play. Another timeless classic is Hard Drivin', heavily penalized by the absence of the original cabinet and control. But nonetheless still enjoyable and the first example of a polygonal racer, complete with a loop-the-loop. And here we go to the racers. A.P.B. is a somewhat original example: with a top view, it involves us in a mix of racing, reflexes and strategy to be able to arrest all the criminals who crowd the streets. The humor, fun and game mechanics remain intact and constitute one of the best offerings in the collection. Too bad for the absence of the analog pedal, which ruins the feeling and also makes Championship Sprint practically unplayable, another classic as simple as it is effective (which Nintendo would have copied in various mini-games of its party games). Spy Hunter 2, to finish with the racers, is not much more enjoyable than its contemporary polygonal sequels, with chaotic gameplay, poor physics and generally very weak appeal. Returning to real violence, the first report is for the fantastic Total Carnage, the latest successor of a great blasting tradition that includes the timeline Robotron and the legendary Smash TV (both present in the first volume Midway). The combination of simple and perfect gameplay, the huge amount of bullets and enemies, the surreal monsters and the gratuitous violence of weapons and situations make it one of the best titles in the collection, even if not as perfect as Smash TV. Cyberball 2072 is a Kick Off in a violent and robotic version, which certainly requires much more strategy and patience than titles along the lines of Speedball and can only be satisfying provided it does not require rapid times or timely gameplay. The violent sport operation came out much better in Arch Rivals, a basketball classic in an incorrect version where a decent gameplay (No Arch Rivals? No NBA Jam...) meets a good dose of comic violence. We conclude with two titles still able to offer much more fun than many current titles. The first is NARC, a classic of action, reflexes and resistance that blends the shooter with the scrolling brawler and would be impossible to finish for different minds darkened by more derivative and serial dialogical pimps than loyal to the Japanese style. The second is the incredible third-person Doom Xybots, from which, however, the title of the ID may have taken much more than expected. The package: interface, emulation, extras Video game code can be emulated and transported, it's in its nature. But a game is also the year in which it was released, the novelties it brought (perhaps remained so), the plastic packaging. For example, turning on an original console that dates back twenty years, inserting an equally old cartridge and connecting this ancient vector for other worlds to a television (preferably not too modern), or finding a game room with an old cabinet that has stood the test of time and market is NOT the same as playing it emulated on a PS2 thanks to a box from Midway. Beyond the judgment on games sheltered from the prejudices of the time, let's see what the package offers. A first flaw of the compilation is its interface, certainly not very attractive or fascinating (although certainly better than the first volume): an operation at the Namco Museum, more enjoyable and suggestive, would have been better than a list without display options or metaphors museum visuals. On closer inspection, some criticisms also lend themselves well to another aspect: that of the fidelity of the emulation, which here presents itself as fluctuating. A reason must be sought perhaps in the technological disparity of the original hardware. The code of a few kbytes of Championship Sprint or Kozmik Krooz'r certainly requires less powerful emulating hardware than much more recent games such as Mortal Kombat III or Total Carnage, which PS2 should also emulate very well. Instead, probably due to a single emulation routine, many titles have leaps in speed (in the case of Pit Fighter, the game sprints at double speed; while Rampage World Tour goes slowly) and sound not quite identical to the original, from lower quality or sometimes disturbed. Graphical inaccuracies will occur on rare occasions. Although not serious, it is natural that the player can consequently turn to more faithful reproductions of the originals, not too difficult to find. In a compilation, on the other hand, the opermuseum action, with the interface and the extras, constitutes more than an accessory and configures the experience of the title, whether or not it is worth its purchase. A few photos of the original cabinets (no layers behind the screen) and videos with interviews and opinions of the programmers taken from who knows what archives without a minimum of audio restoration (annoying to understand behind the hiss in most cases), however interesting, do not constitute a good incentive to buy, especially if at full price. [C] Championship Sprints xybots Xenophobic [/C] Midway Arcade Treasures II makes a great selection of varied and valid titles: at least half of the 21 titles are big games with high entertainment power, and in particular NARC, Total Carnage, Rampage, Xenophobe, Xybots and Gauntlet are absolute classics. But its proposal as a museum fails altogether (poor options, extras and interface) and looks more like an obvious speculative move. It is time for software houses like Midway to understand that the strength of the classics does not live without an adequate presentation, or rather that consumers have valid and quick alternatives. It is also time for superficial criticism to learn to distinguish the absolute value of a game AND beyond the time spent AND by distinguishing it from the commercial operation behind it, to the benefit of the players. Pros Rich and varied selection both for genres and for ~eras~ Some classics remain better than many contemporary productions... ...and this both for gameplay and for aesthetic outcome Retrogaming reserves playability and many surprises Cons Scarce historical and documentary work Extras are of fluctuating quality. Some titles are undoubtedly fillers. This sounds more like a fire sale Midway Arcade Treasure is a collection of classics from days gone by. The code contained in this DVD emulates the original hardware of game cabinets from many years ago; and today offers, on a console capable of carrying out this ~deception~ accurately, the games that ran on such hardware, more or less faithfully emulated. To really evaluate the goodness of the games that Midway proposes from its historical archives, the way in which they have been emulated, the historical extras that are present in the collection and understand if the package is worth the purchase, however, one should spend a couple of lines for talk about the fact that a title like this, by its nature, must be evaluated with a particular eye. As obvious as it may seem to many, it must be repeated that the judgment on the games of a historical compilation must be framed under the profile of the absolute gameplay, namely: if a game sucked yesterday, it will suck today too; while if a masterpiece comes out in 1988 that game will also be a masterpiece in 7142. It matters little that the fashions and tastes of a given era change, at least if we remain video game lovers at least a minimum. Another thing is the judgment on the packaging and the extras: there may be a collection of neorealist cinema classics on DVD with very poor presentation and performance, but no one would dream of saying that Rome, open city is unwatchable. In keeping the aspects clearly distinct, we invite readers not to fall into the traps of those who, despite themselves, do not make this distinction.", "date": "2004-12-09", "grade": null}
