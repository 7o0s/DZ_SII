It is a pity that these conclusions were drawn before seeing Wind-up Knight at work, however: while sharing the genre of belonging with the fun product of Halfbrick Studios, the action game starring the courageous ~spring~ knight, available on the App Store since December 15th, it has weight to spare and boasts respectable numbers; it also offers a different interpretation than usual regarding already widely tested mechanics: less speed, more variations on the theme and an approach that is practically pure platforming. The aim of the game is quite trivial: you have to save a princess in danger and to do so we will have to go through more than fifty levels divided into four large areas, gradually becoming more complex and full of pitfalls to face. The actions available to our knight are four, but they are introduced gradually: he can jump (from a certain point onwards in a double way), slash with the sword, roll and take shelter with the shield from objects or flames that fall from above . The control system adopted by the developers uses the touch screen with four different buttons, and at first you'll find yourself wondering why you haven't chosen to resort to ~gestures~ to perform the various operations. Well, you will understand why very quickly: there are actions that must be maintained for a few moments (covering with the shield, rolling but also attacking with the sword) and a gestural system would not have been the best in terms of precision and speed. Within the levels we can collect a certain number of coins (the challenge is to get them all) to then spend in a virtual shop to purchase more powerful swords or swords with particular powers, helmets that allow us to suffer a blow without incurring in game over, special abilities that tend to decrease the number of buttons (for example those that allow us to avoid flames and falling boulders by rolling instead of raising the shield) and so on. All upgrades that will prove useful when we decide to replay already completed stages, because each of them hides hidden objects and secrets that we will hardly be able to access during the first stint. Win them all and come back to us As mentioned, Wind-up Knight is an atypical running game in many ways, which does not fossilize on speed but which still manages to be frenetic, and to require great precision, due to the numerous variations present within the levels. At first we will simply have to jump from one platform to another while avoiding chasms, but gradually the traps will become more frequent and dangerous, with blades protruding from the ground or from the walls, boards that open under our feet and so on. The structure of the paths will also change at the same time, from the linearity of the first stages to something decidedly more intricate and complex in the final ones, and even the enemies will become bigger and more threatening. Furthermore, we will not be granted all the time in the world: our knight constantly needs to reinvigorate his spring charge by collecting certain power-ups, in the absence of which the energy will quickly run out and we will have to start the level over. In short, an excellent mix of immediacy, progression and depth, which is assisted by an excellent technical sector: the music is very simple and fairly repetitive, but has the great merit of getting into one's head and staying there (no small thing, nowadays ), while the graphics are always easy to read, with characters with a pleasant design, good animations and great care for the outline (see the ships moving in the background of the first stages).
