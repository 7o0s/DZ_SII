And if for Nintendo players this is not so much a problem, on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the lack of a healthy, crazy and fun kart racer was felt a bit. Lack that, unfortunately, we can say has not been filled at all by the Welsh Milkytea. Coffin Dodgers is a Mario Kart-like racing game that also has good premises, but then... Ugly as Death And to say that the beginning was anything but to throw away. Choosing the Story Mode from the various options available, the real juice of the game, despite a presentation that is certainly not screaming and texts in Italian that are not without errors, you are introduced to an original and nice plot: Sunny Pines is apparently the ideal town to enjoy the retirement years and is full of lively old men, a little run down but still full of the will to live. And so when Death decides to take seven of these old men in one night, our men are not there and challenge the Black Lady to a series of scooter races. Not our classic 50cc, mind you, but those devices halfway between a motorcycle and a kart, ideal for helping the mobility of the elderly and disabled. This humorous nature and the ability not to take oneself seriously by playing down even theoretically heavy situations, continues and takes on even more insane tones as the story progresses. The seven characters are certainly stereotyped, from the old war hero to the Amish pastor, up to the former model who continues to believe she is as beautiful and graceful as a little girl, but all in all amusing, just as the capricious Death is ridiculous, far from the figure of the Grim Reaper he would like to embody; this manages to take the souls of those who finish in the last places of each of the four championships present (each of three races, plus a final challenge consisting of a single very long race), but obviously, in order not to let the competition successive tracks in the form of zombies, as well as at a certain point of zombies, as well as various animals, newsboys and UFOs, begin to fill the paths, in a blaze of very creative and fun nonsense insanity that will elicit more than a smile. It is therefore truly a pity that the good news practically ends here. You realize that something is wrong when you realize that it is possible to complete all the tracks practically without ever taking your finger off the accelerator: absent any drifting mechanics, the grip of the scooters is so high that in fact at the beginning you will tend to take the curves even too sharply. And when the curve is really tight, no problem, because even if you continue to accelerate, you just need to steer with more energy and a sort of automatic brake magically kicks in and manages problematic situations on its own. This applies to practically all the characters present, the aesthetic differences translate into substantial differences that are only minimal and sometimes non-existent, with the exception of Death itself, which is unlocked by completing the Story, which however is nothing more than even more performing and easy to control . And the possibility of upgrading the scooter's engine, bodywork, gearbox and paraphernalia, earning coins depending on the position reached, is also of little value: the result will be nothing more than an even more dull and practically automatic drive. Playstation 4 trophies For a title that doesn't last so long, the 23 Trophies in Coffin Dodgers are not even a few. Divided into 5 Bronzes, 10 Silvers, 7 Golds and Platinum, they perhaps represent, at least for those players who are tied to the whole Trophy dynamic, the only valid reason to think about buying the game: their nature makes them so inevitable that it is really difficult, having the patience to complete the Story at least twice and hanging out even just a minute each in the other modes, not getting Platinum. Escape in defeat However, in a karting game, as we know, driving represents only half of the challenge, the other half is made up of the possibility of using weapons and objects which, the more bastards they are, the more fun they make everything. In Coffin Dodgers the dynamic is the same as always: bonuses are collected along the way and the CPU assigns an item relatively, in theory, to the position occupied. The weapons present are not very original, all devoted to attack except one for defense and the classic speed boost; this in itself would not be a problem, the real problems are above all in the functioning of the random system itself. If we occupy one of the last positions then we will have weapons that are actually effective in recovering, but if we are in the first half of the standings, not in first place, we will rarely be able to affect those in front of us, and thanks to the practically identical characteristics of karts and drivers if by chance we are second or third in the middle of the race, finishing first thanks to the bonuses becomes almost a utopia. Furthermore, even an original weapon like the UZI suffers from very erratic and frustrating automatic aiming. Also present is a ~melee~ attack like in the old Road Rash, when the opponents use it it is very effective, when we use it it does nothing but make the situation more chaotic, just as chaotic are the more advanced tracks, which between bonuses and zombies to run over are full of screen elements with the result of making it difficult to see the next curve. In short, it almost seems that we wanted to add some features to increase the difficulty in an artificial and confusing way, without working on a complex and satisfactory driving system and on an appropriate balance of bonuses. In the midst of all this numerous inconsistencies: the jumps which instead of speeding up the race slow it down, a system of experience points which it is not clear exactly what it is for, elements of the seabed which theoretically should perform the same function but present completely different collisions from each other, and a number of small but annoying bugs. The story ends within an hour or so, then it is possible to face it again in the role of Death which, however, makes the competition even more non-existent, and alternative open world modes inspired by Crazy Taxi are worth little, even more devoid of bite than the racing, and the multiplayer which is split screen only, absolutely no trace of online. In this picture so dull and approximate, it seems almost normal, unfortunately, to also have to talk about a graphic that seems taken directly from a Nintendo 64, certainly without fog and in high resolution, and which despite this suffers from obvious stuttering problems in many situations , and a sound that, not even horrible in terms of technical quality and compositions, however provides for such a limited number of music and effects that it gets on your nerves very quickly.", "date": "2016-05-16", "grade": "4.0"}
