{"name": "Il secondo assalto di DICE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131564-battlefield-4-second-assault-il-secondo-assalto-di-dice.html", "text": "The second of the massive DLC pack to arrive for Battlefield 4 is Second Assault. ~Second assault~, as DICE takes us back to battlefields already trodden at the time of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 2, or Gulf of Oman, Operation Metro, Operation Firestorm and Caspian Border, needless to say in a revised and corrected version complete with forced Levolution. There is not only this in the package: we can play Capture the Flag in smaller maps than their standard size, which drastically reduces the time to move from one end of the level to the other, especially in the presence of vehicles. There are two new vehicles, or rather only one since next to the fast Desert Patrol Vehicle, a sort of armed dune buggy we also find a small bobcat, a more useful vehicle on a construction site than between RPGs and cannon fire. To close the range of ~what's new~ there are five weapons for all tastes, four of which are already present in Battlefield 3. Among this little new arsenal we find the old acquaintances F2000, the Belgian assault rifle from high but inaccurate volume of fire, but also the old mule of Vietnam, namely the M60A4 machine gun. If we then wanted to use a less ~caciarone~ approach, there is the silenced As Val, produced in Russia, the complete opposite of the DAO12, the shotgun with a maxi drum magazine. The only ~unreleased~ gun (it was in Bad Company 2) is the GOL Magnum, a single-shot sniper rifle made in Germany. Second Assault for Battlefield 4: here is our review of the DLC And the maps? The queen of the package is undoubtedly Caspian Border, kissed by a warm autumn sun that colors the environment in a very different way compared to the summer one of Battlefield 3. There is little to say; the map is roughly the same, that is the perfect playing field to unite the clashes between infantry, land and air vehicles in a single whole, in that ~total war~ alchemy that those who play Battlefield know. The interactivity of the map changes the layout a bit: instead of the simple fences we now find much more resistant concrete walls, interspersed with some accesses and doors that can be opened that create interesting bottlenecks. As if that weren't enough, it is possible to blow up a gigantic radio tower which, crashing into the ground, creates a further combat zone by also knocking down part of the walls. In short, nothing new, but a perfect mix and obviously more beautiful graphically than what was played in the past. From the open spaces of Caspian Border we move on to the much more cramped ones of Operation Metro, the map set in a subway station and entirely dedicated to the infantry. Those who have spent hours upon hours in Battlefield 3 know its limits, that is, they know that the two teams will ~stop~ near the escalators, a real bottleneck that is inevitable. DICE to try to fix this situation has inserted a couple of lifts and a side passage but in the end you always get stuck in that area. The Levolution allows us to knock down a ceiling and little else (for little else we mean turning lights on and off...). An undoubtedly fun map, but which is the exact opposite of what is expected of Battlefield and with more or less the ~same problems~ of the previous chapter. If you didn't like it then you won't like it even now, net of the graphic boost and a slightly wider destruction. One of the most loved maps of the previous two chapters is undoubtedly Gulf Of Oman. It is redundant to spend rivers of words on this iconic setting, in fact the changes are minimal compared to the third chapter, but this time the Levolution adds an interesting feature to the gameplay. A severe sandstorm takes its toll on visibility, making it very difficult to fly an airplane. The clashes on the ground therefore become even more frenetic in the town, but if someone wants to try sniping from above, with or without the sand whipping the air, they can always take advantage of a couple of elevators activated now for the occasion. In short, nothing new under the scorching sun of Oman we could almost say, but to be honest the Levolution significantly destabilizes the wide-ranging gameplay of the map, ~closing~ the spaces and favoring close-quarters clashes. The last of the maps available in the package is Operation Firestorm. The petrochemical industrial design has remained the same and the Levolution is a small thing. It is possible to set fire to the chimneys, perfect for snipers, and close the shutters on a couple of structures. A map therefore that works by virtue of its good level design, but which takes minimal advantage of the new features made available by Battlefield 4.It goes without saying that the size of the map allows it to be played at all levels and by all means. If with China Rising DICE has managed to broaden the horizons of its typical gameplay by offering decidedly intriguing levels, with Second Assault it has rested a little too much on the laurels of its (excellent) previous maps, not going beyond a few small changes and additions. The novelty rate is clearly low and even Levolution, except for Oman, is not an essential added value of the package. For this reason we do not feel like recommending this DLC, really too similar to what was played in Battlefield 3.", "date": "2014-05-12", "grade": null}
