All obviously in a two-dimensional action-platform context, as is the case in almost all mobile titles inspired by cinematic blockbusters. Ai Confini del Mondo therefore engages the user in the classic activities of the genre: racing, jumping, fighting and above all many, many collectibles to collect. In this context, the Disney product certainly falls into the top of the category, given that the doubloons collected along the way add up to the treasure chests to be identified in more or less hidden places of the stages, in a ranking system that rewards the most attentive players with secret minigames and extras of various kinds. But the gameplay of At the End of the World is certainly not limited to the accumulation of coins: the stages are teeming with enemies to be skewered with your own sword, using a rather intuitive and effective combat system, which allows you to attack and perform combos using the use of only two keys. n some cases, it will then be necessary to engage particularly skilled opponents in one-on-one duels, during which the game will be transformed into a subspecies of fighting game: a very unsuccessful feature, given that everything is based on a succession of dodges and lunges that seems to work completely randomly. At the Edge of the World continues on these tones for the beauty of 21 levels (really many for mobile standards), with some slight variations in some situations: for the rest, the task of breaking up the common game action belongs entirely to the Cannonade mode, a kind of Missile Command in which you have to move a mouth of fire to shoot down the opposing ship and repel its attacks. Complete with bonuses and multipliers, these sections do their job well, to the point of being available from the main menu to be tackled at any time. Satisfying from a playful point of view, Ai Confini del Mondo disappoints a bit as regards the graphics, generally not very impressive as far as they are equipped with good animations: above all the backdrops and the perhaps too small dimensions of the sprites appear below tone. Finally, the sound is good, with a musical accompaniment faithful to the melodies of the film. PRO Simple and fun Effective control system Good longevity AGAINST Sub-standard graphics Some shortcomings in the gameplay Underdeveloped storyline", "date": "2007-05-27", "grade": "S.V."}
