Sunbreak Games had in fact organized a campaign on the famous crowdfunding platform, aiming for a goal of 40,000 dollars to create this ~endless runner~ with a particular atmosphere, set in the dreams of a boy who every night, closing his eyes, knows he can find his friend Buddy to run with him in a scenario made up of lush trees and wooden platforms, fly on his shoulders like a new Bastian, jump and even glide from one handhold to another until the alarm sounds. The campaign was successful and the game landed on the App Store (as well as on Amazon, in the Kindle Fire version), thanks to an approach probably designed for younger users and a gameplay that reflects these choices thanks to a system of very simple and immediate touch control, which is based on simply pressing the screen: one touch to jump, two to double jump, three touches and a long press to use the protagonist's sweatshirt as a ~parachute~ and glide towards the next platform . Buddy & Me starts from a fascinating idea, which is however put into practice in a simplistic way Other than Fortunadrago Needless to say, the Buddy & Me developers have been really good at ~selling~ their project on Kickstarter, cleverly introducing the concepts behind the experience, the dimension of the dream that belonged to each of us in our youth , even Buddy's behavior, which is activated promptly as soon as there is a danger for his friend and is placed in the background to act as a trampoline or to use his own tail as a vine. There is the inevitable theme of objects to collect, which in certain cases can lengthen the duration of the game and are therefore of great importance for gameplay purposes, and then there is a level generation mechanism that can give so much satisfaction from visual point of view, offering us wonderful panoramas that open up between one jump and another, enriched by a parallax scrolling that gives them a certain depth. In short, the conditions for a solid ~endless runner~ are all there. What is unfortunately missing is the innovative idea, the element of detachment from the many productions of the same type. Of course, the setting is very nice and the atmosphere is undeniable, but these are aspects of the experience that after a couple of games are overshadowed by the lack of variety in the situations, which literally kills the enjoyment of the game over the long term. The little ones will certainly appreciate the characters, their design, the rich color palette used, the simplicity of the platform action and even the flight phases (actually the ones we liked the least due to the further impoverishment of the mechanics) . The fact is that the comparison with any other horizontal scrolling running game raises a question: what does Buddy & Me add to its line of belonging?", "date": "2013-10-10", "grade": "6.0"}
