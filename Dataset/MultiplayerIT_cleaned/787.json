{"name": "Geist", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/geist_a.html", "text": "Who am I wearing tonight? As mentioned at the beginning, and for those who have not followed the vicissitudes of the development of this project (also known in the past with the code name ~Fear~), let's immediately say that the choice of the name ~Geist~ (from the German: spirit ) finds its explanation in the very heart of the game, which allows the player to step into the ethereal shoes of the spirit of special agent Sam Raimi, who separated from his body as a result of an unfortunate military operation aimed at dismantling the shady and mysterious Volks Corporation . The body-spirit dichotomy guarantees the title interesting cues in terms of originality Who am I wearing tonight? We leave to those who read these lines the pleasure of discovering the details of the events that led Raimi's body to separate from his spirit, however we anticipate that the canvas that supports the narrative structure of Geist gives a nod to a fantasy-trash of low alloy far from exciting. The body-spirit dichotomy guarantees the title interesting cues in terms of originality, which in the game find realization in a similar distinction between alternating game phases: moments in which you take control of the Spirit interspersed with moments in which the same Spirit takes possession of living beings and inanimate objects. In Geist's conditions, the player can move almost undisturbed, floating freely in the environments in search of possible guests, be they humans, animals or objects, which allow him to interact with the earthly universe. Not all the elements present in the background are subject to possession, so an icon will suggest to the player which objects to focus their attention on. This system of icons, which appear when you are near objects, proves to be imperfect and occasionally a source of frustration, as we will see later. However, taking possession of the body of a living being presents an additional problem: it is necessary to lower the host's defenses, and to do this it is necessary to scare it. In these situations the pseudo-creative component of Geist should come into question, as it is up to the player to invent a stratagem to procure a bogeyman for the victim, or at least to disturb her. In this regard, the objects present on the scene are useful: chests of drawers, telephones, fire extinguishers, etc., but unfortunately most of the time the undertaking is reduced to a trivial and obvious activation in sequence of those few elements which it is possible to take possession of. Often the hitches in understanding how to continue in the game arise instead due to the aforementioned system of icons (which identifies the things with which to interact), which forces the player to pass the game environments inch by inch, making inopportune and cumbersome movements with the view, under penalty of not identifying key elements. An aspect, therefore, that would certainly have needed more attention. Already after the first hours of the game (by the way, the overall longevity settles on the dozen) it is clear that Geist does not fall into the category of FPS properly understood, but instead seems to belong to a hybrid genre; if you think that during the entire adventure we will be forced to eliminate perhaps less than a hundred enemies (almost always equipped with AI at the minimum levels, where not literally immobile, so much so that they seem impatient to be sniped), and who are on the contrary numerous purely exploratory sessions, it follows that it is not entirely rash to speak of Geist as a first-person adventure. The game never gives the feeling of emancipating itself, floating in a succession of obviousness The control system, moreover, would seem to confirm what has been asserted: all in all functional in the quieter exploration sessions, while on the rare occasions in which the trigger must be pressed with more ardor, it reveals all its limits, proving to be slow and not very reactive in response, both in terms of movements and pointing the viewfinder. The game never gives the feeling of emancipating itself, floating in a succession of obviousness. The adventure advances along tracks of things already seen and already done, and the repeated management of possessions ends up losing interest almost immediately, except for reserving some pleasant ideas in the pipeline. A discreet adventure, at times enjoyable, but those looking for a real FPS would do better to look elsewhere, since not even the multiplayer mode can stand out. Geist's technical realization immediately appears seriously incomplete. Polygonal modeling of environments and characters, quality of the textures and complexity of the effects border on mediocrity. To aggravate the whole contributes a fragyou were totally unstable (at a rough guess in some situations the frames per second do not reach double digits), which frankly appears inexplicable in the light of the visual paucity offered on the screen. There are sporadic bugs and a widespread uncertainty in the management of collisions with the seabed. Added to this is a forgettable and not very coherent sound counterpart (moreover, sometimes it jams, clicks, croaks (!)), which now becomes evocative, now plays down untimely, now creates tension again. A decidedly disheartening audio-video scenario, which blushes in the face of productions even several years older. COMMENT Laconically we would say that Geist is a rough game. It is in the technical realization, in the attention to detail, in the control system and, however specious, even the narrative structure fails to convince. Beyond an insufficient audio-visual sector, the main regret is the son of the unconvincing translation of potentially very rich ideas into equivalent gameplay. What emerges when playing Geist is a feeling of general approximation and broad perfectibility. Not everything is to be thrown away, after all the title has new elements and can be played pleasantly, but we are far from the quality standards to which the Grande Enne has accustomed us. Pros: Conceptually original Average longevity Cons: Technically inadequate Poor AI Control system not very versatile After years and years of work, the Geist project has finally come to an end. Speaking of spirits and ghosts we could say that it has manifested itself, finally taking possession of the GameCube and allowing us to sum up what today represents the only exclusive FPS for the Nintendo flagship. Strange to say, if you think that just a few years ago Nintendo64 firmly held the scepter of King in the field of first-person shooters, thanks to the titles developed by Rareware and Iguana. Although the modest curriculum of n-Space left room for more than one fear, working hand in hand with Nintendo allowed if nothing else to nurture greater hopes about the goodness of the title, which in some ways could also be considered ambitious, only to then come out on the sly about the dying of the current generation of consoles.
