{"name": "Kiss Psycho Circus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kiss-psycho-circus.html", "text": "Engine, music... The graphic engine behind Kiss undoubtedly deserves a mention: an improved version (definitely, especially in the management of lights and colors) of the one seen in Blood 2 and Shogo, code-named Lithtech, is capable of managing fairly valid graphics, large spaces, and above all dozens and dozens of enemies on the screen at the same time: really many. Although it doesn't shine for any particular element (perhaps only for the number of enemies that can be faced), the game engine offers many pleasant light effects, visual depth (apart from some occasions undermined by a fairly heavy fogging), bright colors and much intense, discretely defined textures, but above all it has the merit of always keeping the number of frames per second high, guaranteeing the title the adrenaline-pumping action that distinguishes it at all times. Unfortunately, the variety of environments is not such as to earn points of merit for the game, also because each episode (every adventure of the four followers of Kiss) is permeated by a fairly dominant theme; the sound commentary of the game instead earns points of merit, and this does not surprise us. The music that forms the background to the clashes and explorations does not shine for originality or complexity, but in most cases they can be listened to willingly, unlike what happened in the past with respect to similar titles; but in those, unfortunately rare (I counted about a dozen in the game) in which the music of Kiss acts as the background (whether because a Juke Box has been activated or because the game underlines a particular moment in this way) is the music of Kiss, the hand will run to the volume knob. No, I don't know Kiss, their music has never particularly attracted me, and for this reason I've never tried to know it: but I have to admit with all sincerity that the songs in the game are really top notch. If for fans this could in itself be a big incentive to buy the game (among the titles listenable during the course of the game Rock and Roll All Night, Hotter Than Hell, Cold Gin, Unholy, God Gave Rock & Roll To You and naturally Psycho Circus), it must be said that for the others it is ~only~ one of the best audio commentaries ever heard in a video game. ...action!!! And here is immediately the first feature that wants, according to the programmers themselves, to differentiate Kiss from the other subjective shooters released to date: Kiss is a small return to the past, an all-action game, very rich in clashes with white weapons or with weapons of all kinds, short, medium and long range. Lots of clashes with enemies, which recur continuously, not leaving the player a moment's rest, can only make action lovers happy without reasoning (just think that most of the puzzles, doors or windows that open, are resolved simply by killing enemies or bosses present on the screen). The game concept itself, referable to the most classic of the collect the key-kill the monster-open the door schemes, enhances a setting of this type to the maximum: why waste time looking for how to release a lock, when you can take up your gun and kill all the beings you do they hang around? As for the creatures that will try to block the way for our four protagonists, surely the presence of over thirty of them guarantees a good variety for the duration of the game; most of the enemies are clearly inspired by some typical circus characters: the fattest woman in the world, the cannon man, the Clown, the knife thrower, the strongest man in the world... and so on. Unfortunately their behavior is the one already seen in many other titles, that of ~loving each other~ so to speak: for those who haven't understood it, I'm talking about the fact that the enemies, as soon as they see the protagonist appear, launch themselves headlong against him and carry their attack in a repetitive and decidedly predictable. As for the weapons available to the protagonists, which clearly resemble the weapons seen in thousands of other FPS (the rifle, the machine gun, the rocket launcher), and which differ from them only in the look, unfortunately they stand out for the small number... in fact most of the weapons are common to the four adventures, and only the last one, the special one for each musician, is original. In addition to the weapons that can be used, some small ~gadgets~ will also become available (and useful) in the game: a zoom, which will allow us to aim precisely for the furthest enemies (although, honestly, most sometimes we will absolutely run out of time), delland boxes that activate and explode when someone passes near them, a crystal ball that will allow us to review the indications given to us by our ally the sorceress, and other trinkets, the use of which, to tell the truth, is almost never or really profitable (apart from bombs), nor satisfactory. Conclusions Unfortunately, the scheme of Kiss Psycho Circus, even if it will give some satisfaction to players who perhaps approach this kind of game for the first time or who are more inclined to pure action, is starting to feel the years heavily. No interaction with the environments (only the doors you will open with keys or smash with some weapon); a linear story that couldn't be more linear (you will never have any chance to interact with it, you will simply see it scroll before your eyes with the non-dynamism that distinguishes it); simple mass destruction (there are even real monster generators that continue to reproduce them with incredible speed, and that you will hate very soon) which in the long run can become repetitive and monotonous; the presence of the ~end-of-level bosses~ typical of games from a few years ago; the same presence of the variable score based on the secrets discovered and the enemies killed; complete absence of cutscenes (even Blood2 had some) to tie a very thin plot; feeling of being almost ~extraneous~ to everything, because the only thing that will be required of us is to move the character quickly and continue shooting as quickly as possible, as if it were an arcade; the four episodes are absolutely not different (as perhaps happens in Mdk2 - maybe it would have been enough to have an encounter with different enemies...), even if in one, the third, you have to make use of gray matter, at least one thread more than the others ... all of this really undermines the overall quality of the product. Some merits (the fairly accurate graphics, fluid even on older machines, the sound, exceptional in some moments, the frenetic game action, the general speed of the game and the longevity that derives from the numerous, albeit somewhat repetitive, clashes) surely they will make it pleasing to all those who maybe approach this genre of games for the first time and above all for those who prefer frenzy rather than reasoning, but the game honestly if it is compared to Soldier of Fortune (not to mention the king genre, Half-Life) or the very recent Elite Force, really pales in comparison. With this, however, I don't feel like recommending the game to everyone, but to alert only those who in a Fps today are not only looking for a good dose of action (which in Kiss is absolutely not lacking), but also a valid story (perhaps guaranteed by a plot dynamic), interaction with non-player characters, presence of cutscenes, originality of weapons .... and so on; in short, those features that made Half-Life a step above the others (and gave Elite Force second place). A game inspired by a musical group. No, not exactly. In fact, Kiss Psycho Circus - The Nightmare Child, the first effort of the programmers of Third Law (a label belonging to the G.O.D. group, or Gathering Of Development), is inspired by a comic dedicated to Kiss, a well-known musical group that has experienced its moment of glory in the early 80s. The author of the above comic is none other than Todd McFarlane, who in the past gave us the splendid Spawn, one of the few comic characters of recent years to be saved, has licensed his last creation at the Software House. Todd is not completely foreign to the world of video games, having already participated both as a consultant in the creation of the title, however decidedly mediocre, inspired by Spawn and appeared last year on the Playstation, but above all as a designer and designer of some of the creatures that will appear in the future Ultima Origin (Ultima Online 2, so to speak). The adventures of the comic, and therefore directly those of the video game in question, tell of a decidedly heterogeneous group of four musicians who come across a rather particular circus, which links the world of humans to other parallel dimensions. In one of these, the Elders, i.e. the four of the Kiss group, until recently guarantors of peace and tranquility, as well as the balance of the entire universe, were defeated by a diabolical entity, the Nightmare King, who in the last battle, by dying, he however brought them to a better life. However Nightmare King, an instant before expiring, managed to generate his own son (The Nightmare Child, in fact), rilby letting a devastating new malevolent force into the universe; it is precisely to this force that our four, through four different adventures that will see us take control of each of them in a defined succession (even if at the beginning it is possible to choose which character to start with, regardless of the story, if you do not have interest in following the story - which is rather unwise). It all begins when the four protagonists, musicians, meet a strange and desolate circus (Bradbury would know something about it, perhaps - and those who don't know what he's talking about go read the wonderful book ~The people of autumn~), where a strange gypsy reads the future: the gypsy is actually a very powerful blind sorceress, the only one who actually realized the terrible danger looming over the universe, who voluntarily attracted our four friends. In spite of themselves involved in this strange story, they will have to make their way through many levels, populated (very populated, I would say) by various creatures more similar to ~Freaks~ ) than has ever been seen in other games of the genre.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
