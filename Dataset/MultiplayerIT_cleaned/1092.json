{"name": "Everquest 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everquest-2.html", "text": "Visual luxury Everquest 2 wanted to give a big shake up to the technological standard of online role-playing games, it was understood since the release of the first trailers and screenshots: not only high-resolution textures and ample sprinkling of recent generation graphic effects, but a significant increase in the number of polygons instead of a genre that has always relied more on the imagination of the players than on pursuing their aesthetic whims. Mind you, EQ2 would not be up to a comparison with most of the recently released software, but it is undeniable to see a clear superiority with its closest competitor - World of Warcraft in fact - although this technological difference must be paid for by someone , in this case the hardware of us users. Everquest 2 is not a game to be installed on the notebook and is largely capable of saturating the resources of the most powerful systems without yet giving its best, thanks to a scalable architecture designed to remain competitive for at least the next three years. The appreciable result is a graphic of remarkable quality and free from defects of particular relevance, provided that its somewhat ~cold~ imprint and devoted to photorealism is appreciated, evidently at the antipodes of the vibrant chromaticism and richness of style of the Blizzard title. In fact, from an ~artistic~ point of view, EQ2 does not enchant and even if there is no shortage of suggestive landscapes and ~glances~, you will hardly be fascinated by graphics that seem firmly intent on exploring every possible shade and tone of gray and brown. On the contrary, a detail on which the Sony title excels are the animations of the characters: although discontinuous in quality depending on the races of the characters, they prove to be not only well up to the situation, but above all quantitatively abundant and rightly varied. We have not yet seen an MMORPG that makes consistent use of a modern physics engine that provides for a correct implementation of collisions, but despite the fearful sword blows that we are going to inflict, they continue to cleave the air and that the flesh of the enemies , the final effect is sufficiently satisfying not to give rise to significant complaints. Concluding the review of the technical aspects of the game, the audio sector certainly deserves an appreciation: the effects are always appropriate and never over the top, as is the beautiful orchestral soundtrack, even if its continuous epic tones sound somehow out of place while chopping down a tree or hunting rats. Finally, how not to mention the unexpected abundance of recorded speech, probably guilty in a non-negligible percentage of the huge installation of over 7 GigaBytes It may seem like a negligible habit, but their introduction helps to make NPCs more ~alive~ and more similar to those of traditional RPGs, rather than the headless automatons all the same to which the massively online genre has accustomed us. Have a role in this world Now let's look at the purely ~role~ characteristics of the game, trying to highlight the main differences with the past and with the current competition. An interesting detail can be appreciated from the initial generation of the character and concerns the removal of the access restrictions to the classes by race. Which, translated into an Italian more understandable to the uninitiated of role-playing games, essentially consists in being able to undertake any career, from the magician to the warrior, regardless of the chosen race. Creating a Troll sorcerer may not be the smartest choice given the not exactly favorable racial modifiers, but a priori anything is possible. The limitations that take over are others, such as alignment, which in EQ2, in addition to being an explicit and binary choice (Good or Evil) is - rightly - strictly bound for some races. Our good (so to speak) Troll for example, in addition to belonging to a decidedly stupid species, will inevitably be wicked from the tip of his pointed ears to the nails of his ugly scaly feet. This is a rather important constraint, but in our opinion necessary: in fact, each character, having completed the initial training quests, will be automatically transferred, not on the basis of his race or the people he belongs to, but exclusively on the basis of his alignment, in one of the two main cities of the game. Forcing the Trolls to be evil at least has the advantage of avoiding hordes of grotesque, scaly-skinned humanoids who prowl about in the pristine whiteness of the innocent Qeynos. The effect would have been at least worthy of the view of the very honest Tauren of World of Warcraft happily wallowing in the sewage of the undead Undercity... The presence of only two starting cities, however, has its downside: in particular, it flattens much of the exploration charm that is often the engine that drives players to roam the virtual world of the game, discovering new races and their cities. The entire background behind Everquest is dwarfed by being crammed into the same city with all the other good or bad guys. Although Freeport and Qeynos are real metropolises, it must be admitted that the multiple starting points of World of Warcraft give a completely different flavor to the setting, enhancing it and introducing greater variety, at least as regards the initial stages. Returning to the generation of the characters, we can see how the name Everquest continues to be linked to the concept of wide freedom of choice: there are 16 selectable races including, in accordance with the increasingly popular fashion of ~animal~ characters, the new entry of the Ratonga , mouse-men aesthetically very similar to the Skaven of the Warhammer world, evidently the supporting characters missing from the old cat-men, renamed Kerra for the occasion. Cloak, sword and magic We have mentioned the combat system, we certainly cannot fail to delve into the matter. The mechanism on which it is based is the canonical division into turns shared (unfortunately) by most MMORPGs. Somehow courageous titles such as Neocron have managed to propose - even with some success - real-time combat, but currently it seems that the path taken remains that of the ~click & watch~, which in any case does its job well. In the case of EQ2 there was also room for some perceptible improvement: for example, it is now clearly visible to the player if a given monster is alone or belongs to a group that will lend him a hand once attacked. An interesting addition to the gameplay is the introduction of the so-called Heroic Opportunities, which in summary translate into devastating combos of our character's special abilities, activated by certain events during a fight. Quite effective in solitary, they unfortunately turn out to be less playable in a group due to the intrinsic disorganization of a large part of the improvised ~coterie~ in which one participates outside one's own guild: it is substantially impossible that our chain of attacks (which takes its time to be performed) comes to fruition by expressing its maximum potential on an enemy, because invariably our companions will tend to finish him in our place, effectively nullifying our efforts and wasting energies that could have been directed elsewhere. All this is part of a certain tactical depth that EQ2 can legitimately claim against other titles, although its innovative contribution to the genre remains minimal. Curiously, the general character of an MMORPG can be deduced from some of its particular traits, such as the management of character deaths. Extremely hardcore titles, such as Eve Online, almost always translate it into an economic or experience loss of significant proportions, while there are substantially opposite examples, where the passing of one's alter-ego is nothing more than an annoying setback to be faced with a grimace and a shrug. As a MMOG aimed at the general public, Everquest 2 leans more towards the second category, while demonstrating a remarkable balance, proposing a crossing of old and new concepts. As always, the classic experience and equipment penalties are applied, rewarding the player if he is willing to return to the place of death. The novelty is that instead of using the usual bind points, our hero is facilitated by allowing him to select where to be reborn near the place where he got stuck. A solution that allows a considerable saving of time, without completely removing the deterrent that death must represent. Comment Everquest 2 meets all the requirements that a sequel should meet, offering the right amount of new content and small corrections that the ancient ancestor now needed. The great leaps forward from a technological point of view are only minimally obscured by some gaps in game design which, however, will have to be filled in order not to risk that the game already proves to be ~conceptually old~ compared to the competition. An honest product therefore, worthy of the role it is destined to play in the MassMOG scene. But if it's the originality and spirit of pioneering innovation that you appreciate about this genre, then those are qualities you'll have to look elsewhere. Pros: Cutting edge graphicsGreat sound compartment Extensively tested gameplay, ~guaranteed safe~ Important numbers: 16 races, 48 classes for 100 levels, 160 unique monsters! Cons: No innovation Conceptually lagging behind with virtually no immediate PvP competition Another noteworthy novelty are the Froglocks amphibians, although not yet usable as player characters. Very fun to use is the configuration tool of the appearance of the character itself, of which we can modify not only the grossest features such as skin color and hair style, but a whole series of parameters ranging from the width of the jaw , the length of the chin and nose, the proximity of the eyes, etc. A real pity that the differences thus produced are only appreciable at extremely close range. In any case, the considerable number of races for the incredible variety of classes (a good 48!) gives life to an endless potential for combinations, with a consequent increase in customization possibilities, even if it must be said that most of this number is refers to the single specializations of the usual basic archetypes (priest, mage, fighter, scout). In fact, contrary to the simplifications introduced by Blizzard, EQ2 maintains the traditional system according to which newborn characters are ~neutral~, and even once the initial archetype has been chosen, they postpone any choice of great impact on their future. We can therefore speak of real personalization only after having accumulated sufficient experience to be able to direct the development of the character beyond the pre-established tracks of its initial development, personally providing for the purchase of skills other than those automatically obtained by leveling up. The effort put into the creation of quests is tangible which, according to a trend that involves all recently marketed MMORPGs, considerably facilitates the life of inexperienced characters, no longer left to themselves. Less understandable is the choice not to prevent the sharing of the same quests with other players, effectively forcing all members of a group to activate it by talking to the corresponding NPC and to complete the individual steps personally. Another defect waiting for desirable corrections is the design of the journal, an indispensable tool for keeping track of the missions undertaken. The lack of geographical indications relating to our objectives invariably forces us to have long and exhausting exploratory sessions, to then discover that the place we were looking for was actually just a stone's throw away. Likewise, the absence of any reference on the completion status of the quests (or at least if they have been successfully concluded so as to be able to return triumphant to the commissioning NPC) involves the constant company of pen and paper to take notes. Despite these game design limitations, the game still proves to be versatile and well balanced with regard to the classic activities of the ~carebear~, i.e. the average player interested exclusively in gaining experience by killing monsters and solving quests. The sector in which EQ2 proves to be lacking, at least for the moment, is PvP, practically absent. The reasons are many, not least, once again, the choice to divide the characters potentially able to fight each other, in two geographically so distant cities. Belonging to the ~good guys~ or the ~bad guys~, beyond the simple aspect of one's city of origin, seems completely irrelevant for the purposes of the game Belonging to the ~good guys~ or the ~bad guys~, beyond the simple aspect of one's city of origin, seems completely irrelevant for the purposes of the game and waiting for some ~game event~ organized by the GMs that involves some healthy clashes between players , the only form of competition remains the indirect competition that is created between the guilds for the number and importance of quests solved by their members for the purposes of an official ranking. If the Player versus Player leaves something to be desired, the crafting methodology (creation of objects) is rather innovative and aims to abolish the use of macros from above, which allow you to earn money without physically being in front of the screen. Crafting professions are now conceptually similar to combat professions, including experience levels and even hazards, as the process of building an item involves events that need to be responded to in real time to avoid incidents that affect the quality of the item itself or cause the injury (or death) of our character.
