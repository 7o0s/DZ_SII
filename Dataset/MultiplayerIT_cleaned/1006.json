It all starts from a particular observation: have you ever thought about the fact that a situation destabilized internationally (especially in the Middle East) by terrorism and political disorder is not just a disaster for everyone? In this climate, for example, the cost of oil (and subsequently of fuel for our machines and boilers) rises, alas, exponentially, which the big companies don't mind at all This was probably the mental incipit from which Dale Brown, former captain of the U.S. Force and author of great editorial successes with a political fictional background, he set off to build the plot of Act of War: the plot tells of a group of large oil producers, gathered under the very original name of the Consortium, which has decided to finance the most terrible and cruel terrorists of the world to bring down the already very precarious international and geopolitical balances and get even richer thanks to the upward push in the price of crude oil. To oppose this crazy criminal design, a group of army veterans is called into service and, together with the help of the most promising young military minds, a new Special Corps is created to find out who is behind the terrorist attacks and stop the terrorist attacks. organization before it manages to strike the very heart of the United States. Clapperboard: Action! To visually tell the ambaradan just stated, Act of War has been enriched with something like 45 minutes of full motion video (in 16/9) made with real actors. Even if there is some drop in quality in some situations and the dubbing (completely in Italian) remains at discrete but not cinematic levels, we are faced with the best narrative contribution to a video game: forget the almost insaneness of Command & Conquer, here the sensation is truly that of being in front of a real interactive action movie given the high quality of the footage! To make the visual perception even more impactful there will be the ~picture in picture~ that we will see in the upper left corner during the missions and which will show the game action from another perspective or parallel events to those that we will be experiencing firsthand. There will be quick interludes made in computer graphics and the best thing is that all the elements blend excellently with decidedly exciting adrenaline-pumping rhythms. The feeling is truly that of being in front of a real interactive action movie given the high quality of the footage! Wa Want Play! Rightly at this point, someone could rightly ask themselves: ~yes, but how is the game?~. From this perspective, Act of War could disappoint those who expected extreme innovations on the verge of a revolution of this kind. In reality Direct Action takes up and reworks in a superfine way what is the archetype of real time strategy and reaches high peaks of quality with the addition of original, albeit secondary, features. So here are the missions that more closely resemble a shooter rather than an RTS, the possibility of using various buildings as shelters and/or focal points, the capture of our enemies who will guarantee us resources (which we will also be able to collect through oil wells and the 'occupations of banks and credit institutes) and information to be spent to our advantage and finally the possibility of sending our wounded men to hospitals to be treated or to be treated directly on the front by sending an air ambulance. Listed together, you might get the sense of a deeply innovative gameplay: in reality, the heart of the game rests on the tradition of the genre in a structural way. Not necessarily this should be considered a bad thing, also because the single player levels are structured in an excellent way, the presence of dozens of vehicles makes the experience in battle very peculiar and the climax of the plot makes the experience even more exciting in-game Oh, how beautiful this city is before and after the destruction Act of War succeeds in the difficult task of capturing the player's visual attention thanks to a truly remarkable amount of elements present on the screen, managed by a completely three-dimensional graphics engine capable of really big zooms. And he didn't tell use are only soldiers and military means: for example in the level where we will find ourselves in the middle of a demonstration with thousands of people in the streets of London, the background will be incredibly interactive and the excellent effects implemented for explosions and various demolitions will make everything even more compelling. We are probably facing the best technical realization in an RTS also thanks to the painstaking work for the reconstruction of the cities, which took place on a 1 to 1 scale, managing to recreate interactive areas between 5 and 10 times greater than the maps of other RTS with a number of polygons equal to 15 million polygons (another decidedly impressive figure is the care of the soldiers who have a number of polygons equal to that of the protagonists of the first Half Life). Great care has been used to recreate the most important monuments that we will meet during our adventure: from the White House, to Buckingham Palace, from the Golden Gate to the Washington Capitol for which over 100,000 polygons have been used! There will be other distinctive features of a town such as road signs, residential areas, traffic intersections with roundabouts and flower beds. Much ~take care~ for the construction is equally manifested for... the destruction! Each building and structure present in Act of War will have various critical points on which to be able to rage starting with the most basic elements such as doors and windows. The damage will therefore be localized in the affected points and will also be visually updated with respect to the ~injuries~ received. Vegetation can also be burnt or razed to the ground (for example by exerting pressure with a tank), telephone booths or light poles knocked down by a powerful tank. The same monuments (such as those mentioned above) can be destroyed by terrorist attacks, super weapons or continuous and lasting firepower. However, not only large metropolises will be the backdrop to our war exploits: in Act of War we will really travel many corners of the world and the programmers promise the same attention to detail for the other backgrounds present such as small villages in North Africa or the Soviet architectural structures still prevalent in contemporary Russia. We are probably facing the best technical realization in an RTS also thanks to the painstaking work for the reconstruction of the cities A heartfelt applause also goes to the sound component: the weapon and environmental effects are truly ~full~, realistic and satisfying. Promotion with full marks for the various voiceovers that will make us aware of the various events and objectives that we will have to carry out during the level. At the base of the sound experience there will then be a decidedly cinematic background music from a dramatic moment in an action movie that makes everything even more emotionally strong. How long does the act of war last This is perhaps the most objective limit of Atari's game: completing the game levels of the single-player mode will not require a very large number of hours, despite the many (and pleasant) cinematic interruptions. I also advise long-standing strategists to set the difficulty level to the maximum since otherwise the comparison with artificial intelligence could prove too simple. Clearly, the possibility of simultaneous play up to 8 players in the classic skirmish mode both via LAN and online could not be missing. There will be three factions from which to choose our armies: two of ~good~ (the Talon Task Force, and the regular US army) and one of bad (clearly the evil Consortium of Oilmen), each with peculiar characteristics that will make the decidedly rewarding experience from a strategic point of view. Regarding online, I would like to point out the presence of a game room for training (called Fort Irwin, the training place of the American armed forces which is located between the mountains of Nevada and California) where you can play as much as you want without having any repercussions on your ranking. Then instead there will be a real ~War Room~ in which victories and defeats will affect one's ranking. At least fifteen maps are available initially. A particular cooperative mode is also foreseen in which two players will have to deal with various armies of artificial intelligence: the funny thing is that initially the human players will have to collaborate to resist the CPU but then they will also have to deal with each other for the final victory. The fact is that if the fratricidal clash happens too soon, the artificial intelligence will wipe them both out, but if it waits too long, the other human player could defeat you Interesting, isn't it? Comment There was soThere was so much anticipation for this Act of War that I was on the average worried: usually an excess of hype portends great disappointments or in any case titles unable to maintain the very high expectations. Fortunately, this did not happen for the new RTS from Atari: Direct Action proved to be a strategic game rich in cinematic appeal, not only for the action movie quality of almost an hour of footage, but also for the very Hollywood style of the action and for other frame elements that make the interactive experience decidedly adrenaline-pumping. Perhaps someone could have imagined in recent months that AoW would have revolutionized the genre also in terms of gameplay while instead limiting itself to reworking the archetype of the genre in a superfine way with the addition of various original, albeit secondary, features. To promote with full marks the technical realization (probably the best in the field of real-time strategy) both visually and soundly, sorry that the missions of the single player mode don't last too long but to continue playing with Direct Action c 'it's clearly the multiplayer Pros: Very high cinematic appeal Superfine technical realization of all the elements Convincing gameplay and excellent level design Cons: The single mode does not last too long Those who expected a revolution for RTS will be disappointed After the long coverage of Multiplayer on the new Atari RTS complete with previews, in-depth information sheets and interviews, we have finally reached the moment of truth with the review: did Act of War deserve all this hype? Are we really facing a new benchmark for real-time strategy? Will the title of Eugen Systems mark an epochal turning point for this genre?
