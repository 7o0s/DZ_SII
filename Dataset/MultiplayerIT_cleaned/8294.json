{"name": "Save the Just Dance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/109098-just-dance-4-save-the-just-dance.html", "text": "Among the outcry of the most uncompromising gamers and the warmth reserved for it by the mass public, the Just Dance series has reached its fourth episode, precisely respecting the annual deadline inaugurated by the first chapter dated 2009. Four years in which we have witnessed to an undoubted deflation of the party game phenomenon, an element that has not however prevented Ubisoft from selling millions and millions of copies linked to a franchise that has inevitably become one of the most profitable revenue instruments for the transalpine giant. And if we don't have the crystal ball to predict what the commercial success of Just Dance 4 here will be, we can at least give an opinion on the quantity and quality of the contents of this new edition. A slow dance and a strong dance As it was reasonable to expect from a series that has made immediacy and ease of use its strong point, Just Dance 4 does not propose changes to a by now super-tested game structure: the heart of the experience is therefore always represented by dance sessions that can be performed by mirroring the movements of the character on the screen and choosing from over 40 songs available in the package. Being a product that obviously gives its best when played in multiplayer, Just Dance 4 reconfirms its strong social attitude, both by allowing you to play any song up to a maximum of four users at the same time, and by offering specific group choreographies that require a pinch more effort and coordination. Like the play structure, the graphics and the interface have also undergone just a few filings, given that they were already fine as they were: the central part of the screen is occupied by the dancer whose movements you have to imitate, on the left an indicator it marks the progress of its score while the lyrics of the song and the pictograms are visible at the bottom which indicate in a fairly clear and effective way what the next dance steps will be. The team that wins does not change, therefore, and the Ubisoft title essentially maintains the strengths and weaknesses that accompany the series since the first episode: if therefore learning the banal game dynamics and throwing yourself into wild dances is something truly accessible to anyone, on the other hand the motion detection always leaves something to be desired, so much so that (particularly in the PS3 and Wii versions, given that the software only captures the movements of the controller held in the right hand) it is technically possible to obtain excellent scores even while sitting on the sofa and only moving the arms a little. Not that the lack of a more precise system is felt much, of course: the beauty of Just Dance 4 lies precisely in its indulgence, an indispensable vehicle for making even the most uncoordinated user feel capable of being able to move some discrete dance steps and - consequently - to have fun. What is certain is that the approximation of the sensors clashes a bit with the Just Sweat mode that peeps out in the main menu, and which in the intentions of the developers should help burn fat by performing a certain series of songs in sequence according to your needs: beyond the debatable actual value of such a workout, the presence of a calorie counter which evidently can't be very reliable almost makes you smile. Having said that, it is still a welcome variant, good for sweating a little in a carefree way and which helps to increase the longevity of the product, an objective to which a new system of challenges also actively collaborates: each song in fact presents objectives called Dance Quests, which can range from obtaining a certain number of stars to flawlessly performing a certain number of dance moves and so on. The game also invites the user to tackle all the choreographies available by randomly assigning this or that piece a score multiplier that allows you to significantly improve the evaluation of your performance. Continuing to talk about tricks to increase the life of the product, the convenient online shop for buying new songs could not be missing: in this regard, at the risk of appearing malicious, it almost seems that Ubisoft has put together a tracklist deliberately poor of many hits of the moment and instead peppered with songs already heard in a thousand other different contexts (did you really miss Las Ketchup?) specifically to facilitate access to the aforementioned store. And it is precisely a selection of songs less convincing than usual - and with a few covers too many - the only big drawback of Just Dance 4, which for the rest is fun without pretensions as by now tradition and isone of those few party games that don't need any gaming know-how to be appreciated. And this, for the fourth time in four years, is no small thing, even if it is inevitable that the mechanics and the formula will start to be at least a little inflated.
