{"name": "Sushi Shuffle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sushi-shuffle_a.html", "text": "Something is moving in the world of video games for Java-compatible devices, it should be said: if until now making a puzzle game for mobile phones automatically meant bringing back a classic, perhaps reworking it slightly to adapt it to the times, it seems that things are finally changing and that some developers have taken up the challenge to create something new. Wanting to take advantage of the peculiar characteristics of current telephones, it is possible to arrive at at least interesting solutions, as demonstrated by recent titles that use the integrated camera in a very original way. If we think that motion sensors are also starting to spread, the future possibilities appear endless. But you can also work well with classical instruments, right? With Sushi Shuffle, the developers of Glu have tried to do just that: to create a puzzle game with original themes, but which uses proven and always effective mechanics. As mentioned at the beginning, the aim of the game is to move rows of sushi plates of various types, putting identical ones together in groups of three or more, both vertically and horizontally. The paired dishes are eliminated, as in any puzzle game, but in this case they end up on the counter of the restaurant, where hordes of hungry customers are waiting for their order. The elimination of the dishes has repercussions on the rest of the ~board~, with the rows that continue to scroll to make up for the missing parts, generating other pairs and thus giving life to even very spectacular combos, which the graphics tend to highlight thanks to a number of nice visual effects. There are eight types of sushi in all, which are accompanied by six special recipes that boast different special abilities once coupled. It is possible to move the rows horizontally or vertically, switching from one setting to another by pressing the 5 key or one of the function keys, while using the d-pad a row is selected and possibly scrolled to pair the sushi. We must bear in mind that there are no limits as regards the scrolling of the rows, but that it is necessary to put together at least three identical dishes horizontally or vertically, therefore we will have to add an element to a ready-made pair: if there are none in the whole board, we will not be able to continue. There are two game modes available, which differ fundamentally in the level of challenge: in the first case we can play in a very relaxed way, with patient customers who wait their turn without making a fuss and allow us to complete the stages with ease; in the second case, however, the customers will represent a sort of time limit to our moves: we will have to make pairings very quickly, or the counter will empty and game over will come inexorably. Sushi Shuffle's graphics are very colorful, move fast and without defects of any kind, with a series of excellent effects when pairings (and combos, above all) occur and a good differentiation between the various dishes. In the background you can see the counter, with the various customers sitting in their seats, well designed and with a minimum of animation. Unfortunately the sound, once again, plays the role of a simple extra, with anonymous MIDI music that can be largely deactivated. Nothing to say about the control system, however: the response to inputs is always quick and precise, so you find yourself in a bit of difficulty only for the change between horizontal and vertical rows, which can be confusing at first.
