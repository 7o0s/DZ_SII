Over time, the big names in the industry have in fact preferred to play it safe many times, following well-known paths. Fortunately, however, a handful of heroes still resists and continues unabated to please those who don't always want the usual shooter, forced to get by in some way: there are those who try it with graphic adventures (a striking example is the project Double Fine Adventure by Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert, funded from below) and there are those who instead like Paradox Interactive had to strive as a publisher of itself, after having gained considerable experience within the strategic. A very specific sub-genre specifically, which is defined as grand strategy, typically linked to large scenarios and an action dilated over time. The Stockholm-based company has deservedly become a leading figure in this field: its experience, moreover, has its roots in over a decade of field activity gained from Europa Universalis onwards, as among other things we remembered precisely on the occasion of our hands on dedicated to Crusader Kings II, the title on which we draw conclusions today. Given that eight years have passed since its first arrival on the market for the brand just mentioned, it is reasonable to expect a convincing proof of Paradox. Especially after the half misstep made (as producer) with Sword of the Stars II. The rest of the premises are all there. Europe (slightly) united The year is 1066. Europe is far from becoming what we know today and the feudal system puts power in the hands of characters of various levels, ranging from great emperors to those who have to deal with a ~simple~ province. Needless to say, Crusader Kings II puts the player in the shoes of one of these characters, immediately freeing up any kind of choice: there is nothing to unlock to be Emperor and, even if it might initially seem, it's not even that. ultimate goal of the game for those who choose to impersonate one of the smallest fish. Put simply, the aim of those who start a game is to carry on their dynasty within the historical period that reaches up to 1452. The only condition necessary to continue in the game is that their line of descendants survives, so the underlying concern will always be to have a healthy heir. At least one in reality, because in a Europe like that of the Middle Ages it is necessary to watch one's back from everything and everyone, including one's relatives, engaging on several fronts to control the economy, diplomacy and armed conflicts. The freedom offered by the strategic Paradox is enormous, and it is therefore up to the player to decide how to move forward, thus defining the personality of his character. This is influenced by the decisions we make, altering the numerous values present in the game and in some cases giving real character traits, which then make up the essence of the interpersonal relationships of Crusader Kings II. For example, a wedding could be the best or worst way to stay in one's leadership position, given that it is not excluded that a particularly ambitious bride could think of killing her husband to take the lead. In this already complex framework, religion should not be forgotten, in a continent divided between Catholics and Orthodox: one can choose to maintain good relations with the highest authority of one's creed, so as to obtain benefits, but being able to change at a later time his own confession or even committing heresies, adhering to mysterious forms of worship or investing a full-blown anti-Pope. Total control The user finds himself having to keep all the aspects related to his power firmly in hand: contrary to what one might think and as mentioned at the beginning of the article, it is not by playing the role of an emperor that Crusader Kings II shows its full potential, rather forcing the player to rest on his laurels. The biggest challenge is linked to small towns, whose lords are in the perennial situation of having to maintain good relations with their neighbors and work hard to move forward without being overwhelmed. Fortunately, in addition to the general difficulty of the game, it is also possible to view the one relating to the path you are about to take thanks to the initial selection screen. In carrying out everyday life, the player is not alone, as he can rely on a court council, within whichand important figures appear to be assigned to various tasks. Also for its members, among other things, all the rules mentioned above apply, so we must be careful to choose faithful members who do not turn against us. The human factor is therefore the master, bringing the game mechanics in a role-playing direction: thanks to the work done by the developers on artificial intelligence, the feeling of living in a world with its own life is real, and allows you to immerse yourself totally in the game experience without deviations of any kind, given that even the fights cannot be followed on the field in Total War style, leaving everything to some simulation calculations. Those who know Paradox will imagine that Crusader Kings II also requires a fair level of patience between parameters and various operations, starting from the long tutorial (divided into basic and complex topics) up to direct experience: therefore it is useless to get angry about possible initial failures. Faced with so much difficulty, some may perhaps find the reward system too limited, limited in fact to a total score assigned on the basis of various parameters over the entire life of our dynasty. Formalisms aside, it is the game structure itself that gives the player the rewards he deserves: just think of the birth of an unexpected heir or perhaps the tiring conquest of a territory. Graphics and sound As per tradition, for games like Crusader Kings II there isn't much to say about the technical aspect, where polygons and 3D models are far from being the protagonists. What matters most is the interface, intuitive and functional despite the amount of information, ready to give the player repeated suggestions, offering him the possibility of deactivating the hint system only when he actually masters his tools. As for the rest, the game map efficiently shows us the composition of the terrains of the whole of Europe also thanks to some visual filters, while the few characters present on it do not particularly shine by definition: as just said, it does not matter . On the other hand, the soundtrack is excellent, an omnipresent support capable of perfectly accompanying the player through the story, increasing his ability to get involved in the context.", "date": "2012-02-21", "grade": "9.0"}
