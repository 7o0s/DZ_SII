{"name": "Bomberman Live - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bomberman-live-recensione.html", "text": "Xbox Live Arcade is a service that generally tends to reward simple but ingenious concepts, immediate and irresistible gameplay on the extreme care of the technical sector. In short, the classic arcades are the preferred product for the Microsoft digital delivery service, the ones that manage to fit better into the catalog and obtain the widest acclaim. Many of these, however, collide with the awareness that they can no longer represent a good level pastime, failing to pass the merciless test of time. Bomberman Live, developed by Backbone Entertainment, collects the evergreen heritage of the bomber Hudson and, with a few but well-polished introductions, becomes the optimal title for the Live Arcade offer: a timeless game, with immediate gameplay, easy to learn but difficult to dominate and above all equipped with a stainless multiplayer, all at the advantageous price of 800 Microsoft Points. The only flaw is its focus exclusively on versus, transforming itself from the ~full~ game of years ago, into a great multiplayer casual game. For those who have missed the approximately 10-20 episodes of Bomberman released over the twenty-year career of the masked bomber, we will briefly review the structure of the game: it is a sort of puzzle game in which we have to guide a little man to the inside labyrinthine levels viewed from above and as large as the entire screen, capable of moving in the four main directions and placing bombs, capable of destroying blocks and killing enemies in the area. Scattered throughout the levels are various types of bonuses, which can modify the character's movement possibilities and the destructive potential of the bombs (increase their number or the range of the explosion, mainly). This Live version focuses exclusively on the multiplayer mode of the game, the typical ~versus~, therefore purged (or rather impoverished) from the typical ~story~ mode. Having eliminated the typical scanning in progressive levels of the other chapters, with enemies of various types, bosses and increasing abilities, we therefore focus on the more lively action: the direct fight against opponents, human or controlled by the CPU. It is therefore a question of placing bombs to clear the way within the level (by destroying those blocks that can be destroyed), grab as many power-ups as possible (or concentrate on those more suited to the level) and try to eliminate the opponents: the last man standing has won. The explosions develop along the four main directions, and the whole game strategy is based on trying to trap the opponents within the radius of these explosions, being very careful not to become victims ourselves. If you think that the power ups significantly increase the number of bombs that can be triggered and the power of the explosions, all within relatively small arenas and with up to 8 players at the same time, you can easily imagine the frenzy that characterizes the game. New introductions Being based on the battle mode, the core of Bomberman Live are the arenas, in which these battles take place: their different characteristics represent the major variations on the basic gameplay. The Classic arena is the simplest one, which concentrates the action solely on the destruction of blocks and opponents, while all the others have particular ~environmental~ characteristics, which can mostly be translated into traps, secret passages and level design, which vary some game dynamics. Lost World has a desert setting with quicksand that sucks the characters; Ghost Town has special traps connected to fire, Big Top contains different arrows that allow you to throw bombs in certain directions and Spaced Out is characterized by the presence of numerous random teleporters, to name a few. Arenas can be selected one at a time (Battle) or played all in sequence (Tournament) in ranked or custom matches. To tell the truth, there are not many arenas, as there are not many main game modes, three: the classic one, with the typical system that rewards the last one who remains alive; Paint Bomb, in which you have to paint the largest number of tiles with our color (obviously through the detonation of the bombs); Zombie, a variant of Paint Bomb where you have infinite lives but losing one you lose part of the colored tiles, and finally Bombing Run, an accelerated version of the main mode. Games can be further refined through numerous secondary options: limit the number and type of power-ups, activate or deactivate blocks that fall from above when time runs out to shrink the playing area, or activate or deactivate the mode Revenge, with which it is possible, once eliminated, to sow destruction from the edge of the arena, precisely trying to take revenge or simply complicate the lives of those who remain in the game. An adaptation that fits perfectly Bomberman finds an excellent interpretation in this Xbox 360 version, albeit revised in an exclusively ~battlelike~ key, above all by virtue of the possibilities offered by Live. Clearly, since only the versus mode is present, the game practically loses all its potential if it is not played in multiplayer, and in this regard it must be said that Backbone Entertainment has done everything possible to ensure players can enjoy it to the fullest in company. Up to 8 players can join the game at the same time, with the possibility of including some CPU-managed ones too, in case you don't have enough human users. It is also possible to play with friends on the same Xbox 360, with multiple controllers, and with these all connect together to Live and participate in an online game, thus exponentially expanding the possibilities of playing in company. From a technical point of view Bomberman Live represents a good reinterpretation of the classic look of the series: having abandoned the sad parenthesis of Bomberman Act Zero, the game presents itself with the traditional overhead shot and the usual little men in costume and helmet, with few frills, at the beyond greater general definition and attention to detail. In this regard, the possibility of unlocking and using a whole series of objects (clothes, helmets, symbols) to customize the appearance of our character should be mentioned. The audio sector performs its function well, with contained and non-invasive music. There is also support for the Live Vision Camera, although rather limited, as it only allows you to send a few images at the end of each game. Comment If you have the ability (and the will) to play multiplayer (in ~presence~, online, or both), Bomberman Live represents one of the best gaming experiences offered by the Live Arcade catalog. The chronic defect of the series, the lack of consistency of the single player game, here becomes the main defect of the title, with a total absence of any progressively structured mode. This version of Bomberman therefore enhances the elementary unity in the gameplay of the Hudson game: the frenetic strategy of the multiplayer game, with games that run out quickly, but always leave you wanting to continue. There isn't much variety in the action and there isn't a large amount of different game solutions, a typical feature of the classic arcades and derivatives, but the simplicity of the structure allows for immediate insertion into the action for both experts and novices , and the fun is in any case guaranteed, perhaps also hoping for subsequent expansions concerning options and game levels. Pros: Fun and immediate Vast multiplayer game possibilities Elementary but pleasant style Cons: Only the versus mode present Lack of action variety Almost inconsistent when played solo", "date": "2007-09-20", "grade": null}
