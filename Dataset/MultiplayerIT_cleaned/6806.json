From Software has literally awakened the desire for this genre but also for rather difficult titles, while the previous market trend had led to more engaging experiences in which the challenge was no longer the center of attention. Lords of the Fallen is the offspring of this trend and is an extremely interesting project developed by the Germans of Deck 13 in collaboration with the Poles of CI Games, a team with a star within it: Tomasz Gop, already in charge of the heavyweight The Witcher 2 . The title has undergone various evolutions over time, making the leap towards the next-gen, together with the PC, and modifying its structure from the division into acts up to a single world that can be explored at any time of the adventure, to perhaps carry out side missions, open chests left on the street or use some portals that ~open~ after killing the boss of that specific area, and which allow you to obtain objects and a little additional experience. The protagonist is Harkyn, an imprisoned outcast who has the furrows of past sins on his face; from his release the events of Lords of the Fallen begin, in which the protagonist will have to redeem himself and fight against the invasion of the Rhogar, commanded by armored and highly dangerous Lords. When starting a new game it is not possible to select the appearance of the main protagonist, but the game still offers choices in terms of magical inclination and equipment. In the first case we have Brawl, Deceit and Comfort, which share the first ability, namely that of producing a hologram capable of distracting enemies and at the same time regenerating energy, to then focus respectively on defense, attack spells and some variations on the theme. Secondly, the choice between Cleric, Warrior and Thief takes place, which predictably allow you to start with different stats and equipment; in any case, during the progression it is possible to easily operate on the physical parameters of the protagonist to aim for a style of play more in line with one's own aptitudes pad in hand. That's all, in Lords of the Fallen the choices are deliberately limited beyond the growth of the character, who levels up, collects different types of equipment and can enhance the bars of vitality, magic and energy, which determines the resistance. Tomasz Gop actually told a lie, defining Lords of the Fallen different from Souls; the points of contact are actually multiple, with some variations on the theme that we will go into in depth in the course of the review. Action/RPGs aren't just Souls... Lords of the Fallen tries to have its say: here's our review There is always a second choice The setting where the adventure takes place is of a medieval fantasy type, full of saturated colors, light sources and imposing structures in which Harkyn moves, facing enemies and finding new passages. All in two large main areas: the citadel and its surroundings, which represent the last bastion of humanity, and the world of the Rhogar, which is accessed via a dimensional portal. The setting of the gameplay is exactly what one would expect, with the main protagonist being controlled in the third person, the equipment to be customized, any shield and main weapon. Also in this case the rule applies that if the total weight of the transported equipment is less than 70% of the maximum sustainable one, the protagonist is at the best of his agility during the slashing, dodging and running. As for weapons, we have eleven different types, including daggers, swords, spears, axes and broadswords. Each can be held in one or two hands, and the more imposing ones, for example, have a request for force majeure, under penalty of incurring speed and efficiency penalties. The control system provides for the parry (we tested the PC version with the Xbox One pad, and the command scheme to which we refer reflects the latest Microsoft pad) with LB, the light attack with RB and the heavy one with RT ; a single press of the X key allows you to switch between objects, that prolonged their use. With A you jump on the run or dodge in conjunction with the left analog while with B you cycle through the magical skills that are used by holding it down. The Y key assumes a very important function, quto change the fighting stance of the protagonist between grip with shield, two-handed or by equipping one of the gloves on the left hand that are obtained after a few hours of play, and which represent the only type of ranged attack linked to the bar of magic. The differences with the Souls are therefore in the mapping of the front keys of the pad, but we immediately found ourselves at home and we found the possibility of changing the attack position on the fly based on the type of enemy to face interesting. Every time you kill an opponent, Harkyn gains a certain amount of experience points, the multiplier of which increases as they are eliminated in sequence. As soon as you meet the save points, represented by red crystals, you can decide what to do, or whether to immediately spend the experience in characteristic and magical points, resetting the multiplier, or continue to conserve it to continue the streak. The moment you are killed you lose all the experience that remains on the battlefield, and at the ~rebirth~ you have to go back to the exact point of death to get it back. An interesting variation on the theme, therefore, which leaves the player with the choice whether to risk to make his character grow faster or to advance with greater caution, at the cost of having to ~grind~ when you reach areas with enemies that are too difficult to face. Lords of the Fallen tends to offer a high but less punishing level of challenge than Souls, and especially in the first hours of the adventure you have to face the enemies with relative caution so as not to leave us penniless, going around them and attacking them from behind, using parries, dodging and the most suitable weapon among those capable of greater damage or greater attack speed, also because the energy bar runs out after a certain number of slashes and parries. The mechanics of the combat system are sublimated in the fights against the bosses, present in good numbers during the course of the adventure: the latter generally have a vitality bar divided into three or four parts, which correspond to increasingly powerful and diversified attacks. Some have armor that must be eliminated before being able to sink blows, still others have ranged or unblockable attacks, which favor the use of dodging. These types of fights are reminiscent of the classics of the genre; each opponent has an attack pattern that must be memorized because otherwise it is impossible to get the upper hand. The interesting thing is that in these situations we had to adapt several times by changing weapons, using ranged attacks, the shield, slashing from behind or only dodging because the parry did not bring benefits to combat. The ~normal~ enemies themselves require different strategies: some are particularly sensitive to magic, others to physical attacks, others impossible to attack head-on by virtue of their large shield. By playing a bit with equipment and stats it is possible to customize Harkyn according to the style of play that suits him best, however, so every challenge always corresponds to more than one possible solution. About halfway through the adventure, as soon as you manage to get better equipment and upgrade Harkyn well, however, the difficulty rate gradually decreases: we happened to die much more rarely and the bosses themselves presented behaviors that were easy to counter, to the point that we began to move with extreme ease between the corridors and the settings without being too afraid of being overwhelmed by enemies. Some spells are also quite unbalanced, such as the Aries that it is possible to unleash against opponents and take them out with relative safety, without the risk of being overwhelmed in multiple clashes. The challenge does not challenge It is precisely starting from this aspect that Lords of the Fallen shows its major defects, also because the RPG structure is far from being profound: each piece of equipment, for example, can have one or more slots within which equip runes, after refinement by a blacksmith who can be consulted in various points; the choices available are rather limited, and their effectiveness is doubtful unless you proceed quickly only in the main quest, without finding extra equipment or anything else. The two game areas, while quite large, fail to give a sense of grandeur and after the initial discovery phase they can be navigated quite quickly; luckily the developers have demonstrated good level design skills between passages and shortcuts that open up and give a sense of cohesion between all the settings. Where the quest pmain is a succession of (few) dialogues and fights, some secondary missions require Harkyn to collect some objects, while there are a couple of more important characters who accompany the protagonist on more than one occasion, without however leaving a particular mark in a narration with great assumptions, but in reality not as memorable as the first bars suggest. During some dialogues it is possible to select the type of questions and answers to be given, and there are some points within which it is possible to make decisions that affect the course of the story, leading to multiple endings. For example, near a boss fight, one of the supporting characters asks Harkyn to spare him, because he can open a portal useful for his research. At this point, therefore, it is possible to ignore the request and fight, or to fulfill it and skip the fight at the same time, unlocking, among other things, a different objective. We completed Lords of the Fallen in about 16 hours exploring the length and breadth of the map and doing a good number of side quests, or so we believe because there is no location marker and there is no map; once the adventure ends, our stories end, but there is the possibility of starting over with the level, weapons and spells reached, perhaps by selecting another branch to add new ones to those already available, not to mention the possibility of making choices different throughout history. Choices that are actually somewhat mitigated by the ending itself, which is limited to telling what happened with a few supporting images, suggesting little difference between one version and another. Lords of the Fallen ~runs~ on a proprietary graphics engine developed by Deck 13, and generally the glance is good thanks to the artistic level it supports. In particular, the armor stands out, some of which are really nice to wear, and the creation of the bosses, which have an excellent number of polygons and give a real idea of power. The normal enemies are instead more derivative and do not shine for variety, the particle effects make the scenario more alive and there is no shortage of interesting glimpses, also thanks to the lighting system if we want to be a little ~fake~, but which goes perfectly with the medieval fantasy setting. The undulating movement of the camera while running is interesting, which gives a cinematic touch to the game, while we are more average in terms of texture and interaction with the environment, limited to the classic ~prop~ objects. We can therefore say that Lords of the Fallen is nice to see thanks to the applied effects and the artistic structure, but does not offer particularly important solutions in purely technical terms. The game is dubbed in English with subtitles and text in Italian, the acting is normal without any particular flaws, whereas the music sector offers songs that blend well with the setting. The parameters on which to operate in the options menu are quite standard, starting from the resolution, shadows, object geometry and textures, ending with anisotropic filtering, post processing and volumetric lighting. We tested the game on a PC with i5-3470 3.2GHz processor, GeForce GTX 680 and 8GB of Ram: by activating each effect from the menu and selecting high quality, the frame rate never dropped below 45 frames per second and remained most of the time anchored at sixty with Vsync active from the card settings. After installing the GeForce 344.48 Game Ready drivers, among other things also optimized for Lords of the Fallen, we found some additional bugs and game freezes, the patch released a couple of days ago has definitely improved the situation even if sometimes some interpenetration or uncertain camera in the narrow tunnels required to operate manually with the right analog.", "date": "2014-10-28", "grade": "7.8"}
