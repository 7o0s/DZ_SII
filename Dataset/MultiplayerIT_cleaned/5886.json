On the other hand, engaging in a series of musical challenges that test everyone's skills and reflexes always has its charm. Superbeat: XONiC is in this sense one of the last exponents of this type of production to arrive on PlayStation Vita and, we already anticipate it, certainly also one of the best ever in recent years to see the light on Sony's portable console. Made by PM Studios and Nurijoy, a company set up by former employees of Pentavision, a well-known South Korean development company, and published in Europe by Rising Star Games, it is in fact a title that can be played immediately, immediately having fun with gameplay well structured, colorful graphics and a great soundtrack. Also for these peculiarities it can be easily considered the spiritual successor of the excellent DJ MAX of the aforementioned Pentavision. Let's see together why. Superbeat:XONiC is a fun rhythm game but at the same time capable of giving anyone a hard time PSVita trophies Superbeat: XONiC offers the player 33 Trophies, divided into sixteen bronze, eleven silver, five gold and one platinum. To get them you have to meet the demands of the game, such as unlocking very specific songs, obtaining a DJ level of 99 and so on. DJ but with style The playability of Superbeat: XONiC in fact recalls that of the action-rhythm game DJ Max, as well as many other conceptually similar products such as Dance Dance Revolution, BeatMania or Guitar Hero. In fact, it offers mechanics that involve playing notes, displayed on the screen, with the pad keys or, in the case of this game, also with tactile commands. The latter, in our opinion, remain the best solution to better enjoy Superbeat: XONiC on PlayStation Vita. In fact, to ~play~ some of the faster and therefore more difficult songs in the advanced game levels, the classic controls, i.e. levers and buttons that make the title fully compatible with PlayStation TV, even if overall well implemented, can create some problems even to the most seasoned users due to the buttons being too small and which can lead to committing involuntary mistakes in a hurry. In any case, the gameplay provides that once the chosen song has started, animations, images and visual effects of all kinds will be displayed on the screen, as well as the notes of the song that will ~fall~ from the center moving towards the sides of the touch screen. The player is then called to interact with them, pressing the command relating to the color of the incoming piece towards the two side arches on the screen in time, in such a way as to ~play~ a very specific section. However, the notes are not all the same, so you must always pay attention not only to the rhythm, but also for example to the time necessary to reproduce it faithfully by prolonging or not the pressure of the relative key, dragging it downwards or upwards after a first touch , and so on. The more accurate the execution of a note, the higher the evaluation that the game will give to the user's performance, who can even bet on special combos and on a multiplier linked to a bar, placed at the top, to increase his score. right, called Fever. Once filled through the successful execution of a passage of a song, it can be activated to obtain an increase in score. Modes for all tastes During each performance, special DJ icons are also unlocked, such as ~shields~, experience bonuses or particular objects that are used, for example, to quickly recover energy, obtain temporary boosts or as a form of protection when you skip a note and thus avoid lose energy. In the event of mistakes while playing a song, in fact, the player loses ~vitality~ from the appropriate indicator, which empties after each mistake made, but which can still be restored by resuming playing correctly. The main one is the one called Stage, structured in such a way as to contain the game modes 4 TRAX, 6 TRAX, 6 TRAX FX and Free Style. Except 6 TRAX FX, unlockable after reaching a certain level, the others are available immediately. Each session has been designed to allow any type of player to fearlessly approach the rhythm genre and the gameplay of this product in general: thus, if 4 TRAX is the best option for beginners, given that things to do are less than usual and everything is simplified, 6 TRAX and 6 TRAX FX, which integrate new ~moves~ and functions with respect to the basic ones of the other option, remain the ideal solution for the more experienced playerrto. Free Style, on the other hand, is good for everyone, since it allows you to freely select the unlocked songs and have fun without too many frills. In all cases, however, it is possible to adjust the level of difficulty and even define the speed and number of notes that will be displayed on the screen when playing a song. At the end of each session, the game evaluates the player's performance, assigning him a specific score that takes into account various factors, including errors made in the execution of the piece or the skill demonstrated in the hottest moments of the performance. The result obtained can be shared on the Net if you are connected, and within the DJ Ranking of the product it is possible to measure and compare your results with those of other users from all over the world. Completing the various levels also means unlocking new songs, avatars and keysounds, the ~key~ sounds emitted when a certain note is struck, to help the user keep the rhythm. In da Club In addition to Stage there is also the World Tour mode, which consists of a series of missions that can be unlocked step by step by leveling up (level-up occurs automatically upon completion of some tracks), within fourteen nightclubs located all over the world, from Maresias' Sirena in Brazil, to Womb in Tokyo, Japan, to Duel Beat in Pozzuoli, Italy, and Route 66 in Bangkok, Thailand. Each Club contains three game sessions divided into Easy, Normal and Difficult, where you can take part in challenges with a series of different songs, with always different settings and game patterns: each mission requires the player to play one or more songs at the same time certain goals. The progress of the player's performance, as it happens in the other areas of the game, is evaluated at the end. Local scores can then be uploaded to the Net, in a global online ranking (DJ Ranking) where you can compare your results with those of other users around the world. In our opinion, this is the hardest mode of the game, and there are times when the challenge becomes so difficult that it is initially a little frustrating. To conclude our review, let's take a quick look at the technical sector, on which there is little to add except that each song is accompanied in the visualization with a series of beautiful colored and animated graphic images, capable of giving the context a certain touch. verses unique in the panorama of rhythm games. Speaking of music, the songs contained in the Superbeat: XONiC soundtrack are really very beautiful and of various genres, ranging from Pop, R&B, House, Techno, Electro, to Rock, Metal and much more, for a total of 59 tracks. Further confirming the variety of music and rhythm in the game is the fact that although most of the songs in the archive are in English, there are also some in Japanese, Korean and Spanish.", "date": "2015-11-18", "grade": "8.6"}
