{"name": "Europa Universalis 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/europa-universalis-3-recensione.html", "text": "Europa Universalis III for Dummies Entering the world of Europa Universalis for the first time is not easy and that is why the game is accompanied by a rich documentation and exhaustive tutorials. The almost 150-page manual offers a complete overview but is not very usable as a one-shot reading, to be done before putting your hand to the mouse, and this is why some training and explanation sessions have been included, to be carried out preliminarily and which in a couple of hours allow you to have the necessary tools to take the first steps in the Campaign mode. The game interface, the first aspect with which to ~collide~, has been simplified and reorganized, grouping each available function in a more intuitive way. The main menu offers a series of tools closely related to the socio-economic management of one's nation. The functions of the individual provinces and of the troops that allocate there can be consulted by clicking on them and in a similar way it is possible to act on the icons of the foreign states to manage their relations. The sidebar is also handy, offering all the statistical graphs, different ways of displaying the map  from geopolitical to religious  and interaction with the Church. Finally, of fundamental importance is the date indicator, which allows you to alter the flow of time. Paradox Interactive has defined Europa Universalis as a ~Pause-able real time strategy game~, precisely because of the possibility, at any time, of interrupting the unfolding of events and being able to reflect on what to do, make critical decisions and experiment with different scenarios, to then resume as if nothing had happened and at a speed of your choice. The good administrator Managing an empire is not an easy task, especially when the decisions to be made and the possibilities offered are thousands. In general, EU3 divides this task into two separate areas of interest: the administration of social-organizational aspects and the management of the provinces. The first task includes a large number of tasks and will occupy a large part of the first game sessions. The choices of state culture and religion must be evaluated on objective bases and can be changed at any time, for example to remedy popular discontent or uprisings, at the price, however, of greater instability. Also important is the creation of some support figures who facilitate legal interaction with other states, such as diplomats, or illegal interaction, such as spies. Vassals and explorers are needed respectively to make the workload less onerous in the single territories under one's domain and to evaluate the opportunity to establish new colonies. Finally, scientific and technological development is entrusted to figures such as the technologist or the naturalist and pondered by philosophers who, with their thinking, can increase national prestige. The provinces are the mirror of the capabilities of a player of the Paradox title. Each of them, in total there are over 1700, has its own interface, which allows those in possession of it to decide the main characteristics. Demographics, environmental contrast to the ideas of the State to which they are subjected, growth and productivity are important indicators of a province and vary according to the way they are managed: send a missionary to convert people of other beliefs, raise taxes and increase merchant exchanges in ports are not right or wrong actions regardless, they must be evaluated and weighted on the basis of how we have moved previously. The capital of each province can also be enriched with about fifteen structures used for the most disparate tasks and allows the allocation of new military units, both land and sea. The whole phase of administration of the nation, which sees in this chapter the description of only the fundamental points, has been thought out in an exceptional way, managing to balance the rather slow pace offered, with an enormous amount of choices and practicable ways, elevating fun and replayability to hitherto untapped heights for the strategy genre. Create an army, make alliances and conquer the world If a prudent administration of the territories available to you is fundamental, so is the ability to fight the wars essential to increase your empire. To do this, a vast series of tools are available which, of course, find their main outlet in facilitating the creation of units, available in great variety and allocable in each of the controlled provinces. Heterogeneous groups of troops can also be unified into a single unit, so as to simplify their movements and in whose command place a general, an admiral, an conqueror or an explorer, as needed. The real fights take place automatically, so there are no battlefields in which to move the soldiers, leaving the player with the only possibility of planning the salient moments, such as the surrender, the request for peace and the rhythm with which to carry out the sieges. From this point of view, therefore, Europa Universalis clearly contrasts with other famous RTSs, above all Command & Conquer and Age of Empires, proposing a typology of battles closer to that of turn-based games, appreciable even if not at all innovative and incapable of change the pace of the action, as, for example, happens in the Total War series. As a consequence of the unfolding of a war, a whole series of side effects can be experienced, which very often are difficult to predict: if the cause of war is not judged serious enough, a considerable loss of popularity in the international arena and the discontent of the people will unavoidable, just as a good peace treaty, with a fair imposition of supplementary taxes, will almost certainly have better results than an iron dictatorship. Errata and other additions The complex gameplay described so far and which can be largely associated with the entire series were not enough, EU3 manages to be appreciated also for a good number of substantial innovations, aimed at making the experience even more profound and at correcting previous errors or little-appreciated features . Historical realism benefits from a database of names and events without any comparison in a video game, while the introduction of the ~military tradition~ allows for some bonuses in the clashes in case the same warfare is pursued for a long period. Also new is the ~attrition~ system, i.e. the one that foresees the loss of some soldiers for environmental or personal reasons, which now incorporates all the inconveniences of the sea under its own heading. The introduction of the ~national ideas~ is also quite interesting, which consist of a series of bonuses that can be selected and capable of giving particular advantages: in total, a maximum of ten can be adopted, some of which are not mandatory but a crossroads to increase the horizons of conquest; above all the ~Mission for the new world~, which kicks off the discovery of America. Also completely new is the concept of espionage and spy, through which to have important information on other states. The multiplayer benefits from support for 32 players simultaneously, even in cooperative mode - that is, allowing multiple people to control a single state - and has been made more stable. Interesting additions, therefore, capable of giving new stimuli even to the most expert and savvy EU enthusiasts, who above all will rejoice in the renewed and better multiplayer, the final challenge for anyone who has already analyzed all aspects of the single-player campaign. Even the eye would like its part In a complex of absolute magnificence, the heart aches to have to talk about the graphics proposed by Europa Universalis III. The representation of the events and the game menus are in a good 2D, with very well done drawings and rather lively colors. The problems arise with the use of the 3D engine, which has been inserted to represent the units, the ships, and some settlements, all made in an approximate way, with models that are really poor in polygons and not very suitable to stand comparison with even non-production productions. most recent. The sound is positive, which offers musical themes and effects fully suitable for every situation, but it does not stand out for its variety and, bearing in mind the longevity offered, it is rather repetitive in the long run. On the other hand, the artificial intelligence is splendid, capable of responding blow by blow to every move and able to vary its action based on the era in which it is located, so as to always maintain historical veracity at the top. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium IV 1.9 Ghz RAM: 512 Mb Video Card: 3D 128Mb with DirectX 9.0c support Disk Space: 1 Gb Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 Ghz HT RAM: 1 Gb Card Videos: NVIDIA 7900 Conclusions Engaging and profound, Europa Universalis III fully repays the long wait that lasted several years. The management of one's own nation and relations with others makes use of an enormous amount of options and possibilities, while all aspects of warfare are more based on troop management and diplomacy, leaving out the battlefields and suffering from a rhythm for many too slow. The modes are reduced to just the Campaign and Multiplayer Challenge, but that's enough. Technically fluctuating, subdued graphics and discreet sound, it excels only in the interiorArtificial intelligence, sometimes even too advanced and able to make the proverbial ~seven shirts~ sweat. History buffs and those looking for a product with exaggerated realism will find bread for their teeth in the Paradox Interactive title. For all the others, at least one test is recommended, just to dispel any doubts. Pros 300 years of history, 200 nations, 1700 provinces and a myriad of options Almost infinite campaign Exaggerated realism and steep learning curve... Cons ...not for everyone Technically it's still far from other illustrious titles Paradox Interactive is one of those developers that only PC gaming can afford, being known for its strategic games with immense realism, capable both of exalting enthusiasts and of proving to be difficult and at times frustrating for everyone else. In particular, the Europa Universalis series, freely inspired by a famous board game, has stood out from the very beginning for the need to pay extreme attention to every single aspect of the management of an empire. This third chapter takes into consideration the period between 1453 and 1789, from the fall of Constantinople to the election of George Washington as the first president of the USA, during which you can impersonate any of the 200 nations present and do whatever you want with it, there being no pre-calculated goals or endings. In any case, the choice of the country to be controlled must take into account its historical background, as a certain relevance is required in formulating one's plans.", "date": "2007-02-20", "grade": null}
