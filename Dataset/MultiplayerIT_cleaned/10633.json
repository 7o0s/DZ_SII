{"name": "Redfall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/redfall-recensione.html", "text": "In June of last year, on the occasion of the traditional summer conference dedicated to the future of the Xbox division, Microsoft chose to arrive on the stage of the event armed with a new promise, with the clear aim of reconciling with a community left drastically without exclusives for everything 2022, and still hanging from a series of announcements that have been swallowed up, one after the other, in a black hole of silences and postponements. The company was evidently aware that it hadn't offered who knows what recognition to anyone who bought a new generation Xbox, which is why Phil Spencer guaranteed on stage that everything that appeared that evening would be delivered into the hands of players within the next 12 months , without any possibility of appeal. Today we know that things have not gone exactly as Microsoft had traced them, yet there is no doubt that the opinion that fans have of the Redmond house is now significantly more positive. The players had the patience to welcome the postponements of Starfield and Forza Motorsport with a cheerful ~never mind~, also because after years of hiding at least Xbox is now there, together with Sony and Nintendo, to occupy the release calendar with a important first party production. Of course, we could all somehow predict that Redfall would have a hard time playing against two giants of the caliber of Final Fantasy XVI and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, however we could bet on the fact that hardly anyone would have reasonably imagined that Xbox, in this delicate context, would have presented itself to this decisive convergence of May and June with one of the most disappointing exclusives since Crackdown 3. In the Redfall review we will take stock of the few lights and the many shadows of Arkane Austin's new effort, trying to understand how it is possible that whoever made Dishonored's Dunwall and Prey's Talos I station ends up proposing a mediocre vampire shooter that has nothing to do with the standards to which the studio has accustomed us. Feel free to leave the stake at home, Arkane's vampires don't bite. An interesting concept, a disappointing execution The vampires of Redfall have blotted out the sun and now rule the island, what could possibly ruin their rule? Looking back at Harvey Smith and Ricardo Bare's previous work, the idea of Arkane working on an open-world shooter was both exhilarating and mildly scary. The studio has earned its reputation for sculpting simply memorable environments, but the ability of these worlds to bend and twist to accommodate the player's every intuition is what has allowed them to be permanently imprinted on our consciousness. Like a mimic, the map seemed to change to suit your imagination, making you find paths that you had drawn in your head a few seconds before. Applying this magic to an open world format would have required an incalculable amount of effort and resources and, although our hope was precisely to come across a boundless Dunwall at the service of our curiosity, it is now easy to realize that the venture was nothing more than structurally unfeasible. Here, the very first thing we can say about Redfall is that the game has a dimension very similar to that of the other works of the team, only that here its borders are pulled and stretched by force to adapt them to those typical of an open world. The result? A highly diluted and completely anachronistic experience, when compared to the current standards of open world video games. Redfall captures from Stoker's imagination the best way to turn any vampire to dust It's a real shame considering that, at least on paper, the narrative premises from which the study started were more than promising. Redfall takes place on the American island of the same name in the state of Massachusetts, which if you have followed at least a little the promotional fanfare that preceded the game, you will know how to be invaded by thirsty bloodsuckers. The interesting thing is that in Arkane's game, unlike what happens in the extensive bibliography of clear Stokerian matrix, at the origin of the vampires there is not some biblical plague, but something much more terrifying: capitalism. In fact, the transformations originate from some experiments that an unscrupulous pharmaceutical company, Aevum, conducts on the island in search of profit and power. It is precisely the top management that transforms itself first, weaving what is a sort of hierarchy among the ranks of vampires. We found this narrative frame sufficiently original, but we were very disappointed to discover that rebuilding progressively what happened on the island and in the Aevum is the only expedient that Arkane has developed to hold together the shreds of an inconsistent, generic and hasty story, which will have a lot of difficulty in involving you in its plots. The story of Redfall is articulated along the hunt for the supreme vampires, through superficial and often ill-conceived boss fights The story immediately settles down on absolutely linear tracks, contenting itself with taking us by the hand in the progressive cleaning of the two open world maps of Redfall, without ever feeling that iota of intensity or suspense that a plot with horror tones should give away in at least some juncture. Absurdly, the game is also devoid of real narrative films, given that for some inexplicable reason the developers have preferred to articulate the main points of the story through slides in which the characters remain motionless, while being dubbed. We didn't expect who knows what from what remains a game in which vampires are killed, but some stylistic choices and the design of too schematic main missions that are repeated for each supreme vampire quickly bled all forms of involvement, leaving us at the mercy of a gameplay with obvious imperfections, but also with some interesting ideas. The delicate relationship between Arkane and the shooter genre Redfall, as per Arkane tradition, is not supported by a particularly pleasant gunplay Let's start by addressing the thorniest issue, relating to the shooting. Anyone who knows Arkane's DNA will know well that it is not one of the studio's specialties and this is also seen in Redfall, which is in turn characterized by an unsatisfactory and somewhat inaccurate gunplay. In reality, the beauty of a fight depends primarily on who you are facing, for various reasons: on the island we find many humans who have enslaved themselves to the vampires and against them, for example, classic weapons prove to be particularly effective, such as pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Shooting humans is the least enjoyable thing we've found on Redfall Island, as not only are these opponents' AI ridiculously backward, but also because ordinary guns never quite offer a proper feel during the fight. action, also due to the standard settings of the dead zone of the sticks which make it very difficult to aim in the most hectic situations. Conversely, dealing with a creature of the night and throwing the offensive potential of one of the three vampire-slaying weapons at him manages to return great feedback, and the beautiful Arkane-style creature design plays a huge role in this. Vampires are by far the hardest thing to kill in Redfall, which is why we'll have a special set of tools specifically designed to turn anything with canines longer than 2 centimeters to dust: the stake gun, the UV beam, and the flare gun, as well as making Buffy extremely proud of you, will be able to give you a real chance of survival, even against very powerful vampires. Redfall's elite vampires can be a serious obstacle to survival on the island The AI of the bloodsuckers is much better than that of the human enemies, even if in some situations it can happen that they too get entangled in some obstacle during the attacks. But what makes them much more interesting as enemies is their variety, not very deep, but still sufficiently heterogeneous. Each one will call up different abilities and attacks in combat, and even if you've already met them all by the middle of the story, the good number of specimens guarantees a fluid alternation of encounters with different rules.Redfall is anything but a looter shooter, yet the equipment that found scattered throughout the American town they all have a reference color, which reflects the amount of skills that add to the weapon's stats. We will go into the matter shortly in the speech on the theme of the quality of the open world, but already in this phase we anticipate that the game is devoid of all those subsystems that usually crowd open world shooters: there is no shadow of a mechanism for crafting, weapons cannot be modified except in the aesthetics, and there is no form of customization of the characteristics of the equipment. The recipe modeled by Arkane is quite bare and the only thing capable of giving a pinch of depth to the gameplay is the presence of the four characters in which we will visit Redfall, each with a set of clothesunique abilities that seem to be taken directly from those available to the protagonists of the studio's previous video games. The abilities of the protagonists of Redfall can be improved by obtaining skill points It is not clear why Arkane has come to such a radical choice, but looking closely at the abilities of Jacob, Layla, Dev and Remi, one gets the feeling that the studio has fragmented those abilities that appeared in its previous works to distribute them to the new ones characters, but forgetting to give the player the opportunity to change his choice on the run. At the beginning of the game you choose one of the protagonists and you have no way, however, to test the skills of the others in the same save, with the result that in Redfall the player has much less opportunity to express his creativity through the gameplay, compared to what it happened in Dishonored. However, we must admit that the presence of skills manages to make Redfall's gameplay much fresher, even if these are fewer than we would have liked. Interestingly, after trying them all, the four survivors offer completely antipode gameplay models, which somewhat fuels the replayability: Jacob, our first character, accompanied us throughout the story with his crow, becoming invisible and hitting enemies from a distance with his ghost rifle, but in his shoes we often regretted the fact of being able to quickly climb buildings, which Layla and Dev do very well. Remi, on the other hand, aligns with a more supportive role, also having skills dedicated directly to multiplayer cooperative. Each power can then be improved and customized in a skill tree that is not very deep, but absolutely functional for a game of Redfall's ambitions. An open world that bleeds fast In the world of Redfall there are many freely explorable interiors, but rarely can you find something worthy of note inside As we said at the beginning, it almost seems that Arkane in packaging Redfall has harnessed one of his typical open map adventures in what is in all respects an open world bare and poor in activities, unable to offer real incentives for exploration. The story unfolds through two dozen main missions designed to offer the multiplicity of approaches that is a trademark of the studio, but beyond these and a handful of secondary ones with a very simple design, the island offers very few other pastimes for those who are lover of walks in the moonlight. There are in fact basically only two other things to do, in the open world erected by the Texan studio and they end up being mandatory tasks, throughout history. The first is the methodical and systematic extermination of Redfall's neighborhoods, an activity that proceeds according to a well-established script. Exploring you can come across shelters, places to restore medical kits and ammunition between one shootout and another. Here you receive a couple of missions, aimed precisely at freeing the whole neighborhood from the vampire influence, and after completing them you receive the skull of a vampire general, an object necessary to later unlock the dens of the bosses in the Redfall story. This is what the heart of a vampire nest looks like in Redfall The other is instead embodied by the nests of vampires, an activity that has all the impression of having been embroidered for the cooperative game, but which can be carried out in complete autonomy even alone. The hideouts are small and simple dungeons that appear on the map in random positions, and have a radius of influence that gradually widens, going to strengthen the enemies that are inside it. If you want to avoid tackling these areas, it goes without saying that it will always be necessary to clear the map of hideouts at some point, with the incentive that once completed they reward the player with a good amount of equipment and resources. The end has a particular mechanic, which made us think of the cooperative: when you destroy the heart of the nest, you only have one minute to collect all the rewards scattered in the final chamber, a task that alone is practically impossible, but which instead allows to the group to collect all the loot before the timer runs out. These activities are obviously not enough to justify the existence of an open world, and neither can the aforementioned cooperative do it, since it is never really possible to perceive what it is the game mode the developers were thinking of when they laid the foundation for Redfall. At times, the Arkane title seems to have been designed to be consumed in company, from the moment", "date": "2023-05-02", "grade": "6.0"}
