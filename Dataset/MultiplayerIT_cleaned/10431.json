{"name": "Eroi emergenti!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71668-axel-pixel-eroi-emergenti.html", "text": "The videogame panacea that responds to the name of Xbox Live Arcade has revived this year numerous pearls of the past, revisited in a modern key, belonging to the now almost abandoned and forgotten genre of point and click, arousing interest and happiness in the majority of fans of that era. The Microsoft service would seem to be the key to the resurrection of some genres that otherwise would never find space on the shelves, invaded by too sophisticated, modern and polygonal products. 2K Games seizes the opportunity and manages to create an ~old-fashioned~ video game of absolute value, both from a playful and purely artistic point of view. This new two-dimensional point and click is called Axel & Pixel, and it tells how the first one (a painter) ended up because of an evil rat trapped in a world of pure fantasy. In the company of Pixel, his faithful four-legged friend. The game is made up of (only) 24 schemes, divided into four seasons, in which we have to help the two protagonists escape in order to return to reality: their delightful mountain cottage nestled in the snow. Each pattern is faced horizontally: from left to right, where a red arrow indicates the escape route to the next pattern. By moving the cursor on the screen we have to look for clues, activate mechanisms, move objects and do everything possible to pave the way for our two friends. The puzzles are initially very simple, and gradually become more complicated as the adventure progresses. The game is never frustrating: the difficulty level is calibrated on medium-low and we rarely find ourselves in the need to resort to one of the three aids available for each level. During the adventure we must also try to collect as many pieces of the artist's painting and bones for the dog, a factor that prompts us to sift through each scheme well and often to re-face some of them that have already been outdated. Xbox 360 goals Like any Live Arcade game, this Axel & Pixel is also giving away the usual 200 points to unlock, through 12 fairly simple objectives to obtain. The brevity of the game and the fact that it is contained in 24 schemes make the objectives within everyone's reach: it is basically a question of completing the game, finding all the hidden objects and making some records in the mini-games present during the adventure. 200 Points within everyone's reach, without frustration. Point and puzzle The puzzles to solve and the mini-games inserted in the course of the story have the pleasant function of breaking the rhythm and slightly diversifying the general gameplay, providing an opportunity for further fun, albeit quite simple. Axel & Pixel is somewhat reminiscent of Professor Layton on Nintendo DS, with a good story that serves as an excuse to put us in front of relaxing and ingenious puzzle games. The gameplay is essentially based on reflection: study which are the clickable elements of the scheme, and by logical deduction act on them in a certain chronological order. The temptation to resort to aid becomes weaker when we notice the possibility of unlocking objectives by not using them, as well as access to particular mini-games dedicated to the best players. During the resolution of the levels it happens several times that quick time events are activated, or those moments in which we have to press the right buttons in rapid sequence, without wrong timing. SEGA's Shen Mue teaches. These fast action sequences certainly don't distort the essence of Axel & Pixel's gameplay, which is to be extremely reflective and deductive. This same nature of the game integrates perfectly with the graphic style adopted by the developers: the fantasy world where our friends fall is very reminiscent of that of the best films by Terry Gilliam, Labirinth, Dark Crystal, and if we want the Chocolate Factory. The backdrops are made up of high definition photographs, on which drawn 2D elements, the protagonists and all the rest, are delightfully juxtaposed, with a really fun and well done cartoon-style animation. The musical accompaniment is very inspired with dreamlike but at the same time cheerful and carefree music, never invasive or boring. The sound effects recall, perhaps deliberately, the memory of many games of the same genre from many years ago, winking (the ear in this case) to longtime fans, resulting very pleasant and always spot on. The originality of the graphic and sound sector of Axel & Pixel make it very special and subject to interpretations of personal taste, but we feel like saying that the final result is very satisfying and above all it manages to portray, precisely, a fantasy worldstic.", "date": "2009-10-27", "grade": "7.8"}
