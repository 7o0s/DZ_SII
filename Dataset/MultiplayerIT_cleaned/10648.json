With that episode, DICE made a truly courageous choice, skipping the PC version, which had given birth to the progenitor of the series, namely Battlefield 1942 in 2002. Among other things, last year's episode had greeted the debut of the Frostbite Engine, that is a proprietary engine that allowed an interactive environment never seen before and that allowed strategic and tactical solutions out of the ordinary, as well as a healthy feeling of power in the face of walls and buildings that went into a thousand pieces. Strengthened by that experience and eager to smooth out some of the criticisms that had hit the multiplayer of Bad Company, here is the Swedish company presents this Battlefield 1943 which, for the purchase price, is one of the best experiences you can try online with a small download from Xbox Live and PSN. Straight to the target This 1943 is an essential and immediate version of the typical Battlefield online. There is only one mode provided, Conquest, which sees two teams, in the role of Americans and Japanese, who compete for the garrison of the stations located along the map. The team that manages to dominate most of the positions, consumes the energy of the opponents until it is exhausted and, therefore, to victory. There are three maps and they are the ones that the players had shown to appreciate the most among those of the old Battlefield 1942, obviously combined with the possibilities offered by the Frostbite engine and the destructibility of the environments. In a few moments a game is formed and you end up on the net, without lag and with 24 players, arranged in two teams, each of which can be divided into sub-groups of four in order to be able to chat, trying to coordinate, clearly recovering the net Bad Company queues also have the same communication problems, however, as there is no way to talk to members of your own team, other than members of your sub-team. DICE, however, also took note of one of the defects found with the old game, namely the damage that was inflicted on soldiers by building explosions, sometimes really excessive, mainly because the player's energy did not restore over time . Here, not only have the damage been decreased, but the energy is recovered after a few moments away from enemy fire, effectively making the field medic class superfluous, and making only three survive: Infantry, Assault and Snipers, each with its set of weapons that can be changed at the start of the game and after each death and consequent respawn, which, as in the past, can take place from any outpost conquered by your team. Xbox 360 goals Like all the games available on the Marketplace, the loot of available points amounts to 200. They are all naturally achievable by playing online and without any particular problems. In short, few, but definitely accessible. The maps are vast and well designed, the action is frenetic and precise, except in cases where, even aboard a tank, due to the whims of the engine, it is not possible to blow up buildings clearly centered in the crosshairs. We easily pass over these little notes, because between the frenzy, the fun and the work done on the engine, it's hard to believe that it's a simple game available for download. The aforementioned tanks, jeeps and planes are back, to which a fourth map is dedicated, all in the skies, which will apparently be available when 43 million kills have been consumed on EA's servers. The graphics engine confirms its goodness and this time the use, for some excessive, of the screens that characterized the visuals of Bad Company has also been abandoned, giving the whole package a decidedly cleaner and even more convincing appearance. Of course, there is no progression system, if not the one related to experience points that lead to rank up, and the desire to unlock achievements and trophies, but for the purchase price Battlefield 1943 represents one of the best examples of how to take advantage of the new software distribution methodologies and a great investment for fans of competitive online gaming.", "date": "2009-07-08", "grade": "8.8"}
