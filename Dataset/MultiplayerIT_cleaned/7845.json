Yet, if many have wanted to chase this fake Eldorado to start their own crowdfunding campaign, several teams have discovered on their own skin how user trust and the exposure given by Kickstarter also involve a series of responsibilities and complications. One of the most obvious cases is Star Command, a mobile game developed by the young boys of War Balloon, whose epic has gone through two poorly managed fundraisers, some postponements and drastic downsizing. The initially proposed project was a trekker's dream: an ambitious Enterprise simulator, in which the player managed the life of a crew in a spaceship, exploring galaxies and taking on pirates, negotiating with new civilizations and breeding with alien races. A sort of FTL presented however with lively tycoon game graphics. Too bad that the authors have underestimated (once again) the amount of work and resources required by a project of this type, and so the enormous promises and ambitions of the original project have not been kept, if not in microscopic part. ~But it's a piece of scrap metal!~ Star Command's space adventure is introduced by a fairly simple editor with which the player can decide the appearance of the Captain of his ship. In reality, the available options can be counted on the fingers of one hand, ranging just from sex to skin color, from a few hairstyles to some facial hair. Subsequently you move on to choosing the name and color of your starship, despite the fact that a single model is available at the first start: to access more spacious and resistant ships it is necessary to complete the game at least once, but once you reach that point you he hardly wants to replay the whole campaign on a higher difficulty level or with a bigger means of transport. Once on board you are immediately asked to build rooms, hire new crew members and give each of them a particular task: the red-suited soldiers can position themselves at the ship's cannons or defend it from possible boarding; the technicians, dressed in yellow, are able to repair the damage suffered, while the scientists in blue heal their allies. The Captain plays a bit of a joker and can fill any role, but even if his stats are significantly higher than the average, the game ends the moment he is killed. A step-by-step tutorial guides the management of the ship and its crew, but just when the first space fight with an alien ship begins, the player is left without a guide, forced to intuit in a completely autonomous way how the combat system works. Each weapon (blaster, laser, machine gun) is associated with a different mini-game of reflexes and timing, but it will take a few empty attempts before deciphering the interface and finally firing the first shot. Just continue a little 'in the plot to realize that all the promises made by War Balloon are not present in the game, and that the entire campaign is nothing more than a succession of battles that are all the same and of increasing difficulty. Diplomatic relations with other alien races are minimized and aimed at progressing the story, while the sense of exploration is limited to a series of checkpoints that lead from one planet to another until the final fight. Although the minigames eliminate the few simulation ambitions left in Star Command, the space battles therefore represent the only real lively and fun moment in the whole package: you have to dodge the incoming shots, go on the counterattack, send soldiers to intercept the aliens that board, move the wounded to the infirmary and in the meantime repair the damaged parts of the ship, being careful not to be sucked out in the event of a breach in the wall. Too bad that the developers let themselves go to huge design slips and bad examples of balancing: the artificial intelligence of the technicians is concerned with repairing only the damages that are immediately adjacent, completely ignoring a fire a few steps away; the same goes for the soldiers, who shoot on sight but cannot be sent in pursuit of the attackers. Furthermore, the various crew members cannot change profession instantly, slowing down the action and often creating frustrating moments: if you want to transform a technician into a soldier, perhaps to strengthen your defenses, you have to send him to the engine room, wait for thatput on the yellow onesie and twiddling your thumbs as you see him snap back into place. As if that weren't enough, the difficulty curve rises from one moment to the next making the more advanced levels too frustrating, but paradoxically to win it is enough to move the entire crew into a single room and wait for the aliens to be shot down as they they enter through the front door. As long as the Captain is alive it doesn't matter how much damage the ship takes, further demonstrating hasty or superficial game design work. To top it off, so to speak, there is the excessive precision required by the crew control system: if on the iPad it often happens that you touch the wrong box, on the small screen of the iPhone it becomes a surgical challenge to say the least.", "date": "2013-05-09", "grade": "6.5"}
