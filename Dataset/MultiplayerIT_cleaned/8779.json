{"name": "L'ultima speranza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98567-sol-exodus-lultima-speranza.html", "text": "From the point of view of the atmosphere SOL: Exodus defends itself quite well despite the evident modesty of the project. Good quality music and dialogues dubbed into English with a fair amount of care manage to quickly put us in the shoes of a pilot engaged in a difficult space mission. Indeed, humanity is on the verge of disaster. The sun is dying. But on the other side of the cosmos is a remedy and it must be brought home. Unfortunately, the way through the solar system is fraught with obstacles and the darkness of space hides not only hope but also extremely powerful enemies. A relatively deep space From the point of view of the guidance system SOL: Exodus is a Wing Commander title. Instant targeting, afterburner almost always charged, extremely manageable spaceship and also some touches of class such as the possibility of entering slide mode, i.e. rotating the nose of the spaceship without modifying the inertial thrust given to the aircraft previously, simply by holding down the right button of the mouse. Among the other facilities we find then the possibility of engaging the targets by holding down the launch button of the missiles. In short, extremely intuitive, even if the targeting system is terribly inaccurate both from a graphic and a practical point of view with random cycles and bad indicators. But this is not the only problem of the title whose limited structure is incomparable with that of most exponents of the genre. In fact, there is a lack of choices, crossroads, freedom and above all the feeling of growth. This despite a timid advancement system that allows you to spend points to improve weapons, shields and afterburners. In fact, the aircraft is one and only, for the entire title and in the second mission all the weapons are already available and have no possibility of evolution. Obviously some are more effective at certain times, but these are far too simple mechanics and not implemented at their best. Furthermore, to complicate everything we find a system of collisions that are nothing short of embarrassing with poor impacts, ships that bounce on each other and interpenetrations that amplify the already high confusion of an approximate title. Obviously it's a 10 euro game but given the few missions, which are only 8, there would have been room for more care. Trapped in a limited universe The missions are structured according to the canons of the genre with hordes of fighters to shoot down quickly, torpedoes to stop and defenses to neutralize. A classic setting therefore to which SOL: Exodus adds the possibility of hacking enemy technology through some nodes, generally positioned in key points of the flagships. This feature allows you to obtain various advantages such as using the cannons of the opposing ship against its own allies or disabling the missiles and engines of the hostile vessel. An interesting addition but implemented in a spartan way, affected by bad collisions and limited in playful terms to an elementary minigame that requires you to read the decrypted code while fighting. Basically the landing of marines or the recovery of a body of Wing Commander 5 are out of the question. The graphics engine doesn't take detailed objects into consideration in the slightest and the entire structure of the gameplay is really too simplified today, despite the small variations on the theme, to be able to compete with most of the exponents of the genre. And this without considering the often scarce or even non-existent artificial intelligence, with the opposing fighters limiting themselves to convulsive maneuvers carried out in a completely random way and then giving themselves over to our weapons without batting an eye. Much of the difficulty is in fact focused on the forced design of the missions, on the number of enemies and on the number of missiles fired at our flagship or at some transport. So do not expect duels worthy of this definition or a real satisfaction in completing an objective. As already mentioned, even from an aesthetic point of view, the title does not stand out. Opposite some good quality elements is a cosmos populated by uninspired vessels, washed out textures, sketchy containers and asteroids that seem to come from a couple of gaming generations ago. Even the bases, which thanks to the generous dimensions could be characterized by a slightly more complex design, are below the average possibilities of any project created with the Unreal Engine. In short, a certainly not encouraging picture, especially if we consider that at a lower price there are titles with similarly intuitive driving models but much richer, more detailed and characterized by an open space formula such as Galaxy on Fire 2.Of course, in the latter the open component is rather limited, but in SOL it is completely missing. Obviously this is not a mandatory element, but it has been clear for years that limiting movement in open space is a clear contradiction. A contradiction that the enthusiast of this genre feels painfully.", "date": "2012-02-06", "grade": "5.0"}
