{"name": "Madden NFL 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-08-recensione.html", "text": "Classic joypad, modern control While the Wiimote rages on, the old pads seem to age rapidly, yet EA has found a way to creatively exploit all those bells and whistles that now populate current joypads. Through the two sticks throws, set pieces and some types of tackles are carried out and finally in a football game we are given the possibility to decide whether to block a player to the torso or legs with all the strategic repercussions of the case. The quick passes are entrusted to the classic automatic system which assigns some keys to as many players and it is sufficient to press the corresponding key to pass the ball to the chosen player. EA has found a way to creatively exploit all those bells and whistles that now populate current joypads Classic joypad, modern control The block also has a dedicated key whose pressure causes the rather representative icon of a brick wall to appear on the selected player. But this element is anything but decorative, in fact this system of icons and signals underlines the roles, peculiarities of the players and so on, facilitating the user's orientation in a discipline that includes 22 players who run, attack and intertwine in the same angle of view. Certainly this time it takes a little more time to master a game system that includes both dynamic controls and bound keys, but once you have acquired some automatisms you can clearly feel the increase in control over the character and the game action, which significantly increases the enjoyment of American football in digital form. Samples to admire An initially inconspicuous but radical change involves player stats. A spike in a particular skill now has an actual, relevant, and visible impact on the playfield. In practical terms, a player who excels in jumping makes visibly higher elevations. This, as well as obviously being reflected in the automatically managed player's performance during clashes and tackles, involves greater attention towards the controlled athlete who may or may not be able to intercept particularly high balls, make risky breakthroughs or engage in any other type of targeted action. In this case, the introduction of the aforementioned icons is essential, which allow us to identify a player and his specialty during the action itself. Increasing the effects of a trait on a player directly affects the Superstar mode which sees us busy trying to forge a new NFL star who can now really show his strengths. Alongside the Superstar mode, the Franchise Mode also returns, which finally takes on the appearance of a credible management system unlike the one that appeared in Madden 07. While waiting to have a complete management mode again, we must be satisfied with the possibility of controlling the finances of the team, training players individually and keep an eye on the market in the hope that some recruits will turn out to be champions of rank. To conclude the playful offer, the canonical mini-games and online support which also provides a sort of web TV through which to follow the best players on the planet. Once again, support for online tournaments is missing which, inexplicably, is present in other less famous and less sold EA Sport productions. Stupid geniuses Artificial intelligence is still one of the great barriers of the gaming world. Of course it is really difficult to get credible behavior from a mass of pixels controlled by logical laws developed in a simulated environment. And it's even more difficult when the object in question is a complex sport that allows an incredibly varied range of moves. Despite this, the improvements are there and are visible. Unfortunately there are cases in which some players lose their way and get lost in the field Stupid geniuses Computer-controlled players no longer perform empty feints but mostly try to pass an opposing player when they are actually in front of them and the team moves and covers spaces more convincingly, an element that finally drives them off our screens the herd of sheep on the march effect. Unfortunately, there are cases in which some players lose their way and get lost on the field, or follow the ball carrier remaining attached to his armpit but without tackling him or still paralyze themselves watching the flies while almost a dozen thugs dart past him in front of. Not all ovals succeed with the hole Slightly more defined models of the predecessor and substantially identical graphics engine are still more than enough to show us a range of analmost unlimited imations. There are enough crashes, tackles, blocks, and jumps to make some of the action in Madden NFL 08 seem almost real. But alas the players maintain a somewhat plasticky look which reduces the rate of realism. However, NFL remains one of the titles that sanctions the effective transition of EA Sports to 60 frames per second in each of its productions, at least in the Xbox 360 version. On the audio front, however, the sore points arrive. If the soundtrack, as always, is spectacular, varied and does not disdain some quality indie rock, the same cannot be said of the sound on the field which does not recall a fooball match even with a jackhammer attached to the ears. In addition to completing the demerit note comes the comment which is not very varied and often goes off on a tangent, stammering absolutely inaccurate sentences and numbers more or less as was the case now ten years ago. Comment Madden NFL 08 brings with it somewhat groundbreaking and groundbreaking controls, outstanding gameplay visual interface, enhanced AI, diversified abilities, and a tornado of animations. As if that weren't enough Franchise Mode and Superstar Mode have been refined and enriched. Unfortunately, and largely due to the sound, a degree of involvement that goes hand in hand with the rest of the package is missing, but from a technical and playful point of view we are certainly oriented towards the future and the merits definitely outweigh the defects. Once again Madden presents itself as a strategically impeccable game which, finally, after a few years of immobility, begins to show the possible evolutions of this discipline in the digital universe. Pros: Evolution of classic football Incredible animations Great icons and highlights system Original soundtrack Cons: Sound effects and commentary are inadequate.... ...maybe that's why it lacks spectacularity Madden NFL 08 is available for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. The tested version is for Xbox 360. Goals 360 Madden NFL 08 is a tough nut to crack. The objectives are fragmented into an infinite series of actions to be performed ranging from performing a certain number of tries, to conquering a hundred yards with one or two players of the team and are quite simple to obtain. Some, less accessible, are purely random or nearly so, like throwing a 90-yard pass or recovering two fumbles. Unfortunately there are also some rather insidious goals among which the request to intercept 5 opponents' balls or complete 80 percent of the passes in a game stands out. In any case do not despair, with a little practice you can do everything, or almost. The line-up takes the field. Hallucinated gazes cross each other, anxiously looking for weak points in enemies. Gritting teeth hiss coded messages, strategies and positions. Time slows down, blocks hearts, paralyzes men in superhuman tension. Everything is waiting for it to swell like an enormous bubble that grows slowly, more and more, engulfing everything and everyone. Then the general lets out a cry and the bubble bursts. Experienced football Given the strategic nature of this discipline, it is inevitable that sports simulation also deals largely with the game with a still ball. From here depends the mutual similarity of most of the games dedicated to American football which are forced, menu after menu, to give us the possibility to choose formation, position and strategy. Consequently, the element that most distinguishes a title dedicated to football, beyond the quality of the player models and beyond the stylistic choices involving writings, menus and strategy design, is the degree of immersion that envelops the title, or how much that title, as a whole, is able to convey to us of the universe called NFL. The loudest exploit in recent years was made by SEGA's ESPN NFL, which in 2003 showed the world the difference between an excellent American football simulation and a good game capable of immersing us completely in a world that thrives on heroes and sensational actions. Finally, even EA seems to have moved away from the simple choice of spot-on soundtracks and the maniacal reconstruction of strategies and seems to have understood that American fooball thrives on pathos and emotion, even if, unlike the aforementioned ESPN, it has preferred to concentrate on the playability side, has preferred to revolutionize the momentum in which this discipline explodes, in those few seconds that decide the value of everything that has happened before.", "date": "2007-09-18", "grade": null}
