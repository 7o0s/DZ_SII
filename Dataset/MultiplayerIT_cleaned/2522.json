{"name": "Sacrifice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sacrifice.html", "text": "Brief introduction to the story In this fantastic RTS (or strategic game, for newbies) you will take on the role of a magician (among the thirteen selectable ones, some of which are very particular), who will have to take the side of the various existing deities to fulfill their will through a whole series of missions that will see you at the head of an army of creatures that will be gradually made available to you by the gods called into question. There are 5 of them, each divinely characterized (it must be said, ehhe) both in the character design (evidenced through the beautiful official artworks) and in their psychology, making them all immediately as arrogant as they are available or ironic as they are unpleasant. Choosing to support one divinity instead of another is equally an important choice: if you help Persephone you will have spells and allies that, for example, Pyros won't give you or if you help Charnel in a mission against Stratos, you won't wait for him to trust you and so on. It will be up to you to choose who to support, thus determining the unfolding of the story (even if you will not always be able to choose the faction to which you belong). The game structure First of all it is good to say that you will have a very useful tutorial available, in the form of teachings and ~tricks of the trade~ of the Zyzyx bird, which through 3 distinct practice sections will make you feel at ease between magic, destruction, fallen souls and much more . After the tutorials and the choice (in spite of you or not) of the next mission, you will find yourself in one of the many islands that make up the visionary world created by the Shiny artists, with your trusted flying advisor and the assigned troops; as already mentioned, each deity will have its armies so don't start crying if your favorite imp will have to leave you in which case you obey an order from Persephone or Stratos, a speech obviously also applicable to spells. First of all you will have to take possession of the wells from which the mana flows to feed your magic as soon as possible, since without it you will not be able to help your ~men~ wounded in battle, attack enemies with your devastating spells or create creatures allies; some allies, such as the Manahor are essential since they are the equivalent of wandering mana wells while without archers who strike from a distance, druids and trolls (just to mention some type of creature among the fifty present) who attack at close range, there it will be very difficult to be able to get the better of the enemy or to desecrate one of his portals. It is also worth pointing out that you can, thanks to the very comfortable game interface, change the various shots, arrange your men in various types of formation or have them attack or protect a specific being or location, all, as already mentioned, with a few and intuitive mouse strokes. As is the case with rts, the missions are among the most varied, even if in general it always involves destroying the enemy in its entirety, defending certain creatures (usually future allies or neo-allies) or desecrating portals. Before closing the discussion on the creatures inserted by the Shiny guys, it is good to underline the excellent artificial intelligence, clearly evident during the fights, in which your troops will not go on the attack according to illogical schemes or when the enemies will ambush you, perhaps by attacking you from the slopes, or from several fronts to close you in and finish you in a flash. The massacres of war At the end of each battle you will certainly notice red souls and blue souls residing respectively on the lifeless bodies of former enemies and former allies, which constitute one of the peculiarities of the Shiny title: you must know that one or more blue souls can give birth to one or more creatures (depending on how fearsome they are) while a red soul, through the invocation magic of a rather crazy doctor, can become your trusted ally after a somewhat atypical ceremony. And if you will perish? You will simply acquire the possibility to float wherever you want, but you will not have the possibility to use your spells, nor to be able to control your party but a visit to a mana fountain will restore your body, after a short stop near the source energy. Graphic-sound madness Monstrous! Never has a term been so appropriate when evaluating Sacrifice's outward appearance. In addition to presenting beautiful backdrops, moreover present in a good variety (volcanic, hilly, ice surfaces, etc.), the excellent special effects such as the lens flare, are assisted by an amazing realization of thecreatures present on the battlefield that together constitute a unique spectacle. Furthermore, the creatures deserve real applause for the originality of some of them, for their external realization (number of polygons from more than good to excellent, many textures, one better than the other) and for the internal one (the 'excellent artificial intelligence); as if this were not enough, the graphic engine (the same as Messiah, ~bent~ to the needs of Sacrifice), manages an impressive number of sprites on the screen, even at high resolutions and with the special effects activated, without losing fluidity in most part of the cases. Graphic-sound madness Speaking of the minimum system requirements, we are talking about a P2 300, 64 mb of ram and an 8mb accelerated video card, fully compatible with the Direct 3d protocol but obviously to enjoy Sacrifice to the fullest it is good to have a slightly higher PC than the specifications recommended by the Shiny coders (P2 450, 128 mb ram and 16mb video card) as well as a mid-range P3, 128 mb ram and 32 mb ram video card from Riva Tnt2 Ultra up; the game was tested on P3 500, 256 mb ram, G400 Max and Geforce DDR and with a P3 700@ 933, 128 mb ram and Geforce 2, letting itself be played superfluid even with all details maxed out. Before closing the section dedicated to graphic marvels and moving on to the sound side, it should be said that once you start Sacrifice for the first time, the program analyzes your pc to find the best graphic configuration, so if you don't want to test after test, don't there is no problem, it being understood that manual configuration is always the best choice to make to get the best possible results. Equally fantastic is the result obtained in the sound side of the game: where can I start? From the stupendous choice of voices, certainly made by competent people, from the many well-made sound effects present or from the stupendous music? Even from this point of view, as you will have well understood, there is really nothing to complain about even if only a stickler like me could want a greater quantity of music in Shiny's masterpiece, it being understood that they are not present in small quantities and that in any case we speak of a work of great class; the voice actors (hoping that the Italian ones will not be outdone) manage to render the nature and psychology of the voiced characters in an excellent way: honorable mention for the 5 divinities and for Zyzyx, the first for their very nice bickering, the bird for his appreciable irony, evident from some of his sentences. Multiplayer madness If Sacrifice was a single player game, it would have been great, so what on earth can the title of this section mean? That's right, prepare your lan, or subscribe to a nice flat, since with a handful of friends you can pass the time by sending your terrible armies into the field to witness clashes like never before, also thanks to ~multiplayer only~ modes such as Domination and Soul Hunt. Is all this still not enough for you? But then you really want ...Scapex! Ok, you've finished the single player game, you've played ad nauseum with your friends and you'd like to put the CD back in its case to let it gather dust on your hi-tech shelf, right? Stop, you too have a mission to complete: create a sequence of maps, one more beautiful than the other thanks to Scapex, the very powerful map editor that Shiny has included and which will allow you to create, in less than an afternoon, thanks to the excellent yet accessible read-me file, fascinating new locations to trade with friends or share online. Obvious conclusions Sacrifice fully deserves the title of Ects Game of this bizarre 2000. The banality of this sentence comes by itself after having analyzed the title in all its aspects, starting from the stupendous graphic creation, passing through the very involving sound and arriving at the wonderful playability; if we then add many truly original ideas (such as the character design), a well-kept artificial intelligence, but above all a stellar longevity thanks to the possibility of playing with your friends and creating your own maps, what to say? It's the gaming equivalent of a night with the girl of your dreams, with the difference that it won't last so long and you won't have so much company! Extra! If you don't trust our opinion, the demo of Sacrifice is available in our files area, weighing around ninety megabytes, while for the ~price~ of 3mb download you can get the patch, from a fewor released. Finally he has arrived! As you may have guessed from the colossal preview made last month, I've never had a great sympathy for Shiny, Dave Perry's software house, due to its tendency to make people wait ages for its games, disappointing the customer once they has put its greedy sweaty hands on the longed-for video game, finally released! It happened with Wild 9 for PlayStation but above all I was very disappointed in having to reject, in the review, the highly anticipated Messiah that I was waiting for, ahem, like the Messiah. When I had the chance to try Sacrifice for the first time, I left decidedly prejudiced, even if the game was spoken quite well and it had even been proclaimed as the best game of ECTS 2000. It is useless to hide it too much, if already the beta version tested for the The preview was wonderful without having tried the multiplayer mode (for obvious lack of people to challenge), how can the final game ever be, which will appear in the month of December, among other things in Italian. Stay with us, sacrifice everything that surrounds you and leave Black and White alone for a while, here we have a game that hasn't been seen since Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament, just to mention the latest killer applications in the field pc.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
