{"name": "Valentina", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/valentina.html", "text": "The diversification of the offer and the sectoralization are fundamental elements for any market, and that of video games is no exception. Absent on consoles for a whole series of reasons, the genre of erotic games finds very fertile ground in mobile phones, made up of many male ~casual gamers~ who do not disdain to look at some beautiful, discrete girl between one commitment and another. The problem with sexy products lies in the fact that developers often don't put any effort into their creation, leaving the task of attracting buyers to the sexual component. Valentina's video game, developed by Redhead Spurs, unfortunately represents a great example of the genre. It is an extremely simple text adventure, probably scheduled in half a day, in which the player finds himself having to make choices among those on the screen in order to continue. Each wrong choice results in a return to the initial screen, likewise each correct choice allows us to go ahead and see other images. Which are, without a doubt, the central element of the product. The big, indeed huge, problem is that in Valentina there is no ~correct~ way to proceed, as every choice could be right or wrong depending on how the story will evolve. You don't need to think about which is the right answer to each question, nor know the character of Crepax to possibly understand his psychology... simply, you end up memorizing which are the correct answers and proceed accordingly. Given the paucity of the game in its structure, it is easy to imagine that even at a technical level the results achieved are scarce. The black and white images of a half-naked Valentina (sometimes more, sometimes less - Crepax's comics from this point of view are really chaste compared to those of Manara, just for comparison) are the highest point reached from this title and are quite sharp even on the mobile screen. The rest well, the rest isn't there. The control system is based on selecting phrases with the joystick and pressing the FIRE button to confirm. PRO Quite sharp images The designs are by Crepax AGAINST The game doesn't exist Short and cumbersome There is so much better around", "date": "2007-07-31", "grade": "S.V."}
