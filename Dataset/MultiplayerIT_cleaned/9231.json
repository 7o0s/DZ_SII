In this sense, the fans of the series will find it difficult to recognize it and, perhaps, it would have been better to do a complete reboot than to put a three in front of the title, thus suggesting a de facto continuity. The same change of developer could suggest that a different path would have been chosen from that of the past, with the series taken away from Gas Powered Games, probably due to the critical and public failure of Space Siege, to be entrusted to the discontinuous Obsidian Entertainment , capable of enriching games from a narrative point of view, but often the victim of too much ambition (see Alpha Protocol). However, for players worried about possible bugs, a fixed presence in other Obsidian releases, let's say right away that Dungeon Siege III didn't give us any problems from this point of view, proving to be a solid and playable title from start to finish. So we didn't have to worry about uncompleteable quests, errors or omissions that prevent us from continuing the adventure or some annoying graphical glitch. That's not a small thing these days. Talking and narrating The plot of Dungeon Siege III tells the story of the X Legion, a group of chosen warriors defenders of the kingdom of Ehb. Blamed for assassinating the king, the X Legion is attacked and wiped out by Jeyne Kassynder and her army of religious hardliners. Obviously not everyone dies and some good fighters manage to escape. The player is called to take on the role of one of the survivors of the massacre. The aim is to erase the shame of such an infamous accusation by bringing together the survivors scattered throughout the kingdom, so as to reform a powerful army capable of defeating Jeyne. In short, you have to travel far and wide and carry out the most disparate missions to establish contacts and find allies to go to war against evil (who said Dragon Age: Origins?). Without saying anything else about the plot - not that it's particularly original, but we know we have many spoiler-sensitive readers - we can tell you that there are some rather piloted twists and turns and that, in any case, Obsidian's writing takes care of keeping the level high, always a head and shoulders above the competition, with dialogues that are interesting even when they talk about nothing. In this sense, the good localization in Italian should be noted, which does not lose much compared to the original version. Of course, it must also be said that speaking with the characters you shouldn't expect to make decisive choices like those of Alpha Protocol or Fallout: New Vegas; here everything is much more linear, rigid and guided and, despite the presence of multiple choices in the dialogues, talking to the other characters only serves to get background information and to obtain missions. The useful Let's face it clearly: Dungeon Siege III played alone is quickly boring. Not that it's bad, mind you, but after a few hours of play you've seen everything there is to see, scenarios aside, and you can't find any new stimuli. The bosses themselves are all quite similar and have repeating attack patterns (they flee after some beating, summon an army for help, come back for some beating, and go until they die). The control scheme is quite classic, with one button for attacking, one for special shots, one button for parrying and so on. It takes little to practice and, even as the choices in terms of powers increase, the difficulties in managing the character are zero. The enemies are the same as always, that is, they range from spiders and bandits of the first levels, to the biggest and most resistant beasts of the advanced stages. There is no shortage of adversaries accustomed to the use of magic, undead of various types, wild creatures and so on. As genre dictates, the balance between the powers of the character and the power of the monsters remains stable throughout the adventure, with the classic elastic progression guaranteed by the management of object collection and level growth, which allows you to select new skills or to make them grow in different ways according to personal tastes. In general we can say that the difficulty level is very low and at a normal level you have to work harder to get killed than to move forward, also because you only die when all party members are down, a difficult eventuality to occur. The higher difficulty level, called Hardcore, offers a greater challenge and is the one that all seasoned players should choose, especially if they want to indulge in the modecooperative. Only in this way some powers make sense and the artificial intelligence of the CPU-driven characters shows its goodness. Of course, you die much more often, even against clustered groups of enemies, and you have to go further into the study of your character and objects to advance in the game, but isn't this the beauty of a title like this? Playstation 3 trophies Thirty-five trophies are unlockable in Dungeon Siege III. Bronze trophies require you to perform very simple actions, even if many are related to the cooperative mode. With the silver trophies things get more complicated and some won't be easy to obtain, such as the one that requires you to defeat Rajani without using your healing ability. The three gold trophies require you to complete the game with all side quests, at hardcore level. Finally, the platinum trophy is obtained by unlocking all the others. The delightful As mentioned, the game allows you to have an entire party available. Unfortunately, and here the fans of the first two Dungeon Sieges will turn up their noses a lot, it is not possible to manage practically nothing of your companions. Not bad, given that the artificial intelligence is excellent (apart from in some situations and in the presence of obstacles to be overcome by following pre-established paths), but obviously one of the most characteristic aspects of the series is missing compared to the sub-genre of role-playing games action. Pets deserve a separate discussion, much more foolish and reckless than the other companions. The umpteenth solitary attack against a group of armored warriors makes you want to use them as food rather than as a resource in combat (hello animal rights friends, no real animal was mistreated during the processing of this review, we swear). If in the general aspects Dungeon Siege III is a good product, when you go into detail some problems that cannot be overlooked emerge. Obsidian has chosen the path of simplifying all aspects of the game, with the result that, as already mentioned, you will soon find yourself repeating the same actions almost mechanically. For example, the enemies, despite being of different shapes and despite being capable of producing different types of damage, all face each other with the same pattern from start to finish. The missions themselves, while varied story-wise, all require similar actions (go and kill guy, retrieve item X, or get to location Y). The story changes when playing cooperatively, but the surplus of fun caused by sharing a video game with another human being has been true for all games since the first virtual chess played via punched cards. To make the situation worse, the characters are poorly customizable and the possibility of creating heroes / armies capable of supporting themselves in any situation, regardless of the class chosen. Indeed lovers of support classes will find themselves almost unemployed. What's the point of having a party if you can do everything yourself? The futile Technically, Dungeon Siege III is very good. Let's say that it goes beyond its duty with well-modeled characters and enemies, richly detailed scenarios and high-level special effects, especially for the representation of powers. Obsidian's graphics have worked a lot on variety, perhaps to compensate for the monotony of the gameplay, and have been able to show off an impressive repertoire of fantasy scenarios and creatures. The only real flaw, if we really want to find one, is the lack of a more marked artistic direction, but after all, even the previous chapters are not remembered for their stylistic courage. The same is possible with the soundtrack, full of effects and evocative music in perfect fantasy style, but certainly not original or unpublished.", "date": "2011-06-17", "grade": "7.8"}
