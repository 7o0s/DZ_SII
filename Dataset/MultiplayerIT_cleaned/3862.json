The infallible killer created by Goichi Suda debuts on Nintendo Switch with a bizarre episode, basically a spin-off created by putting together a series of concepts that the brilliant Japanese game designer kept closed in the drawer, waiting to be able to use them in some way. Let's try to understand each other: in its soul, Travis Strikes Again keeps intact the gameplay that fans of No More Heroes remember well, made up of frenetic and engaging hack'n'slash sessions, characterized by excellent impact rendering, an essential aspect because such a game is actually fun; but it adopts different solutions in terms of visuals and mechanics, effectively offering us seven unique experiences, which must be accessed by operating a cursed console. No, really. characters and structure The opening cinematic of Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, sees the evil Bad Man determined to avenge the death of his daughter Charlotte at the hands of Travis Touchdown. The clash between the two is furious and literally tears the fourth wall to pieces, calling players into question for the first of many occasions during the campaign; but there is also a very negative aspect: in the middle of the duel, the cursed Death Drive MKII console ~awakens~ and catapults the two contenders into their own vintage videogame world. The strange couple therefore find themselves having to collaborate, when they are informed by the voice of the creator of those video games that there is a way to bring back to life the daughter of Bad Man: all you have to do is get hold of seven, er, magical orbs, summon a mysterious tiger-god and make a wish. From this point on, the game structure takes on relatively clear connotations: you move inside a hub, Travis' house, with the possibility of reading messages, checking the interesting ramen blog, buying T-shirts with the logos of a series of indie games and make the protagonist wear them, make a rescue (sitting on the toilet, as per tradition) and of course access the seven games that make up the campaign, to be unlocked one after the other by engaging in some exhausting but enjoyable sequences in visual novels. Even in this juncture Suda51's genius is expressed in a clear way: after a very long and text-heavy first session, a support character clarifies to Travis that if the thing were repeated the Metascore of the game would have been disastrous and they would have had to say goodbye to the chances of seeing No More Heroes 3. Seven different gameplay? As mentioned above, the Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes campaign consists of seven different experiences, which can be accessed by activating the protagonist's cursed console. Apart from a couple of occasions (the Asteroids clone and Tron-style drag races), however, the basic gameplay is the traditional one of the series and the controls are not altered in any way; you just have to deal with modified visuals, in some cases with a completely overhead shot, as in the original Grand Theft Auto, in others from the side, for a two-dimensional use combined with platform mechanics. Playing alone or with a friend, thanks to the local cooperative multiplayer with two Joy-Con, which can be activated at any time, we will therefore find ourselves facing the numerous ~bugs~ of the games created by the mysterious doctor Juvenile, which appear in the form of enemies with a skull instead of a face, divided into various categories and equipped with different characteristics in terms of strength, resistance and attack patterns. The list includes a recurring mini-boss and seven increasingly stronger bosses, especially the last one. To defend ourselves we will have to wield Travis' iconic lightsaber (or Bad Man's baseball bat), ~beating~ it from time to time to recharge its energy, and alternate between fast and heavy attacks, jumps and lateral swerves, possibly resorting to a super move that is charged by fighting or a set of special skills that we can unlock by collecting the related chips (and lifting them in the air like Link) and freely assigning them to the four buttons on the controller. Equipped with a cooldown period that significantly increases their strategic depth, these maneuvers allow us to throw enemies against a wall, hit them with an electric shock, stun them for a few seconds, create an energy field that heals our wounds, launch a bomb that detonates after a few moments, activate a very powerful satellite laser, create a copy of our character that attracts the attention of opponents, and so on. You produceone and genius Where the budget does not arrive, ideas, talent and design choices can arrive: the entire indie production is based on this concept, but Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes even makes it a clear manifesto. Goichi Suda's new creature was created with few means, this is clear from the start, and this limit is reflected above all in the technical sector, which appears rather dated, especially as regards the scenarios. The funny thing is that the development team, perfectly aware of the thing, has embroidered on it trying to throw entire sequences into real videogame trash, between kinematics from the first PlayStation and corridors that repeat themselves obsessively. From a narrative point of view this is justified by the vintage setting of the seven video games to be faced during the campaign, but in the end the whole shack is based solely on the gameplay, on the fun cooperative (even if in the two-dimensional platform levels it becomes difficult to coordinate) and on the flood of more or less obvious quotes that the Japanese game director has included in the package: from Zelda to Superman, from Resident Evil to Tron, passing through all the Grasshopper Manufacture productions, which appear in the game in one way or another . If the graphics are undoubtedly the weak point of the project, the same cannot be said of the sound, thanks to a very interesting and stylish, rhythmic and engaging soundtrack, capable of making the most of the various sequences and proposing funny reinterpretations of themes famous.", "date": "2019-01-16", "grade": "7.5"}
