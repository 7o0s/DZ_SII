{"name": "Il guanto di sfida", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107522-horn-il-guanto-di-sfida.html", "text": "Since the iOS platform has shown its potential in the technical field, in this case with the advent of the Unreal Engine, we have witnessed the development of more ~busy~ titles compared to the tradition of mobile games. Phosphor Games' splendid Dark Meadow offered us exploration inside a building full of mysteries and terrible creatures, but with each game over we returned to the starting point, in a sort of strange evolution of the concept of ~survival~ . Infinity Blade explored pure action and white weapon fights, giving greater depth to the formula with the second chapter but without ever even trying to go further. ~Beyond~, what a fascinating concept. It is what the most talented developers generally aspire to: overcome the hardware limits by perhaps operating in an alternative way, travel paths never traveled before, have the courage (and the strength, thanks to the substantial contribution of Zynga as publisher) to bring a real action adventure to the App Store, supported by a plot, a design and even a sound capable of exceeding anyone's expectations. We grappled with Horn for a few hours and we only reached 60% completion of the story, which already says a lot about the amount of this production. The funny thing is that, once immersed in the great atmosphere of the game, we were afraid of being disappointed by the duration of the same, thinking that the first scenario (the village of Cuthbert) was in the end the only one available and that the story ended abruptly after its overcoming. Nothing could be more false: Horn's journey continues to another location and then another, in search of the source of a curse that has transformed people and animals into Pygons, or into stone creatures with a hostile nature. The same protagonist of the game, a shrewd blacksmith apprentice, had turned into a Pygon and returned to normal by pure chance, after having stung himself with a crystal composed of the same material that moves these monsters. Hence his idea: reduce the crystal to powder and mix it with iron to forge weapons capable of hurting them. Not just games Horn's manufacturing care is absolute, and from this point of view we can safely speak of the most impressive title ever made for iOS devices. If you have an iPad at your disposal, we strongly suggest that you enjoy the experience on the large screen of the Apple tablet, as we did. The plot of the game is inspired by ancient British legends and is told with the right timing, an excellent direction and an excellent spoken English (subtitled in Italian), also among the best ever heard in the mobile field. The only thing that leaves us perplexed is the control system, which doesn't have the traditional virtual stick for character movement, but asks us to touch the point we want to move to on the screen. This is not a technical limitation, as we are free to move the view with our fingers at any time, even on the way from one place to another, but a design choice that you can get used to quite quickly, but which in any case we consider it questionable. The touch system also applies when Horn has to climb a wall, jump from platform to platform, or swing across a narrow passage. It certainly cannot be said that it does not work, but at the same time we believe it may have contributed to the generation of at least a couple of fairly serious bugs and which Phosphor Games has already said will remedy with an update. Within the scenarios are scattered crystals that play the role of virtual currency when we want to use the crafting system for the creation and upgrading of weapons, as well as evil Pygons to be faced in duels that recall those of Infinity Blade, while leveraging elements such as the lateral swerve and the identification of the ~weak point~ of the enemy, whose rock armor shatters under the blows that we ~draw~ on the touch screen. Each defeated opponent translates into a ~stone~ to be used together with the crystals to complete one's purchases, and which we can also obtain via in-app purchase if desired. Despite the limitations of the control system, exploration is always quite pleasant and there is also a handful of simple puzzles. However, the charm of the experience is mostly transmitted by the technical sector, which on previous generation iOS devices seems to give some problems (this too will be solved with an update) but which on the iPhone 4S and the new iPad boasts extraordinary quality, only slightly blurred by some textures less defined than the others and by a noticeable stuttering when passingfrom one scene to another.", "date": "2012-08-22", "grade": "9.5"}
