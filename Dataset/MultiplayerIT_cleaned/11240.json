{"name": "Tornado DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tornado-ds-recensione.html", "text": "Tornado is a game developed by Skonec, a Korean company specializing in the processing of arcade titles: making its debut on DS, with this project it tried to create a more superficial - but also more immediate - version of Katamari Damacy. Once any pretense of environmental awareness has evaporated, what remains is a tornado with enormous destructive power, an authentic force of nature to be hijacked on every element of the stage, ~living~ or not. Strictly with a nib in hand. Whirling The concept is very simple as well as conscientiously crude: the aim is to satisfy the player by placing him in a position of absolute power over everything around him. The various whirlwinds that are controlled do not originate from the wind, but from the rotation, through the stylus, of one of the many characters available; each of them naturally has its own distinctive characteristics, abilities that are reflected in the behavior and handling of the vortex. Once the tornado has been created, it is necessary to continue to draw circular trajectories around it, without interruptions, in order not to dissipate its force. Unfortunately, the combination of the various movements - the rotary one plus the classic movement to direct the character - very frequently obscures the game screen, a defect that becomes more cumbersome as the levels go by, due to the increase in unexpected events that would require an immediate reaction: fortunately, reduced visibility aside, the touch controls work admirably. On the other hand, some problems arise when it comes to giving a strong acceleration to the tornado, to be carried out by blowing on the microphone: it is almost useless to underline that, although there is a ~physical~ link between the two actions, this formulation slows down the pace of the game too much. Many developers, both novices and experts, often give in to the temptation to use every feature made available by the DS, without caring about the actual advantage produced by such a choice: the use of the microphone in Tornado is certainly one of these cases. Ancient flavour Tornado is able to restore the flavor of the titles of twenty years ago: surly and angular, it does nothing to welcome the player but for this very reason, despite the obvious playful limits, it manages to challenge him and draw him into a vicious circle typical of the 8-bit epoch. The design of the levels is not particularly accurate, as are the objectives to be achieved, usually limited to the collection of various objects or one in particular, however the pleasure derived from aspirating buildings and monuments is great, and it is certainly supported by the time constraints that accompany each game. everything is destroyed and removed, and doing so is as trivial as it is fun Ancient flavour The position of the objects to be found changes every time, and if on the one hand this has prevented an intelligent arrangement of the buildings, on the other it has certainly increased the pressure on the player, always forced to improvise and forced to let off steam on the various buildings. The dimensions of the tornado are constantly related to the buildings to be sucked in, both because the vortex enlarges by incorporating objects, and because certain monuments can only be eradicated through a large whirlwind (they exist of various strengths). Lampposts, litter bins, houses, parks, lampposts, walls, columns, triumphal arches, towers, pyramids and men: everything can be assimilated, without any distinction, and if the honeyed context helps allay most of the moral scruples, probably some the player will still be annoyed by this choice, perhaps precisely due to the lack of differentiation between living and non-living beings. Aware of this situation, Skonec has ~solved~ the problem by bypassing it: the elements sucked in are not destroyed, but captured and brought back to earth (we are not anticipating the specious story that forms the background to the action), so much so that they can always be consulted through a game option. Convenient justifications aside, the core of Tornado remains the same: everything is destroyed and removed, things and people, and doing so is as trivial as it is fun. Comment Tornado is a deliberately brutal and edgy game, based on the total destruction of any interactive element of the stage. It acts in a limited context, devoid of any kind of nuance, but precisely for this reason able to unleash a primordial competitive instinct of Ottobittian memory in the player's soul. The experience does not last long and there is no reason to repeat it, except for the desire to improve one's score. Tornado is a game that will appeal to those who admire Katamari Damacy but don't like its conceptual and stylistic stratification.Pros Good tactile controls Demanding Immediate Cons Repetitive Flat mechanics Not long-lived trair bowl As satisfying and enjoyable as it is, Tornado remains a simple and unrefined game, with few nuances and rather repetitive, which draws its strength from the challenge it throws at the player. Once the difficult objectives it proposes have been completed in a few hours, there is little else left to try, if not the almost forgotten run-up to the personal best, also typical of the titles of a few years ago. The multiplayer mode and the objects to collect are not enough to renew a poorly elastic mechanic like that of Tornado, so brutal and not very limited (and limited) as to enclose the strengths and weaknesses of the game in itself. Graphically Skonec has done a decent job, creating nice scale reproductions of really existing buildings, while adopting canons already widely established both in the East and in the West.", "date": "2008-08-26", "grade": null}
