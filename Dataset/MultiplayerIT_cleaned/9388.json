{"name": "Tempismo perfetto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86776-motorstorm-apocalypse-tempismo-perfetto.html", "text": "Impressive to watch in motion, the original MotorStorm was received positively by both critics and the public, who rewarded it with over three and a half million copies sold. More than the subject matter, indeed quite inflated, it was the practical realization of the Evolution Studios racer that convinced the enthusiasts, together with the ~hunger~ that typically accompanies the launch of a new console. The sequel, released the following year, while deserving more in terms of content and gameplay did not get the same response, stopping at just over a million copies sold, therefore less than a third of the debut. This made producers and developers reflect, who thought it best to take some time to create a possible third episode, as well as to make a series of more or less substantial changes to the series. This is how the idea behind MotorStorm: Apocalypse was born, a racing game that starts from the ~eventful~ context seen in Split/Second: Velocity (also taking up some solutions, see the zoom and that sort of ~bullet time~ on the disturbing element during the race) to take it to the extreme limits of catastrophism, with an entire city collapsing under the blows of an earthquake still in progress, devastated by explosions and storms of unprecedented violence. And in the midst of all this the MotorStorm pilots compete with each other to find out who will cross the finish line first and who will end up buried due to the collapse of a building. A nightmare situation that unfortunately thousands of people have actually experienced in Japan in recent weeks, and which has prompted Sony to postpone the release of the game almost all over the world, simultaneously creating a series of inconveniences for those who were able to buy Apocalypse on the day pre-established and ended up with an online multiplayer unfortunately unusable. But we'll get there shortly. Three characters in search of an author The ~Festival~ mode is presented to us through the eyes of three different characters: Mash, a rookie but very talented driver; Tyler, a star of the first magnitude in search of consecration; Big Dog, a veteran who in many ways plays a bit of a mentor role to the first two. Each character is associated with a degree of difficulty, which translates not only into greater ~malice~ of the opponents on the track, but also into the obligation to cross the finish line in a certain position to qualify for the next event. The races with Mash can be concluded within the fifth position compared to the sixteen vehicles in the race, while those in which we control Tyler or Big Dog must be completed strictly on the podium. Finally, finishing first unlocks that specific race in the ~Special Events~ list, a full-bodied extra mode that perfectly integrates the story mode and sees us grapple with each track in the most aggressive way possible, with the aim of completing the laps provided within a strict time limit. It goes hand in hand with the inevitable ~time attack~, which in the case of MotorStorm: Apocalypse is enhanced by the possibility of using the ~ghosts~ downloaded from the community for a challenging and never predictable confrontation. Let's go back to the ~Festival~, however: the events of Mash, Tyler and Big Dog must be tackled in this order, ideally placing themselves as the easy, intermediate and difficult part of the single player campaign. Between one event and another it is possible to witness a series of cutscenes defined, indeed appropriately, ~comics in motion~. The story they tell serves as a mere outline for the actual action, and indeed it rarely happens that the events of a race have anything to do with the contents of the animated sequences. The drawing style is typical of some American comics, the characters therefore present themselves with a very well-characterized appearance but end up not corresponding perfectly to the polygonal models created for the actual races, which actually make their debut within the loading screens with very questionable renderings from the point of view of the shadows (they all seem to have a lighthouse ten centimeters from the head, pointed downwards), while bearing a showy black border so as not to be too distant from the desired interpretation for the cutscenes. We wouldn't be surprised to discover that the story of ~comics in motion~ was inserted during construction, and in the same way we didn't like how this solution also influenced the palette used by the game, with too bright colors and a sense of ~toy~ which has little to do with the situations shown during the competitions, and which indeed would have benefited more from duller colours. The multiplayer modesIn fact unusable until March 25 (there were even console freezes during matchmaking), the online component of MotorStorm: Apocalypse started working thanks to the release of patch 1.02, just in time for the release of the game in English shops scheduled for the end of the month. Evolution Studios' racer also features local multiplayer for four players via split-screen, however it's clearly online that it's at its best, with matches that can be played by up to sixteen people and three different modes to choose from: ~ Pursuit~, ~Eliminator~ and ~Race~ (the latter is the only one accessible from the start, however). It is also possible to assign to your vehicle a particular trim among those available (most of which must be unlocked), consisting of three bonuses that affect road holding, turbo management and the ability to inflict ramming damage. There are also numerous skins and customization items, which can also be unlocked by leveling up. The search for new games happens quickly, and even if the rooms are not crowded at the moment, we assume that the situation will improve substantially over time, especially when MotorStorm: Apocalypse is finally released in the USA. The races are bad and spectacular at the right point, we didn't encounter any particular problems related to lag but with a large number of cars on the track it seems that the frame rate suffers in a particular way, showing the side to more frequent drops than usual. Unfortunately, the much talked about mode creation editor has not been included in the final version of the game, but we are hopeful that it will be implemented via update in the near future. Playstation 3 trophies There are forty-eight trophies obtainable by playing MotorStorm: Apocalypse, most of which (thirty-six) are bronze. The latter are obtained by completing simple objectives: win a race with all vehicles, complete certain events, overcome a certain number of special challenges and so on. Silver trophies come for completing certain races with Mash, Tyler and Big Dog, as well as collecting certain achievements in online modes. Finally, the gold trophies are obtained by completing the Festival with the three characters and reaching a certain level in the online multiplayer. Turn and hope, hope and turn MotorStorm: Apocalypse re-proposes, in fact, the gameplay of the previous two episodes, while adding dynamism to the action due to the frame within which the races take place. Each track therefore has an enormous number of ~shortcuts~ and alternative passages that often appear out of nowhere between one lap and another, perhaps because an earthquake causes a building to collapse or creates a huge crack in the ground, or because a The sudden explosion blows a hole where a wall used to be. There are scenarios in which you run on top of some skyscrapers, jumping from one roof to another and taking advantage of the remains of some bridges, and others in which you move along the coasts devastated by a tsunami. There is no shortage of ~highways~ and urban splits (~split~ is precisely the right term), as well as tracks set in rough terrain, where often the most difficult thing is to understand exactly where to go. Some solutions actually appear very imaginative, and we can only applaud the Evolution Studios guys for how they managed their ~idea~, developing, as written at the beginning, various concepts present in Split/Second: Velocity. In the same way, however, it is clear to any fan of the series that there are not many substantial innovations from the point of view of gameplay: vehicle management is ~turbocentric~, the bikes often and willingly ~bounce~ from a barrier to other and the physical performance of some vehicles leaves much to be desired, above all because it is not possible to feel the weight. To win the races you need to have a little luck or memorize the circuit well, take advantage of the boost whenever it is available (cooling the engine faster thanks to water or during jumps) and avoid direct confrontation with vehicles that overlook us in terms of size. The races are ~mixed~ and it is the game that decides which car we will be on board: between racing bikes and choppers, quads and buggies, muscle cars and monster trucks, trucks and pickup trucks, there will be so much to learn about the best ways to drifting around a corner, preparing for a long jump, or knocking out an opponent. During the story mode we will almost always be asked to try our hand at classic-type events, but there will be no shortage of elimination races and direct comparisons. And noUnfortunately, there will also be episodes of frustration that arise from some not very ~coherent~ gameplay choices: our vehicle can break through a wall without batting an eye, to then get stuck in a barrier and be hit right in by another vehicle, the all just a few meters from the finish line. These are situations that have always existed in the MotorStorm series and that in some ways we also consider normal (after all, they are still ~obstacle~ races), however there are games like the old FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage that have managed to limit damage from this point of view, offering a generally more fluid and enjoyable experience, without continuous restarts due to accidents. And speaking of fluidity, unfortunately drops in the frame rate are not uncommon: MotorStorm: Apocalypse moves a lot of polygons and keeps the level of detail high as regards the supporting structures of the track, which fall apart before our eyes between laps and the other, but to obtain all this he must necessarily come down to some compromise. The portion of the scenario that surrounds the action must also be seen in this perspective: if the roofs on which we run are convincing from the point of view of design and details, for example, the same cannot be said of the buildings they see in the background, characterized by very simple structures. Furthermore, when our vehicle falls off a cliff, the sequence reveals visual solutions that needed more attention or were replaced entirely by something pre-calculated. Finally, the music constitutes, in our opinion, the lowest point of the technical sector, given the small number and the general repetitiveness.
