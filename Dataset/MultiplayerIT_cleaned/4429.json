Directed by Chris Darril and developed by Stormind Games, it tells the story of Rosemary Reed, a thirty-five-year-old woman with features reminiscent of Jodie Foster from The Silence of the Lambs, who is investigating the disappearance of Celeste, the daughter of the notary Felton, date for running away from home but whose fate is actually shrouded in mystery. To understand what happened, Rosemary goes to Felton's house with an excuse, triggering the man's piqued reaction and a series of unspeakable horrors, with unexpected implications. What is hiding in that house? Why did Felton call his daughter Jennifer? What role did his wife Arianna play in the whole affair? How is Celeste's disappearance related to Felton's old business? What role do the strange red-robed nuns play in the whole affair? To answer these and other questions, Rosemary will first have to be able to survive the dangers that threaten her throughout her investigation. Rosemary Remothered: Tormented Fathers is essentially a third-person stealth game in which the protagonist can walk while standing or crouched, run, pick up objects to throw to create diversions (or others to use as weapons), hide using furnishing elements such as wardrobes or sofas, solving puzzles and reading documents. The game interface is really essential: interactive objects are indicated by white dots, which turn into contextual icons when you are close enough to them. Too bad there is no tutorial to explain the various mechanics; even some illustrated screens would have been enough, perhaps recallable during the game. The absence will be felt especially for newbies, who risk finding themselves lost when the real action begins. The gameplay has a classic approach and not casually more reminiscent of a Clock Tower or a Haunting Grounds, than that of more modern titles such as Outlast or Resident Evil VII. The environments, therefore, not only have to be examined carefully and crossed several times, in search of objects and solutions to the various puzzles, but the general difficulty is calibrated upwards, with design choices with a radical as well as intriguing flavor if read in such a recovery perspective. Let's take sound management and its relationship with enemies as an example: in most modern titles, enemies appear in environments specifically designed for them and act on an essentially horizontal plane, with noises attracting them only under certain conditions, often very stringent. Crawling, walking or running makes no difference when you are in areas where their presence is not expected, even if perhaps later we are told that they were still nearby to give us the illusion of greater realism. In Remothered the so-called stalkers continuously populate the places where they are and have a 360 perception of noise. This is why it is important to move stealthily even when you are sure you are on a different plane than theirs. Obviously this can be exploited to attract the enemies where we are most interested: by virtue of this, the many collectible objects that are around, which in the prologue seem even excessive, end up taking on a precise function in the game economy, and putting fewer would have meant limiting the player's maneuvering options. So, instead, you are freer to experiment with alternative solutions to get by. In short, studying an area to know where to go in case of danger therefore becomes essential, also in terms of another detail: escaping from enemies is very difficult. Sure, you can slow them down (never kill them) by hitting them with a defensive item, but trying to escape for too long is a strategy that inevitably ends in Rosemary being gruesomely killed (the death scenes are really gory... if you like the usually get caught at least once by each enemy). It must be said that all these solutions inevitably end up slowing down the action, but the tension gains a lot and, above all, holds up throughout the adventure. In this way the use of continuous sudden frights was also avoided, a widespread solution in the genre, but in some ways childish and, above all, effective only in the moment. The horror is just beginning Remothered: Tormented Fathers has a duration in line with that of other titles of the genre. If you don't go looking for all the documents scattered around the map and just do the essentials, you can finish it in a handful of hours (about four or five). But let's say that this is the worst wayto play with, because it loses a lot of narrative detail. Those who like to go deeper and take the time to explore the environments from top to bottom will finish it in about nine or ten hours. As already mentioned, it is not a very easy title, especially in the final part, the most tiring of all and the one in which one dies more often. Nothing insurmountable, but it requires a slightly more reasoned approach to overcome (don't worry, we won't anticipate anything). We also specify that, being the first chapter of a trilogy, the conclusion leaves many questions open, but also opens up interesting developments that should be developed in the next episodes (we'll see). From a technical point of view, the title of Stormind Games and Darril Arts is well done, despite some imperfections, especially in the animations of the interlude sequences. Speaking of fluidity, it proved to be excellent (we tested it at Ultra details on a not very powerful PC), even if some compromises are evident, such as the lights on which are completely invisible from a distance, despite the rest of the environment being completely in the dark , or excessive reflections on the skin of the characters during the filmed sequences, which in some situations make the faces a bit plasticky. In general, however, the technical side works well and does not regret other titles of the genre. In fact, it's far superior to most indie horror films on the market. In particular, what we can consider its most direct competitor comes to mind, namely that NightCry which was supposed to be the spiritual sequel to the Clock Tower series and instead did not go very well, to put it mildly. Obviously our judgment takes into account the production level, but that's not all: applause also goes to having chosen a third-person perspective, certainly more complicated to manage than the first. Also note the extreme cleanliness of the game in terms of bugs and glitches: we have never encountered any compromising ones. In particular, Remothered has never crashed and has never returned to the desktop, a sign that the period spent in Early Access has done him really good.", "date": "2018-02-03", "grade": "8.5"}
