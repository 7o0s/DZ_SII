{"name": "Largo Winch: Empire Under Threat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/largo-winch-empire-under-threat.html", "text": "Packaging and manuals We open our beautiful green box, and take a look at the manual in three languages: Dutch, Spanish and Italian. Inside we find all the information necessary to understand the game interface, the commands and a detailed explanation of the options menu. We put the disk in the console.... As I told you earlier, the game will start with a press conference. Everything seems to go smoothly, Largo concludes his speech successfully, and the moment arrives for refreshments for the guests. Just as everything seems to be going well, an anonymous phone call arrives to warn us of the presence of a bomb in the building. You have to find the bomb without causing panic in the crowd. After solving the matter, we will be overwhelmed by a whirlwind of negative events against our company that portend something much more serious: conspiracy against Group W and industrial espionage. Largo thus decides that he must solve these problems on his own, even if his friends will always help him out, including Simon, an expert burglar and womanizer, Joy, a former CIA agent, Kerensky, an expert hacker and former KGB agent, and John Sullivan, his father Nerio's right-hand man in the management of Group W. Our research will lead us to travel far and wide across the globe, but always fortunately surrounded by beautiful women and luxury means of transport. A classic graphic adventure.... Largo Winch is a real graphic adventure. In full respect of the tradition of this type of game, we will have to deal with objects to collect, analyze and combine with each other. There will also be puzzles to solve and evidence to look for. In LW we will always know what to do, we will almost never go around like souls in pain, without knowing what we are doing. In fact, everything is simplified to us by our trusty PDA (PDA), which Largo always carries with him. Thanks to this precious object, we will be able not only to save and exit the game, but also to modify the options, and most important of all, consult the travel notes that Largo writes down from time to time, as we progress throughout our adventure. .....but not too much. In LW things will not always be addressed thanks to objects, or by solving puzzles. Sometimes we will be faced with situations that will have to be solved with our hands! Let me explain: it's not that the game suddenly becomes a sort of DOA3 fighting game, of course, I would compare it more to a turn-based RPG. In practice, in some points of the game we will be faced with a very simplified interface of a Final Fantasy-style fight. We can therefore choose the enemy to hit and then how to hit him: we can do it with punches, kicks or possibly by throwing an object that is nearby (for example ashtrays, knives, paint buckets) at him. All managed by a scoring system expressed in hit points (HP). On other occasions, however, we will have to use our hacking skills to infiltrate government databases, or simply to understand where an e-mail was sent from. Also in this case the game temporarily abandons its semblance of a graphic adventure, to become a sort of puzzle game: we will have before us a grid that represents the internet network, and we will have to move the data flow from our starting terminal, to one of arrival, where the information will be found, being careful not to be intercepted by the viruses that swarm in the big network! Other subgames are the classic poker and the game of 15. We will have to solve these minigames if we want to find new clues for the continuation of the adventure. Women, women, women!! When one is full of money, it is known that many people surround him, especially those belonging to the fairer sex. And this is precisely the case of our lucky billionaire, who wherever he goes, wherever he is, will always have a bunch of prosperous polygonal presences around him! Starting with the irrepressible secretary Carmen, girlfriend Sharon, friend Joy, to get to Dr. Salma. The game focuses heavily on the female presence, as everyone in this sector does by now (Dead Or Alive and Lara docet), and there will certainly be some spicy skits. It is no coincidence that on the game packaging, we find a logo that advises against the purchase of this software for children under the age of thirteen. Adventure: Graphics! The graphic sector of LW performs its duty perfectly. The game environments are totally three-dimensional, and not pre-rendered as often happens in titles of this genre. The textures are all of excellent workmanship, making the settings very pleasing to the eye, above allto internal ones. At the polygonal level, the game proves to be a little behind even older productions, such as Halo or JSRF. The cross-platform nature of the title has certainly not helped the graphic impact, on any of the three consoles, since there are no substantial differences when comparing the screenshoots of the three versions. The quality of the animations is fluctuating: the main character is well cared for in this respect, however the animations of the enemies in the fights leave something to be desired, performing in imaginative movements that do not bring any fighting style to mind. The lip is also poorly synchronized. Often the lips continue to move long after the character has finished speaking. The sound sector The music of this LW didn't particularly convince me, except for some tunes in the missions in Siberia. They tend to be particularly boring and repetitive, even if, all in all, they blend very well with the atmosphere of the game, bringing that extra bit of immersion that never hurts. The sounds, on the other hand, have all been sampled very faithfully, in this respect no kind of criticism can be made to the game. The characters are also well voiced, even if the speech is only available in English and French. Fortunately, the subtitles in Italian are there, and they are also well done. Nice gameplay but.... An interesting novelty in the genre of graphic adventures brought about by this LW is certainly the possibility that the character dies. We will see the word ~Game Over~ appear at the end of a fight in which we have had the worst, or if we walk into an area full of armed guards. Therefore, all situations will have to be tackled using the brain, Largo Winch is certainly not Silvester Stallone, and only in exceptional cases will we have to resort to our hands. Often we will have to infiltrate the most unlikely and remote places on the planet (there will also be a trip to Italy), and we will have to act as secret agents to find the information we are looking for. Puzzles and items to use will be our bread and butter in LW. Fortunately in the game we will never go around with hundreds of objects in our pockets, at most I have accumulated 5 or 6 during a mission, after which the inventory is emptied. This is good because you avoid proceeding at random, trying to combine or use objects in the most absurd and improbable ways (and anyone who has played some old Lucasarts classics knows exactly what I mean). The game is therefore smooth and almost never frustrating. .... where is the longevity? When we save our game, the Xbox will also take care of noting the number of hours we have spent on that savegame. When I finished the game, it said 8 hours and 40 minutes on my save. The total playing time felt really small to me. But what is due to such a poor longevity? Probably, indeed certainly the puzzles are the main cause of this: if LW had more challenging puzzles, it would have taken much longer to complete it. On the one hand, the low difficulty of the game helps to make the title more attractive, and avoids exhausting sessions in search of what to do. On the other hand, it drastically shortens the longevity of a title with good potential, which could have kept us entertained for much longer. In this regard, an all in all similar adventure that I played on PC comes to mind, I'm talking about Broken Sword, which offered a fair longevity, precisely because of its very complicated puzzles (who hasn't gone crazy in front of the famous goat! ). Broken Sword didn't have an hour counter in the savegame, so I can't make a comparison for sure, but it certainly kept me busy in front of the computer for much longer than LW did to keep me in front of the TV. We also squash some bugs! You got it right, I'm talking about bugs! Programming flaws that in some cases can even prevent you from finishing the game. I found a couple during my adventures with the world's most persecuted billionaire. The first concerns a problem with the game engine, which occasionally causes our Xbox to crash completely, freezing the image. I think it occurs above all in particular locations, and in particular in the changes of shot. At that point, all that remains is to turn off the console and start over from the last save. I therefore recommend that you save often, in case you ever decide to play it. However, the bug isn't very frequent, it's happened to me ~only~ three times since I've been playing it, and it doesn't necessarily mean that it could also be a defect of the console that reads the disc badly, and not of the software. The other bug isin my opinion much more serious. At some point in the game we will have to deal with a chessboard and chess pieces to be positioned in a certain way to solve a small puzzle. At first I didn't quite understand how to move them, so I decided to give it a few tries. By placing some pieces in particular boxes, the piece was blocked, it was no longer possible to move it from there. I thought that having found the right square for the piece, the game decided not to let me move it from there, as the position was correct. Then when I understood how the pieces were placed on the chessboard, I could no longer move them: some pieces were in the wrong position and, as these pieces were blocked, I could no longer continue in the game!! Luckily I hadn't overwritten the save, and I was able to reload the game from a previous position which allowed me to lay out the chess correctly! Summing up Beyond the bugs I just told you about, and the graphics certainly not from Xbox, I really liked this Largo Winch. The variety of settings, as well as situations, the constant fear of being discovered by the guards, the mini-games, the ~romantic~ situations, are all ingredients of a game, which amused me a lot, as long as it lasted. Because this is precisely the problem of Largo Winch: its short life that will force you to sell it, exchange it, or even put it back on the shelf to accumulate dust in a short time. Apart from two or three cases, almost all the puzzles are easy to understand and will lead you without too many hitches to the resolution of the strange happenings around your company. A highly recommended purchase for non-experts in graphic adventures, who will perhaps be able to gain experience with this Largo Winch. For those who grew up on bread and Lucasarts as a child, just like me, it could be a good diversion, bearing in mind however that they would devour it in one bite. In two words: a nice game that doesn't last long. Pros Excellent plot, very articulated and full of details Good graphic impact, especially for internal locations You can die! Women, women, women! It's the only one of its kind for Xbox, at least until Broken Sword 3 Cons Short life A couple of bugs Xbox hardware can do better Materials Official site of the game Official site of the comic Official site of Largo Winch Official site of the series TV Largo Winch - Trailer 1 Largo Winch - Trailer 2 Largo Winch - Soundtrack Largo Winch: An empire under threat Who is Largo Winch? What does it do, and above all what drives the developers of a well-known software house like Ubisoft to release this title for PS2, Gamecube and Xbox? Well, Mr. Largo Winch is none other than a fictional character born at Depuis, a French comic house, which even inspired a television series, and the video game that I am about to describe to you. Of course, we will enter the game in the role of Largo Winch, a multi-millionaire who inherited from his father, Nerio, one of the largest multinationals on the planet: the Winch Group. The game begins with a press conference, in which the start of a humanitarian operation sponsored by our company is publicly announced, which will greatly benefit the brand and image of the Winch Group in the world.", "date": "2002-09-27", "grade": null}
