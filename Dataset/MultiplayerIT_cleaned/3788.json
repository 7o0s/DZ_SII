{"name": "Ape Out", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ape-out-recensione.html", "text": "A gorilla escaping from an office might in itself seem like a weird idea from which to make an action game. Normally this would happen if we were discussing an ordinary title, one of the many that populate the elephantine catalog of Steam. However, when we combine these premises with a dynamic soundtrack of jazz derivation, levels divided into music albums complete with side A and side B and a psychedelic graphic style, a fraction of a second is enough to understand that there is no need to ask ourselves many questions but simply to get comfortable, hold your trusty pad in your hands and let yourself be carried away by the events. Yes, because Ape Out has exactly this effect the first time you see it in action. It has a simple structure but this doesn't make it effortless; it is original in presenting a context of its own, but in some ways it recalls other works belonging to the same vein. In short, in short, it is a strange game, one that is difficult to forget after having at least one ride on the carousel. Curious to understand something more? Then all you have to do is continue reading our review. Gameplay: melee action and procedural maps Ape Out is an action game with a top view, even if this definition does not fully explain the type of game that we find ourselves in front of. This is because, in terms of gameplay, the title created by Gabe Cuzzillo with the support of Bennett Foddy and Matt Boch is based above all on close-quarter hand-to-hand combat. Enemies take up arms and resort to explosives, while the fleeing creature can only rely on its innate abilities, namely impetuosity, brute strength and tough skin. At the beginning of each level, the orange-coated ape is kept under lock and key, but the free ride for his captors is destined to last a little longer. With a leap forward the gorilla throws off its yoke and does what any captive animal would do after even vaguely sniffing the air of freedom: it flees. Actually easier said than done, given that the structure is teeming with heavily armed guards, ready to open fire to bring down the animal but also to set out resolutely on its trail if it is wounded and leaves behind a copious trail of blood. A handful of well-aimed hits are enough to put an end to the creature's ambitions, but you don't need to limit yourself to memorizing the play area and enemy placement, since the levels are procedurally generated. The basic setting of each setting is always the same, but the position of walls, windows, open spaces and narrower corridors changes without interruption, forcing the player to navigate on sight to frame the most suitable strategy to reach the goal unscathed. exit point that leads to the next portion. This is quickly understood after the first deaths, when the view widens and we are shown the entire structure of the map, while the word ~DEAD~ appears in large letters in the background. After all, do they dress up as a wild animal or not? And then you have to act instinctively, trying in some way to throw your heart over the obstacle and try to manage the strength you have without too much hesitation. In fact, Ape Out offers a very basic control system, entrusted to the left analog stick for managing the movements of the gorilla, while with the two triggers it is possible to carry out violent melee attacks and grips on enemies. By pushing the guards against each other or slamming them on the walls of the scenario, you will see them literally pulverized in a festival of blood and mangled limbs, which, moreover, can in turn be collected and used as a blunt weapon, albeit with not exactly exceptional results. The only variation lies in the ape's ability to take one enemy hostage at a time. In doing so it is possible to use it as a shield, rotate it to fire a few shots at its own allies and finally send it at maximum speed to crash into the unfortunate person on duty and then continue at full speed towards the coveted freedom. The game system works and is fun to use, also by virtue of an increasing level of challenge which ends up adding a lot of spice to each game. The checkpoints present at the end of each single level make life a bit easier, but in the stages where the difficulty becomes higher, the density of enemies increases and the size of the open spaces grows, you will have your work cut out for try to unravel the skein without having fixed reference points to learn and settle. From this point of view Ape Out sins mostly in variety,because actually it wouldn't have spoiled the presence of a few more alternatives from the point of view of interaction. Music: a fugue with jazz sounds The real gem of Ape Out is linked to the musical component, which hides a rather interesting studio behind it. As we mentioned at the beginning, the work is divided into four albums, each in turn divided into side A and side B like old vinyl records. The peculiarity is that the soundtrack follows a dynamic trend based on the rhythm that is actively imparted by the player with his movements on the field. The procedural dynamics is therefore not limited to the structure of the maps but also extends to the audio. The chaos and frenzy of the escape is punctuated by singular jazz-like tones that begin to unleash with each kill. Responsible for the music and sound effects of Ape Out is Matt Boch, a professor at New York University with a degree in Visual and Environmental Studies from Harvard. Bach is also creative director of Harmonix, the studio that created Guitar Hero and Rock Band. In his curriculum there are further projects all with a musical theme, such as Dance Central and also Fantasia: Music Evolved, created in collaboration with Disney. The Ape Out soundtrack is essentially based on a series of drum solos, a choice aimed at conveying that ~animal~ feeling that exudes from the interaction. The sounds overlap one another, get tangled in a riot of percussion and cymbals, giving a cadenced and symmetrical rhythm compared to the one chosen by the player during his umpteenth attempt to escape. Once each album is completed, Arcade Mode can be entered in an attempt to climb the online charts. The bonus you get for passing each stage is calculated on the basis of the time saved in the previous segment and the number of kills scored. Unlike the traditional mode, where it is allowed to restart from the last checkpoint to try to go further, in these sessions it becomes essential not to make mistakes for as long as possible, otherwise you have to restart the path from the first of the ten levels that make up each album.", "date": "2019-02-28", "grade": "7.5"}
