Everyone almost agrees in exalting in particular the undisputed ability of the title to know how to keep the gamer glued in front of the screen pad in hand thanks to the new features proposed and despite the high level of difficulty of its gameplay, the obstacles, bosses and traps . Packed with extra content, i.e. game, audio CD with soundtrack, strategy guide and hardcover art book, plus Italian localization for subtitles, the product finally arrives on European shelves directly in a limited edition with the suffix Black Phantom Edition. The plot at the base of the adventure proposes the almost primordial clash between good and evil, in this case inserted in a fantasy context. In the spectral Kingdom of Boletaria, King Allant has the lackluster idea of dusting off an arcane ritual linked to the power of souls to give prosperity and wealth to his people, ending instead by reawakening the Ancient Demon, a gigantic Beast that according to an old legend was found imprisoned in the depths of the Nexus, the world of the dead. Thus begins a period of terror and darkness for the inhabitants of the realm and surrounding territories: the only hope of survival is linked to the heroic figure of a spotless and fearless individual who will have the thankless task of restoring peace to the region. The abode of souls This is broadly the incipit from which the game kicks off. At the beginning of the story it is possible to create your own personalized avatar by choosing various aspects, including the class you belong to, selectable from those available. The latter take up those typical of the fantasy genre and therefore range from the canonical thief to the wiry warrior passing through magicians, knights and so on. Furthermore, each of these classes is characterized by unique abilities, physical, intellectual and magical characteristics often linked in turn to the types of weapons and accessories that they are then able to make the character use in the game. The choice of these last elements is very important in relation to the type of PC you want to impersonate, also due to the non-underestimated aspect of fatigue, given that the overall weight of the equipment worn affects the movements and resistance of the hero, especially in battle (think for example of a wizard wearing heavy armor or a greatsword). Once this is done and after a short tutorial you are introduced to the Nexus, the focal point of the whole adventure. It is in fact from this place where the souls of the deceased dwell that all the main actions related to the strengthening of the character, his weapons, the purchase of Items (the souls of defeated and recovered enemies are used as currency) and the learning spells and moves. It is also from here that you can access the various locations. Soul thief The game structure of Demon's Souls: Black Phantom Edition at first glance may seem similar to that seen in many other titles, therefore a sort of action-RPG with typically dungeon crawling elements. You explore, you fight by any means, you kill, you absorb souls, you upgrade your weapons or your skills. In reality, the gameplay of this product is quite deep and the player must, right from the start of the adventure, approach each phase, from exploration to combat, in a reasoned manner, that is, without throwing himself headlong into each path or against each opponent who stands in front. Learn to balance your hero's equipment in relation to your style of play, keep an eye on the various status bars relating to health, magic points and stamina level, the latter as we mentioned at the beginning of the article subject to decrease in relation to the The equipment worn and the moves made are just some of the aspects to take into account in order not to find yourself exhausted or weak in battle. The latter are in turn rather difficult to deal with: although the mapping of the commands is not particularly complex and indeed is quite usable, every move, even the most trivial, must be studied, especially bearing in mind that each opponent reacts differently to attacks which undergoes. And it behaves accordingly complicating the user's life. For this, nothing in Demon's Souls: Blac should be underestimatedk Phantom Edition: Death is always around the corner and is often brought about by the seemingly least dangerous enemy. If you are killed you can continue fighting as a ghost but with only half of the total energy waiting to recover your body (by defeating an end-of-level boss or finding some special stones -Ed) and even if it is true that in this case the opponents in turn become a little less difficult it is true that they are still difficult to beat. Without forgetting the perennial risk of losing all the accumulated souls if the red spot that indicates the place of death of one's character is not reached within the pre-established time frame. Given the absence of checkpoints, you also have to start the level from the beginning. And all enemies that were previously eliminated will be in their places again. Fortunately, in some points of the map it is possible to create shortcuts that can be useful for moving from some initial locations to other more internal ones. Co-op hunting Demon's Souls also has a novelty that makes it unique in its kind: the particularly innovative use it makes of online. This component is a fundamental element of the product and is, if you wish, permanent, given that it is integrated with the single player mode and present right from the start of the adventure (provided you have the console connected to the network), and affects on several aspects of the game. Everything works almost as if you were in a permanent world on the web: while you explore, investigate, etc., you find traces of all the players who, at that moment or in other situations, cross or have crossed a given area, leaving a imprint of its presence. This imprint can be a simple text message abandoned on a path by a previous video gamer which warns the passing user, for example of the presence of a particularly ferocious and difficult monster, a rare Item or groups of hidden enemies, or they can be the characters of the other players themselves who are facing the same level at the same time and who will appear to the eye as white figures. Or even bloodstains on the ground by interacting with which the last moments of the player who lost his life at that very point are revealed, allowing the discoverer to understand what happened and who it was who eliminated the unfortunate predecessor. To prevent some players accustomed to jokes from deceiving other users with fake reports, there is the possibility for everyone to assign votes to the messages found along the various paths. In this way, players can check from feeds whether the warning they have come across is reliable or not, thus avoiding unpleasant surprises. Demon's Souls: Black Phantom Edition online play is further enhanced by the presence of a cooperative mode where up to four players can team up to face any dungeon together, as well as end-of-level monsters. Balance in the balance There are two main options related to multiplayer: if you play from your console, you can summon up to three fellow fortune-tellers from the web in the game (using the so-called Blue Eye Stones and a special ~marker~ through which you can check how many and which other players are online, their rank in the world leaderboard and their reputation level). These will appear as ghosts in blue color, while the user-controlled character that acts as the host remains in solid form. Or vice versa and in this case the ~spectre~, let's say, will be him. In both cases, however, the only possible interaction with other human gamers is generally limited to the exchange of goods and equipment. The other system linked to multiplayer is instead a little more subtle: in practice, always with the help of the Black Eye Stones, a player can transform himself into a black ghost and invade the game of any other user connected to the network. By doing this he can challenge the unfortunate and involuntary host in a fight to the death, after which he can literally plunder the loser's supplies by stealing all the souls collected up to that moment. With serious consequences on the balance of the world. In fact, it is necessary to pay close attention to the actions performed by one's virtual alter ego: they can influence the surrounding environment thanks to the so-called World Tendency. This sort of Good or Evil level meter present in the various areas in which you move takes into account the deeds of the various characters: if they kill demons and similar amenities, then the explored area will tend, for example, to have a positive statusvo which will result in particular optimal conditions for the player, such as enemies with a lower number of HP or a lower level of physical and magical strength, or opponents no longer present in points where they previously stopped. Again, the hero controlled by the player will gain more power or be able to access side missions. Playstation 3 trophies There are 38 Trophies available in Demon's Souls. Of these there are 27 Bronze, 5 Silver, 5 Gold and 1 Platinum. While to collect the former it is necessary to work a little less, satisfying requirements such as obtaining the best weapon from Clearstone or Hardstone, or assassinating a specific demon, for the latter, especially the Gold ones (which once conquered will unlock the Platinum one) it will be necessary literally go out of their way since to obtain them it will be necessary to learn all the spells or recover all the rarest weapons, for example. Magical atmosphere Conversely, ignoring bad opponents and massacring some innocent people, the ~indicator~ will tend towards black, and all around, fueled by hatred, will make the mission difficult. It should be noted that always depending on the level of goodness or evil of a given place, some characters with whom to interact or fight may or may not appear. During games with the internet option activated it is interesting to note how it is influenced by all players connected to the server in which you are connected. The level of goodness or badness in a given area will essentially depend on the actions performed by all online users. Final note on the technical sector of Demon's Souls. Despite some drop in frame rate here and there and a level of detail that certainly does not make the most of the potential of the PlayStation 3, the graphics of From Software's game remain on good levels overall. It's true, the characters don't have a high number of polygons or a level of detail that makes them cry out to be a masterpiece, just as their animations sometimes leave something to be desired, but it's also true that the atmospheres, the settings manage to be evocative, pleasing to the eye and at times engaging thanks also to a good attention to detail linked both to the system that manages the lights and to the one that regulates atmospheric phenomena such as wind or fog. These elements that put together give the product a truly remarkable overview for the visual impact it manages to offer to the gamer. As does the audio sector which with its few musical accompaniments for the soundtrack in favor of more or less natural sounds such as the blowing of the wind, the sound of footsteps or the lamentations of demons which intensify that sense of unease that the game setting already offers itself, as mentioned, to the public, it contributes profoundly to making every situation magical, dreamlike.", "date": "2010-06-25", "grade": "9.0"}
