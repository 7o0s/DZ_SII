On either side of the path the sheep are made of cardboard and our mentor is an unlikely vampire. But despite the playful atmosphere, the title does not lack a healthy dose of blood that splashes abundantly when certain spells hit the opponents. In short, at first glance it looks like a super deformed action adventure, the feeling is reminiscent of certain situations in Diablo and the action gameplay is unbridled. The whole is then wrapped up in a world which is indeed inspired by Nordic mythology but which makes quotations its bearing wall. Back to the Future, World of Wacraft, Predator are just some of the dozens of references that accompany us through the title and sometimes even influence our actions. In Magicka there are plot, characters and dialogues but everything is extremely simplified. Dialogues and a witty atmosphere are obviously important to contextualize our magician's deeds, but the heart of the experience is that of a pure hack & slash, where acting counts more than any word. And the action thankfully is varied and includes giant monsters, end-of-level bosses and even some battles alongside CPU-controlled allies, who we should save but who more often end up being decimated by our spells. But unlike modern hack & slash, the game is divided into screens of various sizes and when you reach the exit, after exterminating the monsters that get under you, you enter the next map. In short, it is an approach closer to horizontally scrolling fighting games, strengthened among other things by the checkpoint structure and by the possibility of actually saving only at the end of an entire chapter, which must therefore be completed in a single game. Yet, even if the basic structure is too classic and limited, the Arrowhead Game Studios title has an ace up its sleeve  The Ace in Magicka In Magicka you move with the left mouse button, parry with CTRL and activate the secondary modes with SHIFT. To run, the key must be held down constantly and the pointer transforms automatically when we pass over people or objects to allow us to speak, use or collect. While you may wield a sword, the absolute center of gravity of the title is obviously the spell system. Nine types of magic of which eight can be combined to generate a plethora of different and devastating effects. The powers are activated using 8 letters on the keyboard and once the desired elements have been activated, up to a maximum of 5, the right button is pressed to release the spell. Projectile spells can be charged and boosted while the others generally produce a stream or barrier. Holding down SHIFT instead allows you to cast the same spell but this time in an area, while with the middle mouse button the spell is cast on our character. Furthermore, by holding down SHIFT and clicking with the left mouse button, it is possible to magically charge the sword which, in addition to increasing the damage, modifies the shape of the spells. The elements obviously have different peculiarities. Ice slows down opponents and freezes liquids but does little damage, while fire does a lot of damage and can also be used to dry our character who, for example, suffers damage when he throws lightning when he gets wet. Spells also have a different area of effect and if used carelessly they can heal enemies or damage us and our allies. Furthermore, even if it is possible to charge up to 5 elements, each new power selected weighs down the mage and slows him making him more vulnerable. Eight elements and infinite variations The basic power is wind and it cannot be combined with others but it is essential to shrug off enemies and escape from the most desperate situations. Individually selected elements make it possible to generate a flow, which can range from cure to flare-ups, while the combinations vary in shape and type. For example, combining fire and stone generates a flaming projectile that explodes when it impacts an enemy or a wall. An exception is the shield power which used on oneself generates personal protection, launched with the right button generates a barrier and combined with other elements creates elemental walls, traps and cures to be left on the ground. But there are also contrary elements that cannot be combined and so to lengthen the range of the lightning you need the arcane as stones do not conduct electricity. What's more, there are additional elements that need to be found and can be generated by combining the basic ones. In addition to the above, there are also special spells that we can find in the form of formulasand magical and are scattered throughout the game world. The collected formulas inform us of the elements necessary to cast the spells but it is better to memorize the most useful ones since there is rarely time to read something during a fight. Once the formula has been composed, to activate it it is necessary to press the space bar. These are very useful spells that include speed, mass fear and teleportation; the latter is undoubtedly the most versatile. And finally we move on to the wizard's staff which allows you to access powers in yet another way. Each stirrup, and there are many of them playing Magicka, has a passive power, which thanks to the paradoxes of linguistics is always active, and a spell that can be cast by pressing the middle mouse button and without having any magical element activated. The powers of the stirrups are therefore instantaneous and almost all of them, if used well, can be used to ward off enemies and save the skin. Feeling of power The gameplay is fast, dynamic and once you become familiar with the spells it becomes more and more fun. In fact, initially we tend to press two or three keys at random, preferring the most powerful damage elements to unleash random destruction. But proceeding in the game it is necessary to think about what you are doing, even if it is not easy to become familiar with all the available combinations. The possibilities are in fact countless, so much so that with the same spell it is possible to block an opponent, defend ourselves or create a funnel to hit enemies more easily. Of course, particular spells and formulas also require combinations of 4 or 5 letters, but damage-related spells are generally bound to simpler yet extremely powerful combinations. In fact, Magicka often gives us the illusion of being omnipotent and the explosions of enemies add that necessary touch to make us feel like war machines. And it's a feeling that seems to come directly from some Diablo situations. But as in Diablo dying is not at all difficult. Special enemies, spellcasters and hordes of goblins can complicate things and at that point it is enough to miss even one spell to find yourself surrounded. Also in Magicka there is also physics to play its part. In fact, if we welcome the possibility of shooting an enemy in a canyon, enemies can do it too and some even specialize in throwing the hero. In short, sometimes the challenge is less demanding with the end-of-level bosses since some are based on repetitive and predictable rounds and like the other elements taken from the old-style arcades, they clash with the freedom of action of this title. Longevity and assorted problems The game modes of Magicka are adventure and challenge. The first is decidedly long and accurate but the enormous number of magical possibilities do not allow for a perfect calibration of the situations. Often, in fact, the fights can be resolved by casting the usual spell relentlessly, but there is no shortage of situations in which the difficulty becomes decidedly tougher and the reflexes must be lightning-fast. The challenges, on the other hand, are arenas that can be tackled alone or in four. The goal is to resist 20 waves of enemies while trying to score as many points as possible. There are two arenas, an amphitheater and a forest, and they are characterized by different enemies who become increasingly numerous and bad. Obviously in four the dimension of combat is enhanced, situations become more difficult and collaboration is necessary. Accidentally detonating the screen can be extremely dangerous and can lead to the premature demise of the entire group. However, in both single player and multiplayer, enemies should always be considered based on their capabilities. Leaving the archers alone because they are far away is a big mistake and it is equally dangerous not to consider the monsters that cause little damage but can block or slow down us and our companions. Some monsters also try to drag the hero into water or a canyon, and both eventualities lead to a quick demise. Unfortunately there is no mode specifically dedicated to PVP even if, in Diablo style, it is possible to exterminate the companions in the coop and steal their precious staff. This obviously allows less gregarious players to wreak havoc on a game by killing teammates when they least expect it. And this eventuality, given the difficulty of entering an online game due to a disastrous netcode for now, could also prove irritating. The only solution in these cases is to play with friends, and perhaps in Teamspeak given the bad chat in the game, but even those, we assure you, can beand really annoying. Simple, pleasant, horribly buggy The bugs, despite the fact that the first patch has already been released, persist indomitable. In fact, it is not uncommon to observe graphic glitches and collision problems, often there are interactable objects that cannot be used and it also happens to find yourself stuck in a menu or in a game screen, with the only option to start the chapter over. Furthermore, online multiplayer is plagued by all kinds of problems that make it almost impossible to enter a game. But Paradox and Arrowhead Game Studios have nevertheless proved to be at work and presumably the numerous negatives will be resolved in not too long a time. The graphics are extremely simple but accurate, solid and refined. Furthermore, our eyes are delighted by profusion of light effects, well-finished shadows, touches of class and models of all kinds which, despite the economic nature of the title, are animated quite well. The music often winks at the medieval going here and there towards the epic. A pleasant soundtrack, certainly not epochal, but built with songs full of atmosphere that rarely lead to the irritating. The dialogues are dubbed in Swedish and subtitled in English but, even if you don't know a word of the two languages, it is still difficult not to understand what is happening given the simplicity of the situations. Furthermore, the dialogues are recited in a parodic and caricatured way and still manage to convey atmosphere as the onomatopoeic sounds of the Sims can. Among other things, the caricature choice adapts beautifully to the grunts of the monsters that sometimes recall the trolls of Harry Potter and the Ewoks of Star Wars. While on the contrary the sound effects are serious and, wisely, they don't skimp on bass to underline the magical blasts and the enemies' explosion to smithereens.", "date": "2011-02-02", "grade": "8.0"}
