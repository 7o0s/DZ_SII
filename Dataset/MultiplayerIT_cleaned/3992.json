{"name": "Reigns: Game of Thrones", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/reigns-game-of-thrones-recensione.html", "text": "Reigns: Game of Thrones, the official game of the Game of Thrones TV series, is in a sense the full circle. In fact, the first Reigns was inspired by it for themes and brutality, with that interface stolen from Tinder that gave particular weight to each of the government choices submitted to the player, and with plots and subplots that were nourished by palace intrigues, forbidden loves, power relationships and a lot of dangers that had to be survived. Reigns: Her Majesty was the decidedly successful attempt to decline the same mechanics and themes to women, while now Reigns: Game of Thrones does nothing but lead the series to its natural landing place, giving it in a certain sense the officiality that was missing. The game mechanics are practically identical to those of the previous Reigns, with some small variations linked to the different setting. The player is presented with cards that represent a character or an event. Each card offers two choices that affect one of the four powers of the realm positively or negatively, or which determine a certain chain of events. The powers, i.e. religion, army, people and finance, are represented by four icons placed at the top of the screen: emptying or filling them completely involves the death of the ruler. Attention advances Reigns: Game of Thrones tells an alternate history to that of the TV series and novels on which it is based. For this reason we inform you that in the following paragraphs we will mention some events that for some could be anticipations. They are very vague, but we warn you all the same because we know that among you there are people who, if taken by surprise, are ready to explode themselves against the editorial staff screaming ~spoileeeer~. Gameplay The variants we were talking about essentially concern the different management of the game flow, continuous in the first two Reigns, broken in Reigns: Game of Thrones. We try to explain. If you remember, in the Reigns, the death of a ruler was immediately succeeded by another, who inherited not only the power, but also part of the effects of the decisions taken in the previous chapters, which can be translated into new unlocked cards, essentially forming a long dynastic history that developed kingdom after kingdom. In Reigns: Game of Thrones, on the other hand, there are nine selectable sovereigns, whose reign always begins at the same time, i.e. after the hypothetical conquest of King's Landing by Daenerys Targaryen with the consequent disappearance of Cersei Lannister, but before decisive confrontation with the Strangers. At the beginning it is only possible to select Daenerys, with the other characters (Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Sansa Stark and so on) who must be unlocked by correctly addressing some specific events. Time is counted in moons and not in years, to avoid deviating excessively from the series, and upon the death of each king or queen, the kingdom is reset, while keeping some events active, such as access to the inn, new cards or sovereigns themselves, which can be selected multiple times, even consecutively. Of course this is the case, given that, as in previous Reigns, you die often and very quickly (a game lasts a handful of minutes on average). The common thread of everything is the red priestess Melisandre, whose role takes on more defined contours in the advanced stages of the game, that is, when almost all the unlockables have been unlocked. To enrich the gameplay there are also some special events, such as travel, brawls, fights, Small Council meetings and others, which often involve multiple choices. For example, facing the Lannister army, you can give orders to your men by choosing from a maximum of four possibilities, each represented by a card. Or traveling to Winterfell random sub-events can occur with binary choices or multiple choices, depending on the situation. In any case, the special events are described by small stylized animations placed at the top of the screen, which allow you to check the progress of a journey or the progress of a battle with a simple glance. Be that as it may, despite the additions, the game mechanics remain very simple to assimilate and use and differ little overall from the original formula. A game for fans In narrative terms Reigns: Game of Thrones enjoys and suffers at the same time from the series from which it is based. If on the one hand the presence of the characters from the series is a plus, on the other they undermine the enjoyment for anyone who hasn't seen the show or read the books, also because the references to past events are continuous. Brutally stated: some events assume that the playerknow what we are talking about in order to be fully understood. For example, when Jon Snow is asked to make a certain decision regarding Sansa, you need to know the past between the two and her personal history to give the right weight to the choice you are making. Another example: in the chaos in which Tyrion chooses Jaime Lannister as Hand, only those who have seen the show or read the books can understand why the latter is so reluctant to accept and the former makes irony about his own choice. In addition to the individual characters, knowing the series also serves to understand the current political situation in Westeros, i.e. the entire scenario of the game. Like why are the Greyjoys enemies of the Iron Throne? Why are the Tyrells in such a difficult situation? Why is Bran Stark so feared by the new High Septon? And still others, are all questions that any enthusiast can answer automatically, but which blow big holes in all the others. Obviously this is a limit taken into account by the production, which evidently wanted to create a game for the fans and not for the newbies of the series, but it is right to know, especially for fans of the previous Reigns who perhaps risk considering Reigns: Game of Thrones as a simple sequel and not as a product dedicated exclusively to a certain target. From a technical point of view there is very little to say about Reigns: Game of Thrones, since it follows the style of the previous Reigns, with ultra-stylized characters and environments, drawn in a kind of low-poly rendered in 2D. There's some more animation and there's more variety in events, but it's really hard to talk about actual progress. The soundtrack instead enjoys the official songs of the television series, including that of the opening theme. If you like them on the show you will like them here too.", "date": "2018-10-24", "grade": "7.5"}
