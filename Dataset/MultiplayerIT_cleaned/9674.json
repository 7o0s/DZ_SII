In fact, in Solomon's Boneyard the curious and extremely questionable teaching method adopted by the special teachers turns out to be also intended for the young generation; victims of the subtle and not too veiled blackmail that from time to time teachers (even normal ones, if one can say) offer up to their students, disguising boring tasks to be carried out beyond class hours in ~optional extracurricular activities~ (in fact mandatory ), the little protagonists will find themselves in this context facing a real test of courage, just so as not to disappoint their teachers. One night at the cemetery Prequel to the aforementioned Solomon's Keep, Solomon's Boneyard tells the story of 7 young wizards (of which only 4 are immediately available) engaged in a fight against the creatures of the night that infest the Dead Hawg cemetery. The still inexperienced necromancer Solomon Dark, just graduated but already decidedly devoted to the ~dark side~, is in that sad place to develop and train his main skill, which is to awaken and command the dead. Driving one wizard at a time, the player's task will be to exterminate as many zombies, skeletons and similar atrocities as possible, using the characteristic spells for each character. Having therefore abandoned the classic story mode with random dungeons, Solomon's universe is transformed into a sort of endless Survival Horror, with the sole aim of collecting as many kills as possible. The comparison with the previous episode is useful on this occasion to understand the game mechanics, taken substantially in full: with the left virtual stick (structured like a rotating ring) the direction of movement will be indicated to the character, while the one on the right will instead be responsible for the various types of attack. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on the case, after a careful test and an accurate comparison with Solomon's Keep, we notice a slight inaccuracy in the right stick, not due to a loss of sensitivity of the controller but paradoxically due to its increase , which will force the player to keep the thumb much more firm and precise; nothing particularly accentuated, mind you, but easily verifiable in use with all magicians. Another element that Solomon's Boneyard has in common with the previous chapter is the randomness of the skills that can be upgraded at each level up: here too, having reached a certain number of kills, you will gain experience and you can choose an upgrade from a list of three randomly selected by the CPU . Doubts remain about this choice, which while giving unpredictability to the action limits enough the development of the character; however the upgrades, being slightly smaller in number, will appear more frequently on rotation, thus facilitating the choice. Therefore, despite the absence of random dungeons, due to the fixed setting in the cemetery, the possibility of alternating the choice of the protagonist gives the game a greater variety than in the previous chapter: in fact, each wizard has a different style of attack due to the particularity of the spells in possession. By way of example, a fire mage will have to shoot his spheres aiming precisely at each creature, while the witch with lightning powers will be able to limit herself to directing the powerful beam towards an unspecified point of the group of enemies by hitting them randomly with the beam electric. Among the shortlist of powers of Solomon's universe then appears that of ice, managed by the wizard Morth, whose potential if properly developed allows you to freeze a huge number of enemies simultaneously thanks to the wide range of the jet. As usual then, the victims often release gold coins to be used for the purchase of objects and potions, part of the traditional fantasy inventory; these coins will remain available even after game over to upgrade all wizards. To balance the greater pace of play, given by the horde structure, the mana bar (the ~fuel~ for attacks, present together with the health bar at the top of the screen) will regenerate faster than usual, thus allowing for faster recharging quick spells. Even technically, Solomon's Boneyard settles on the good levels of the previous chapter, improving the play of light and the reflections of the shadows if possible, while maintaining the horror / humorous style that distinguishes the series. The problem remains of the repetitiveness of the environments and the anonymity of the audio sector, limited to a few effects and music, while the integ finally appearsration with the Open Feint lens system.
