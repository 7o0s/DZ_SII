{"name": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars - L'Era dei Duelli - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-the-clone-wars-lera-dei-duelli-recensione.html", "text": "After completing the double Star Wars film trilogy, George Lucas's production company has seen fit to enrich the most famous science fiction saga ever through animated feature films in computer graphics. Star Wars: The Clone Wars, screened in theaters not long ago, is chronologically placed between Episode II and Episode III, therefore we will find Anakin Skywalker still in the guise of an unblemished Jedi, in the service of the Republic. The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jabba the Hutt's son, which is organized by the Separatists (under the command of Count Dooku) to put the Jedi in a bad light, accusing them of having committed the deed. Obi-Wan, Anakin and his young pupil Ahsoka Tano leave immediately to find the little Hutt, but on their way they will find the assassin Asajj Ventress as well as Count Dooku himself, intent on ensuring that their plan is not compromised. The game Developed exclusively for Wii, Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Age of Duels presents itself as a classic tie-in, whose main game mode closely follows the events narrated in the animated film. After completing a short tutorial, in fact, we will take turns at the commands of three different characters (Ahsoka Tano, Anakin and Obi-Wan) and we will have to face a sequence of increasingly cunning and powerful opponents, following the plot as regards places and situations . The duels will not all be different, in fact on more than one occasion we will find ourselves fighting again with the same enemy, but they are based on the same rules: to achieve victory, you must have the upper hand in three ~rounds~. The clashes are extremely spectacular, they make extensive use of predetermined sequences and very often see us move within different scenarios in rapid succession. It is clear that the fulcrum of the game is all in the control system: we will be able to move our character using the Nunchuck's analog stick, jump and dodge with the A button and parry the blows with the B trigger. Matter of numbers In addition to the story mode, which unfortunately ends within an hour on the normal difficulty level, The Age of Duels does not offer other ~substantial~ modes. You can challenge a friend or try your hand at free fights, choosing your character from among the ten available and fighting within one of the nine scenarios present; but it lacks online multiplayer altogether, which would surely have contributed to the game's length. Furthermore, there are no other methods that can justify the sale price, certainly not from an economic line. Finally, the title developed by Krome Studios suffers from a general lack of variety, with the fighters who practically all behave in the same way and who differ only in the way the combos are performed: this is a problem that affects less successful fighting games, who fail to offer an experience with some depth and end up offering a high number of characters, but only on paper. To this we must add a control system which, as usual, does not keep its promises: although the right and left slashes are discreetly detected, the same cannot be said of vertical movements and even less of those in depth. Very often we will find ourselves shaking the controllers at random, because the game is unable to ~read~ the combos or because the maneuvers themselves are not as effective as they are spectacular: much better to deal a single blow with the favor of the Force, spending the rest of the time to somersault and roll. The apex, however, is reached during the ~quick time events~ in which you have to move the Wii-mote according to the indications on the screen: we will hardly be able to win against the opponent, and this only due to a mediocre movement detection. Technical realization The best thing about the game is undoubtedly the direction, capable of showing us engaging combat sequences in line with the animated film: the result is spectacular, and will certainly be appreciated by Star Wars fans. The graphics, in general, are of good quality: the polygonal models are simple (they don't even move their mouths during the spoken phases...) but have good animations both in terms of quantity and quality. The scenarios move between ups and downs: some locations boast a good level of depth and a good choice of colors, others are too small and dull. The textures, in general, are extremely simple or completely missing: a choice dictated by the need to make the action as fluid as possible, to the detriment of detail. Localization in Italian is good, pity only for Anakin's voice, the victim of a particularly listless and devoid ofany emphasis: the character addresses the enemy in the heat of battle, while flames and destruction blaze all around, with the tone and animosity of someone reading a storybook. The music, fortunately, is excellent as usual, while unfortunately the effects are mediocre. Comment All Star Wars fans wanted a title like Age of Duels for Wii, but now that they've been satisfied, there's probably only waiting for the Motion Plus at the top of their thoughts. are numerous: Wii-mote and Nunchuck, at present, are unable to guarantee the precision necessary for this type of game. Or, at best, the developers belonging to the so-called ~third parties~ really struggle to get results that go beyond a narrow sufficiency. In this specific case, the controls are not in real time (the character performs the commanded move with a variable delay) but above all it is really difficult to carry out combos or simply ~lunges~ when needed. The other problems of Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Age of Duels, however, are far from negligible: a story mode that is too short and easy, the thickness of the fights that is lacking, the lack of secondary modes that can guarantee minimum of longevity and a technical realization functional to the action, but modest. We're not really there, really. Pros Discreet graphics Great music, good dubbing in Italian Fascinating basic idea... Cons ...but very poorly made Only one mode of weight, however short and easy Limited and confusing gameplay", "date": "2008-12-11", "grade": null}
