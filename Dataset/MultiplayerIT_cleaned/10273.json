The game can be broadly defined as a reduced version in the trappings of the next gen one, but perhaps for this reason more similar to the old productions of the series and therefore to the tastes of the fans. In fact, everything is centered on the typical elements of a three-dimensional fighting game, especially the game modes, focusing on one-on-one battles, as we will see shortly. In the name of tradition is the story that forms the background to the game, which continues the saga by presenting us once again the fight between the G Corporation and the imposing Mishima Zaibatsu, culminating as usual in the famous Tournament for the role of King of the Iron Fist. Once you have chosen the fighter you want to play from a list of forty heroes, each with their own personal background and unique fighting techniques, the gamer can start his battle. Novelty In the initial menu, the first thing that immediately catches the eye is an absence that certainly won't make most Sony users despair: in fact, the little-loved Campaign mode of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 edition is missing, fortunately replaced with the classic one, History , structured in the canonical series of (few) one-on-one fights which then lead to the last and decisive clash with the Boss on duty, with rare exceptions (such as when using Alisa) the fearsome and hateful Azazel of this sixth chapter. In our opinion, the heaviest absence is that of online multiplayer, a key element to often keep interest alive in certain types of games, especially fighting games. Deprived of the possibility of challenging users scattered around the planet via the internet or of competing for the top positions in the world ranking of the best Tekken 6 videogamers, PSP owners can only rely on the classic ad hoc local wireless connection with a few friends to vent your desire to challenge other humans. Instead, there are the classic modes such as Arcade, Survival, Timed, etc, as well as very nice challenges such as the one called Gold rush which consists of a succession of meetings divided into thirty seconds each, in which the ultimate goal is to keep your total money balance active after a timer expires. In practice, for each blow inflicted, you receive money which, on the other hand, is deducted if you are hit. The money raised can be used to customize the various characters in the roster of fighters. New heroes There are six new characters introduced in the sixth chapter of the saga: they are Lars, the illegitimate son of Heiachi to whom he is also linked by fighting style, Zafina, mystical and lethal. Then we have the androgynous Leo with a desire for revenge against Kazuya, Miguel Caballero Rojo, the female-looking adnrodie Alisa Bosconovitch and Bob, a valid fighter who despite his size and belly knows how to fight like few others. Miniature fists For the rest, the gameplay is always the same, fun and rewarding of the series. Initially immediate in the commands, the Namco title then gives its best later on, when having thoroughly learned the control system of the characters and the various moves that characterize them, it is possible to master the more advanced commands and to develop very tactical and rich clashes of combos, tricks and counter moves. In this, the excellent mapping of the game's controls on the PSP controller helps a lot, which uses the four basic buttons for attacks with kicks and punches (as well as grapples with their combination) and parrying simply by avoiding pressing the keys: after all, the Tekken saga was originally intended to be played with the aid of the d-pad. From a graphic point of view, Tekken 6 is undoubtedly a well-made production. Despite the hardware limitations of the PSP compared to the home consoles from which this port was made, Namco's game shows a general care and a visually valuable set. Less well-finished stages and without atmospheric elements, but still well represented and animated, characters with fewer polygons however well characterized from the point of view of detail even in the movements, even if some moves have been simplified in this sense, and special effects slightly reduced in quantity and quality but always effective. Thanks then to the possibility of allocating 380 MB of memory card for the installation of the game, the loadscatkins are very fast. For the audio instead, excellent samplings regarding the effects during the fights and a decent soundtrack, suitable for the genre. In short, ultimately we can talk about a perfect optimization and adaptation of the game for Sony's portable console.", "date": "2010-01-04", "grade": "8.3"}
