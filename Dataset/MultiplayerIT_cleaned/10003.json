Prince of Persia: the Forgotten Sands is placed between the first and second chapter of the trilogy that marked the return of this charismatic character, and tells the story of our hero who visits his brother's kingdom to learn the secrets of the art of a perfect ruler, sent by his father to prepare for the time when he was to succeed him. Arriving at the castle, however, the Prince finds the realm under siege by an enemy force who wants to seize the secret hidden within, or King Solomon's invincible army. Cornered by overwhelming forces, the brother decides to call on this mythological army himself only to discover that, in reality, it is an even greater threat than the one he wanted to fight. From there begins an adventure that will delight those who wished for a return to the origins of the saga, with the only defect of being a happiness that is a little too short and without real obstacles for the most savvy players. Life is a leap With Prince of Persia: the Forgotten Sands, Ubisoft retraces his steps, once again adopting a tested formula made up of very fast platform phases without the slightest need for the Prince to return to levels already passed thanks to a series of rooms drawn on the screen by an engine which is now mature and allows excellent views in almost all circumstances. It is an action game that alternates sections of combat against King Solomon's army with parts in which you have to solve short environmental puzzles in order to arrange platforms and water ducts so that the protagonist can jump over ravines seemingly insurmountable and climb walls that are insurmountable at first glance. By reading carefully, the real novelty of this chapter will not have escaped you, given that the Prince has on his side, in addition to the powers of the Sands that allow him to rewind Time as in the past, making death a false problem in almost all of the jumps, also the more mortals, even the ability to control the flow of liquids. In fact, thanks to the help of a woman, a wonderful divinity who supports him in this unequal struggle, he is soon given the power to create solid columns of water and handholds to hold on to for a limited period of time, precisely blocking the flow of water. fluid. The game designers once again confirm their ability to create some of the best platform sequences that it is possible to play in this genre, with fun and breathtaking sequences, in which you have to juggle with the pad in order to repeatedly activate and deactivate the power so as to make to flow the water when it is necessary to pass through waterfalls that cover passages, or to stop it when instead a wall or a column is needed on which to find refuge in order not to fall irreparably into the void. Imagine, therefore, stairways that slide under your feet, while the prince falls downwards and you have to run up the walls, throw yourself into the void and then activate the power at the last second and create a handhold from which to start again for a another set of jumps to the next puzzle or fight. Also on this front there are some novelties, with the Prince who acquires experience points for each enemy killed, points that can be spent on a chessboard to unlock upgrades relating to vital energy and magical energy, which is used to rewind time when dies and to activate the powers with which to make his way through thousands of sandy undead (!). There are four powers: fire, ice, rock, which hardens the Prince's armor for a period of time, reducing the amount of blows suffered, and wind, which unleashes a tornado that sweeps away weaker enemies and stuns , weakening them, the biggest ones. Each of these has four power-up levels, but you soon find yourself using them only carelessly, given that Prince of Persia: the Forgotten Sands is far from a difficult game and that the basic hits are already more than enough to get to the end of the game. And sorry because between the melee moves, those contextual to the environment, which change depending on where you end up bumping into enemies, and the flying shots, there would be a lot of fun for a while. Playstation 3 trophies Prince of Persia: the Forgotten Sands is a decidedly generous game, given that already in the first play it allows you to obtain about 70% of the available trophies, of which 9 are silver and 3 are gold. Apart fromthose that cannot be missed because they are earned by progressing with the game, there are those related to the use and enhancement of the various powers that require minimal effort and those related to the discovery of the sarcophagi or to overcoming the clashes with some bosses unharmed. Be careful to leave something on the street because once the game is over, there is no possibility to replay the individual levels, but you have to do it all over again. Even with the enhanced character. Sand doesn't bite Prince of Persia: the Forgotten Sands can be completed in about seven hours at the normal difficulty level, the bad surprise is that there is no ~difficult~ one you can try once you finish it and have adequately boosted the character, which it's a shame because, as already mentioned, the powers work and it would have been fun to test them with truly worthy opponents. The game is there, it's fast and fans of the saga will also appreciate the Prince's new acrobatic powers, including a flying shot which is a delightful reference, even in terms of mechanics, to Sonic's spin dash which allows, towards the end, to perform truly spectacular evolutions, all in the name of a refreshing speed, while in the void you jump from one enemy to another even clinging to them. Except that when the game picks up the right rhythms and all the elements fit together in their place, it's already time to say goodbye, after a breathtaking battle. The more willing will be able to make the journey again to collect all the sarcophagi, statues hidden in the depths full of experience and energy, unlocking the residual trophies/objectives, or they can play two additional modes which require you to eliminate a series of waves of enemies within a certain time or to arrive unscathed at the end of a series of hordes of opponents in the shortest possible time, but it is really a small thing for those who do not love the Prince viscerally. Graphically, apart from the fact that the Assassin's Creed engine, without the weight of the vast environments typical of free roaming, allows for excellent light effects and very defined textures, the work is excellent, albeit with some ups and downs, especially for some less inspired by others. The animations are very good as are the sound effects and the musical accompaniment, with a dubbing without peaks, but functional to the narration of the story which fails to excite, but which for an action of this type does its duty to bind the unfolding of events to the end.", "date": "2010-05-20", "grade": "8.0"}
