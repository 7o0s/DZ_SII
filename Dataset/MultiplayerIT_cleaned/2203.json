The game will mainly be a third-person action, in which we will be able to jump and beat our opponents, and in which with the simple pressure of a button we will be able to switch from the third-person view to the first one which will allow us to use the ~grappling hook~ to reach places that seemed too high for us, and to attack our opponents with batrangs The characters of the game mirror those of the TV series, both in character and in physical appearance, but unfortunately this is not enough to hide the scarce inventiveness of the title , in fact, even if batman will be able to use all his techniques, against enemies that always remain the same, many times the fights will end up being quite the same as batman will mostly be able to attack with kicks and punches and make holds, although fortunately with as you progress in the game you will learn combos and special moves. Two of the positive sides of the game are the atmospheres that reflect those of the TV series, and the possibility of using the much loved batmobile on the streets of Gotham. Poor graphics Even if the Gotham settings are done well and the characters are similar to those of the TV series in my opinion The graphics are not in Batman's favour, in fact the main character has quite conspicuous defects, one of which is the too uniform color of the suit, and in my opinion (it will be my problem but I hate cartoon graphics) the cartoon graphics animated does not suit a title of this kind that would perhaps have favored more demanding graphics, even if perhaps the programmers have deemed it appropriate to combine the graphics with the type of character that we will have interpreted during the action, given that the bat man has acquired much of its success also thanks to the animated series. However, the graphics are sparse and not very detailed when compared to other XBox titles. Batman vs Jokerit...oops...Joker! The music being taken from the TV series are perfect for the game, and the voices of the characters have been reproduced by the actors who also dubbed the TV series: we will also be able to have subtitle support during the course of the action. The sound of Batman and the Joker has been treated more carefully by the developers and it is also noticeable in the dialogues. Who will win this time between good and evil? In the end we can say that the game perfectly reflects the TV series both in terms of characters and atmospheres, and we can say that an excellent job has been done in this respect, but in my opinion the gameplay and graphics could still be improved, which could have been more detailed. However this title is quite fun and can not miss in the homes of all those who love the bat man and his adventures Pros: The game mirrors the TV series There is the batmobile The levels are varied and all very fun to play Cons: Unfortunately the graphics are not very detailed and the power of the Xbox has not been fully exploited especially in the creation of the locations The controls are not always very precise and many times you will take it out on the joypad Materials: Tips Finally you will take on the role of the bat man... The rise to power that the Batman saga has made has been truly impressive, in fact from a comic book, it has been transformed into a television series, and its fights against the joker and all his allies have been seen by almost all the kids in the world. Italy, later, to further increase its success, it was decided to make it into films, including Batman, Batman forever and Batman & Robin. As the last stage of this endless climb, Batman is also preparing to become the most powerful console game in the world. i.e. an XBox game.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
