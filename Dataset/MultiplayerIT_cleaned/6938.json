Nothing particularly surprising then, given that it is the offer of independent developers that is now almost the absolute protagonist of the Sony laptop catalog. The reason for the interest around the game developed by Digital Dreams, a Dutch team with offices in the same building as Vlambeer, Game Oven and Abbey Games, lies mainly in the fact that Metrico has been added to the list of titles offered for free via PlayStation Plus in the month of August: a surge in popularity that can undoubtedly be useful for developers needing to make themselves known, as in this case. It's just a pity that, despite many good premises and some excellent ideas, Metric is ultimately a rather disappointing product. A schizophrenic control system and too much ~trial and error~ mar the Metric experience Undoubtedly the most successful aspect of the Digital Dreams effort is the graphic component, original and intriguing despite the choice of a minimal and stylized style really reduced to the bone. Yet it is an aesthetic solution that marries perfectly with the underlying concept, which is really interesting. Basically Metrico is an infographic-based puzzle game: statistics, equations, graphs, figures, columns, histograms and everything you'd expect to find in a very boring presentation on the financial results of any company. Elements that become protagonists and justify the development of what is basically a puzzle game with platform elements, within a two-dimensional context with horizontal scrolling. Metrico doesn't say anything explicitly to the player to explain mechanics and objectives, but limits itself to giving clues and suggestions precisely through numbers and graphs: if a percentage increases by walking or a value increases by jumping, it will be quite simple to understand what those two actions are like to allow the resolution of that particular puzzle. Obviously, this is only an example, also because the variety of puzzles offered is quite consistent and generally of a good standard, although there are certainly less successful moments in which the ~trial and error~ element takes on such proportions as to go beyond the process of logic and natural understanding. The main problem with Metrico, however, lies in the fact that the developers have let themselves get carried away a little too much in trying to find original solutions capable of making the most of the features and capabilities of PlayStation Vita; a sort of absolute need to justify the exclusivity of the publication on the Sony laptop, in an effort that however went well beyond the acceptable limits that it is necessary to maintain in order to preserve a playability worthy of the name. In fact, each of the six levels present adds a level of interaction between the game and the machine: if the beginning is in fact trivially linked to sticks and buttons, subsequently the touch screen, rear touch surface, gyroscope and camera are also used. Unfortunately, without any indication whatsoever, the search for the key to understanding a puzzle often passes through boring and frustrating attempts at interaction using all the tools listed above: logic and deduction are debased, and we find ourselves tapping and turning the console or press keys hoping to hit the right formula. An irritating situation, which is considerably worsened by the problems in the control system: one cannot ask for great precision from the rear touch pad and the gyroscope, but Metric is instead decidedly fussy, forcing the player to an often excessive effort of patience. The ~worst~ is reached right in the last level, when the camera comes into play and it becomes necessary to have 3 red, green and blue objects or surfaces available to frame in order to manage the movements of the platforms and solve the related puzzles : a kind of game design madness, of creative arrogance, which turns out to be almost impractical if you find yourself playing outside a home context or in the dark. The impression that the developers got a little too carried away, necessarily looking for originality and forgetting the fun, is what reduces the ambitions and the overall quality of Metric. The potential of perceives, and the charm of the underlying idea is indisputable, but the final realization of the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Finally, the brevity of the adventure should be noted, which can be completed in about three hours.", "date": "2014-09-02", "grade": "6.0"}
