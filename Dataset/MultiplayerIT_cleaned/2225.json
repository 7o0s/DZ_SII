The library was born in 1941 from the fervid imagination of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, but now Tanuki Studio has decided to use it as the basis for a stealth platformer adventure with a strong narrative vocation. The plot - which also relies on suggestions from Apocalypse Now - is undoubtedly the strong point of the production, which in its second part is marred by an all too ~surgical~ and pervasive platforming, with a frustrating and not very stimulating result for the player. An excellent art direction and many good ideas remain for a video game based on agility and stealth, not violence. We tell you about our journey to the library of Babel in our review of The Library of Babel. Investigations in Mesopotamia The Matriarch has access to the immense flow of information from the library of Babel, but has not yet managed to fully understand the true nature of this mysterious place ~Humans all died in the great extinction. Cats didn't.~ This is one of the sentences you read during the (long) uploads of The Library of Babel, set 20,000 years after the extinction of the human species. The world is now run by an advanced robotic society that knows very little about its creators, but the Seeker Ludovik, the protagonist of the adventure, heads towards a recently discovered ancient library in the hope of learning more: it seems that on its shelves there is content all that has been written and all that is yet to be written. Received by the robotic Matriarch who is dealing with the decryption of signals from the library, Ludovik finds himself in the midst of a state of emergency declared due to the murder of a religious leader, and must delve into forgotten and dangerous territories to track down the mysterious killer. The exploration of the jungle and mountains of this Mesopotamia of the future is made fascinating by an excellent artistic direction, marked by strong chiaroscuro and with excellent camera management, which occasionally moves away from the protagonist to offer spectacular and wide-ranging views . The use of two-dimensionality guarantees precise management of what is presented to the player, with very accurate backdrops and animations. The same attention is also perceived in the dialogue interfaces and menus, consistent with the robotic nature of the protagonist and his supporting actors. No place to hide The platforming sections degenerate towards excessive difficulty starting from the middle of the adventure of Ludovik, protagonist of The Library of Babel The Library of Babel is a two-dimensional platformer in which you advance by hiding from the guards who populate the areas occupied by the cult that Ludovik has to investigate. This is especially true in the first hours of the game, while in the second part of the adventure (which can be completed in about ten hours) there is a decisive shift towards a more extreme and, in our opinion, unnecessarily technical and complex platforming: The Library of Babel it is not proposed to the public as a hardcore experience but as a title with a strong narrative vocation, and the continuation beyond a certain point will become particularly difficult for players not accustomed to technical prowess, also considering the lack of accessibility options. The dialogues, through which you get main and secondary missions shown in a special section of the menu: pity that the dialogue options already covered are not visually highlighted, and that some secondary missions are actually necessary in all respects to continue in the adventure, without the player being informed to that effect. Exploration and backtracking following the acquisition of new skills are essential to continue and satisfy the requests of the robots present in the colony which acts as the central hub of the game, also paying attention to the possibility of combining objects with each other through a special option inside of the inventory. The artistic direction of The Library of Babel is the strong point of the production, both visually and sonically Pleasant puzzles to unlock the doors, which can be solved by creating a balance between red and blue lights by directing the flow of electricity. Once you have accessed one of the areas in which this videogame Mesopotamia of the future is divided (all distinct within the map and equipped with fast travel options), you must carefully avoidmind the enemies patrolling the area. The stealth system is very simple: Ludovik must crouch behind crates and other objects - highlighted with white outlines - and wait for the enemy to pass, then get up and move at the right time. Too bad that the guards have a poorly readable AI: the absence of a cone of vision is felt, and even after several hours you are surprised by an enemy capable of tracking you even at a great distance, while on other occasions you will not even react jumping over the head of the robot on duty. The result is a certain underlying flatness, and the system as a whole proves monotonous and uninteresting after a short time. Checkpoints aren't always forgiving, and replaying entire sections of challenging platforming due to very minimal errors is, in the long run, a very frustrating experience, also considering that you lose a portion of the collected gems. From a technical point of view, The Library of Babel poses no headaches on Nintendo Switch, but is plagued by long loading times when logging into a different zone or when using fast travel. Discreet, albeit with a few mistakes too many, the translation into Italian. The music is magnificent, with Middle Eastern sounds that seem to come from a distant future, a happy metaphor for a robotic civilization that tries to remember its human ~ancestors~.", "date": "2023-04-10", "grade": "6.5"}
