{"name": "La magia Nintendo in punta di telecomando", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pikmin-2-new-play-control-recensione-lav.html", "text": "Halfway between an excellent commercial operation and a good work of repechage of its great classics dispersed on the GameCube, today Nintendo has decided to let its new Wii users play its good old Pikmin 2, one of those rare games that have managed to to reconcile the favors of the public with those of the critics. Unfortunately, as we all well know, the previous home console of the big N was overshadowed by the fierce competition of the time, and in fact its many small and great masterpieces were appreciated by an unfortunately small number of people. The phenomenal success of the Wii and the close link between its hardware and that of its predecessor have therefore allowed Nintendo to set in motion a recovery campaign that focuses entirely on the new controls, allowing it on the one hand to make a much wider audience play with its best software library, on the other hand to be able to do it without the use of huge investments and maintaining a budget price. Luckily Miyamoto has a green thumb Take the good old Lemmings, mix it with a real-time strategy, set it in a nature documentary and season it with the traditional magic and perfect playability of any good Nintendo title. This is Pikmin 2, although each description can never be exhaustive enough: only by playing with joypad in hand (in this case it is the case of saying remote control) you can be able to fully understand it. Pikmin is a genre in itself, like many of the titles born from the imagination of that genius of Miyamoto-San. This, in particular, was born thanks to the passion that the famous game designer has always had for gardens, plants and their micro-fauna. After enjoying the first chapter, reworked with the innovative controls of Nintendo Wii, it's time to get your hands on the sequel. Pikmin 2 takes the basic idea of the original game and improves practically all aspects of it, increasing the things to do, decreasing the bugs, changing some details and even inserting new Pikmin. First the controls: the remote works perfectly. Pointing is always precise and functional, even when the cursor moves over rough terrain, hills and obstacles, it is always very easy to understand how it is positioned in three-dimensional space thanks to its perspective that leaves no room for doubt. The separate use of analog (nunchuck) and pointing (remote control) is very convenient and allows you to perform previously unexpected operations, such as moving and simultaneously launching Pikmin or giving orders. The camera, which in the first one was free and rotatable thanks to the two triggers, this time is managed in a different way: to position it behind the shoulders of one of the two protagonists (this time you work in pairs!) you must first indicate the direction with the remote, then press the Z button on the nunchuck. A fast operation, but still more complicated and less intuitive than using a single key. In practice, using the free camera always involves pressing two keys instead of just one as in the GameCube edition: an almost obligatory choice, given that the first analog (represented by the remote control itself), this time is engaged in pointing the indicator on screen. The control system works just as if we were using a mouse on a PC, a method well known by every real-time strategy player, which is well suited to the very nature of Pikmin 2. Olimar and his colleague Louie must in fact issue commands to whole hosts of nice Pikmin, with the aim of making them recover as many treasures as possible without falling victim to the fearsome animals that infest the undergrowth. Many new ideas, and many fewer problems If in the first Pikmin our mission was to recover all the pieces of the shattered spaceship (about 30 parts), in this sequel things get much more challenging: the goal is to collect as many treasures as possible, and there are more than 200! The plot of the story, very simple, only serves to kick off the very long sequence of levels available. Once he returns from the unfortunate journey in which he had crashed with his ship, Olimar has a bitter surprise: his company has made too many debts and risks bankruptcy! Due to the fault of a space rabbit, the shipment of precious Pikpik carrots was lost, and the President had to sell Olimar's spacecraft and ask for a large loan. With Louie's help we immediately set off in search of treasures, in an attempt to avert the bankruptcy of Hocotate Transport, to the same planet where the accident had occurred. Numerous changes and additions have been made to this adventure. The most important concerns the Pikmin themselves:now there are two new ones, the poisonous whites and the hardy heavy purples, joining the fire-resistant reds, the blue swimmers and the hardy yellows. Each of them can evolve by eating certain substances and a nice little flower, which has appeared on their head, will indicate those that have become faster and faster. Up to a hundred of them can be used at a time, and once the solar day is over they must be returned to their spaceship to avoid the nocturnal wild animals. This time, compared to the first chapter, the time limit (those fateful 30 days) that served to complete the game has been eliminated, a factor that favors relaxation and enjoyment of the adventure itself. A database has also been included in which to appreciate everything encountered in the adventure, a factor that clearly suggests how much Nintendo wanted to make the gaming experience even more adventurous and relaxing, without frenzy. Even the fauna of the enemies has been expanded and made more heterogeneous, compared to the prequel, introducing new bosses and unpublished insects. Numerous adjustments also in the game mechanics: now it is much faster to launch pikmin, and the introduction of the second character on the screen allows you to manage the action from two points of view, without having to make long journeys from one point to another of the map with only Olimar (it is in fact impossible to issue remote commands). This factor allows endless new possibilities, as well as execute our commands much faster. Thanks to this new feature, the developers have been able to design much more complex and articulated levels, but the learning curve is soft and gradual, allowing the player to practice and grapple with increasingly complex situations without frustration. The Pikmin's Little Big Adventure In Pikmin 2, there are hundreds of treasures to find. Not pearls or diamonds, however, but batteries, old abandoned objects, bottle caps and anything else that can be found abandoned: objects that have great value for a small inhabitant of the space. You can also go underground, in ever deeper dungeon levels where you can recover hidden relics and valuables, defended by many enemies and giant bosses such as worms and lethal insects. On the surface, then, you return to it thanks to powerful jets of water. The level design is sublime, very heterogeneous despite the always similar setting but always fresh, brilliant, fun, never distracting. Traveling with those little Pikmin, in that equally microscopic environment, gives a priceless feeling of recollection and adventure at the same time: it seems to be an ant inside the universe of a flower pot, and soon you literally learn to love both that magical context, both the little Pikmin who follow us everywhere and promptly launch themselves at our orders. We soon learn to hold on to their lives, so much so that we get really angry when one of them succumbs and their little soul materializes in the air going up to heaven. We soon learn to smile, when one of them falls behind the group and runs away. Or when, once tired, he sits down and rests. The tender sympathy of the Pikmin is an integral part of the gameplay of the game, as well as the suggestive setting. The graphic sector is very accurate in every detail: the micro-world of Pikmin is realistic and full of details, plants, flowers, animals and things. The frame rate is granite, even when hundreds of Pikmin are displayed on the screen, whose animations are often jaw-dropping. The textures are of excellent quality, always very lively and bright, very caring for the entire duration of the game. Technically no improvements have been made, as Pikmin 2 is the exact port of the GameCube edition. However, the audio has been optimized to take advantage of the dual speaker-speaker output integrated in the controller, and now many effects and sounds come out directly from the remote control, providing a pleasant audio immersion effect. In addition to the long and full story mode there is also a two-player battle option, in which, thanks to the split screen, you can duel against a friend. There are various rules, but basically the winner is whoever manages to bring the opponent's marbles to their base (the onion). Furthermore, finding a particular treasure during the story unlocks the challenge mode: in this series of competitions you have to accumulate an ever higher score by facing hordes of enemies and having a limited number of Pikmin available. It is also possible to play in two, again with split screen. Too bad that Pikmin 2, for these two modes, does not take advantage of the Wi-Fi Connection NiI intend to play with our friends from a distance.", "date": "2009-05-10", "grade": "9.0"}
