It is a mobile RPG with gacha elements, for a change, which supports Tales of Arise in an attempt to restore prestige to the historic Japanese series, with truly remarkable results so far, as regards the chapter for PC and consoles. We have seen how the big Japanese publishers tend to rely a little too frequently on the same structure for their mobile games, often applying the minimum effort and focusing everything on the charisma of the characters and stories, but in this case at least a certain commitment is noted in the desire to propose something new, even just from the point of view of display and controls. This does not involve substantial changes in the game mechanism, which is always a very driven action RPG and focused on various characters, but offers several very interesting variations on the theme. The cast is made up of 21 main characters who alternate as protagonists on the scene, each with their own chapter to complete, which already represents a particular solution, also considering the diversity of backgrounds and characteristics that emerge for each protagonist, all well characterized by the design point of view and with a certain narrative support. The idea of 21 characters all to be explored, with the possibility that they have intertwined narrative lines that then converge in a choral tale is really very fascinating and the stories are also well written, enough to convince us to go on from chapter to chapter. The story of Tales of Luminaria is therefore composed of this sort of anthology, with chapters each dedicated to one or more characters included in the world of the Bandai Namco series, to be completed to receive the rewards. Leveraging on the charisma of the members of the large cast, the game offers a remarkable alternation of narrative elements, settings and situations, even if the gameplay is always the same. A vertical RPG Tales of Luminaria, a mix of cutscenes and gameplay There is a single solution adopted by Tales of Luminaria that affects the presentation, but also the gameplay and the use of the game itself: the use of the screen vertically. It is an original and questionable choice in various respects, but which is very functional, given that it allows on-the-fly control with the use of only one hand, with all the commands concentrated on a single touch. This particular graphic arrangement is evident right from the initial screen, with an interface that looks - for once - really different from all the other typical Gacha RPGs. Tales of Luminaria features options arranged on vertical tiles that fill the space in a simple and elegant way, although this arrangement may seem a little confusing and disorienting at first. Priority or newer contents are arranged at the top and from this screen you can access the various chapters of the game, customization options and gacha-style summons. The gameplay is that of the ~scrolling~ hack and slash action RPG, it could be defined, greatly simplified by the use of a few keys on the screen: also here the vertical arrangement determines, as a consequence, the strange central position of the single key which serves both to move the character and to attack, with additional virtual buttons dedicated to special moves with their specific effects for each character. Each chapter presents a different story and character, which are also distinguished by fighting style and personality: we find short-range fighters, archers and magicians, each with its own approach to battle which is reflected in ranged or contact attacks, but in in any case it is a question of pressing the central button to hit, moving using it as a virtual analog or touching it in short quick movements to dodges without thinking too much, minding the cooldown of the special moves and little else. Tales of Luminaria, characters and fights in pictures The ~portrait~ type framing allows you to hold the smartphone with one hand and play practically at any time, but it also brings with it poor visibility, aggravated by the fixed framing. In general, the game tries to accommodate this particular cut as much as possible, but the battlefield tends to spread out in width and this creates numerous blind spots even during combat. It's a shame because, otherwise, the graphics are very well done both in the anime-style cutscenes and in the game phases, with scenarios thatthey flow pleasantly during the exploration and dialogue phases between the characters, but it is difficult to always have a clear vision of what is around the protagonists. In all this, the soundtrack fully incorporates the style of the series while the dialogues are of remarkable quality, practically constant between the characters even during the game action, obviously all in English (with English lyrics, there is no 'Italian). The gacha element of Tales of Luminaria is exclusively dedicated to clothes, equipment and weapons, since the characters are an integral part of the story and are provided with the release of the various episodes. There are therefore no standard summons of fights with different rarities, but the same principle is applied to all the items to be equipped, which consequently cannot be conquered in the game in any other way. The system is apparently more conducive to those who do not intend to resort to micro-transactions, however it should be noted that the use of the gacha is still essential in order to have the weapons and equipment necessary to continue in the game. As a result, any need or willingness to resort to micro-transactions remains practically unchanged, even if the pressure is probably less, given that these are less important elements than the characters, which are automatically provided by the game.", "date": "2021-11-29", "grade": "7.0"}
