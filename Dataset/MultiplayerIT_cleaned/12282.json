{"name": "Soviet Spy III: Operation Umputation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soviet-spy-iii-operation-umputation.html", "text": "The continuous search for novelty in wireless gaming leads developers to make changes even in the series that have achieved a certain popularity. This is the case of Soviet Spy, which in this third incarnation differs markedly from what has already been seen in the previous episodes, maintaining its platform setting but drawing on an unpublished plot and background. This time we will see the protagonist of the game locked up in a high-tech space suit, capable of remedying accidental falls using thrusters, while making space between enemies using gradually different and upgradeable weapons. Soviet Spy 3 starts leaving us in the middle of a blizzard, with precise objectives to be achieved level by level. Continuing the game will take us inside the enemy bases, increasingly full of opponents and traps, which we will have to avoid by making jumps or shooting devices at the right time. The control system is classic: the mobile phone joystick (or the corresponding number buttons) is used to move our character and to allow him to jump, while the lower right diagonal (or the 9 key) is used to enter the doors. Finally, the fire button is used to use the equipped weapon among the three that you will have available: a pistol, a rifle and a laser beam. Equipment that is anything but conventional, but the enemies to face are not ordinary: zombies, mutants and mechanical creatures of all kinds, divided between fifteen levels with increasing difficulty. The technical realization of the game stands at excellent levels: the scenarios are quite diversified and the choice of colors always appears spot on, while the sprites are very numerous and boast animations above the average of the genre. In general, the idea is that of a very well-finished product, which also focuses on ~seeing what comes next~ to entice players to continue the adventure. Perhaps also because in terms of pure gameplay Soviet Spy 3 is a bit lacking, due to the cumbersome control system which perhaps makes most of the dynamics that develop in the stages unsuitable, starting with the evasive maneuvers.
