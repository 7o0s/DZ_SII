You can refer the daring patron to the review of Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution that we released last year, or (recommended) submit your review of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale, which you are reading right now. Of course, they are not the same thing, and not for the obvious reasons related to the title or the fact that they are two separate episodes of the same franchise. The collectible card game (one of the best known in the world together with Magic) has changed very rapidly in recent years, perhaps to keep up with methods of use that have also become too rapid, almost schizophrenic. The traditional rules you knew were joined by those of Speed Duels, then Rush Duels. And it is precisely to the latter that Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale is all about it. The operation - perhaps especially in Europe - makes particularly sense, and we are going to explain why in the review of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale. The plot: the bond with Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens This is Yuga, featured in both Sevens and Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale The plot of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale takes place in the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens, an anime series completely unknown in the West. And the problem is definitely not a lack of interest, as all previous series of Yu-Gi-Oh! they arrived on time to us too, at a certain point. The cause is to be attributed, if anything, to the pandemic: in fact the serialization of Sevens began in 2020, a very unfortunate year, to then undergo several successive interruptions. The resumption of the second season, in Japan, is very recent; most likely, therefore, our local adaptation will see the light in 2022. From a videogame point of view this is good, because consequently Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale in Italy represents a fresh and innovative production: we do not know the ~familiar faces~ in the country of the Rising Sun, nor the situation, nor the new rules. The territory of Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens must be fully explored, clearly starting from some well-known and essential elements, such as the presence of cards and duels between challengers equipped with their own original deck. The player takes on the role of an unnamed new duelist, a kid from Goha Elementary School; thus begins his ascent into the world of Duel Monster, in the company of Yuga (the protagonist of the anime series) and his friends. The city is controlled by the Goha Corporation, which does not welcome the very recent changes to the Duel Monster rules, introduced by Yuga and for which even your alter-ego seems particularly inclined. The new rules of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale require you to draw continuously Speaking of important news: Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens has revolutionized the rules of the Konami game and the same goes for Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale, which has completely absorbed its new mechanics. ~Duel Monster~ duels are now faster and more intense, at least on paper. Without starting the drafting of an encyclopedia on the subject, here are the most relevant changes we have noticed: you can summon as many monsters as possible in the same turn, and no longer just one (the tributes remain for monsters from level five onwards); the playing field features three monster card zones and three spell and trap zone cards; no more extra decks, therefore the Pendulum, XYZ, Fusion and company summons have been completely removed; introduction of cards to be played in combination at the same time, which flank each other (even graphically) and actually behave like a single creature with a single attack, a single defense and a single effect. Revamped gameplay The Black Magician could have been missing from Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale? Given the many news related to the anime and the rules, let us now focus more on the offer of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale. The gameplay alternates exploratory phases with others dedicated entirely to combat, obviously based on Duel Monster clashes. The former are also the least successful: the game world is not particularly vast and from an artistic and content point of view very lacking. Basically you will move between a few areas, full of secondary characters that are useless and some NPCs (few) ready to assign you a specific mission, most of the time the one necessary to continue the plot. nobody cares: because whoever buys Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawnof the Battle Royale does it for the possibility of dueling - and he will be able to duel, keep this in mind, only with the new rules we have already told you about. The clashes of the title, yes, are very accurate from the point of view of the effects, however more than any other title of Yu-Gi-Oh! published for ten years now. The benchmark, thankfully, was wisely Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links for mobile devices, and not the sloppier and more anonymous Legacy of The Duelist (released on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 last year). This translates, to give an example, not only in captivating graphics in the texts on the screen during duels, or in cards that are finally a minimum legible and with increased dimensions, but also small images of the 2D monsters that ~are generated~ by cards and remain suspended above them; some cards (but not too many) once played even show a very short movie, usually a creature that goes wild taking position on the playing field. From a technical point of view (textures, polygonal models, attention to detail) nothing formidable to report, but let's repeat it again: do you remember the real sloppiness of Legacy of The Duelist? Sure, the heydays of Yu-Gi-Oh PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable titles are long gone, but for once we're holding onto something a little bolder. Graphically the duels of Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale are more than acceptable Again, the main defects of the production are the most easily understood: first of all the number of cards available, which in no way can equal the lists and decks of the past. And how could it? The new rules have imposed obvious limitations, above all the removal of the extra deck and entire strategies currently available in official tournaments. On the other hand, these limitations allow Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale to be daring, offering fresh rules and a renewed use of the same biased game that has been entertaining for over twenty years now. Greater care in exploring the 3D environment, the school and the city of Goha would have made the production really interesting: for now we have to recommend it only to those willing to spend 40 euros for a first taste of Rush Duels and Yu-Gi -Oh! Sevens.", "date": "2021-12-15", "grade": "7.0"}
