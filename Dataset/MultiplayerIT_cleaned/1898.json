{"name": "Dynasty Warriors 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynasty-warriors-3_a.html", "text": "History In the game we will take part in a war waged by three different factions, that of the Wu, the Shu and the Wei, each of which will have its own army and its own elite of generals. It will be up to us to decide which side we are on and which general to personify, so as to bring the fate of the war to our side! Impersonating a glorious general After seeing the nice introductory video of the game we will be transported to the main menu from which we will be able to choose what to do. From the main menu we will have the possibility to set the options to our liking, to continue previously interrupted games or to start new ones. There will be 3 modes in the game, the mosue mode which is equivalent to the story mode, the free which consists of a quick game and the challenge which will allow us instead to give life to a real record hunt. Once the mode has been chosen, we will be asked to select the character to use. After receiving the mission briefing we will find ourselves in the battlefield, and that's where the real game begins! Our task will mainly be to seek out and defeat enemy generals, or to prevent the arrival of new enemy troops by killing the gate captains who allow them to enter. The enemy units killed will depend a lot on our speed in carrying out the mission: in battles, if completed with a good strategy, the kills will not exceed 150 units, but if instead they are carried out with a less tactical and more barbaric method, you can also reach levels of 1000 (my maximum for now is 600, but to unlock LU BU you need 1000) At the end of each mission the points earned will be counted, and these will increase the level of your general which from 16th will become 1st degree, to then even reach the MAX. The missions will also allow us to increase the character's statistics (life, musou, defense, attack) in fact it will not be uncommon to find bonuses +1, +2, +4, or +8 to defense or attack. In addition to the bonuses, a series of objects have also been introduced which, if equipped, will significantly increase specific skills, and each character will also have a certain number of bodyguards available, used for his protection. However, these guards can be replaced with one of the available characters of the user's choice. The character will keep his stats unchanged, so if your chosen general is at full power, he will become your best defense! Each character will have 4 different weapons available. The first 3 weapons will be the standard ones (anyone could unlock them) while the fourth will be the bonus one. To get to the fourth weapon you will have to set the difficulty to hard and complete some special objectives (these you will find written in any walktrought). Using this weapon will give you additional bonuses. Super moves will also be executable in the game, which will give the player the opportunity to make his way through the enemy ranks. Their usefulness is not so much to damage the enemy, but rather to knock him down. When you play in 2 player you will have the possibility to perform a super move in combo: if you are close to your partner and you perform the super move at the same time an electric effect will be added to your attack which will double the damage An almost infinite longevity I wanted to dwell on this point because I think it is one of the most important features of a game. In addition to having fun, Dynasty warrior 3 guarantees the user a very high longevity, as it allows you to use 41 characters, of which only 9 are present initially , and moreover, for each of these it allows you to increase the level through bonuses and to equip them with different weapons (each character will have a set of 4 personalized weapons). Surely a good player will not stop playing until he has unlocked all the characters, but a very good player will not stop until he has brought them all to maximum power. It goes without saying that the multiplayer aspect also greatly increases the enjoyment and longevity Multiplayer what a passion Played with a friend, the game becomes even more beautiful and fun. It will be possible to play the game in co-op mode which will allow us to participate in battles (both in free and in musou mode) together with a friend using the spleet screen. In addition to the previously mentioned mode we will also be able to face our friendsus in limited duels in which only our two generals will appear Surely Dynasty Warrior 3 is a title that satisfies the user from a multiplayer point of view and allows the latter to have fun in the company of his friends Graphically speaking Graphically, the title performs quite well even if it certainly does not reach the maximum heights to which some xbox titles have accustomed us. Although the game has to move a varied number of polygons as we will fight against about 40 enemies at a time, the fluidity is not affected by this at all, on the contrary we always remain on a high number of FPS The characters are very well made and the warriors too secondary that make up the armies, although all the same, reach a good graphic detail. The effect of the super moves is rendered really well and greatly increases the user's involvement and enjoyment. Even when played in 2 players, the game remains at high FPS levels and does not slow down, except when super moves are performed in combos. The stages are very large and well made, even if the interactivity with the objects that include these last is very little. We will only be able to break boxes and vases, but we will not be able to affect anything else in the stage environment. To lighten the graphics a little, a mist has been inserted in the background which will allow us to see objects and enemies only at a certain distance. this is a minor detail that does not affect the graphic quality of the title Sound The title is unfortunately spoken in English, but fortunately it is also subtitled (always in the same language) and thanks to this what is being said is quite understandable. The music chosen to accompany us on our journey is truly of excellent quality. The battle sound is also done well, but I think you'll be too busy mowing down enemy phalanxes to notice ^_^ We put away our weapons To conclude I would say that dynasty warrior is certainly not a title with the charisma of halo or with the freedom of action of morrowind, but there is no doubt that it is a fun and long-lived game. I strongly advise against dynasty warrior 3 to those looking for a challenging game, but instead I recommend it to those who want simple and fast fun. Lots of bonuses, characters and maps are the strong point of an innovative title for the Microsoft console and that will surely amuse the user who chooses to buy it. Pros: lots of bonuses. Very fun. the characters can be upgraded. player Cons: repetitive in the long run not suitable for everyone Dynasty warriors 3 The first dynasty warrior was born as a 1 vs 1 fighting title, it is only with the second title of the series, in fact, that this innovative style of play was introduced. The third chapter, like the second, is based on an arcade / action style that will see us fight against hundreds of men at a time. This genre is completely innovative on the microsoft console.
