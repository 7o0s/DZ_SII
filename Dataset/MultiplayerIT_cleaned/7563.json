The other is Daedalic Entertainment. In the results, the two studies could not be more different, but they have one thing in common: as authors (in this case collective) they have developed a personal style that has evolved over the course of the works. And if Memoria demonstrated the maturity of Daedalic Entertainment's style, The Walking Dead was the consecration of Telltale Games' approach, which favors the narrative aspect, moral choices and casual gameplay based on Quick Time Events. It was therefore obvious that The Wolf Among Us would retrace the steps taken with The Walking Dead. We therefore have a series based on the license of an American comic, in this case the popular Fables by Bill Willingham, with a graphic style that incorporates the drawn tables and actions to be performed within a time limit. As always it is impossible to evaluate the series on the basis of the first episode, which in this case has to spend a lot of time presenting the setting - although it does it very well, letting the actions tell the story. The world of Fables is in fact an imaginary community of fairy tale characters exiled from their stories and taking refuge in Manhattan, New York. To disguise themselves from the sight of human beings they need a spell, the Glamour, sold at a high price. Those who cannot afford it end up locked up in the Farm, a kind of lager for the poor. You will therefore have understood that in the world of The Wolf Among Us there are social hierarchies with clear boundaries. Either you are in or you are out. On the subject of the right to inclusion, the first episode returns on several occasions, so it is likely that it is one of the pillars of the series. Be that as it may even with all their rules, fables, former citizens of the world of fairy tales, have a tendency to fight and hurt each other. It therefore takes someone who is vigilant to maintain order and prevent them from showing themselves to humans in their original features. This someone is Bigby Wolf, none other than the wolf from Little Red Riding Hood and the Three Little Pigs, the protagonist of the series. If you're new to the Fables universe don't worry, the events narrated in the video game take place much earlier than those in the comic. Once again, Telltale enriches an original work with an unpublished narrative, which expands the subject without betraying its essence. Or so it seems. We're just getting started, and so is Bigby, grappling with a dirty case of beheaded fairytale women. The Wolf Among Us opens well a noir story of murders and prejudices which, however, does not touch deeply The old vice of the wolf If we look at the form of the game, The Wolf Among Us is a simple and painless journey that ends with the story hanging at a critical moment. Impossible to go wrong, because there are no puzzles to solve and, even if we fail a Quick Time Event, we can always try again: it's just a matter of pressing a key at the right time or hitting a red area with the mouse pointer. The path to follow is clear and the freedom of action is reduced to the minimum necessary to make the protagonist move, so we don't even run the risk of not knowing where to go anymore. Here and there are items to collect, but they serve no purpose other than to offer more choice during a particular scene. In case, however, the game takes care of bringing out the right item at the right time, so you just have to go with the flow. We are left with two important tasks, to survive during the clashes by overcoming trivial keystroke challenges and to make relevant narrative choices when the opportunity arises, sometimes during a dialogue, others during an action. We will return to this last point in the next paragraph. Let's focus instead on the fight scenes. The first takes place almost immediately, a couple of minutes into the episode, while the second is placed in the last third of the game. Between the two moments there is room for a daring chase between fire escapes and corridors of social housing. Compared to the past, you need to put more effort into quickly pressing a key or responding to commands that change over the course of a few seconds, so that you end up just following the directions without looking at the action that takes place on the screen. In the end, one would almost want to review the fight to find out what the choreographic result of our choices was. Thanks to the perfect correspondence between the succession of commands and the development of the scene, the clashes are spectacular and dynamic, but still an end in themselves. There remains the feeling of having enjoyed a healthy fist fight, even violent, but without the urgency of surviving to see another day or help a loved one in need.ty. This is obviously not a problem of the game system, but of the narrative structure, which we will discuss in the next paragraph. Fables without a moral Let's get to the heart of the game and of the latest Telltale Games productions: the characters, the plot, the moral choices entrusted to the player. The writing veers effortlessly from funny to dark, punctuated here and there with roughness befitting an anti-hero like Bigby. Each character is voiced by talented actors and characterized as appropriate, nothing to complain about. We just haven't grown attached to anyone yet. We cheer for characters who fight for something they hold dear but in this episode the scene is mostly occupied by a protagonist who only touches on his inner conflicts to focus on his job as a neighborhood sheriff grappling with a dirty case. The moment of greatest psychological subtlety we perceived during the dialogue with Colin, one of the three little pigs, who showed his tormented side more than all the other characters. It's not that we don't have fun in the world of The Wolf Among Us but the problem, at least for now, is rather the opposite: we just have fun, because the conflict is all moved towards the outside. The one crucial choice in the game poses no moral dilemma, and if we do miss a dead body, well, it's that of a stranger we hadn't even seen his face, let alone know what he was risking. We are thus far from the angst that gripped our stomachs in The Walking Dead, when we were grappling with decisions like I watch my best friend die to save the little girl I love most. However, we would like to underline that these are premature considerations, because the series has yet to get going. Bigby is by no means a flat character, on the contrary, we know that he fights against the violence that lurks within him, but this tension and the choices connected to this unsolved knot are yet to come. Only in one case, after a bloody confrontation, can we decide to indulge in a gesture of violence in line with our dark side, an act that, if we decide to do so, leaves us full of shame and remorse. These are the moments we need. Even if the traumatic event that closes the episode had depended on a mistake caused by our weakness, the drama would have taken off. As it is The Wolf Among Us - Episode 1: Faith is still a well-finished and enjoyable first chapter, with an almost perfect rhythm of an urban crime story that can still evolve in any direction. Also towards the narrative excellence of which Telltale Games has already given ample evidence.", "date": "2013-10-16", "grade": "7.4"}
