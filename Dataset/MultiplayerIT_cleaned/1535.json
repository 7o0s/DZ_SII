{"name": "Conflict: Desert Storm II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conflict-desert-storm-ii-3.html", "text": "Set again in Baghdad in the midst of the Gulf War, CDSII puts the player at the head of a team of chosen warriors, of whom he will also be given the opportunity to select the origin, which can be American or English, respectively from the Delta Force section and SAS. Despite this purely choreographic distinction, the game proposes, in both cases, the same legendary characters of the predecessor: John Bradley, Paul Foley, Mick Connors, David Jones. The four warriors will each have distinct abilities: Bradley will be the leader of the group as well as an expert in communications and assault weapons; Foley will be the classic sniper, more commonly known as a sniper, capable of hitting a target even hundreds of meters away; Connors will instead have as a peculiarity the use of heavy weapons, such as missile launchers and machine guns; Jones for his part will be the expert in infiltration and explosives. This long list of features was needed in order to introduce the game system. Conflict: Desert Storm II is a third person shooter which, if necessary, can also be subjective. The most prominent feature lies precisely in the possibility of using a team instead of a single character; in fact the player, in addition to guiding one of the four military experts, will be able to command the remaining three via radio thanks to very specific inputs as well as switch from one to the other at any time. It will be possible to give orders to an individual or to the whole group, call for a burst of fire or send a soldier to a certain position, ask to be followed or to stop. This interesting feature is undermined by a somewhat unintuitive control system, above all due to the fact that, to each key of the pad, with the addition of the left trigger, the various commands will be assigned, which will have to be memorized one by one due to no text display on screen. Before starting the actual game it will be advisable, and strongly recommended, to take a look at the training section, where, in addition to familiarizing yourself with the complex system of controls, you can get to know the iron sergeant in charge of training , who will give much more than a smile thanks to his rough attitude and frequent rebukes. Once the game has started, after selecting one of the three difficulty levels, the experience becomes much more serious and complex. Each mission will begin with an accurate explanation by the logistics section which, thanks to satellite shots, will focus on all the targets and obstacles that will be encountered on the battlefield. If the first mission will be nothing more than a perpetual shootout with consequent carnage, from the second onwards everything will become more varied and, in some ways, strategic. The ten missions present in Conflict: Desert Storm II will in fact alternate exciting shootings with more quiet actions, in which it will be necessary to infiltrate an enemy commando or act as an escort for allied soldiers. The player will have free choice on how to face each mission, moving each soldier at will and at any time. The variety is certainly one of the greatest strengths of the SCi Games title, which also boasts a, albeit simplistic, growth of the characters in perfect RPG style. After successfully completing a mission, points and bonuses will therefore be awarded to the characteristics of each of the four soldiers, depending on how they distinguished themselves in battle. Finally, last only in order of mention, there is the multiplayer mode which will allow you to play the same missions up to four players in split screen. SCi Games in developing this title ran into two double-edged swords: the first is due to the not too stable relations between the USA and Iraq in purely advertising terms, while the second is the setting of the game, halfway between realism and the arcade. The latter could really please everyone or the opposite. In fact, on the battlefield, the dispassionate realism given by a varied armament is contrasted by the impossibility of dying in particular events. The four soldiers will have an energy bar which, once completely discharged, will take advantage of a subsequent charge, with the only difference that the soldier will collapse waiting for treatment. This implies that, after a violent explosion, the victim instead of jumping to pieces will still be curable by his companions. Furthermore, the level of difficulty, even set to the minimum, could doand as a deterrent to beginners, who in addition to having to manage a rather difficult control system, will not have much space to assimilate the mechanics of the game. Graphically Conflict: Desert Storm II stands at very good levels, with qualitatively high peaks. The polygonal models are made with a good number of polygons and animations, as well as really accurate textures. The same thing goes for the game environments, which, in addition to presenting a decidedly good level of detail, boast a well-chosen motion blur in certain areas that perfectly reproduces the heat effect from a distance. Even the somewhat realistic explosions add quality notes to the graphic sector of CDSII, complete with particle effects and light effects that give the game a high level of spectacularity. The only flaw with regard to the frame rate is its instability and, although it risks not having vertical collapses, it is afflicted by frequent jerks. A note of merit instead for the creation of the sound which has excellent effects and dialogues entirely dubbed in Italian. Final comment Conflict: Desert Storm II fully redeems the, albeit discreet, predecessor and does so by reinvigorating all its main features. A good title with attention to all its facets which, however, risks, being in the middle between realism and arcade, of not satisfying the occasional players, much less the purists of the genre. Despite this not too remote hypothesis, the SCi title offers about 15 hours of warmongering fun, to which it is necessary to add the infinite possibilities given by the multiplayer, as well as a really good technical sector. A game that all those who appreciated the prequel and lovers of ~basic~ FPS will surely love, for all the others a try before buying is highly advisable. Pros: Technically very good. Great variety of missions. Extremely fun multiplayer. Cons: Convoluted control system. Those less familiar with the genre might find it frustrating. War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing. With this phrase, repeated and obsessively shouted, a young Bruce Springsteen demonstrated all his dissent for what was, is, and probably will be one of the greatest evils ever: war. One could quibble for hours and write page after page, with sentences strictly belonging to the most shameless rhetoric about how bad war is, unjust and so on. The fact is that this empirical premise does nothing more than introduce the game we are about to deal with. War can be beautiful, if it's done for fun. Even better if made in the form of a video game, and the developers of SCi Games must know this well who, after the first discreet chapter of this saga, have decided to throw themselves back into the fray with Conflict: Desert Storm II.", "date": "2003-09-30", "grade": null}
