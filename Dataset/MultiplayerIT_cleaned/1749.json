{"name": "Space Channel 5 - Part 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-channel-5-part-4.html", "text": "Ulala's Swingin' Report Show! In the role of Ulala, a charming presenter of the ~Space Channel 5~ television station, we will have to save space from the menace of the Rhythm Rouges and free their hostages by following their rhythm and dance steps. If at first glance the plot may seem ridiculous, as the hours go by this impression can only be confirmed as such, but self-irony is one of the peculiarities of the Sega game. The game mechanics turn out to be quite simple: it is a question of repeating the movements of the aliens by acting on the arrow keys and on the keys used for shooting and saving the secondary characters. Initially single presses or short combinations are required, but as the levels progress, the difficulty rate will rise considerably, engaging the player in sudden movements and long sequences to memorize. The on-screen indicators are limited to the Share index, conditioned by the performance made, and to the hearts that indicate how many errors are still allowed. To differentiate the otherwise repetitive playful component, the UGA programmers have included several bonus sections, in which the beautiful Ulala will be able to challenge the reporters of competing TV stations in duels based on musical instruments, such as the electric guitar and the drums. Much weight has been given to the end-of-level boss duels, ranging from giant carnivorous plants to a trio of singing robots, always introduced by hilarious interlude sequences. Often these bosses have sudden and continuous changes of pace that displace the distracted player. Once the supporting characters have been saved, they will appear on the stage following the movements of the beautiful space reporter, encouraging the player to free a large number of them to see the screen literally invaded by improvised dancers. By carrying out particular secret movements during the ballets, numerous extra costumes can be unlocked for the protagonist, in the appropriate section. In addition to the Game mode, where you are called to face different missions in sequence with the possibility of saving both in the middle of the level and when the mission is completed, there is also a mode called ~Ulala's Dance~, a sort of ~survival~ with a hundred short levels characterized by a constant increase in difficulty. It is then possible to deepen the knowledge of the primary and non-primary characters in the ~Characters~ mode, and finally Ulala's ~dressing room~ is accessible where you can dress her with the various costumes unlocked in the other modes. The multiplayer consists in the subdivision of the tasks between Player1 and Player2, called to respectively control the directions and the action keys. Up! Down! Up! Down! Chu-Chu-Hey! The technical aspect of Space Channel 5 v2 is at least controversial. The design is commendable and cared for in every aspect: a particular futuristic setting (at the ~Jetsons~, so to speak) blends with the blatantly 60s look, the bright colors invade the screen and inevitably infect the viewer. However, fluid and sinuous animations are applied to poorly detailed polygonal models composed of an insufficient number of polygons. Puppets that could have been fine in 1999, but which in 2003 are undoubtedly dated. Even the textures sector proves to be only discreet, both as regards the characters and the backgrounds. Finally, there is a questionable compression of the Full Motion Video sequences of introduction to the missions, far from the perfect rendering of the videos of other titles available on Playstation2, in particular those of the Squaresoft, Namco and Konami series. A graphic sector which therefore turns out to be not up to the stylistic choices made by the Sega designers and which is redeemed only in the presence of the much loved 50/60Hz selector. On the other hand, the audio sector is excellent in all its aspects: spot-on, catchy music, perfectly in line with the style of the game and always ~synchronized~ with the images on the video. The sound effects and voice sampling are also good. The dubbing is in English, accompanied by Italian subtitles. Unfortunately the flaws of Space Channel 5 part2 are not limited to the pure technical sector. Sometimes there is a bit of confusion and difficulty in understanding which keys must actually be pressed: for example there may be opponents who pronounce the action to be performed in a distorted voice, or it is left to the player himself to ~guess~ which key is corresponding to the requested action. Other times there are inaccuracies in the detection of inputs, with delays of a few milliseconds severely punished and early pressures inexplicably ~allowed~. Gamers who are less patient and willing to get involved in musicthey will find the intermezzo sequences between one ballet and another excessive and will complain about excessive loading, especially if the same sequence has to be repeated several times. However, these are marginal defects that do not affect the quality of a title undoubtedly aimed at an audience that knows how to abandon itself and let itself be carried away by the grooves and engaging sounds, and which requires great concentration and quick reflexes for this. The Sega product performs quite well in terms of longevity. The six, very long, game levels, the ~Dance of Ulala~ mode, the flood of objects to unlock and the multiplayer help to increase the hours necessary to complete the title, although this is basically based on the re-playing of sections already played. Comment Space Channel 5 part2 is a title that must be sought and understood. It will hardly be able to involve those who are not willing, but it is certainly capable of rewarding those who let themselves go to the rhythm of the fascinating Ulala and its choreography. The flaws of the technical sector must not discourage those who are willing to live such an experience. A title that therefore joins the already praised Rez on the shelf of stylish games. Pros + Beautiful choreography + Engaging music + Hypnotic gameplay Cons - Questionable technical realization - Some inaccuracies in inputs - Definitely not for everyone Conceived for the Sega Dreamcast in 1999, Space Channel 5 was part of the first wave of conversions by the Japanese software house for the benefit of the Sony toy library. The very original atmosphere, the result of a fusion between futuristic style and typically 60s spirit, has helped to make it a sort of manifesto of the most fashionable conception of videogaming, on a par with psychedelic experiences such as the one proposed in the wireframe world of Rez. Now the second chapter of the delirious UGA title also arrives on the shores of Third Place, involving the people of the monolith with its markedly funky rhythms.", "date": "2003-02-18", "grade": null}
