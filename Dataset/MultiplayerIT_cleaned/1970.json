{"name": "Freekstyle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freekstyle.html", "text": "Known faces In Freekstyle you will be able to use the digitized version of many real motocross world champions (including Brian Deegan, Greg Albertyne, Mike Metzger, etc.), each with their own characteristics and abilities. Clearly, by continuing to play, you will be able to increase the parameters of your pilot, acquiring more speed, new stunts, etc., thus managing to be more and more competitive and reckless. As in every EA BIG title, continuing in the game, you will be able to unlock new bikes and new very special secret characters. Graphics and sound From a graphic point of view, the game has been very accurate, both in the characterization of the characters and in that of the various tracks. The tracks are many and all characterized by their own details: you will find tracks developed inside steel mills, missile bases, forests on fire, etc., where you will have to juggle fiery circles, glass plates to break, very steep ramps and an infinite number of other obstacles. The game was really focused on the charm of the multiple stunts that you will have to perform to run in the various tracks, also having the possibility of passing through alternative roads and even more challenging secret sections. The perfect mix between stunts and tracks, makes Freekstile a fast-paced and fun title. Technically speaking, it must be said that the work done was of the best: the graphics run very smoothly, without particular problems and slowdowns, but clearly, having been reused the same engine of SSX Tricky, nothing less was expected. Just think that during the stunts, when you find yourself suspended in the air, thanks to a very wide horizon of view, you will be able to admire a large part of the track below, but be careful when landing, if you don't put the bike back in the right position, the the only thing you will see is the ground on which you will break your bones. The metallic soundtrack that will accompany you during the competitions is also perfectly apt, adrenaline-pumped and pumped to the right point at all times. Everything under control Another commendable aspect is the response of the pad, always prompt and precise even in the slightest corrections. There is no denying that the Dual Shock has been exploited to the maximum: through the vibrations, you will feel the accelerations and the impact with all the obstacles you will encounter, even the smallest unevenness of the road surface, so much so that at times you will seem to be actually riding the bike. Concluding Unfortunately all that glitters is not gold, in fact it is true that Freekstyle is an excellent title, well made and very fun, however it could be a bit too demanding for beginners, and nothing new for those who have already played SSX Tricky and Sled Storm. Other than that don't think you're dealing with a realistic motocross simulation, Freekstyle is anything but: everything in the game has been pushed beyond the limits of what's possible, making it a very arcade title, where exaggeration and spectacularity replace reality. Pros: Excellent control system Adrenaline-pumping Spectacular tracks Cons: Sometimes too difficult Not very innovative compared to similar titles already released Pure fun Have you ever thought about doing a handstand or standing on a motorcycle that jumps through a flaming circle?! By playing Freekstyle you can do this and much more. EA BIG, already famous for many titles including the beautiful SSX Tricky, presents us with its new motocross game, but not the usual simulator, but a very special game, focused above all on the spectacularity of the many stunts that you can do in saddled with 500 horsepower racing cars. The aim of the game is not only to be fast, but to perform the craziest evolutions, obtaining as a reward, extra points based on the difficulty of the stunt performed. Believe me, the stunts available to the various characters are really many, and they will guarantee you hours and hours of spectacular racing.", "date": "2002-10-22", "grade": null}
