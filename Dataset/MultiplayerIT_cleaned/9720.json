{"name": "BIT.TRIP BEAT", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81423-bittrip-beat-pong-incontra-arkanoid.html", "text": "As demonstrated by the brilliant Tetsuya Mizuguchi with Rez and the promising Child of Eden, there is a successful action subgenre that builds its foundations on the mixture of images and music. These are not simple rhythm games, but ~experiences~ that often recall the concept of psychedelia and almost always have in common the presence of an empty space, within which the player finds himself interacting with colored elements and sounds electronic. It only takes a few seconds to understand that BIT.TRIP BEAT belongs precisely to this vein: black background, often ~acid~ colors, beats that hammer us and characterize our interaction with the pixels that we have the task of repeating. Halfway between Pong and Arkanoid, in the title developed by Gaijin Games we control a simple colored bar which, along four different paths, must repeat the squares that ~fall~ from the right of the screen. Most of them bounce and disappear, others are tougher and require several impacts to be eliminated, still others arrive in tight groups that change their trajectory as they scroll, up to the bosses (yes) who literally ~dismember~ during your attack routines. Each impact between our bar and the pixels reproduces a sound perfectly in rhythm with the music, a bit like what happened in the excellent Space Invaders Extreme for Nintendo DS, restoring the idea of a ~link~ between the various elements that make up the gaming experience. Beat and beat again To give a silly example, playing with BIT.TRIP BEAT is a bit like playing a game of Pong without an opponent: the ~balls~ arrive and we have to try to push them all away, also because each missed beat costs us some ~energy~. ~ and it can make us fall into a monochromatic abyss from which it is only possible to get out with a lot of concentration, under penalty of game over. As mentioned above, there are four scenarios included in the basic version, and as many can be purchased through an in-game download system. They are not all available right away, you have to unlock them gradually and they boast an increasing degree of difficulty: in the first one you are faced with relatively simple sequences, which only become more complex towards the end and also require an effort of memory; from the second onwards there is a series of evolutions as spectacular as they are difficult to manage, which in fact promote the classic ~trial & error~ given that the structure of the events remains the same and is not randomized between one game and another. The default control system sees us move the bar using the iPhone's accelerometer, and therefore tilt the device according to our needs. It is certainly an intuitive solution, but it is not reliable enough in more advanced stages. In such situations it is in fact the case to go to the options screen and select the manual controls, which work simply by moving a finger on the touch screen (the right thumb, for example) and which therefore lend themselves to faster and more precise manoeuvres. The game features both local and online multiplayer, and integrates Apple's Game Center for managing games and friends. Unfortunately, during the test days we never managed to find a single challenger, which seemed really strange to us. If it's a bug in the current version, however, it will likely be fixed quickly via an update. Moving on to the purely technical issue, it is clear that a product like BIT.TRIP BEAT doesn't rely on polygons and spectacular sequences to hit the player, but rather on solutions based exclusively on style, on the contrast between colors and on a specific artistic direction. We can say that the final result is really pleasant both to see and to hear, even if the sound sector is relatively ~poor~ compared to expectations.
