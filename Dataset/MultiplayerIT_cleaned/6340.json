The first playable build was released more than two years ago now and, let's face it, it was a decent hodgepodge of ideas related to mechanics and an interface that are still to be defined. If you have already read the vote at the bottom of the page you will understand for yourself why Klei's latest effort is also the perfect example of development carried out in collaboration with the community that went the right way, with a conclusion comparable to the ~they all lived happily ever after ~ of fairy tales. Yet the departure of this stealth turn-based strategy with procedurally generated levels was, so to speak, discreet. The developer was busy simultaneously on other fronts (Don't Starve) and in the stealth genre he had already had his say with the Shanks first and then with that gem of Mark of the Ninja. What space could there be for a product so pleasant compared to the others? Instead, here we are once again applauding the work of this small giant of the independent scene, capable of renewing itself with each production, without however renouncing to keep an eye on the market. Klei always seems to be able to take the right step, never going beyond her possibilities, without giving up the highest possible quality. Klei returns to the field with the stealth Invisible, Inc.: find out in our review Invisible Agency Invisible, Inc. begins with an attack on the Invisible secret agents' headquarters. The agency boss manages to escape by saving part of the artificial intelligence, called Incognita, used to monitor the espionage activities of the entire planet. Left with very few resources, the Invisible must now be able to recover ground and stop those who attacked them within seventy-two hours, infiltrating corporations on all continents in search of information and resources. More details of the plot will be discovered as you play, but don't really expect much more. Above all, don't expect the narrative to be the core of the gameplay because it isn't. Basically it's just a pretext around which a game system has been built designed to simulate espionage actions that evolve with the accumulation of experience in the field, in pure Roguelike style. Invisible, Inc.'s missions all have the same structure: the briefing illustrates the primary objective to be pursued, which can be the release of a colleague, the violation of a secret server in search of information, the neural scan of an executive , the recovery of advanced technologies and so on. Alongside the primary objectives there may be secondary ones, often linked to the resources hidden in the attacked places. Finally, once homework is done, all that remains is to look for the elevator and go back to the helicopter that will take us to the next mission. Obviously the whole game is involved between saying and doing. Spies like us As we said, the levels of Invisible, Inc. are procedurally generated, so they are always different and never repeat. The player must learn to exploit the agents at his disposal, managing their abilities on a turn-by-turn basis. But let's try to describe a typical game sequence: we find ourselves in front of the prison door where one of our colleagues is being held. We look through the keyhole to realize how part of the room is formed. We note the presence of a camera and a guard. From Incognita we tamper with the camera by spending one energy point on the hack. One danger is settled, but the other still remains. Before proceeding we decide to have a clearer picture of the situation. We place two agents at the edges of the door. We're about to open it and the noise might attract the guard. Said and done: not only did we attract attention, but we also revealed the presence of a second man. In the next round both will come to verify our position. Don't panic: we select the ambush option for both agents and end the shift. The alarm level of the structure rises. The meter isn't full yet, so we don't suffer unwanted effects, such as the activation of cameras that were previously turned off or the reboot of hacked systems. However we must hurry. The guards arrive. The two agents take turns grabbing and stunning them as ordered. We have three shifts before they recover. If we want, we can kill them since we obtained guns in the previous missions, but at the price of increasing the alarm level and losing Incognita energy points. Better to leave it alone and act cleanly. The way is clear, but instead of sending both agents to rescue the colleague we decide to have one of them take turns immobilizing the unconscious enemies so as to have more time.Freed the agent, which we can use for the rest of the mission, and from now on in all subsequent ones, it's time to escape. We leave the unconscious guards where they are and head to the previously discovered elevator room. Increasing the alarm level brings new enemies to the floor. A little bad. Somehow we will manage. In case we don't manage, depending on the type and level of challenge selected at the beginning of the campaign, we will be able to either retry the mission by generating a new map, or rewind the current map starting from the beginning, or accept our fate and see fail countryside. In the latter case, the game would assign us the experience points appropriate to our businesses, with related related resources. Like any self-respecting roguelike, the experience gained is not lost after death, but is carried over to the next game, in order to increase the player's chances of success. Friendly interface We hope that it has been understood that Invisible, Inc. is a much larger game than it might seem at first glance, with many facets to consider. Unlocking new team members, new technologies for Incognita, and new tools for spies opens up a whole host of possibilities that make every playthrough unique. You soon discover that there are many different approaches to completing the missions, which become more or less complicated depending on the choices you make and what you want to achieve. In this, the game interface is the player's most precious ally, in its perfection and cleanliness that makes every move natural and clear. In part it reminded us of Firaxis' XCOM, whose lesson no turn-based strategy should ever forget. The actions are contextual and linked to the objects: when it is possible to do something, rest assured that the appropriate icon will appear above it. To say: we have hardly encountered a title with such a level of gameplay complexity, but with such a short and complete tutorial, which is enriched by some in-game explanations during the first missions, an indication of great refinement in the execution of the basics. Such a result was only possible thanks to the careful study of every detail, with the controls built around the user's perception, so as to immediately establish a direct relationship between what happens on the screen and what is actually done. The gameplay is so fluid that you end up forgetting that you are dealing with a turn-based game system and not in real time. A large part of the praised company is also due to the demonstrated technical knowledge of the development team. Invisible, Inc. does not put gaming systems under pressure, but it is no less accurate than a triple A from a technical point of view. Graphically we note the extreme cleanliness of each object, necessary to not make the reading of the maps heavier. The minimalist style, with the typical cartoon traits of Klei's productions, still offers excellent visual cues, with the characters featuring a large number of animations and the graphic elements that change according to the type of display. An excellent work, also in this case, enriched by a genre soundtrack that accompanies the games without ever becoming annoyingly present, as if it were an elaborate form of silence.", "date": "2015-05-14", "grade": "9.2"}
