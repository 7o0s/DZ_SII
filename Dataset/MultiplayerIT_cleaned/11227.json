{"name": "Defend your Castle - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/defend-your-castle-recensione.html", "text": "Having ascertained that the WiiWare service is, in large part, intended for re-editions of flash games already available on the internet, often free of charge, we can conveniently begin to evaluate how much these Wii versions are improved compared to the originals, and how much the developers they intend to make money on it. This seems to be a decidedly more productive approach than simply complaining about the average quality level, and making comparisons with competing digital delivery services. It may seem like a sort of renunciation, in truth it is a simple awareness which, once achieved, determines a more serene and fair evaluation of the offer present on the Wii channel. This Defend Your Castle, for example, is a modified version of a flash game that can be played for free via the web browser, developed by XGen Studios themselves. However, it should be noted that this version is decidedly more refined than the original, offered at a fair price and how it fits into what appears to be the backbone of the WiiWare offer: providing immediate and simple entertainment for one or more players. In essence, it is a question of having to defend a castle. The whole game is based on a single screen that shows a stylized landscape, with our castle on the right and a variable number of more or less armed attackers arriving from the left side. The aim is to eliminate these invaders before they reach the castle and reduce its defenses until the bar above is exhausted, and to do this we are offered various methods, which can be improved in quantity and quality by spending the points collected during each level. The main method of eliminating the annoying little men is to grab them with the pointer (controllable via the Wii Remote of course) and throw them into the air with enough force to crash them to the ground. Violence and pastel colors There are a number of variations on the theme that add some depth to the gameplay: the accumulated points can be spent on upgrades, which allow the use of various defense systems. The first of these, the one that actually paves the way for all the others, is the ~pit of conversion~, or a bucket of blue paint in which it is possible to throw enemies, to transform them into our subordinates. By creating our own army, it is possible to use it in various tasks, which can be unlocked precisely with the purchase of the various functions: we will therefore be able to deploy archers, magicians, bomb men and workers involved in the reconstruction of the castle walls. By increasing the amount of men working on each of these tasks (symbolized by flags placed on the four towers of the castle), their effectiveness is consequently increased. In truth, even with all these active expansions, little changes in the action: it is still a question of continuing to grab the enemies and throw them away with violence, in increasingly agitated situations. The invaders will increase from level to level, increasingly armed and faster, and once you get to buying all the upgrades (around level 15, more or less), you already reach a certain monotony of the action in which the only variations they consist of the concentration of forces on the towers and the purchase of additional fortifications for the walls, as well as of course an increasingly faster movement of the wrist. The original version of the game was a feast of blood, this one for Wii has been heavily sweetened, but achieving a rather strange result: the general appearance is stylized in a deliberately childish way (paper clouds held up by strings, square castle and ~little men~ composed exclusively of lines, sun smiling in the background), with a pleasant naive effect. However, the violent charge underlying the game remains intact, therefore one has the impression of being faced with a sort of deviated and violent childish fantasy. There is also a ~drop-in drop-out~ multiplayer mode, in which as many cursors simply appear as there are players. Virtually nothing changes in the game structure, except for the presence of individual point counters for each user. Comment Never as in these cases is it necessary to evaluate the game in its context in order to be able to judge it. The unsettling simplicity of the concept and the fundamental monotony of the action can leave those who expect something more than a simple electronic pastime dumbfounded. But that's what it is, after all, and luckily this time also included in an acceptable price range (500 Wii Points) and with some infused work to modify this version compared to the original flash. It is true that in a few minutes the game shows everything it has to offer, but the underlying simplicity, the gentle curve of difficultyolty and the same ~pastel~ appearance hide an unexpected habituation power, hampered perhaps more by the onset of pain in the wrist caused by the exhausting repetition of the same movement than by boredom. Recommended for those looking for a simple thought-busting and for those who obviously appreciate the corresponding web browser game.Pros Simple and immediate Low cost Presence of multiplayer Cons Fundamentally monotonous action Danger of wrist pain Lacking tactical depth and depth", "date": "2008-09-02", "grade": null}
