The funny character with a monitor instead of his head was in fact exploring various scenarios in search of objects to move by pushing or dragging them, devices to activate and so on, with a view to a structure devoted to replayability and enhancement of each single level , which had to be completed the first time in a ~normal~ way and then with attention to hidden bonuses and speed, so as to obtain the amount of stars that at a certain point was necessary to unlock the more advanced stages. The excellent technical realization and some exciting ~two and a half dimensions~ phases further enriched the experience, which in its speed implications undoubtedly gave a nod to the classic chapters of Sonic the Hedgehog. Over a year and a half later, here we are reviewing the sequel, Cordy 2, available on the App Store and Google Play with a ~demo~ version, downloadable for free, which allows us to try the first four levels and then, if necessary, proceed to unlock of the complete product (which contains thirty levels, plus some bonuses) at the price of 4.49 euros. An above average figure for mobile games, but in this case more than deserved, given that we are dealing with one of the best (if not the best) ~pure~ platformer for iOS and Android terminals, bearing in mind that the hilarious Rayman Jungle Run addresses the issue from the point of view of endless runs. All more In making Cordy 2, the developers didn't limit themselves to simply reproposing the elements of the first episode, but they substantially enriched the gameplay, first of all adding a set of enemies (to be eliminated in the most traditional way possible: jumping on their heads) divided in various types, each characterized by different behavioral routines; secondly, a series of devices to which the character can connect to obtain special abilities to use within the levels. Depending on the device, Cordy can in fact adhere to walls, emit waves capable of breaking stone blocks, fly with a jetpack or a helicopter (in the latter case within Jetpack Joyride-style stages). The ability to transform into an electrical impulse and dart very quickly from one point to another in the scenario has remained, along with the comfortable ~snap~ and the leash with which to swing when you come across certain electronic pins. However, we worked on the level design in a clear and decisive way, dedicating the right space now to environmental puzzles, now to the more classic platform phases, now to Sonic-style racing complete with loops of the loop, also implementing the boss fights at the end of each area. And speaking of zones, Cordy's cubic planet is surrounded by three moons that form the backdrop to this new adventure, each with a different ~theme~. First of all we have the ~Carnival City~, with its festive atmosphere, technological style, enclosed spaces and trampolines at every corner; then there is ~Porto Armonia~, with its lush greenery, waterways in which to discover new secrets and a background that winks at oriental settings; and finally the ~Factory of Heaven~, a huge metal structure suspended in the air. The concepts related to the replayability of the first chapter are back in a big way in this sequel and once again enhance the locations, which you really need to dissect to get all the stars and unlock the advanced stages. Or you can rely on the bonus levels, small and delicious puzzles that complete us within a couple of minutes and that give us that extra star we needed to get to the end. The work done by SilverTree Media is also excellent as regards the technical sector, thanks to a more refined graphic style, choices of great taste and a truly successful mix of characters and settings. The only sore point: the sound accompaniment. Not because the music is mediocre, on the contrary several songs are really nice and pleasant to listen to, but often they are too short and therefore they stop and start again abruptly in the middle of the action.", "date": "2013-02-22", "grade": "8.9"}
