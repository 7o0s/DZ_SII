{"name": "Grim Fandango Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/144283-grim-fandango-remastered-ritorno-a-rubacava.html", "text": "When Sony's Adam Boyes took to the stage at the Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles last summer to announce Grim Fandango Remastered, the audience around us erupted in a roar of applause and cheers, equalized just an hour later with the finale at surprise of Uncharted 4. In a conference dominated by high-sounding names like FarCry 4, Bloodborne and Mortal Kombat X, so much enthusiasm for a re-release of an old-school graphic adventure could seem excessive. Yet Grim Fandango is not just any adventure, and the one born from the collaboration between Double Fine and Sony is not a simple Remastered published to grind easy money. The story of Manny Calavera is not limited to dealing with the theme of death with humor and a noir atmosphere, but is completely immersed in it. Swan song by LucasArts, the first project to scrap the SCUMM engine and requiem of old-fashioned adventures, Grim Fandango was for years a cult that was difficult to recover and play due to distribution and compatibility problems with the most recent operating systems, making it usable only by resorting to abstruse alternative channels set up by fans. This explains the warm welcome of the Remastered: not only is one of the most popular and fascinating adventures ever available again, but it does so thanks to the work of its original author. For years Tim Schafer has wanted to bring his magnum opus back to the land of the living, and no one better than him would have been able to do it by staying true to the original vision and reuniting the old gang like the Blues Brothers. It took 17 years for the return of Grim Fandango, one of the best graphic adventures ever Love is for the living A game may age aesthetically over the years, but the story it tells remains set in stone. It is no coincidence that Grim Fandango is remembered for a cocktail of hilarious characters, mafia plots and a love plot in noir sauce that borrowed heavily from Mexican folklore and films like The Big Sleep and Casablanca. All told using a metaphor of passing and the afterlife that led Manny Calavera, travel agent for deceased people, to face an epic through the Land of the Dead along a four-year narrative arc. And from the very first introductory scene, everything is in its place. There are dialogues that alternate gags and comic double meanings with much more refined jokes, written in a period in which Schafer himself preferred less conventional scripts. From Rubacava to El Midollo, from the Petrified Forest to Puerto Zapato, a break at the Calavera Caf and then straight towards the End of the World. During the journey they meet crazy individuals like the revolutionary Salvador Limones or that infamous Domino; and then there is Glottis. Oh Glottis. It is immediately evident how Grim Fandango does not feel the weight of the years like other 3D games, thanks to pre-rendered backdrops and characters represented in the form of ~calacas~, the typical Mexican dolls that decorate the Da de Muertos. For this Remastered, Double Fine still wanted to rejuvenate the game by inserting high resolution models and completely redesigned textures. An almost archaeological restoration work that led the Californian team to recover and reconstruct the old materials from the dusty archives owned by LucasArts and its former employees. Added to this is a dynamic lighting system which, if to someone it may seem like an easy attempt at exhibitionism, actually enriches the charm of the game even more. The lit cigarette that revives Manny's bust, or the half-closed shutter that creates plays of shadows on his skull, are small touches of class that, however, emphasize the noir atmosphere of the story. On the other hand, the backdrops remain unchanged compared to the past, but before accusing Double Fine of a sloppy and disengaged job, we must consider that not all the graphic materials have been successfully recovered from the Lucas archives, and that, above all, recreating each environment from scratch 3D would have required a considerable effort, probably not within the team's reach and certainly crazy enough for a Remastered of an adventure that sensationally ~flopped~ in its debut. The smartest compromise was precisely to leave the old backdrops, which are not only perfectly up to the new character models, but overall allow for a result closer to the original title. However, the limitation that this entails is obvious: the option to view the game in 16:9, although present, does nothing but cut and stretch the image, with the result that we find ourselves walking through the El Midollo square as a greased and squashed Manny Calavera. With the pWith the press of a key, you can switch between the original and the remastered graphics at any time, but unlike the drastic restyling seen in Monkey Island: Special Edition, in this case the look remains so consistent and faithful to the original material, that even the most fans traditionalists will prefer to play the modernized version. Playstation 4 trophies Despite being a fairly linear graphic adventure, Grim Fandango Remastered goes down hard as regards the list of unlockable Trophies. There are 48 of them, and most of them require you to activate specific lines in dialogue with other characters or in Manny's monologues. For Platinum, however, it will be necessary to play the entire adventure with the old tank controls: apparently a Trophy strongly desired by Tim Schafer himself. To the Ninth Afterlife Double Fine's remastering work was not limited only to the aesthetic aspect. In fact, it is enough to stop for a moment and strain your ears, perhaps while having a drink at the Blue Casket or watching the Mar dei Lamenti overlooking the balcony of the Calavera Caf. All the principal scores have been given a polish thanks to the return of the original composer, Peter McConnell, and the work of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. An eclectic blend of genres mixing jazz, swing, bebop and flamenco, with a jubilation of violins, cellos, clarinets, saxophones and trombones to recreate one of the most distinctive soundtracks ever heard in a game. It is a pity that each song cannot be listened to individually even outside the adventure, an option that would have embellished the extra contents composed of the original concept art (many of which have never been published before) and, above all, the two hours of audio commentary of the developers. Seventeen years later, Schafer has in fact brought together several key people who worked on the project to invite them to tell interesting anecdotes, curiosities, outbursts and sources of inspiration screen after screen. An indisputable ~selling point~ for old fans looking for an excuse to dress Manny's bones once again. The opportunity to re-propose Grim Fandango today has allowed Double Fine to also review what has been one of the most criticized and worst-aged aspects of the game. The ~tank~ control system (to give you an idea think of the first Resident Evil or the original Tomb Raider) had annoyed fans of the old point and click games, who found a much more intuitive solution in the SCUMM interface. ~At the time the intention was to eliminate any type of interface and make the player feel not outside the game,~ says Schafer in the audio comments, ~but completely immersed in it. In the middle of the level~. Motivations aside, Grim Fandango Remastered satisfies everyone by adding the possibility of using the mouse or using more comfortable directional controls via pad, while on PlayStation Vita you can also interact via touch screen. At a time when people have more and more games to choose from and less and less time available, the only real shortcoming that can be attributed to the work of the development team is the failure to introduce a hint system. Indeed, Grim Fandango belongs to an era in which graphic adventures mocked the player, the puzzles were intricate, the combinations of imaginative objects and the rubber chickens had a pulley in the middle. In some cases, solving an enigma is so intricate that hours can be lost trying, and a help system, perhaps with several levels of depth as it was for Monkey Island: Special Edition, would have allowed anyone to enjoy the story without getting stuck.
