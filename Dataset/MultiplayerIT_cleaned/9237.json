For a few months it was feared that Nintendo did not want to release the latest remake of Dragon Quest for the Nintendo DS in the West, then like a bolt from the blue the beginning of 2011 brought the news that many fans were waiting for: Dragon Quest VI would arrive also in Europe and America, for the first time ever. The original version for SNES dates back to 1995 and has never enjoyed any official adaptation: for fifteen years Western gamers had to do without a real milestone of its kind, until Square Enix started, now several years ago, the revised and corrected versions of the central ~trilogy~ in the saga. Thanks to this operation, we Europeans too were able to enjoy the remakes of Dragon Quest IV and Dragon Quest V and with this last chapter the circle begun on the Nintendo DS comes full circle: the main saga says goodbye to the handheld Nintendo, which also hosted the most recent episode, Dragon Quest IX: The Sentinels of the Sky, with a crucial chapter that has heavily influenced the JRPG production of the last five decades. But will this sixth Dragon Quest have aged well? I dream or am awake Despite the numeric suffix, Dragon Quest VI: Realm of Dreams is effectively a prequel to the entire trilogy also composed of Dragon Quest IV: Chronicles of the Chosen and Dragon Quest V: Bride of Destiny. For those who have played the previous episodes, the reason will appear increasingly obvious as you approach the final stages, in order not to spoil the surprise for newbies, it is enough to say that the new protagonist is not destined to remain a simple lumberjack forever and that the A truly legendary fate awaits. Already in the first minutes of the game we are introduced to his epic mission: to find the means necessary to destroy the evil sorcerer Lacertow. To do so, the Hero of this Dragon Quest will have to travel between two parallel worlds, gathering a group of valiant companions. Unlike the other episodes of the saga, often characterized by only superficially outlined supporting actors, Dragon Quest VI: In the Kingdom of Dreams offers a much more incisive and captivating cast. We are still far from the multifaceted and at times exaggerated storytelling of the most modern JRPGs, however the characters who will accompany the Hero are multifaceted and motivated by personal problems that enrich the plot. The latter is proposed in the perfect style of Dragon Quest, it is an adventure with distinctly fantasy themes and settings that develops between castles, caves and lost ruins. Unlike the previous Dragon Quests, this sixth episode has a greater goliardic vein that lightens a decidedly epic general atmosphere that sometimes manages to take itself too seriously. In general, one has the feeling of playing a much more modern JRPG than the two prequels / sequels of the so-called ~Zenith trilogy~, however the story suffers from the idea of parallel worlds, perhaps not really developed properly. This concept would later be taken up and elaborated on by games like Chrono Trigger but here it appears a bit sketchy and less incisive, with a plot that connects the two worlds through episodic adventures unrelated to each other. The feeling you get is that of a somewhat trivial story that tends to go on too long, relying on the excellent cast and some truly brilliant dialogues. Translation The translation of texts in an RPG is a very delicate matter and in this case it deserves a separate discussion: the original Japanese script of the game is full of puns and dialogues that are difficult to adapt to our language without losing meaning. For this reason, the translators have opted for an adaptation reminiscent of Final Fantasy IX and the more recent Dragon Quest IX, but even more daring. Therefore, in the villages we speak in various dialects of our peninsula and there is no shortage of pop culture references, from soaps to VIPs through characters who speak like Yoda. The result may leave purists a bit perplexed but for those who don't speak English it is certainly an enjoyable translation that elicits more than a smile. Past present Dragon Quest VI had the not inconsiderable merit, in 1995, of projecting the Enix saga into the modern era of JRPGs, shaking off some decidedly outdated mechanics and limitations that afflicted the series already at those times and which today would be more annoying than traditional. In its incarnation for Nintendo DS, the developers of ArtePiazza have further refined the interface to modernize it just enough to make the game more user-friendly without distorting its fundamental classicism. The common purse aunlimited capacity, represented by a horse pulling a cart, is just one example of these improvements that make the experience more enjoyable than in the past. The dual screen of the Nintendo DS also allows you to constantly view the map of the world you are in or of the cities you are visiting, a very convenient feature that makes exploring the more intricate locations decidedly less frustrating, especially if we consider the presence of traditional random fights. The entire menu structure now appears more comfortable despite its extreme essentiality. Dragon Quest VI: In the Realm of Dreams does not deviate particularly from the structure of the previous episodes, proposing the canonical first-person battles that show only the spectacular and well-kept animations of the enemies but never the sprites of our party. It is a stylistic choice that will have to be reckoned with up to Dragon Quest VIII (PlayStation 2) but in the context it works well and the fights appear decidedly faster than in the previous Dragon Quest V. The real step forward, however, lies in the system of Vocations which returns for the first time after Dragon Quest III mimicking the one developed by Square for Final Fantasy V. Once again, past and present mix, but in this case we are faced with a system that recalls that of Dragon Quest IX, but a little rougher. The Mutationis Abbey allows us to change the vocation of our characters, allowing them to learn new spells and skills, improving various statistics. By fighting a certain number of battles, each class can be upgraded, and certain combinations unlock more powerful advanced vocations. The system allows for good customization of the party but the feeling is that of a prototype: it is impossible to evolve and know all the vocations without fighting literally thousands of battles for their own sake. Considering that it is not however necessary to undertake every vocation with every character (making the strongman Carver a wizard is at least a questionable choice!) to complete the game in its entirety, these limitations leave a bitter taste in the mouth helping to underline the conflict between past and present that is this episode of Dragon Quest.", "date": "2011-06-16", "grade": "8.0"}
