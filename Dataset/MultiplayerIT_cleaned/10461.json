The 2010 edition of this popular football franchise that has returned to the public again this year in all sauces and platforms rather full of novelties and gameplay improvements, also arrives in stores on PlayStation Portable in an attempt to become the product of reference football. Of course, as we will see the new episode of the series, FIFA 10, does not revolutionize most of the aspects of the product too much since the game is stylistically close to that of the past year for settings and controls, but the latter appear improved under several wait. Let's see how. Even in this portable edition, the EA title can count on a large number of championships to play and teams to select, 350 of which are totally covered by official licenses (real logos, jerseys, etc.). Among these, the one concerning the Dutch national football team also stands out, which in recent years was missing. As always, there are various modes in which to try your hand and ranging from the classic exhibition match to official or customized championships and cups, passing through the one in which it is possible to be the manager of your favorite club or the professional one, as well as a mode for multiplayer both via Wi-Fi and online which will be discussed later. All on the field Just the game options related to coaching or player careers are in our opinion the most interesting ever of the EA title. The way in which it is possible to play entire seasons in the role of an ~English~ coach, i.e. who also manages the finances and transfer market of a club, has been improved significantly and therefore made more complete. Obviously we are not at the level of a Player Manager and God forbid seeing that FIFA 10 remains a football simulator played and not a management one, but what is certain is that the new features introduced on PSP by the developers such as the figure of the Scout who finds new talents around for the world or makes accurate pre-race reports, the possibility of planning and carrying out a project even in the long term with a team in at least fifteen years of career or greater economic resources to have a budget with more funds are not bad. Ditto the Professional mode which this year adds to the many possibilities offered to the user to ~live~ almost a sort of parallel life on and off the field like a true modern athlete also that of playing international matches linked to qualifications and participation in the World Cup of 2010 in South Africa. But beyond everything, it is once you take the field and start playing that you notice the most interesting changes. The gameplay is more reasoned, there is immediately a greater control over the players by the player, on the actions in general, on the passes and on the shots compared to the previous episode. The latter are more immediate and less cumbersome to perform thanks to a greater responsiveness to the commands of the virtual athletes and an improvement in the physics of the game both in the physical contrasts and in the movement of the ball, which now seems heavier. The collision detection and ball defense system already admired in the 2009 edition especially on other platforms and which in our opinion represented the greatest innovation of the FIFA series compared to the past is here taken up and adapted to the PSP hardware with results more than appreciable. New tactics, schemes, styles of play and an unprecedented level of difficulty for the best players complete the picture. Multiplayer and technical realization The other modes present are the one in which you have to face particular scenarios and a series of challenges such as overturning the result of a game or scoring a hat-trick, etc., the one relating to a sort of Quiz game, the training one and the multiplayer one both online and wireless. One of the peculiarities most appreciated by every lover of the sports genre remains in fact that linked to the possibility of playing against friends and acquaintances in addition to the usual CPU. And FIFA 10 is no different. The PSP version of the EA product allows users of this console to challenge each other both on Wi-Fi and online in thrilling matches to the last breath. Unfortunately, however, in the latter case the experience is sometimes made rather frustrating by an unstable service during the connection phase, even if for the sake of correctness of information it must be said that I do not knowLet's be sure if it was random and only when we tried to play several times or if it's a negative feature of the product. In conclusion, let's take a look at the technical sector. The graphics in FIFA 10 are beautifully crafted for the Sony portable console. The players are represented quite well, at least the most famous ones resemble their real counterparts, while the less important ones have the classic generic faces which, however, combined with the right look, allow the specific athlete they represent to be visually identified on the pitch. It is also possible to build the virtual athletes yourself using the internal editor. The jerseys are highly detailed and include badges, names and sponsors. Overall, the engine does its job well and everything, from the stadiums to the turf, almost gives the idea of a real football match. As far as audio is concerned, the product confirms the positive notes just mentioned for the graphics sector. The game effects during the matches are well done considering the hardware available to the developers and the commentary, although not complete and continuous like the counterpart on PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, is all in all pleasant. As per tradition for this series in recent years on all the platforms on which it has seen the light, FIFA 10 can also count on a respectable soundtrack composed of many switchable sound tracks. The list of songs and authors is long and includes different musical genres suitable for all tastes.", "date": "2009-10-16", "grade": "8.8"}
