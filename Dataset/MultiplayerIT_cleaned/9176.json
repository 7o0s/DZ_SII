Almost two years later, the guys at Capybara Games found themselves having to transform their little gem into downloadable software for PlayStation 3 and Xbox: a port that was not easy, moreover, especially due to the nature of the game which is drastically different from with the typical characteristics of the franchise. We can safely say that this edition, rather than a port, is a real remake and whoever hasn't had the chance to try the portable version of this bizarre but surprising minestrone of ideas can finally fill this gap. Provided you have a lot, a lot of patience. The Chronicles of Ashan The point of contact between Clash of Heroes and the Might & Magic series is mainly one, namely the setting: the game takes place in fact in the land of Ashan, forty years before the events told in Heroes of Might & Magic V for PC. After that, even the narration is decidedly detached from the traditional style of the saga: in this case, in fact, an extremely cartoonish and colorful character design has been adopted to tell the typical swashbuckling fantasy story in which a small group of young heroes from different regions finds himself forced to collaborate, discovering the value of friendship in a desperate battle against the forces of evil. In short, it is the typical plot of a television cartoon and in fact dialogues and situations reflect a different target, not necessarily childish but certainly less niche. However, the story is a somewhat trivial pretext for linking the countless battles that make up the heart of the game. The mechanics are quite complex but basically the player controls a small group of soldiers or supernatural creatures, deployed on the lower side of the screen. Above it are the enemies: taking advantage of the limited number of actions available per turn, the player must position his units respecting a series of basic rules which, combined with each other, allow for effective defensive or offensive strategies. By horizontally aligning three similar units, for example, it is possible to create a sort of defensive barrier while three vertically aligned units will attack the enemy during the following turn: the latter is represented by the edge of the screen defended by enemy troops and the player's aim is to directing the attacks of his units so that they hit that edge, eliminating enemies in the path or piercing their defenses, simultaneously defending his own lower edge of the screen and, by extension, his life energy. In reality, this brief explanation does not give an idea of the complexity of the gameplay which is soon enriched with innumerable gimmicks and options: for example, in addition to additional units equipped with special abilities, players can also deploy ~champions~, which can be equipped with particular accessories and capable of launching very powerful attacks, as devastating as they are complicated to trigger and score. Playstation 3 trophies Inevitable a fair amount of Trophies: seven Bronze Trophies, four Silver Trophies and a Gold Trophy. Conquering them all will not be easy: some are quite simple and require you to win a battle online or during the Campaign, others will be unlocked by performing complex strategies during battles and to get your hands on the Gold Trophy you will have to complete every mission in the game. Rich dish The complexity of Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is really satisfying but from it arises a problem that is perhaps the only real flaw of the game: it's really very difficult. From the very first battles one realizes that knowing the basic rules of combat is one thing but putting them into practice by combining them to take down the toughest enemies is definitely another matter. The game kind of tries to whet the strategist in us and the colorful screens make it a little more enjoyable to repeat the same mission for the umpteenth time, however some battles prove to be downright frustrating and require enormous planning worthy of a real strategy game: this is especially the case with optional missions that require you to win certain battles under truly superhuman conditions. Luckily Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is a graphic gem that lightens upmoments of tiredness thanks to the extreme care reserved by Capybara Games in the creation of a completely redesigned high resolution graphic design: the sprites are very rich in animations and details and above all the advanced missions turn out to be small fireworks displays of explosions and magic. We're not talking about latest generation graphics of course, but the cosmetics of Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is functional and very pleasant. It is not the only novelty of this edition, however: leaving aside the units, spells and objects added compared to the Nintendo DS version, this port has an online and local multiplayer mode. It is indeed a somewhat weak and not very thorough feature, stingy with options that distinguish it from a hastily added mode, welcome but completely superfluous.", "date": "2011-07-13", "grade": "8.0"}
