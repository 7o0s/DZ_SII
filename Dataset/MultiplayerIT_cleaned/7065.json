{"name": "L'epico augello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/133457-angry-birds-epic-lepico-augello.html", "text": "That the Angry Birds franchise has achieved extraordinary popularity is a fact: the over two billion downloads totaled by the original episode and its various sequels ratify a success that had never been seen on mobile platforms, and which gave the la to a whole series of collateral productions, from merchandising to spin-offs. The last on the list is precisely Angry Birds Epic, a tactical RPG developed for the occasion by Chimera Entertainment, which catapults us into the wonderful and dangerous Piggy Island, a scenario dominated by green pigs who have stolen the eggs of the ben known birds, making them quite angry and giving rise to a furious chase that culminates in a spectacular sequence of turn-based combat. So the gameplay changes compared to the Angry Birds that we all know, just as the context changes, this time linked to the canons of medieval fantasy and therefore a harbinger of a themed reinterpretation of the various characters, which has already happened for Angry Birds Star Wars. And so the red bird Red becomes a knight without blemish, his friend Chuck a skilled wizard, the hen Matilda a healing priestess, Bomb a powerful pirate and the little brothers Jay, Jake and Jim of cunning thieves. Five classes that acquire additional skills during the adventure, in the form of ~professions~ that can be selected before each mission and which have an undoubted tactical value compared to the opponents you have to face. Similarly, in Angry Birds Epic the leveling of each character and his equipment are the result of experience gained and looting respectively, with a certain number of items that can be collected at the end of each fight (using a ~wheel of fortune ~ with random implications) and which are then used for the crafting of weapons, armor and talismans. Despite its simplicity, Angry Birds Epic boasts a discreet tactical thickness and a solid structure Rovio birds The one made by Chimera Entertainment is not a ~real~ RPG, since it focuses only on turn-based combat and does not include elements such as exploration and interaction in the mix, but nevertheless it boasts a rich and multifaceted structure, which hides a good number of tactical substrates. Of course, this aspect takes shape gradually, with a series of rather trivial initial fights, put there for the pure purpose of familiarizing yourself with the simple touch controls implemented for the occasion. An interface that sees us dragging the selection from one of our characters to the target of the turn to carry out the attack, towards a companion to give him an extra ability or with a single tap to enable a power on oneself. At the bottom of the screen, a pepper-shaped indicator fills up as the hits are landed and, once full, allows us to unleash a different super move depending on the bird that executes it: a deadly blow, an explosion involving all hostile units, and more. During the more advanced missions, the selection of party members becomes fundamental (they can't be more than three, so someone will have to stay out), as well as the exploitation of every single advantage, especially when facing particularly strong bosses. Unfortunately at the same time the freemium nature of Angry Birds Epic appears clear, which after the sixth level of experience makes us bump into the much feared ~paywall~ and therefore requires a certain amount of grinding or some in-app purchases to be able to continue in the 'adventure. On the other hand, the lack of the traditional ~action energy~ avoids the limitations that often afflict free titles on the App Store and Google Play, allowing us to play for as long as we want and without having to wait. The synthesis of these two aspects, tendentially positive even if not of extraordinary impact, goes well with a technical sector of excellent workmanship, fairly varied in the scenarios and able to exploit characters that we know well in a different field, providing them with cartoon-style animations and accompanying their deeds with a pleasant and fitting soundtrack.", "date": "2014-06-17", "grade": "7.6"}
