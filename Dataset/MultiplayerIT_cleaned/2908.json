{"name": "NBA 2K21: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-2k21-recensione.html", "text": "The link between basketball and video games was certainly not born yesterday. For decades, in fact, the magic of the NBA championship has been represented to us on screen by development teams that have alternated from time to time. That was before Visual Concepts came along with its NBA 2K series, pulverizing the competition to eventually become the only alternative on the market. The NBA 2K21 review comes just over twenty years after the birth of that ~2K~, which took place at the turn of the year 2000 with the first edition of the series on the Dreamcast. EA Sports has tried again on more than one occasion to get back on track with its NBA Live, but also for the Redwood giant in the end the time has come to hoist the white flag against the 2K Games series, often judged not only with the title of best basketball simulation but also with that of best sports simulation in general. Difficult to think otherwise, at a time when NBA 2K came to make use of the collaboration of Spike Lee when others were just at the beginning of their experimentation with the story mode in sports, or in front of an increasingly refined and realistic representation of what happens on the parquet. Not always all that glittered was gold, it is true, just as 2K Games' choices in commercial terms have not always satisfied the players, but the great impact this series had in the world of sports video games remains undeniable. With the arrival of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the appointment with NBA 2K21 will even be doubled: while waiting to be able to enjoy the new features of the game on the next consoles, let's see how it behaves on the current ones. My Career: The Long Shadow As mentioned in the intro, the My Career mode has been a core part of NBA 2K for years now. This year's title is no less, taking us with the story entitled The Long Shadow to take on the role of Junior, nickname of a budding player forced to live with his father's long shadow behind him. Despite his skill, Junior's parent failed in his time to make the leap from the world of college to that of the NBA, remaining an unfinished talent. When the protagonist begins to gain popularity thanks to the talent he has inherited, the press and the league environment will inevitably make the inevitable comparison, forcing Junior to contend with other difficulties. Starting from high school, NBA 2K21 allows us to accompany the boy in the his transition to college until his arrival in the NBA, alternating moments dedicated to narration with others in which we are instead called to play basketball to promote the young man's chances in the draft. All this represents the prologue where you get to know the story of Junior, divided between dreams of glory and personal events. In fact, there is no lack of romance with a college girl, in addition to the genuine rivalry with an old friend considered by all to be the star of the draft. The story gives the impression of being quite linear even if occasionally we are called to make important choices, such as the one related to the agent who then influences the way in which Junior can acquire VC (the game's virtual currency) and fan col pass matches. As per tradition, also for NBA 2K21 Visual Concepts has attracted some real actors to impersonate the main characters of the story: among these the presence of Michael K. Williams (The Wire, Boardwalk Empire) stands out, but it is also easy to recognize the faces by Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond), Jesse Williams (Grey's Anatomy) and Mireille Enos (The Killing). While not reaching the heights of NBA 2K16, The Long Shadow is still more than willing to follow, also allowing us to savor the world of college basketball with its first hours of play, which until some time ago belonged to the NCAA video game series. The NBA 2K21 Career mode also acts as a bridge for entering the District, however only possible after Junior's arrival in the NBA. If desired, it is possible to skip the entire prologue to get straight to the moment of the draft, in order to immediately access the additional mode. However, in our opinion, it is worth enjoying The Long Shadow in all its duration. Returning to the District, the arrival of 2K Beach allows us to interact with other players in a renewed environment, from which to kick off three-on-three street basketball matches or five-on-five ProAMs. The decision to allow players to access the District only with the character generated with the MyPlayer editor is a double-edged sword, especially considering that to make it grow properly it is necessary to spend the hard-earned VC coins. The same coinVC can be spent on My Team packs, thus forcing the player who doesn't want to buy VC with real money to choose what to prioritize. The other modes After the first few hours spent in Junior's company, we are inevitably led to explore the other modes that NBA 2K21 has to offer. Among them we have already mentioned My Team, a kind of FIFA Ultimate Team interpreted according to Visual Concepts. Just like in FUT, we can create our ideal quintet by collecting cards and opening packs. After last year's criticisms, the developers have rethought the characteristics of this mode a bit, which with NBA 2K21 integrates a series of additional competitions and periodic events in a very similar way to what has been seen in recent times in the FIFA series . The possibilities offered by My Team are now quite numerous, both offline and online, although as regards the latter we must say that we have had some problems. In more than one case matchmaking has led us to face opponents with whom the connection dropped after a few moments, or even at a certain point to play against a team made up of invisible men before the game realized that something had gone wrong in the game. 'start of the game. If the online sector is therefore a bit to fix after the launch which took place a few days ago, those who want can console themselves in the meantime with the numerous offline alternatives offered by NBA 2K21. Among these we find in the front row My GM and My League, methods that have remained practically the same as last year. The WNBA also returns, with the ability to select women's teams for both Quick Games and My League. Playstation 4 trophies In addition to the glory of the ring, NBA 2K21 also allows us to conquer fifty-one Trophies, divided between the usual platinum, two of the gold type, ten silver and thirty-eight bronze. Most of them are linked to the two modes My Career and My Team, within which it is therefore necessary to get busy with particular companies in order to be able to achieve all the objectives studied by Visual Concepts. Gameplay: new shooting, new swearing Once you take the field, the sensations proposed by NBA 2K21 are completely similar to those of its predecessor. Those who have had the opportunity to play NBA 2K20 in recent months can therefore be perfectly at ease with everything, except for one fundamental aspect: shooting. In fact, the choice of Visual Concepts was to completely redesign the system for shooting the basket by the players, delegating its management to the use of the right analog stick. The quality of the shot is no longer defined by the release timing but by the aim that the gamer must take inside a crescent that appears once the lever is moved downwards, to then aim at the center of a highlighted interval to obtain the coveted green rating. With a few more games than the demo and a difficulty in our opinion set a little higher, we have to say that the new pitch has taken us more than we expected. In several cases, the system was also excessively punitive, causing shots from unmarked players to fail with good fundamentals. It is no coincidence that after the release of NBA 2K21 in stores, gamers began to complain about the severity of the new shooting system, forcing Visual Concepts to intervene to soften it especially at lower difficulty levels. The current situation sees the need for an inevitable period of adaptation, both for newcomers to the series and for veterans. In fact, especially in the most agitated phases, it is still necessary to press the square button to shoot, risking making a great deal of confusion. In reality, the old shooting system hasn't completely disappeared, but it has been made more inconvenient in terms of time and yield due to a new release bar with which timing is now evaluated. Shooting aside, as we said, impressions offered by the gameplay of NBA 2K21 are very similar to those of NBA 2K20. Along with the new shot also comes a dribbling system connected to the right stick itself, thanks to which a renewed fluidity is given to this type of movement. The different way in which the players move on the pitch is also tangible, thanks to an improved management of the spacing and the different body types of the athletes. Graphics and sound: postponed to December At the end of the generation, the technical aspect of NBA 2K21 inevitably becomes the least interesting of the package. With the current consoles practically squeezed to capacity, we will in fact have to wait for the release of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versionof the game to see the novelties prepared by Visual Concepts in the graphic field. However, the overview of the field and its protagonists remains of an excellent level by current standards, with an overall experience that brings NBA 2K21 very close to the basketball we see on television. The filmed scenes in My Career however, they have some small shadows. While it's nice to see how the faces of well-known actors have been brought into the game with extreme care, on the other side the secondary models don't enjoy the same attention to detail, not to mention the background images which in some cases seem almost stuck with scotch. To be a sports game, however, at least for this generation, maybe you can't ask for more. Finally, we point out the permanence of some screens still a little too long in the uploads, especially between the various phases that make up The Long Shadow. NBA 2K21 and nextgen: watch out for the purchase! Before buying NBA 2K21 for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, it is a must to take a few moments to reflect on the platforms on which you will then want to play the basketball simulation for the rest of the year. The model designed by 2K Games for the transition to the new generation in fact hides some pitfalls, so first of all we must not assume that the purchase of the game now allows us to have it at no additional cost on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. This it is in fact true only for the Mamba Forever Edition sold at a price of 99.99 euros, while the standard edition will not allow players to access the next-gen version.
