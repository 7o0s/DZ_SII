{"name": "Castle of Magic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castle-of-magic_a.html", "text": "If you wanted to throw down a sort of identikit for the platform genre, you could first of all write, without fear of contradiction, that these are games in which you jump onto platforms. Ok, we are all in agreement on this point. Secondly, the protagonists of these games are often very nice and cute, to cater to all tastes: a moustachioed plumber, an anthropomorphic hedgehog, a placid child, things like that. The enemies present in the stages must be defeated mainly by jumping on their heads, and only alternatively can they be hit with direct attacks of various kinds. Platformers usually boast a series of very different locations (~worlds~), each divided into various areas that must be overcome in sequence. At the end of each ~world~, there is the classic fight with a preferably huge boss, which must be defeated by studying his modus operandi and taking advantage of his inevitable weaknesses. The possibility of transforming and enhancing the character, giving him perhaps temporary extra abilities, as well as the presence of stages different from the others, which break the linearity of the gameplay, are accessory features. Finally, the collection of objects and bonuses that can sometimes constitute the ~energy bar~ of the protagonist is inevitable: rings, diamonds, coins, gifts and so on. Well, Castle of Magic looks like the perfect platformer. The latest Gameloft production sees us playing the role of a boy who finds himself trapped in a magical world, and must find his friend Jenny before returning to reality. Succeeding in this enterprise will not be easy: we will have to face five different worlds, each divided into various stages and each characterized by a particular theme: the snow, the forest, sweets, the sea and technology. At our disposal we will have some nice magical powers, in this case a wand that can transform enemies into blocks of stone, which it is then possible to destroy or throw towards other enemies to crush them. Obviously it will also be possible to take out opponents by jumping on their heads, at least when they are not wearing pointy helmets. Our vital energy is made up of diamonds that we collect around the levels: when we suffer an attack, we lose them (exactly like in the various Sonics) but we can collect some on the fly so as not to remain defenseless. The platforms alternate with blocks that can be destroyed, as well as portals and devices of various kinds. There is no shortage of upgrades, which in this case can equip us with ranged attacks (with the character's clothes changing accordingly) or make us unstoppable for a handful of seconds, making us gain something like fifty kg of fat in an instant. In aquatic stages, this translates into a literal transformation, with the character becoming a swordfish when he goes underwater and collects a certain bonus. Finally, there is no shortage of extra actions: the double jump, the possibility of gliding to reach very distant platforms, the dive attack... The technical realization of Castle of Magic is extraordinary in style and quantity: although the fluidity of the animations (excellent) remains in the average of mobile games, the rest is at least two hands above everything that has been seen so far. In the mobile sector, the platform genre (also understood as two-dimensional action games) has made enormous strides forward, but this new Gameloft product is really off the charts: the impression is that the developers sat down at the table and made a list of the most beautiful, ingenious and nice elements that have ever been seen in a platform in the last twenty years, to then insert them all, without distinction, into the game mechanics. We have five beautiful, colorful worlds, with different variations in the structure of the stages and a large number of enemies, not to mention the bosses: huge, well designed and animated, really imaginative. The touches of class abound, with platforms that rotate according to the weight applied, destructible objects and small puzzles to solve. And the sound? More unique than rare case, the musical accompaniment of Castle of Magic is up to the situation, with really nice and catchy music, which is reproduced together with sampled effects of excellent workmanship. It is a pity that the audio can generate slowdowns on some terminals, but it is still a fairly limited problem. PRO Extraordinary graphics in style and quantity Playable, fun, immediate Sound compartment up to par, finally AGAINST A little too easy Sound can cause slowdowns on some terminals", "date": "2008-11-17", "grade": "S.V."}
