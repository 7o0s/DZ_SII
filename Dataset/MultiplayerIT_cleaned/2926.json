{"name": "Legends of Runeterra - Call of The Mountain", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legends-of-runeterra-call-of-the-mountain-recensione.html", "text": "Legends of Runeterra is a product we love. Since its launch it has been able to give us a fresh, dynamic and full of twists gameplay with game mechanics that drew inspiration from Hearthstone and Magic but were also able to mix together creating something truly unique and well-defined, a completely new game in short capable of stealing from us hundreds and hundreds of hours between classified and expeditions in the last few months. Updates on Runeterra are constant, arriving every two weeks or so and continuously revolutionizing the meta to keep the game fresh and give value to all the heroes and cards, leaving very few excluded from the circle of the most popular champions. Since the launch there has been an excellent alternation of control decks, with Heimerdinger as standard bearer, but there have also been portions of the season where the aggro with Draven and in Midrange of the Bilgewater expansion have had the upper hand. In short, it was legitimate to expect that things would continue in this direction and there was extreme curiosity in understanding the possible potential of the cards of the new Region. On August 26, Call of the Mountain finally arrived on the servers, the new game expansion that brought as a gift seven champions and 89 new cards, with an avalanche of new keywords. This review of Legends of Runeterra - Call of The Mountain will explain whether or not it is worth your time. Follow the course thanks to the stars The region of Targon, for lovers of the lore of Runeterra, takes its name from the mountain that dominates it, a land intended for pilgrims in search of answers, through a journey that claims more lives than it satisfies questions. It is a magical place full of mystery to which some of the most particular champions of League of Legends are associated: Leona, Taric and Diana are just some of them and they finally find their space on Runeterra too, accompanied by the immense dragon Aurelion Sol. Dragons are at the heart of this expansion, with a good amount of dedicated cards and a new fury keyword, which increases their power and health for each completed kill. The first thing we therefore experimented with were dragon-themed thematic decks, and if at the moment mono-dragon decks are still extremely complex to do due to a vulnerable early game, some decks with Aurelion Sol and Trundle manage to place themselves quite high in the meta current. The celestial cards summoned by Aurelion Sol work vaguely like Hearthstone's discover but here, wisely, they have an extremely smaller pool of possibilities, almost completely eliminating the RNG factor, which has always been unwelcome during competitions. So yes, you can try to fill your hand in search of a safe closure with celestial dragons at no cost but forget about being able to activate burst or fast cards just to save the match. The gameplay study behind this mechanic is there and it shows and we have never found it abusable to save ourselves in a corner with a flick of luck as instead happened to us, against and in favor, an endless number of times on the Blizzard-branded rival . In addition to the celestial cards, as we said, Taric and Lulu try to give even more value to the keyword support, seen relatively little in recent months, except in aggro decks with Fiora, succeeding very well and bringing their presence as a fixed amount in the decks Tier S of this first wave. We are above all satisfied because all the new heroes seem really nice to play, with good mechanics and in ranked games there is a good recirculation of decks, with a system that, at least for the moment, does not seem to want to reward a single style of play. At the same time the old cards continue to have great value and the decks with Twisted Fate and Swain, but also those with Tresh continue to easily have their say. In short, if you have made an investment in terms of time or money, you need not despair, with Call of The Mountain you will still be competitive, also and above all given the lack of any rotation between the cards, at the moment apparently neither necessary nor desired . They close the circle of the important keywords dawn and dusk, effects that are respectively activated if the card is played as a first option or as a ~combo~ during a turn. In short, another addition that gives a not indifferent strategic depth. All free! After last month's Spirit Blossom event complete with Season Pass and rewards we would have expected repeating events so that Riot could better monetize a title that at the moment seems to want to be based exclusively on game boards, guardians, card backs edemotes. Instead, surprising us, there is none of this. Legends of Runeterra continues to be the lightest card game of all, offering the possibility to earn a huge number of cards for free by simply investing a little time on the game servers. You could also decide never to throw yourself into competitive ranked or friendly matches even, perhaps aiming only for the laboratories, which from August 26th have preset decks based on the Targon region, or perhaps experimenting in Draft mode expeditions. In addition to the experience linked to the twenty new levels of Targon then, we also point out the addition of 4 more experience levels for all the old regions with a new champion, with the possibility therefore of quickly obtaining a copy of Trundle, Lulu and Nocturne quickly. Too bad there are no new ordeals at the moment compared to a few months ago but it is understandable given the amount of other content that has arrived. In short, if you haven't been on Runeterra for some time, Call of the Mountain represents a good motivation to come back and experiment with new mechanics, in an environment enriched by animations and sounds of uncommon quality for a card game and by artwork that define crazy is really an understatement. Riot's illustrations are once again simply sublime and we don't find it difficult to call them the best in class. With a continuous update plan already planned for the next few months, our attention will remain catalysed on Runeterra for a long time to come. To stay ten years at the top of the charts, you have to have loads of ideas. You have to be ready to invent and reinvent yourself, to follow the fashions of the moment and sometimes go overboard in trying to impose them. Riot Games has been able over the years to build a community very fond of the brand, while creating a cohesive and credible universe that does not skimp on the facets to get to embrace an even wider and heterogeneous audience. He obviously did it by collecting the sown of the golden era of Blizzard, then even surpassing it by demonstrating an incredible attachment to his characters and games. It is unlikely that for each champion there is not a study of his history, an in-depth study of a parallel universe where new plots are told with a continuous evolution of the plot that incredibly manages to captivate even in games not strictly related to the narrative such as MOBAs can be or card games. We had the opportunity to have a chat with the League of Legends development team to go deeper into the matter and today we want to share our chat with you. In recent years you have decided to add stories and deepen the history of League of Legends on an ongoing basis, why is it so important for a game like this to have this kind of background? We've found a ton of ways to tell our stories lately, but the planning work for these story arcs and world development we've been building for years. With such a large and passionate player base we have seen incredible reactions to this type of creativity and the fact that players invest so much time in our games motivates us to delve into this type of work. As long as they keep asking it is our responsibility to fulfill their requests. At the same time, we absolutely don't want lore to become a barrier to enjoying our games. Some players just want to log into servers and have a game, and that's great! But for all the people who want to go deeper we always want to be ready for them to find a new level. Storytelling isn't always just about creating great cinematic. When champions interact with each other in Summoner's Rift, or when a story mentions something in Legends of Runeterra, the effect can be equally large. The more we can give depth to our world and our characters the more authentic and unique they become and hopefully you can feel happy to be part of these universes. We have seen events, comics, books and much more in recent months, what will be the fate of Runeterra? For the 10th anniversary of League of Legends we announced our first big step outside the gaming space with Arcane, an original animated series based on the League of Legends universe and developed with our friends at Fortiche. There is a lot of excitement surrounding this evening, inside and outside the company. I can't go into too much specifics at the moment about the future of the world of Runeterra, but with all the work related to kinematics, comics, short stories and projects like Arcane I think it's clearor see how Riot's intention is to improve our stories more and more, arriving at positioning League of Legends among the great intellectual properties that we love so much. Some events have been driven by strong promotional assets, such as the Giants video, are you planning something similar for the future? When we create cinematics of this type, we always try to fit the type of medium and video that best fits a certain character or event. For example with Jinx, we thought that given her strong personality, a completely crazy music video would best showcase her mental instability and feel authentic. With Yone, however, we felt that showing his relationship with his brother in a 2D/CG video would best represent and introduce this new champion to players. So while the format can be very different depending on the champion, line of skins, or events, we always aim to have creativity that represents the subject in the best possible way as we visualize it in our minds. With all aspects and assets far removed from the standard fantasy world of League of Legends, don't you fear that your champions may lose identities (or have too many?) No, we see skins as a way to best showcase a player's individuality within the Rift, which doesn't have to be the same as another player's. Yes, we have tons of champion skins (But you always forget about Ornn! Ed), but through their development we always keep the essential aspects in mind and aim to have a consistent identity, even if the dossier is slightly different . Spirit Blossom is a huge and fairly long event, with dialogue between champions and other great gimmicks. Can we expect events of the same quality and length in the future or will you focus on smaller events? Which make it better for your experience? Ryan: As wonderful as it's been working on Spirit Blossom and telling players that we're looking to invest even more in events in general, it's more important to also make it clear that not all events will be of this scale and magnitude. This does not mean that there will no longer be, or that there will still be, events of this type. It will solely depend on the success of each individual event and how hungry the community is for events like Spirit Blossom. If these events are a success, we'll have no reason not to explore further and do something similar. However, we have no future plans at the moment, we first want to see how the result of Spirit blossom will be. Part of the League of Legends community plays more for the pleasure of collecting skins and other cosmetic items rather than competitively playing your title. How do you manage the needs of such a different audience with the various updates? We always want to make sure that League of Legends is a type of game that all types of players can enjoy. Whether you're a casual fan of skins and skins, a lore-head always on the lookout for new story or champion information, or a hyper-competitive player determined to climb as high as possible each season, we work in diverse teams so that each type is well represented. For this we have the skin department, the competitive one, the dedicated balance team and many others. These groups work hard to ensure that every aspect of the game is structured in the best possible way for each group of players.", "date": "2020-09-01", "grade": "8.5"}
