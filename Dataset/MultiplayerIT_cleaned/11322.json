{"name": "Dracula 3: Il Sentiero del Drago - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dracula-3-il-sentiero-del-drago-recensione.html", "text": "The figure of the vampire has always tickled the popular imagination and, with mixed fortunes, has produced an endless series of interpretations and re-readings on all known media. The most famous vampire is, of course, Dracula, a figure who has profoundly marked the Western (and not only) collective imagination, becoming a point of reference in the horror scene; a real classic (the first edition of the book of the same name, written by Bram Stoker, dates back to 1897). Video games have certainly not been sparing in exploiting the figure of the vampire in general and of Dracula in particular (how many titles with vampire protagonists/deuteragonists/generic enemies come out every year? Especially in RPGs, a vampire never denies anyone). The title subject of the review is the third chapter of a series of graphic adventures dedicated to the prince of the night no, not Lampwick, and therefore no buttocks in a thong on the beach or in the disco (but you're obsessed!). We are obviously talking about the aforementioned Dracula, who lent his name to this and the two previous episodes of a saga born in 2000. Holiness or eternal damnation? Dracula 3: The Sanctuary of the Dragon (not to be confused with Dracula: Origin, another graphic adventure coming out these days) offers a completely original plot that intertwines with the historical reality of Romania at the time: we are in 1920, Father Arno Moriani is sent by the Vatican to set up a canonization process in Vladeviste, a remote village in Transylvania, Romania. His investigation, initially focused on the life of Dr. Martha Calugarul, will soon become a vampire hunt that will lead him to travel across Europe in search of a way to find and stop the bloodsucker par excellence: Dracula. the final result is convincing and helps in identification, creating a good sense of verisimilitude Holiness or eternal damnation? What is it that should scare me? But we were talking about the slow start. After a few hours of play, with the entry of the supernatural, the interest in the plot takes off as well as the puzzles that become more and more interesting and intricate, even if never impossible to overcome. The only thing missing is the atmosphere. In reality, the developers have tried to create a bit of suspense, but it is the game structure that is castrating in this sense: it is difficult to create tension when the player knows he is moving on fixed screens and also knows he cannot risk his life in no way. There is little need for demonic red eyes poking out of the dark or some twilight vision, it takes much more to create tension. In the end, the situation improves, but the tones remain those of a dark yellow more than a real horror, a kind of episode of the Lady in Murder, with a few twists and a few more deaths. Yet the representation of the different locations is not bad and, in some cases, despite the obvious limitations of the graphics engine, leaves you pleasantly surprised. But there's nothing to do, while looking for the solution of a puzzle without having time limits, there's no way to feel the slightest tension. The love of reading The interface also comes from afar and many hardened adventurers will immediately recognize the Omni3D-like game engine, first used in 1997 with Atlantis The Lost Tales. In reality it has long since changed its name and has been improved, above all from a visual point of view, even if it has remained substantially identical to the original: the view is in first person with the player called to move the pointer to the center of the screen while moving the view of the current scene. Hovering over a hot spot, the pointer will change shape depending on the possible interactions (move, speak, pick up, use, and so on). The only peculiarity of Dracula 3 is the presence of a rich section dedicated to the documents examined during our wanderings, which must be consulted expertly to solve the various puzzles. The aid system is also linked to the documents section. Do you need advice? Go and open the Bible, click on the flashing book-shaped icon at the top right and you will find yourself reading a random sentence from the thick volume which, coincidentally, contains a more or less direct clue on how to continue the game. the only peculiarity of Dracula 3 is the presence of a rich section dedicated to the documents examined during our wanderings The love of reading Among the defects, it should be noted the management of the inventory, which obliges every time an object is collected or used to take it back from a sort of limbo box of which one absolutely did not feel the need, and the rather short duration which allows to finish the game less di about ten hours; even if it should be specified that the longevity of graphic adventures is generally linked to the player's ability to solve the puzzles and not just to the quantity of the latter. Comment In short, summing up we can say that we are faced with a very good and exciting adventure, with some too many technical limitations, perhaps, but which manages to capture the player's attention despite a slow start with little bite. Recommended both for fans of the genre and for those who want to experience it for the first time without risking being faced with too difficult a challenge.
