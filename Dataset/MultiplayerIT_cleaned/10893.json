{"name": "Bombe d'Acqua", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bombe-dacqua.html", "text": "It's a quiet day in the city, until plucky Splash Bandit's anti-bullying alarms start ringing gravely. What he had always feared happened: the bullies banded together and formed a small army with the intention of tormenting nerds and defenseless kids. The only way to stop them is to go back out there and fight them one at a time, using the same old weapon: water balloons. And that's exactly what we'll do within the many stages of this new Digital Chocolate title: under the command of Splash Bandit, we'll find ourselves having to eliminate one or more bullies every time by launching our particular projectiles. The undertaking will be far from easy, however, and indeed it will gradually become more complex: the locations will almost immediately begin to represent a significant obstacle, therefore we will have to understand their structure and make our moves with the greatest possible precision, exploiting the force of gravity to hit the targets but also taking advantage of the many variations of the normal balloons that we will have available. In addition to the ~standard~ ones, in fact, we will be able to use extra large balloons (with a more effective impact), ~cluster~ balloons (which divide in the air to hit a larger surface), ~timed~ balloons (which explode after five seconds after launch), ~sniper~ balloons (small, fast and accurate) etc. In some cases we will even be able to use special equipment to take off and reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Once the game has started, we can try our hand at a quick game or with the main mode, which can also be tackled in ~turn-based~ multiplayer by selecting the individual stages in a speed race. The character we take control of can move freely within the locations but does not have the ability to jump, therefore he must resort to tricks to overcome most of the obstacles. By pressing the 1 key, we will be able to scroll the view on the level at any time to check the position of the enemies and the arrangement of the platforms and walls, then with the d-pad we will move Splash Bandit and position it in a strategic point to launch the first shot . By pressing the d-pad up and down we will see the viewfinder move, therefore we will be able to press and hold the 5 key to load the shot, the power of which will be shown by a special bar located on the left of the screen. Each type of balloon reacts differently based on the trajectory and force of the launch, so at the beginning we will have to experiment to understand how to behave to land the shots. Once we hit one of the enemies present, we will see his energy bar affected by the attack: at that point it will be his turn to throw an object at us, which will hit us or not depending on how uncovered we are. The stage is completed when all enemies are eliminated, then a report is made on the time taken and any bonuses earned. The graphics of the game are in full Digital Chocolate style: clean, with a very good design and an excellent use of colors. The many stages available are divided into some areas that differ in the setting, presenting more or less the same graphic elements but arranged in a way that is anything but trivial or redundant. The characters boast a decent set of animations and the sound sector is made up of good quality MIDI music, which has the advantage of accompanying the action in the best way and without disturbing.
