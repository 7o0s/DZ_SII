{"name": "Lilas Sky Ark", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lilas-sky-ark-recensione.html", "text": "We had the opportunity to spend a couple of weeks in the company of the second title developed by the small Monolith of Minds team, as well as the prequel to their first work, Resolution, and we are ready to sum up this small, problematic project in our review of Lila's Sky Ark. The narrative that doesn't exist Lila's Sky Ark: the narrative sector is more elusive than the end of a rainbow Telling in a highly fragmentary way, diluting situations, events and revelations to cover several hours of playful experience is a fairly common constant in video games. Often, the narration is left ~on the sidelines~, at the mercy of the player's desire to dissect or not the events that led to the situational regime of this or that game universe when you immerse yourself in it. It can be a great way to create that veil of mystery necessary to encourage the audience to get lost in the created world, but it is also a double-edged sword. In fact, it is very easy to be overwhelmed by the expository complexity of this narrative system, either due to a lack of balance in the rhythm of unveiling of events, or due to the lack of attraction exerted by the created universe. Lila's Sky Ark fell into this trap, but he did it in the worst way. Not only are the circumstances that support Lila's adventure unclear, but the same universe in which Monolith of Minds wants us to immerse has failed in any way to capture us. The narration proceeds along two straight lines: one represented by thirteen letters scattered around the map which contribute to constructing a ~secondary~ picture, created with the intention of digging into the personality of the protagonist; the other from the progress obtained by completing the ~main missions~, which are exhausted in the exploration of a new area and in defeating a boss that afflicts that region, so as to protect Rainbow Ark from the yoke of the Conductor and her generals. This style of occasional narration, entrusted to the dialogue with characters scattered around the map, the defeat of difficult enemies and the discovery of letters ~from another world~, would have all the credentials to work, going to fascinate the player with his enigmatic and hidden side, but it seemed to us that it only resulted in the most total confusion, especially once the adventure was completed (not to mention the fact that it takes very little to understand in which direction the story is pointing). In essence, what concerns this universe is explained little and is explained badly, leaving the player dry-mouthed, without any ~reward~ for having persevered and completed the game, of which the narrative sector, it must be specified, is the last of the problems. Cumbersome gameplay Lila's Sky Ark: the gameplay is possibly more chaotic than the narrative sector Storytelling is often not one of the strong points of independent videogame productions, especially when the focus is mainly on gameplay. So, from a title that's lacking in storytelling, one would expect at least a little more panache to the action sequences. Incredibly, Lila's Sky Ark manages to do even worse in this area, touching the maximum limit of frustration. The combat system is out of scale cumbersome. To defend ourselves from the creatures that populate the various regions of the game, our only means is to throw objects at them. We start with small vases and wooden boxes, but gradually we arrive at more and more effective ~ammunition~. Which, in itself, wouldn't be a bad thing: it's a remake of the twin stick shooter, but without the ~twin~. Yes, because to throw objects you need to stay still, which makes you vulnerable to enemy attacks. The only way we have to avoid being hit is to dodge, which, however, causes the object to fall out of our hands, leaving us momentarily harmless. So far so good, you say. It can be an interesting dynamic, which pushes you to calculate the times well, to make strategy. We thought so too, at least until we had to face more than one enemy at the same time. In these cases, the battlefield is more a place of pure chaos and illegibility than a battleground capable of bringing the player's skills into play. Lila's Sky Ark: the inventory wheel, the real enemy to beat Every time an object is thrown, it is necessary to recall another one from the inventory, which is possible either with the backbones (shortcut that follows the positioning of the objects in one's backpack) or with the classic wheel, capable of freezing the action and leaving the player more time to choose what to continue the offensive with.This is just one of those cumbersome elements that weigh down the gameplay, given that, if you want to use more than one object of the same category, you have to recall it from the inventory each time, in a succession of ~equip, launch, equip, dodge, collect , launch~ that starts to get boring after the first ten minutes of the game (not counting the bugs that afflict the game, including the sudden and unwanted throwing of an object after it is picked up, wasting resources that are also very precious for of progression). In addition to this, the poor accuracy of the aiming system must be added, which seems to point in the desired direction, but which, due to the poorly managed perspective of the game, leads to wasting various objects. Not to mention the impossibility of calibrating the launch power, which forces you to rely on the lopsided hit-boxes of the enemies. Lila's Sky Ark: the balance of the clashes is another of the defects of the game Furthermore, all this complexity of mechanisms breaks down when you start to rely on some powers acquired by Lila during the adventure, which transform the combat sequences into a frantic fury against the most difficult enemies. So, even in terms of balance, the game fails, passing from the relatively demanding first half to the second half where every conception of strategy and skill become an obstacle to the only viable solution: not letting the opponent catch his breath. The critical issues of the Switch version Small parenthesis. We only got to try the game on Nintendo Switch, a console that seems like the ideal destination for such a title. Imagine, therefore, our surprise when we realized that, on the portable console par excellence, it is not possible to play the title in portable mode. The only solution to play it on the move is by detaching the Joy-Con from the console, a choice that we honestly did not understand. Furthermore, the not exactly crystalline optimization weighs down the console a lot, leading to evident and significant frame drops during the most agitated sequences, especially when there are numerous enemies on the screen. In the case of a specific boss, which made minor enemies appear in profusion, it was almost impossible to understand what was happening (which is already difficult in itself, let alone at three frames per second). Forced exploration Lila's Sky Ark: Exploration plays a primary role within the game The combat, however, is only part of the experience. A good portion of the game, in fact, is focused on the exploration of the game map. The world of Rainbow Ark is divided into four zones and a ~headquarters~. These four areas (the usual, abused biomes: forest, mountain, sky and depth of the earth) contain different secrets to reveal, which will lead the player to retrace his steps several times, even against his will. It would be nice to be able to say that this procedure is carried out to recover something of value, but most of the time you return to an area only because you are unable to proceed and you think you have left something behind. At this point it must be done an important distinction between ~explore~ and ~roam~. In the first case, the goal is to let yourself be captured by the surrounding circumstances in order to find their peculiarities, alternative ways, hidden secrets; in the second, however, one finds oneself groping through an environment that is difficult to read, with the sole purpose of being able to find, almost fatally, a path to follow, not knowing, moreover, whether it is the right one or not. just yet another dead end. Lila's Sky Ark: It's worrying how long it took us to figure out that being with the bell hanging wasn't part of the scenery, but made the platforms move when hit from distance The game is a continuous wandering in search of something only briefly mentioned, a hidden hole that appears to be a secondary road, but which turns out to be the main one; all in search of an objective that flashes madly on the map. And this wandering does not reward anything that contributes to an increase in fascination with the world we are experiencing. They are just paths, inlets and protrusions that change color according to the territory being crossed. Note how ~exploration~ takes up most of the time. In just over five hours of play, we spent a good two-thirds of them retracing paths already trodden, looking for routes that were revealed in all cases to be ~hidden~ by an unhappy design and by a forced insertion of some mechanics never experienced before, which are not introduced in any way.Inshort, what was meant to be a free exploration left to the player, turns into a misty expanse that rather than encouraging the investigation of every smallest portion of the map, becomes an obligation imposed by the game, if you want to complete the adventure . Visual anonymity Lila's Sky Ark: Visually not only anonymous, but also confusing As if that weren't enough, even from a graphic point of view the game doesn't shine. In addition to being highly anonymous, made in a pixel art that does not seem to have anything more to say than what has already been said by other productions that are decidedly more capable of making their artistic vision adhere to the needs of the created game, Lila's Sky Ark is a melting pot of perspective and stylistic confusion. From the more general unjustified juxtapositions between game graphics and interlude illustrations completely discordant with the latter, to the difficulty of reading the surrounding environment (plagued by the aforementioned perspective, assisted by a bad artistic management of the visual elements, which clash to have supremacy on the scene), up to various enigmatic graphic effects, which confuse the novice player (how long it took us to understand that the red halo at the edges of the screen represented the sunrise and sunset and not the critical conditions of Lila's health), each element that makes up the visual sector is a small defeat for the stylistic coherence that the game would like to propose. Even in terms of sound, it doesn't excel, however, at least in this case, it limits itself to that, without deviating from the margins of ~discreet~.", "date": "2022-04-21", "grade": "4.5"}
