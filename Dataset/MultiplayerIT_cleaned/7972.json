In most conventional video games, all The user is made to take on the role of the heroic savior of humanity, busy repelling alien attacks, vanquishing criminal organizations, chasing away hordes of monsters and so on. However, the developers of Ndemic Creations had fun completely overturning the rules of the game with the present here Plague Inc., a strategic one that has the macabre goal of eliminating every single individual on the face of the Earth through the spread of a lethal disease... Therapeutic persistence The first step in the path that leads to the extinction of mankind in Plague Inc. is represented by the selection of the type of epidemic that you want to control, a choice initially limited to bacteria only but which can be extended by a further six units by successfully completing as many game sessions at the normal difficulty level. Each pathogen has different characteristics that are directly reflected in the gameplay: therefore there are viruses that are very powerful but difficult to control due to their rapid mutations, fungi that find their Achilles heel in slower transmission, parasites struggling to evolve and so on, all of which add to the variety and replayability factors. Also because the games of Plague Inc., contrary to the average of the strategic ones, are resolved in a rather short time, precisely because the title relies entirely on the constant change of the conditions of the scenario. In terms of playful structure, the Ndemic Creations product has all in all simple and rapidly assimilable premises: the user must in fact start by choosing which country to start the infection from, and then follow the evolution of the disease and define its course by spending the DNA points earned as the disease spreads globally to add new symptoms, transmission characteristics and skills, using a grid for this last juncture that takes its cue from the level-up screens typical of classic RPGs. However, the one just described is only the tip of the iceberg of a truly articulated title, full of nuances that it is really pleasant to discover slowly, learning from your mistakes, also given that the tutorial boxes are kept (deliberately?) Vague. Therefore, the choice of the location of the onset of the infection must be anything but casual, and must take into account the climate, the population density, the proximity of air and naval stations that can favor the contagion and so on; furthermore, the evolution of the disease must contemplate not only the starting characteristics of the selected pathogen, but also and above all the perception of the epidemic by humanity, given that situations characterized by particularly serious symptoms will be contrasted more harshly and decided by scientists dedicated to finding a cure; finally, you have to take advantage of the events that are reported during the match, for example by taking the opportunity of the massive gathering of people from all over the world for the Olympics to spread the disease everywhere. All these contents are ~hidden~ by an absolutely basic, but at the same time strangely hypnotic presentation: the game interface consists of a simple world map, with the various regions turning red as the infection takes hold foot, accompanied by a news snake in the upper part of the screen and by a bar with the fundamental indicators positioned at the bottom. However, the user must not limit himself to watching while the epidemic grows: in addition to the continuous passage from screen to screen to view statistics and enhance the disease, the interaction also passes through bubbles that appear on the display in correspondence with the infected countries , and which must be burst with a tap as soon as possible to get bonus DNA points. Accompanied by massive doses of black humor, Plague Inc. is also appreciated for the stimuli given to the player to invite him to start a new game as soon as another one ends: in addition to the already mentioned six different pathogens, victories lead to unlock a large variety of upgrades that can be applied to the infection's DNA from the outset, especially useful if you want to try to face the brutal maximum difficulty level. Finally, a far from invasive appearance of in-app purchases, dedicated to chi want to have immediate access to all the contents or for those who wish to try their hand at two scenarios that radically change the rules of the game.", "date": "2013-03-08", "grade": "8.0"}
