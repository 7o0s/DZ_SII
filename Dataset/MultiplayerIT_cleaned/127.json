{"name": "Sim City Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sim-city-mobile_a.html", "text": "My whole city Sim City is based on a very simple concept: build a city from scratch and make it prosper, trying to keep the inhabitants' satisfaction level high. The player therefore has the task of constructing buildings, infrastructures, parks and so on, always keeping an eye on the budget and the impact of his actions on the social and natural environment. In the mobile phone version subject of this review, Sim City keeps these fundamental aspects intact, without compromising the playability of a product not properly designed to be enjoyed through the keyboard of a mobile phone. Seemingly insurmountable, the control system problem is solved in Sim City with a certain agility: in addition to the four keys delegated to cursor movement, only two others are used to allow navigation between the various windows and select the desired elements. The interface -another delicate issue- then manages to be concise and functional at the same time, without ever appearing unclear. In short, from a purely technical point of view, Sim City is a small jewel of practicality: even if some functions have been cut (such as the zoom function, which is actually somewhat missing), the Maxis title lets itself be played absolutely fluid. The audiovisual sector is less exciting - however completely secondary in such productions - which presents a somewhat rough 2D graphics with a questionable color palette and an almost completely absent sound which, however, is not missed too much. The rest falls within the classic canons of the franchise, which here too manages to combine a remarkable basic simplicity with a surprising underlying complexity. To ensure that your city thrives, the user must therefore keep a multitude of factors in balance, building infrastructures that can support the needs of the population. Above all, power stations, water supply sites and industrial areas are fundamental: but residential and recreational areas must also be created, possibly protected from smog and dangers (it is not excluded, for example, that a nuclear reactor could explode) and close to commercial activities, parks and so on. All without forgetting essential services for citizens such as hospitals, police stations and fire stations. Also because natural disasters play a leading role in Sim City: a well-aimed tornado or a powerful earthquake is enough to throw the city into total chaos, forcing the player to always keep his attention high. As per tradition, Sim City does not have a real final goal: there are no levels, the only stimulus given to the user to continue is to observe the growth of his ~creature~. However, this mobile version offers a special Scenario mode designed to satisfy anyone who feels the need for a challenge: the player is then dropped into ten particular situations that he must try to solve thanks to his management skills. PRO * Play structure always winning * Functional interface and control system * Potentially very high longevity AGAINST * Audiovisual sector not exceptional * Not suitable for everyone", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
