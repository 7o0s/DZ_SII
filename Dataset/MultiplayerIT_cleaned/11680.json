Hoshigami is a Japanese-style RPG with strategic elements, evidently inspired by classics like Final Fantasy Tactis and Tactis Ogre. The adventure is set in the Kingdom of Ixia, in a distant and imaginary era of medieval and fantastic evocation, when spirits and divine entities still lived together. The one who has the power to hear the voice of these spirits and communicate with them is called ~Hoshigami~; Villa, one of them, seized power and sealed away the spirits to command their fate, destroying the world of Ixia with their own infinite energy. Villa's evil empire lasted until Sarnus, thanks to the blessing of the spirit of Light and Love, defeated him with the help of six other Hoshigami, returning to reign over the peace of their land. This is the prologue to the adventures of our protagonist Fazz and his team of friends, fighting against the ~usual~ forces of evil intent on repossessing power and bringing darkness back over the world. Hoshigami is a Japanese-style RPG with strategic elements, evidently inspired by classics like Final Fantasy Tactis and Tactis Ogre Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away... Along our way we meet many characters, mercenaries, warriors, wizards, archers and young girls, all agree to join us offering help and sacrifice for the good cause. Our task is to equip them properly, teach them fighting techniques and make them level properly: each character can be assigned personalized attacks and spells. The story, in some places, can also take different directions, determining which heroes will become part of our party and which will not. The non-linearity of the game is also evident from the fact that there are multiple alternative endings; the story is nothing original, it is a plot that serves to give a certain credibility to the plot, like a thread of connection between the various combat arenas. The story, in some long text sessions, is excessively confusing and boring due to speeches that go beyond the main objectives of the adventure. The novelties of the RAP system and the Shoot bindings The plot, as it is easy to guess, stocks up on the overused clichs of Japanese role-playing games. However, it lacks exciting situations, big twists or particularly significant events: it is rather a glue to put together the various phases of combat, large chessboards where our character-pawns face enemy armies, a bit like in the Advance Wars series, if you will, where the story was certainly not heart-pounding. Hoshigami makes use of all the basic rules of the strategic: the fights are turn-based, the characters move one at a time within precise and outlined spaces, after which through the drop-down menu you can choose between the various actions available, such as spells , attacks or parries. Obviously hitting from the side or from behind causes more damage, an archer is more lethal from a distance and a warrior in melee attacks. In all this sea of clichs, all exploited properly, there is, however, some nice news. Hoshigami uses all the basic rules of the strategic The novelties of the RAP system and the Shoot bindings Let's talk about the very effective and innovative RAP (Ready for Action Points) system. It is basically the possibility of each character to perform several actions during their combat turn, as long as each of them remains within a pre-established ~cost~ limit. One could almost compare the ~RAP~ to the fatigue generated by the actions performed, which are marked by a specific value. Moving, attacking, casting spells and using items: everything has a particular cost. Our hero can use the ~RAP~ bar until it runs out, but we must bear in mind that it will take some time to recharge it later. The strategic component finds in this system a valid means to reason and sip our moves properly. Furthermore, the ~RAP~ system also influences the attack order of the characters, favoring the ~fresher~ ones, i.e. with the least depleted bar. Another innovation is that of ~shoot~ moves, performed in the same way as a golf ball is thrown in video games. A bar appears on the screen which must be stopped as close as possible to its limit, to cause greater damage. The two sides of the coin This interesting mix between the classic and all too abused elements of the strategic and the ~RAP~ system certainly manages to interest the player and to intrigue all those navigated in the genre in question.Unfortunately Hoshigami suffers from such profound problems in the gameplay that any attempt by the developers to make the proposed innovations appreciated is in vain. We are obviously referring to the excessive imbalance of combat skills in favor of magic. In Hoshigami there are small coins, called Coinfeigm, which in their minerals contain the strength of the spirits of Ixia, which we talked about in the introduction. These coins, which are essentially used to cast spells, can have ~seals~ applied which make them more effective and cheaper to use, in terms of ~RAP~. Hoshigami suffers from problems so deep in the gameplay that any attempt by the developers to make the novelty fun is in vain The two sides of the coin Once learned to use properly, and enhanced with suitable seals, coins are absolutely devastating. Already after the first phase of the game, that of learning, the first Coinfgems will make life all too easy for us, with attacks so powerful that the enemies will not even have the necessary experience to be able to stop them. On the contrary, if we don't learn to use coins, the enemies with stronger seals than ours will wipe us out without too many problems, continuously causing the death of our protagonist and the consequent and frustrating game-over. The method used by the developers to free Hoshigami from its intrinsic difficulty has therefore turned against the player, in the worst way. Just like the ambivalent sides of a coin, the title can therefore be too easy, or excessively difficult. A 3D solid with a 2D feel Just like the story and plot, Hoshigami's design and graphics are also not particularly inspired and fresh. The double screen of the DS is well exploited as the menus are delimited and separated from the playing area, but unfortunately suffer from a chronic lack of style and originality, resulting absolutely flat and lackluster. Nothing more than a series of white writing on a colored background just like in the old NES RPGs. You see things better on the action screen, with very solid 3D graphics, well-defined 2D elements and very large sprites. very solid 3D graphics, well defined 2D elements and very large sprites A 3D solid with a 2D feel The general style of Hoshigami is ambiguous: on the one hand the ~setting~ is the classic medieval one, with castles, towers and fantasy elements, on the other hand the characters are not at all on the same wavelength, sometimes resulting even futuristic. The soundtrack, on the other hand, has been well remixed and is composed of songs of excellent workmanship, with an epic style with rock nuances. Even if at times one gets the impression that the tracks have very little to do with the current action, the music is pleasant enough. Even the sound effects have been taken care of properly, variety is ensured by dozens of different sounds for attacks and very good digitized voices during fights. Hoshigami engages the player for about 50-60 hours, unless the coin and seal system is learned and tamed much earlier: longevity is therefore not the real problem of this title. Comment If you love the strategy RPG genre you might appreciate some brilliant innovations by Hoshigami, solutions that every game of this genre should adopt in the future. The game has an average technical realization, with solid isometric 3D graphics and well-detailed sprites, but it lacks on the inspiration and originality of the story and design. The fights are fun and rewarding until it becomes clear that there is an excessive imbalance of the attacks in favor of the spells, a factor that makes every novelty of Hoshigami useless until it becomes excessively frustrating, or even too simple. Pros: Excellent solid 3D audio and good detail RAP system and ~shoot~ attacks Cons: Gameplay unbalanced in favor of magic Uninspired design Inconsistent story Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Heart is available for Nintendo DS Hoshigami is a name that some may have heard before, a few years ago. It is in fact a game that came out some time ago on PSOne, which despite a good feeling and a decent realization has not been handed down to posterity as a masterpiece, due to some fairly serious problems it suffered from. Hoshigami is back today on Nintendo DS, an ideal game platform for this genre, that of strategic RPGs, thanks to its particular dual screen and touch screen hardware qualities. The developers have rewritten the story, modifying it and introducing new characters, the music has been revived and remixed andsome aspects related to the longevity and general difficulty of the game, notoriously too difficult, have been improved. This ~remake~ therefore has the aim of taking a product with potential appeal, restoring it in the least cared for aspects and re-proposing it to the general public in a new and improved way. Hoshigami is clearly inspired by the classics of the genre, with an isometric overhead view of the battlefield, recreated entirely in 3D and decorated with 2D elements. The characters themselves are drawn in bitmaps, with a purely Japanese style. Pressing the R or L triggers rotates the camera, literally circling it. By doing so all the sprites of the scenario will move accordingly in the selected direction. While thus maintaining a fully two-dimensional flavor, Hoshigami is played with a free camera that rotates at will, leaving us free to plan the action in the most effective way.", "date": "2008-01-11", "grade": null}
