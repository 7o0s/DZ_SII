{"name": "Flight Simulator X: Acceleration - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flight-simulator-x-acceleration-recensione.html", "text": "Where Tomcats Dare The main features of this expansion are numerous new missions, two planes, a helicopter, and a multiplayer mode to compete in adrenaline-pumping speed races. The first, and certainly the one that will be most successful among the new aircraft, is the F/A -18 Hornet, war jet designed in the late 70s and still used in the armies of many countries. The F/A-18 can attack air and ground targets, and is capable of approaching mach 2. Thanks to these characteristics, the F/A-18 hands down outclasses any other aircraft in Flight Simulator X, and will become certainly the favorite of many players. From the past comes the P-51D Mustang, a combat aircraft designed in the 1940s and used in the Second World War by the US Army which flew in the skies until 1957. Where Tomcats Dare Acceleration presents its racing variant (hence the letter ~D~), with tricks that increase the power delivered and facilitate handling, allowing reckless manoeuvres. The third and last new entry is the EH-101 helicopter, designed for military use (even our Navy has adopted it) but also used in the civil sector. The additional missions are really well thought out and varied: each of them has its own little scripted ~plot~, and the player has to play his role. In one of these you even have to intercept a UFO over the famous Area 51 in the United States. The various tutorials have also increased, and in this case it is very useful to tackle the training mission that explains the little secrets of airplane speed races: better trajectories, departures, ways to make the engine overheat as little as possible. Multiplayer For the management of online games, Microsoft has created a sort of browser where you can check existing games and take part in them, or create a customized one. The first notable competitions are Red Bull racing, where drivers are often called upon to perform breathtaking acrobatic maneuvers. Speed races can be of different types, from a sort of ~circuits~, relatively short and repetitive like any car or motorbike competition, to real distance challenges, where passing through predetermined stages you grind mile after mile. It is also possible to participate in rescue missions in cooperative mode. Graphics and sound The Acceleration expansion confirms Flight Simulator X as a game that is certainly beautiful to look at, even if not exactly extraordinary (time passes for flight simulators too). The very high standards of the series are however respected, guaranteeing excellent polygonal models of the aircraft and faithful and detailed cockpits. The overall heaviness is slightly increased, but no medium-high level PC equipped with a good amount of RAM should have particular problems running the game at maximum level of detail. As for the audio sector, we point out good sound effects and discreet music. Acceleration will not make its detractors fall in love with Flight Simulator, but it certainly adds something more to the famous flight simulator, adding a little spice and light-heartedness to the usual mechanics. Of course, for those who already have twenty thousand community-made add-ons installed on their PC, it may not be such an attractive purchase, but it is certain that the missions and aircraft offered here are all of excellent quality, and the multiplayer turns out to be quite fun.
