First of all, it should be noted that the game can be played with or without the aid of certain aids. By default we find ourselves analyzing three-dimensional backdrops where the movement is not free, but limited to the predefined possibilities of rotation, zoom and little else. Whenever the aforementioned actions can be carried out, the indicator turns green, allowing us a better analysis. When you see something singular or important, you can aim with the pointer and, if the object is active, a green ~toolbox~ appears. At this point we just have to select the right analysis tool. These are the ones to which the saga has accustomed us by now: luminol, cameras, various powders for collecting fingerprints, plaster for casts, torches, but also simple tweezers and latex gloves to pick up objects. Obviously by disabling the aids there are no more cursors that turn green and everything remains more difficult, but also perhaps less intuitive and distracting. The advice is therefore to leave these aids active also in order not to lose the thread among the many elements put on the plate. Once all the evidence has been collected, which is not too difficult, we move on to the laboratory to analyze it. Here you can compare and search fingerprints in databases, use an electron microscope, search for DNA and make the necessary comparisons, view videos and listen to recordings, analyze computer data, reconstruct objects, do ballistic tests, etc. All the action takes place through basic actions, such as putting together limited parts of fingerprints or joining the streaks on a bullet, or very simple mini-games, such as putting together the various three-dimensional puzzles. All decidedly limited All that remains is to question the various suspects/protagonists. This is perhaps the most boring aspect of the title since it consists of listening or reading - the title is excellently subtitled in Italian, but poorly dubbed in English - a series of very long and wordy dialogues. On the one hand they serve to create the story, on the other they are really too long... Finally, the inevitable morgue appears where information on the bodies found is provided, Brass's office where warrants can be requested and a garage where to examine any vehicles through the usual methods. Let's get a tooth out right away, the title is just mediocre. However, it still has strengths not to be despised and which are worth more than one try for those who are passionate about the series. The technical sector is very fluctuating, undermined everywhere by very showy shots both in the audio and in the few camera movements. The characters are just about decent with some cases, Grissom himself, where the resemblance is quite questionable. Made with very poor polygonal models and with very few animations, they don't make a good impression even during dialogues with eyes and blank stares and lip animations just mentioned. The scenarios for their part are sometimes rich in detail and well done sometimes poor and cheesy. The reuse of some backgrounds in the various cases is outrageous  remember that there are just five episodes  as well as some models such as, for example, the lower half of all the corpses with even the junction line with the upper part clearly visible Very bad finally, the digitalisations of the aerial views typical of the very low definition series. The music fails even in the slightest to reach those of the films as well as being boring and little. But what makes the title intriguing and noteworthy is the script of the cases. These do not disfigure with what was seen on television evenings and always know how to intrigue and leave you in suspense until the conclusion. There is no shortage of bizarre and strange stories, mutual hatreds, twins, blind wives, rock bands and strange museums! Sudden scene changes, excellent construction, and a skilful introduction of new elements that lead to the truth overshadow defects such as lack of interactivity and excessive linearity. Given that the game is based on these five cases  which are not few since it takes about twelve hours to complete them all  the judgment can only rise again. Comment If you wanted to recreate the spirit of the original CSI in a video game, the goal was undoubtedly achieved. The atmosphere is there, the characters are there, the cases are complex and bordering on credible too. Therefore, the illusion of being there is not lacking. All this and the beautiful plots and scripts manage to make the title reach and slightly exceed the sufficiency. Too bad for such a fluctuating technical realization and full of slowdowns. However, the bitter taste remains in the mouth, because with a little more of complexity, a few well-made minigames to collect and analyze the evidence and the elimination of long and boring dialogues would have created a title of undoubted depth and value. Pros Excellent adherence to TV series The plots of the cases are really beautiful Pleasant to play Cons Technical implementation to be reviewed Dialogues too verbose and boring Too simplistic and simplified", "date": "2008-05-08", "grade": null}
