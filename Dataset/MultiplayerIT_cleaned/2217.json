{"name": "Legends Of Wrestling", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legends-of-wrestling.html", "text": "Graphics and sound The first impact with the graphics could be summed up with a grimace of disappointment, the kind that persist on one's face during all the necessary tests that are the prelude to the actual review. The style used is very ~cartoon~ (perhaps someone will appreciate it) and is accompanied by a mediocre realization of the wrestlers, so much so as to make Giant Gram almost regret on Dreamcast (title, among other things, decidedly old, like the coin -op from which it is taken): the number of polygons is decidedly low, the textures are few and at least not very varied, polygons that interpenetrate each other, arenas and audience (in bitmaps) in the stands whose creation seems to date back to the (good) times of the first Playstation, few animations and poor intercalation between one movement and another, everything was made in an extremely indecorous way for the console that exclusively runs Jack And Dexter, Gran Turismo 3 and Virtua Fighter 4. As if all this were not enough, the frame rate is among the most unstable we have seen in recent times, almost constant thirty fps with (rare) peaks at sixty frames per second, make Legends Of Wrestling one of the best examples of unacceptable, poorly defined and jerky graphics. Compliments. A certain number of samplings of a more than fair level with normal music and sound effects close the (very sad) technical department of this Acclaim production (among other things responsible for the horrible Wrestlemania on Nes). Playability and longevity The game modes present are tournament, career and the classic exhibition; it is possible to organize one-on-one, two-on-two matches, complete with a referee controlled by a fifth human player (!!). From a new generation Wrestling game, one would expect the presence of various types of competitions (such as the mythical royal brawl), but unfortunately the lack of variety is just another of the many defects of Acclaim's Wrestling: an almost disastrous gameplay (made up of commands that do not respond immediately, interpenetration of polygons, few moves per fighter and counterattacks that are difficult to carry out) is the master, between the mediocre technical aspect described above and the long loading times. We are not. When the courier delivered the game to review it, the cover with the Wrestling greats from years ago had immediately given decidedly positive hopes, the possibility of having a well-made fighting game, with the potential of Playstation 2 well exploited and Hulk Hogan and beautiful company, controllable again. Laughable graphics, a negligible sound sector, long loading, disastrous playability completely sink the Acclaim game, one of the worst Wrestling games ever, as well as a new shining example of how NOT to program on the powerful black Sony monolith. Sin.. We are not. Pros: Hulk Hogan, Ted Di Biase, Bret Hart, etc 50/60 hz selector Cons: Technically horrid Absurd uploads Disastrous gameplay Heroes in plain sight About ten years ago they were like the Pokemon of now, what are we talking about? But of the legendary wrestlers of the WWF (World Wrestling Federation), huge guys who exalted, in the 80s and 90s, hordes of passionate teenagers who did not leave the house to see their favorites on TV or live (sometimes even in Italy) beat each other happily (so to speak, sometimes). Packets of figurines, action figures, specialized magazines, Wrestling had by now become a real fashion, able to excite and excite thanks to the high charisma of its most representative characters. It's hard to forget the emotion aroused by a royal rumble where wrestlers of the caliber of Ted ~million dollar man~ Di Biase, Hulk Hogan (for many the true symbol of the WWF), Andr The Giant, The Undertaker (the undertaker, from us), Ultimate Warrior and so on; the moments dedicated to the interviews were not to be missed, where more or less continuously the various challengers beautifully insulted each other, some unforgettable finals where almost continuously Hulk Hogan stood as the absolute ruler of the federation. The gaming world has certainly not been watching and hundreds have been the transpositions of this spectacular event into videogames, a pity that most of which (especially on 8-bit consoles) have been real bullshit, excluding a select few (good some of which, coin-ops). What was this long premise about the stars who were of Wrestling for? It serves toimmediately define the line up of wrestlers included in the video game package called Legends Of Wrestling, the latest video game released on the market inspired by the popular ~sport~, thus winking at those who, like myself, were fascinated by this world . However, seeing the final result, it was better to continue basking in the good memories of adolescence gone ......", "date": "2002-03-12", "grade": null}
