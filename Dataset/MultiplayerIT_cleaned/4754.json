The original idea, born from the mind of Chris Chung, was born long before Overwatch established itself on the market, effectively anticipating the new trend of arena shooters. Motiga, the development team behind the project, had set out to create a competitive game that blends the experiences of PvE dungeons with classic PvP skirmishes, throwing boss fights in small arenas in between. After a few months of testing, however, Chris must have realized that things worked better without those huge beasts clogging the shooting lines and from there he therefore decided to substantially change his perspective on the title, transforming Gigantic into a hybrid between MOBA and shooter. Gone were the PvE battles, so were the arenas and two teams of five players competing for victory, a change in the running that actually slowed down development, moving the delivery deadline forward by a long time. Meanwhile Motiga was looking for commercial partners and the decision to develop the title as an exclusive Microsoft brought unexpected problems, and the game was in danger of going belly up several times, at least until Perfect World bought the intellectual property by pouring into the coffers of Motiga enough money to continue development. Today Gigantic finally arrived on Xbox One and PC, and we are therefore ready to evaluate it in its full version. Two guardians to defend Gigantic is halfway between an arena shooter and a MOBA as we said. Five players per team have the task of attacking and killing the guardian of the opposing team and all this while trying to massacre each other in the center of the few but well-structured arenas available. The third-person view, which unites the title more to SMITE than to League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm, implies that players will have to pull out their best aim both to hit opponents and to use skills and Skillshots. Many of the characters present are great ranged hitters while there are still few support heroes based mainly on heals and shields. It is something that we frankly appreciated and, although they do their duty when coordinated with the rest of the team, it is difficult to miss a character healer if this is not in the group, thanks to the hybridization of the classes. Voden, for example, is a kind of horned fox armed with a bow that can cause moderate damage over a distance and poison enemies but also has two healing potions to keep the party alive. However, they are not treatments capable of revolutionizing a fight but rather to facilitate recovery immediately after a fight or give that little protection essential for survival. The real tip of the balance, as far as we have seen, is therefore coordination with the front-line classes, often capable of repelling shots and bullets and being of greater help to the group. The limitation of the treatments on Gigantic is most likely due to the possibility of summoning huge creatures with different characteristics onto the field. In some specific areas of the map, by spending some Focus, it is possible to recall beings who reveal invisible enemies, who modify the accesses to the various areas of the map, who inflict area damage or who, precisely, are able to heal neighboring characters. These beasts play a fundamental role in the economy of the game since the sectors controlled by them are an inexhaustible source of energy points, an indispensable statistic to launch the attack against the enemy base and they will defend it in our place until their death allowing players to roam freely around the map with greater peace of mind than similar games. Defense is the best defense Brute force on Gigantic is basically useless if not supported by a good strategy. Each match is divided into phases, each of which requires one of the teams to fill the power bar before the opposing team to launch its attack. Every action performed successfully during the match, whether it is the collection of energy at the control points or a kill, contributes to the accumulation of power, making each round particularly intense and giving the disadvantaged team the opportunity to almost always recover the situation . Once the bar has been filled, your guardian will start the attack by knocking down the opposing colossus and exposing the only weak point thanks to which to inflict a wound on him, then repeating the procedure until the three total lives have been removed. It is at this moment that the clash comes alive and the action becomes crackling, enhancing the gameking and, from the point of view of e-sports, also the public that follows the clash. Gigantic is in fact a very nice title to look at and particularly aesthetically cared for. However, the decision to use a light engine paid off and the cel shading style gives an extremely appreciated cartoon aspect, with good animations and truly charismatic characters. There are about twenty heroes on the servers at the moment and many of them are perfectly distinguishable from the mass of all the same characters proposed by the genre in recent years. Sure, the skills look alike and are more or less all already seen, but it's the first time they've been placed in such a context and they work more than very well. The only regret that we feel like underlining in this circumstance is the only partial choice to give an animalistic aspect to the champions. Keeping animals as a reference for each individual hero would have made the difference even more and given a distinctive imprint to the production of Motiga. Few irons in the fire, for now The skills of each individual champion are all available from the beginning with the possibility of enhancing them following some specific branches as experience points and levels are obtained in the game. In addition to the basic blow and three complementary skills, there is obviously a final move capable of changing the fate of a duel which, however, must be used sparingly since it uses focus, the same resource that must be spent to summon creatures on control points, another distinctive element that adds an extra pinch of strategy to the usual and more banal control of cooldowns. Unfortunately Gigantic then collapses when you go to analyze the actual content of the game: despite being a free to play, with some packages at a negligible cost to buy to get the initial bundle of heroes (and another for 30 euros with all the heroes current and future), at the moment it has only one game mode, some extra skins and some creatures to buy with credits but it stops there. There are still no ranked games or content to help break the routine a bit, they are probably in future projects for the company but at the moment we don't know when and if they will arrive on the servers. Even the cost of the heroes, for those who do not want to shell out a euro, is quite prohibitive given that the currency necessary to buy them accumulates extremely slowly, giving you one every two weeks or so by playing assiduously. The matches give you few coins and the bulk of your income will come from the daily quests, available in extremely limited numbers. Consider that on average each mission gives you between 40 and 70 doubloons and to buy a sample you will need between five and thirteen thousand. Fortunately, the free rotation comes to our rescue with six free heroes a week, a more than satisfactory pool to take the first steps and buy the hero we like best.", "date": "2017-07-28", "grade": "7.8"}
