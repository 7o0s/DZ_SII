{"name": "Chaser", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chaser.html", "text": "I don't even have a slingshot, but I can find a machine gun for sure on the street! The title of the paragraph in a certain sense illustrates what the classic video game character usually finds on the street; rest assured that it will hardly hit the enemy with stones on the forehead or spitting in the eye, on the contrary, almost certainly on the road full of dangers an ultra-technological machine gun and a couple of uzis will always find them. And as it happens Chaser does not deny himself: pistols, a triplet of machine guns of various calibers, a nice double-barreled shotgun, a series of silent and non-silent sniper rifles, and last but not least, the lemon ~grenadine~ to make better digest lead to opponents! Certainly, you will say, but what do I need all this armament for? But obviously to help the soul of the opponents to reach the bright firmament as soon as possible, since they too will try to do the same with you... and without many compliments! Already, the AI (artificial intelligence, for the layman) of the enemies is not as they say state of the art, but the number of them will make the difference. Indeed, in the first levels everything seems to go smoothly: you eliminate about fifty enemies without many worries, but when you get to fight against Japanese ninjas who bounce like crickets from one part of the map to the other, then the time has come to show off the wildest adrenaline. Needless to do it on purpose, in Chaser there is a Matrixian ~bullet time~ model option, which slows down the time flow and allows you to ~kill~ the most fiery enemies gently and quietly. Paradoxically, this option, which adds a lot on the cinematographic side, takes away from the game a large part of the fun brought by the ~I'll kill you fast as soon as I see you!~, so I strongly advise against its use, except in really furious scrums (like that of the defense of the transport wagon inside the warehouse). Finally, the usual medicinal junk restores energy and the Kevlar bodice scattered around the maps or released by the corpses of the opponents, will allow an increased longevity of our hero, who will have to use them with calculated parsimony willy-nilly. But how I love to shatter the neighbor's window! We come to the technical sector of the game. Chaser sports a modern and accurate graphics engine, the CloakNT Engine, which in addition to exploiting the DirectX libraries, also relies on the latest technological discoveries of ATI / NVidia graphics cards (more to the latter, sincerely). Therefore, without mentioning mysterious words such as vertex pixels, smoothvision or various anisotropic filters, the following can be summarized in short and simple words: you can shatter the windows and enjoy watching the pieces fall realistically on the ground; you shoot into the water and the bullets disturb its motion(!); some objects respond in a physically realistic way to events (explosions, complete with particle effects); galore volumetric lights, with misty stratification to increase the scenic effect; jets of steam and waterfalls calculated in real time, with exemplary graphic rendering. In short, the graphics engine has been exploited properly, even if some flaws still exist, such as the not exactly excellent interference of the characters with the structure of the map (the dead man lying in the middle of the doors or sticking out of the walls like a ghost never fails ) or the excessive drop in the framerate in the areas where several windows are shattered at the same time (in particular, the Japanese hotel has a double-storey room full of glass partitions and trying to throw a grenade leads to a ~bullet time~ not required.), also because the computer has to calculate in real time the path that each single piece of glass follows, including the rebounds they make against the walls and the floor! The opening/closing level and interlude films are shot with the same graphic engine and show off a remarkable mastery in directing: the protagonist's flashbacks have sudden and sinuous camera movements, with some accompanying slow motion, which, pressed by a average quality soundtrack, will bring to the game a clearly cinematic style. Of course, in the long run, seeing them again makes them monotonous, but it is possible to bypass them with a simple push of a button (in the face of Unreal 2 which imperiously forced us to watch its long and boring cutscenes.). Sometimes it will happen to be ~prey~ to flashbacks in the middle of the action, further increasing the mental clearing effect that invests the protagonist as the levels progress. When I get to the end, will I want to start over? It's the butthe constant year of almost all singleplaying First Person Shooter: the poor longevity brought by the fixed position of the opponents. The surprise effect already falls from the second attempt to pass a certain area of any level. The repetitiveness brought about by knowing that in that given place there is that given enemy in the end inevitably tends to severely flatten the playability and consequently the longevity, reducing everything to the usual and sudden save / load game, to try to eradicate the enemy taking as little damage as possible and with fewer blows inflicted. It is normal that once the game has been completed it will be difficult to resume playing it again, above all considering that today's player has less and less free time available, also given the deluge of similar titles published every year. The downside is provided by the multiplayer section. The adversaries, being ~human~, do not remain in fixed positions or follow established paths: they are absolutely unpredictable. And that's what's missing from all singleplaying titles of today and yesterday: the unpredictability of knowing what your opponent will do to thwart your path to victory. And unfortunately Chaser, like the future Doom 3, will suffer the same fate as the titles of the past: leaning on the shelf to gather dust. Unavoidable. ... and then we might as well play it in multiplayer! As mentioned in the previous paragraph, Chaser has a substantial multiplayer section, which contains more or less the objective-based game styles of many similar titles released in the last two years. In addition to the usual deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag, there is also the ~Shock Troops Mode~, which is nothing more than a game mode with multiple objectives of the type ~red team attacks~ and conquers the objectives, while ~blue team defends~ and protects targets from enemy assault. In practice the usual hackneyed sulfa, presented simply under another name. To make matters worse, the very few maps available (they can be counted on the fingers of one hand!), but a few days ago JooWood released a map pack of over 50 MB containing various extra official maps, so all you need to do is arm yourself with holy patience and start the download of the mega file, to increase the variety of maps in multi by a few points. Finally, the latest patch (to date 1.49), in addition to streamlining the netcode from some sporadic bugs, gives the possibility to as many as 128 (!) players to face each other together and from this point of view there are few titles that allow such a high number of users playing simultaneously. Conclusion Chaser, removed the flaw of longevity due to the excessive repetitiveness and linearity of the game, is still a good title. Technically speaking it is not an Unreal 2, but it is superior in playability. Nor is it a title that reserves many surprises, considering the mix of styles that fills it (a bit Half-Life, a bit Matrix, a bit SoF2) and the obligatory path to follow to complete the game, but that that it contains is exploited properly: the assaults that surround the crucial objectives are beautiful, the sound effects of the weapons and the loading of ammunition are truly excellent, which instill in the player the intoxicating desire to smash everything just to hear the full-bodied roar of a machine gun that shatters glass and reduces the adversary who is often behind it like a sieve; different environments in which the player finds himself (orbiting station close to structural collapse, cities hit by meteorites or beaten by incessant rain, the usual humid sewer to go through, huge purification or storage plants, oriental-style hotels and buildings, terraforming stations on distant Mars, etc...) and the excellent choice of using flashbacks to gradually unravel the skein and clarify the plot one piece at a time. These are the tricks that give the title a good rating, even if it leaves that bitter aftertaste of non-satisfaction, with the usual circumstantial phrase: more could have been done. Pros: Great texture. Graphics engine in step with the times. Quality weapons and sound effects. Lots of levels and different environments. Directing movies in a cinematic style. Cons: Excessive linearity in play. Predictability of opponents, with fixed locations. Few multiplayer maps. The numeric keypad enter is not configurable. Collision between the objects to be perfected. Premise John Chaser is the classic video game character: he wakes up half-crazed on the infirmary bed of a space base orbiting the Earth, just when a group of soldiers from who knows where burst into the station to kill - guess who - justour forgetful on duty! Obviously, like any classic clich such as ~boy perennially persecuted by bad luck~, our dear Johnny does not remember an emeritus stump, therefore, while the soldiers try to puncture his lower back (unloading 'only' half a quintal of bullets at him! ), has a hidden memory that strongly advises him to run away and think about later to remember why and how he is in quell'inguacchio! It is said that life is comparable to a box of chocolates: you never know what kind of bon-bon you'll get, but it seems to Johnny that they have assigned him a nice package of those with a counter-bow, considering that in the continuation of his adventure he will have to deal first with the Italian-American mafia (headed by a certain Vallero), then with the Japanese Yakutza, then with both put together (!) and then, for a change, he will also nice little trip to Mars to look there for the keystone that will open his mind and finally know who is the wife who certainly ~cuckolded~ him in his absence... beautiful as a happy ending, isn't it? ;)", "date": "2003-10-14", "grade": null}
