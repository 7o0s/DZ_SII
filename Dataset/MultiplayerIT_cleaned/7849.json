Unfortunately, it is also one of the less inspired spin-offs, designed above all for a childish audience and therefore devoid of all those refinements and complexities that make the mother series attractive even to players with a few years too many behind them. We'd like to think that the third dimension offered by Nintendo 3DS has given the guys at Chunsoft, who develop for Game Freak, the opportunity to take a step forward... but unfortunately that's not the case. Dreams about pokemon Still being an RPG, Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Portals to Infinity also offers a plot that gives meaning to our raids around the new dungeons. There are actually two narrative lines: in the main one, we will wake up after a horrible nightmare in which we saw a pokmon in danger, and we will discover that we have been transformed into a pokmon in turn. In which one, we will decide at the beginning, choosing between the omnipresent Pikachu, the funny Axew and the three starting pokmon of the fifth generation (Snivy, Tepig and Oshawott). Upon our awakening we will be greeted by a pokmon who will become our best friend (always chosen from those previously listed) and we will be introduced to the parallel storyline: in fact, we will decide to help our new friend build a real ~paradise for pokmon~, that is, a village equipped with all comforts. The two stories end up intertwining with each other, of course, and with a whole series of mini-stories related to a number of other pokmon, some of which will join our party. The plot obviously doesn't want to be that of a serious RPG, but it is still too cloying and childish: although it was certainly designed for a very young audience, it is impossible not to be perplexed by the naivety of many situations. The excessive prolixity of the texts and the length of the cutscenes make the unfolding of the events decidedly heavy and boring, and often one wonders why one wants to give so much emphasis to a story of so few pretensions. Fortunately, the technical sector is very pleasant: Portals to Infinity is the first fully polygonal Pokmon Mystery Dungeon, and it must be admitted that the developer has done an excellent job both from the point of view of polygonal modeling and animations. The settings are colorful and full of details, despite their repetitiveness, and the pokmon have been excellently made: from this point of view, the Chunsoft title will certainly be appreciated by the little ones thanks to the care with which the Nintendo little monsters have been transposed. The 3D effect Although it has no practical application, we must admit that the stereoscopic effect of Portals to Infinity is one of the best we've seen on the Nintendo laptop: the feeling of depth is always excellent and the game of shots embellishes the various cutscenes , opening a real window on this region of Unova. Boredom around the corner Unfortunately, it is not only the plot that suffers from the Peter Pan syndrome. By now, those who buy a Pokmon Mystery Dungeon already know what they are getting into, but this does not mean that the formula can be recycled indefinitely without making any significant improvements to a game system that has shown its side since its inception. The ability to build and expand the pokmon village is the main feature of this edition, but realistically it is a huge side mission that takes place almost automatically as you unlock and complete the various objectives of the game. The expansion of the country takes place mostly by finding particular objects at the bottom of the dungeons and delivering them to the pokmon who have asked us to find them, while the managerial functions are reduced to a minimum. However, you go to the dungeons to carry on the story, and even there you are faced with the usual mechanics: each floor is randomly generated and the player must explore it in search of chests to open and stairs that lead to the next floor. The fights follow a hybrid model that is part turn-based and part real-time, with the player using his alter ego's four special abilities: the low level of difficulty, however, makes the clashes a simple matter of button mashing, and the autonomous intervention of the pokmon who accompany us further simplifies things ... when they don't decide to uselessly waste theand their skills or to go about their business to look for treasures, perhaps even risking their skin (and game over) against other enemies, demonstrating a rather disappointing artificial intelligence. The excessive simplicity of the fights is also combined with that of the dungeons themselves, which only in the advanced stages of the game offer some noteworthy puzzles or obstacles. Players looking for more difficult challenges will be able to take advantage of the Metaportals, a feature that takes advantage of the console camera and augmented reality technology: the idea is to look for completely round objects that the game will transform into additional dungeons in which the power of the enemies and the quality of the treasures depend on the size and color of the object framed. The idea is nice and offers a fair longevity, but the mechanics didn't seem very precise to us, given that we often found ourselves framing objects that perfectly respected the indicated parameters without being able to open any Metaportal.", "date": "2013-05-08", "grade": "6.0"}
