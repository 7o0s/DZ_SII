{"name": "Final Fantasy III", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-iii-3.html", "text": "A tale from another time The splendid introduction in computer graphics reminds us how Square Enix is still an undisputed master in storytelling, and in a few minutes of FMV he presents us with the four protagonists of the adventure: Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus. Brought together almost by chance by the will of the Crystal, our young heroes must embark on a journey to locate and thwart the threat that threatens to destroy their world. Both the plot and the characterization of the various protagonists is rather light, entrusted above all to the dialogues and supporting actors: Final Fantasy III maintains the feeling of a fairy tale without too many pretensions, without space-time cataclysms or frustrated and complexed heroes, presenting all those clichs that have become such over the years and that have made us dream from chapter to chapter. Princesses to save, flying ships that sail through the clouds, mountains guarded by deadly dragons, caves full of monsters, rivers to navigate... Despite the simplicity of an old-fashioned product, Final Fantasy III is a fairy tale, light but captivating. The playful structure follows this lightness, but does not forgive mistakes: the remake par excellence by Square Enix is one of the most difficult RPGs ever made, above all due to some truly old-fashioned elements absent in the most recent video games, despite the linearity of the adventure and the simplicity of the various tasks that we will have to carry out to proceed in the story. From dungeon to dungeon, exploring mines and caves, crossing the colorful map aboard an airship, a canoe or a ship, careful planning of the growth of our four heroes must never be missing, otherwise the Game Over or obsolete and boring experience points and money ~grind~ sessions. Despite the simplicity of an old-fashioned product, Final Fantasy III is a fairy tale, light but captivating. The new job system Well, it's not really new, if anything it has been revised and re-proposed. It is not very different from what was seen in Final Fantasy Tactics, among other things, the concept is always the same: progressing through the story, new Jobs will become available to select for each of our protagonists, and the combinations are practically unlimited. In addition to truly classic and well-known Jobs such as Black Mage, White Mage or Monk, here are new more refined professions such as Magus, Scholar or Devout, for a total of about twenty Jobs, each with different abilities: while the Soldier, for example , is an ace in the use of heavy weapons and physical attack, the Evoker is able to call upon the arcane deities and unleash one of their magic at random... Knowing and knowing how to use each Job is the key to success in Final Fantasy III, considering above all that the game often requires the use of a Job or a certain skill in order to continue: just think of one of the initial phases, in which the Mini magic of the White Mage or Red Mage is necessary to shrink the party to introduce it in some microscopic locations. This structuring of the game therefore imposes a careful management of the party, also considering that the experience level of a character and his Jobs do not coincide: that is to say that Luneth can be level 18, with the Black Belt profession at level 9 and the Dragoon at level 5. Planning the growth of our heroes to avoid brutal game sessions dedicated to upgrading Jobs, or unbridled ~grind~ of monsters to have all Jobs for all characters always ready for any eventuality? It is up to the player to decide. Fabulous programming Praises and congratulations to Square Enix for the work done with this revival of an 8-bit classic, which on DS has earned the gift of the third dimension together with a careful restyling of environments, characters and creatures. It goes without saying that we have a little gem of programming in our hands and undoubtedly the best product made so far for DS, from a graphic and sound point of view. Very fluid, full of details, colorful, artistically impeccable... Final Fantasy III strikes - and does so with class - in every aspect, from the exquisite stylization of the new character design (which recalls that of Final Fantasy Tactics, and not by chance) to the attention to detail of environments, spells, contour elements such as the zoom that highlights the quality of textures and modeling, as well as secret passages and objects to collect. Touches of class abound, such as the costumes of the Jobs that change according to the character, perfectly in style with it and its character, or the supporting characters who enter the scene during a fight and help the party by healing it or attacking enemies. One small surprise after another, which will perhaps make more modern players turn up their noses in some cases, while pufans and longtime fans will be moved by some ingenuity that arrived in 2007 by stealth. To accompany the graphic orgy that is Final Fantasy III there is an extraordinary soundtrack, which enhances the already excellent technical sector thanks to the variety and quality of the many songs in the background of wanderings, battles and cutscenes. Fabulous programming Succulent and perfect donut, then? Unfortunately not, as Square Enix underestimated a crucial element in the making of this remake: the console on which it was developing it. Nintendo DS makes us think of two things, first of all: touch-screen and dual screen. The first feature has been duly considered: Final Fantasy III can be played both in the old fashioned way and with the stylus, fully supported, and which allows you to select the various options, navigate through the menus and move around the environments in a quick, intuitive and painless. The choice is up to the player, and the two control modes are perfectly complementary and can be switched at any time. Unfortunately, however, the Dual Screen has not been exploited for practically anything, if not for a directorial choice concerning some cutscenes or the world map if you travel outside villages or dungeons. For the rest, during battles or exploration of labyrinths or closed rooms, the upper screen of the DS remains completely black, empty, defunct. The lack of ideas or will to exploit a key feature of the Nintendo handheld, perhaps isolated out of haste or laziness, is therefore disappointing. The lack of upper screen utilization is simply a drop in the ocean of high quality that is Final Fantasy III. Square Enix's remake succeeds in the very difficult task of maintaining a very classic feeling, fitting it into a modern product from a technical point of view, which on a laptop like the DS seems almost miraculous. Technically exceptional and flawless, with beautiful music and a light but engrossing storyline, Final Fantasy III is a dream for longtime JRPG fans, while presenting a decent wall for new players accustomed to more recent products of the same genre. The Job System, deep and varied, is still a few spans below the one already admired in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, but it intertwines perfectly and coherently with the old-style play structure of this JRPG. Complete the picture a wireless option that allows you to exchange letters with other players, unlocking small secret goodies: quite useless, but pleasant. Pros Technically lovely Simple and rewarding old-style gameplay Long lasting and addictive Cons Unused top screen A bit too old-fashioned by modern standards Perhaps it will be a stalemate, or the lack of ideas in this period in which the consoles show their teeth and their revolutionary capabilities, but it seems that by now the path of the past is the one to follow, for the software houses, in the moments in which in playrooms there are holes to fill. In truth, the portings of Final Fantasy date back to the golden age of PlayStation One, when Square Enix produced small compilations with the historical episodes of the saga, building on the success of the most recent chapters in the West: until then, Final Fantasy he had had a decidedly complicated history of translating. All the historical episodes of the series were reproduced on Game Boy Advance, even those for NES never dragged out of Japan almost twenty years ago, but for the first time it is with Final Fantasy III, on DS, that Square Enix decides to make more than a simple port. Warning: Final Fantasy III is not the Final Fantasy III released in America in 1994, that was actually Final Fantasy VI in Japan, and it is in fact under this name that the Game Boy Advance port will be released in the coming months. The Final Fantasy III that we are about to review is exactly the original, released in 1990 for the Famicom, in Japan, with the small difference that we are in 2007, which runs on the Nintendo DS and which, to begin with, is in three dimensions.", "date": "2007-02-14", "grade": null}
