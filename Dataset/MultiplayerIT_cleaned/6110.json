{"name": "Ho visto la luce!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154972-the-flock-ho-visto-la-luce.html", "text": "The Flock is the classic title that is great on paper, but with obvious limitations in the making. It is an asynchronous multiplayer game of the horror genre, in which players guide the Flock, long-limbed creatures with great agility, who must take possession of the ~artifact of light~, a sphere that projects a wide beam of light. The main objective of the game is to follow the light by tearing its owner to pieces At the beginning of each game you enter one of the three available maps and start hunting for the powerful object, whether it is still untouched or already in the hands of another Flock. When a Flock grabs the artifact it becomes the Carrier and starts accumulating points. The asymmetry of the gameplay lies precisely in this transition of state: both the Flocks are agile, i.e. capable of running at great speed and making incredible leaps, and the carriers are slow and clumsy, i.e. unable to jump and much slower in running when they had their hands free. The only weapon that protects them from the fury of their opponents is the artifact's beam of light, capable of burning them instantly. Too bad the hunters have their own countermeasure, that is, they can become immobilized by becoming stone so as not to suffer any damage even when fully invested by the light. The gameplay is all resolved in this alternation, in which the hunters yearn to become prey and try to keep possession of the artifact for as long as possible, going around the map in search of power points which, if activated with light , yield many points (two are enough to get very close to victory). The maps are nice, but not suitable for a horror game The Flock, on the other hand, just have to be able to tear them apart. It is not possible to attack other Flocks, except when a carrier is torn to pieces causing a great explosion of light which destroys all the hunters it invests (but without scoring). Whoever manages to fill the score bar first, retaining possession of the artifact, wins. Now let's try to explain the first problem that emerged from our test: what is described is not a mode of the game or a fraction of it, but it is almost the entire game. Apart from the tutorial, there really isn't much else, except the kill counter announced with great fanfare by Vogelslap, the developer. After each kill, one unit is taken from the world's Flock population. When the counter reaches zero, the game will be deactivated, in the sense that it will no longer be purchasable. At that point a final event will start of which nothing is known yet. The only certainty is that after that the game will become inaccessible and will no longer be playable in any way. Currently the counter has more than two hundred million units, so we can't tell you how long it will take to reach zero. A lot will depend on the success of the whole operation (more players, more deaths, of course). The question we ask ourselves, however, is another: is it worth participating? Fear? No Honestly, the curiosity for this kind of sociological experiment is great and also the sympathy we bring to it. In an era in which to see the ending of a game you have to hope that it sells little, because otherwise it is immediately transformed into a series, knowing of a title designed to end in absolute terms intrigues us a bit. When you take possession of the artifact you become the prey Unfortunately, from a playful point of view, The Flock is very limited. It would be improper to bring up sources of inspiration such as Left4Dead or the recent Evolve, because here the production values are completely different. This does not mean that a few hours are enough to start feeling a certain sense of tiredness in starting a new game. The problem is that Vogelslap has failed to untie a fundamental knot, that is, it has failed in its intention to create a multiplayer game that is really scary. In theory, the tension should arise not only from the extremely dark graphics, with desolate and foggy scenarios that strongly recall a certain modern Gothic tradition, but also from the behavior of the players themselves. Having the artifact of light in your hand and feeling hounded by other players should at least be intimidating, but it isn't. The creepy sound effects and sudden distortions of the screen are not enough to make the player tremble, who unfortunately while playing is aware that, however horrific, there are human beings behind the Flock. The gameplay that arises from the opposition between the carrier trying to hit the Flock with light and the latter using petrification to get close to the artifact, has little to do with horror and turns everything into a kind of complex ~ one two three, star~. Initially it is also fun, but soon, as there are no variations to thebasic formula, we find ourselves hoping to die just to bring the meter down. We review The Flock, a horror that promises to disappear when its population is exterminated The meaning of life The three maps, despite being quite varied, help little to relieve the player of the sense of discouragement that takes him after a few games. One is set in a suburb of an unnamed city, another in a mountain temple, and the third in a cave. What will be at the end of the counter? Here too a problem arises, which the player perceives almost immediately: it is clear that they are maps designed for multiplayer, therefore as arenas. This is a subtle observation, because horror requires a particular map design based on certain principles, which aim to obtain certain effects. Obviously for a title like The Flock it was not possible to conceive claustrophobic environments to travel at a snail's pace for fear of turning every corner. Here the creatures must dart up stairs and slopes and must have the right spaces to show off their agility. The desired effect seems to be more that of a Predator-like horror, but the final result is far from succeeding. In short, the promise of a multiplayer horror seems largely failed. For the rest, to understand the success or otherwise of the game, we will have to wait for the reaction of the players: will they get involved in the death counter? Will they be curious to know how it ends? Or will they be completely indifferent to the whole operation, perhaps waiting for the much publicized final surprise to be shown in the inevitable YouTube video? Which then, thinking about it, the concept of The Flock reminds us of another well-known title that promised to reveal the meaning of life to the lucky player who had removed the last cube.
