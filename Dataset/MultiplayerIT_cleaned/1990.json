{"name": "La Cosa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-cosa.html", "text": "THE BEGINNING OF FEAR The plot of the game follows the same settings and places that were seen in the 1982 film; we will play the character of Captain Blake who, with his rescue team, will have to keep a report on an accident that took place near the cold Antarctica. The initial presentation sees Blake's team land near a destroyed laboratory with which all contact has been lost. But the hostile temperature and the perennial mists of those places make everything more difficult and isolate the rescue team who are forced to act with the sole aid of the radio. After the brief but comprehensive presentation, the game begins in the cold ice of Antarctica and everything does not bode well. Everything is well packaged right from the start, the feeling of anguish is very strong and well reproduced and the fidelity of the scenarios to the film is impressive. Nothing seems copied from other Japanese productions that we know well; the game starts very different from the usual and the peculiarity of controlling a team rather than a single hero makes it very original. Interaction with the rest of the team is the peculiarity of the game: all team members will have to cooperate to succeed in the enterprise, and the dialogues represented by the icons on the characters' heads make everything more immediate. The non-interactive sequences are the strong point of the game, they explain in a reasoned way what is happening in that hell, forcing the player to pause to think about what to do. From this point of view, the designers of the Black Label are to be commended: the use of these pauses in key places make the title different from the usual ~shoot and blast everything!~. UNITY IS STRENGTH The strategic component of which The Thing makes good use is the key to understanding the game: you will be forced to shoot, to kill, to solve the cursed puzzles, but everything must be done as a team. Many times you will have to ask your doctor for help because you are almost infected; other times it will be necessary to rely on the engineer to overcome impossible passages and the survivors will give, as far as they can, useful information and possible help. The survival horror genre is seen as follows: the exploration and fighting base is all there, but what makes this title anomalous is that there are various elements of multiple genres mixed together; this, however, is not necessarily a good thing. Purists of the horror genre may be disappointed. A note of merit goes to the dialogues between the team and the possibility of very in-depth interaction between the group; Let me explain: after a few hours of play it will be possible to verify that your team members are disheartened and no longer want to follow you, or if you shoot someone from your team, they will turn against you. The presence of the ~moral~ factor (on each character there will be an icon that symbolizes the mood) is an addition that I personally don't like but which makes everything more similar to reality. GAMEPLAY AND BEYOND After learning the commands and getting to know the team members, you will find yourself in the middle of the action, in the midst of various collapses and explosions of all kinds. Your team will follow you everywhere, never getting in the way of the action and many times they will prove useful in firefights by lending a hand with the artillery. The artificial intelligence of the companions turns out to be good and well structured: it will be possible to interact through an icon menu where all the characters will be managed. The management of this menu seemed to me not suitable for a more action-oriented player; I personally think it is a useless and not very credible move. Apart from that, the team performs well and will never get in the way of game action. The action is well balanced compared to other markedly arcade titles, the tactical component is of a good level and the exploration of the environments and the resolution of the puzzles is quite varied and well calibrated. The non-player characters have a prominent role that is not usually found in other titles: we will be able to talk to the survivors or try to help them and even shoot them when we don't trust them. Going forward for the research center you will be able to collect many objects: weapons such as pistols, machine guns, grenades, flamethrowers; first aid kit, common tools (torches, blowtorch) and miscellaneous items such as flares. Inventory management leads the player to plan his own moves and managing it carefully will serve to get out of Antarctica safely. The positioning of the objects is not very sensible, in my opinion, and the position of the ammunition with respect to the medkits is not calibrated: critical situations are almost never encountered but some ammunition imore would not have spoiled. The goals are simple and clear from the start; the rescues are infinite and possible in pre-established places. On the playability front, the situation is dubious: on the one hand we note the excellent work in the editing phase of the characters and the very successful interaction between them, on the other we see the sufficiency of the commands given to the team members: the character management system is difficult and unintuitive. Shooting is simple, aiming perfectly is impossible. I don't agree with the choice of the fire button on the trigger, but these are tastes! The player's movements are not the most fluid and seem at times robotic and not very loose. The game engine performs well and in the busiest situations it doesn't seem to be affected by the drop in frame-rate, but by now the Xbox has got us used to this. The view of the game is a classic third person with the possibility of making it in subjective and shooting in subjective. The management of the environments is plausible and treated in terms of detail, even if there is no lack of disappearances of various shadows. The music is well made and helps the player immerse himself in the full game. An honorable mention should be made to the dubbing completely in Italian even in speech, the voices are well distributed and the acting is convincing. TRY AGAIN YOU WILL BE LUCKY! Without joking too much, this title is convincing in its scenic but not technical realization: the settings are well recreated, the characters of the team characters are well built, the interiors are well done, even if the structures are all a bit similar. The firefights are very limited by the environments and the ammunition and sometimes with the flamethrower we will get hurt more than they; the enemies are big and scary but they all look a bit like each other and have little average intelligence. The very low longevity certainly doesn't help, given the average price of current games. In short, not bad, but zombies are scarier. Pros: Compelling environments Above average voice acting Innovation of the survival horror genre Cons: Low longevity A.I. below average Graphic not exciting Materials: Official site preview English version exclusive movies Intro Action, Menu, New Game 1, New Game 2 Italian version exclusive movies Intro, In-Game 1, In-Game 2, Level 1, Headshot THE THING In recent years, horror film productions on the big screen have lagged behind in terms of pure terror and gore to the nth degree. The Thing, the well-known horror film by John Carpenter, on the other hand, is an old-fashioned horror that scared a generation of kids as soon as it came out. The American-made film dated 1982 was a good example of a dark and highly distressing science fiction film. Given the relative young age of the Microsoft console, there are no titles that can resemble this Black Label Games game, since all the titles released so far are not comparable in genre to this The Thing; and this only benefits the title itself as the competition has not yet expressed itself on the matter (any reference to Capcom is purely coincidental).", "date": "2002-10-07", "grade": null}
