Aliens: Fireteam Elite, the first work of Cold Iron Studios, does not escape this rule, as evidenced by the three million views obtained by the trailers on YouTube. Will he be able to reconcile the creatures conceived by Giger and Rambaldi with the gaming public, still traumatized by Aliens: Colonial Marines? We will explain it in the course of our review of Aliens: Fireteam Elite. However, we can anticipate that, despite being far from the abyss touched by the Gearbox fps, the Focus product warms the heart of only a very specific slice of enthusiasts. Certainly not for those looking for breathtaking graphics: respect for the stylistic elements of the Alien saga is maximum, but in terms of animations and textures it seems to have come out five or six years ago. It doesn't matter to those with an easy trigger, the real target of this all-substantial action: to revive the fortunes of the franchise, the developers have in fact chosen a game structure based on more frenetic action, creating a third-person cooperative ~horde shooter~ that recalls for mechanics Left 4 Dead and for visual World War Z, another game with cinematic roots. Hoenikker, Katanga, SN/TH/YA... but who came up with the names? The dismal atmosphere of Alien The story takes place twenty-three years after the events recounted in the third film, although it is not connected in any way. The war between colonial marines and xenomorphs ended with a victory for the latter, who have multiplied to excess. From the Katanga refinery on planet LV-895 comes a request for help from Professor Hoenikker, the last survivor of an alien attack. Once rescued, we discover that in the nearby caves there may be other survivors who escaped the fury of the Weyland-Yutani synthetics, but will it really be so? Told mainly by the unbearable voice of Lieutenant Herrera and by dialogues aboard the spaceship / hub Endeavor , the plot remains in the background without ever catching the eye. Unfortunately, it is sunk by a dubbing (in English only) which is a candidate by right among the worst of the year, between meaningless intonations and incorrect indications. Too bad because on the other hand the soundtrack is really good. The campaign is divided into four acts, each of which is made up of three chapters, of which initially only the first is selectable. The enemy creatures come mainly from the canonical universe of Alien, but also partly from that of the prequel, for a bestiary that reaches twenty units. The structure of the levels is identical to itself from the first to the last minute of the campaign: lobbies, squares or more or less large halls are the arenas in which the carnage of xenomorphs takes place. They are connected by almost empty corridors that you will want to go through as soon as possible, even overlooking the fact that, hidden here and there, there are collectibles. This is because one immediately realizes that exploration is barren: the apparently interesting alleys lead to paths blocked by rocks, while the doors that overlook the corridors are all closed. There is only one obligatory direction, however indicated by a cursor, and there are no variations on the theme. Shoot, reload, shoot The settings are inspired by the film saga, in particular by Clash Finale. Unfortunately, apart from some scenographic areas (such as the room with the gigantic head at the beginning of the second act), they are bare and a bit anonymous. The only elements with which to interact are the covers, not very effective, and the boxes of explosives positioned in strategic points to slow down the enemy advance. The action stubbornly follows a tried and tested scheme: you arrive in a room infested with aliens, initially small size; as they are neutralized the swarm continues to pour on the players with increasingly resistant and pernicious enemies. The highlights are those of the sieges that are activated after the flip of a switch, giving a minimum of time to prepare the defenses before seemingly endless attacks that culminate with the descent into the field of the most difficult xenomorphs. In this hackneyed structure, the element of originality is represented by the aliens. As the films teach us, they can also come from the ceiling, the floor or the ~fucking walls~, using grates and ventilation ducts: this makes the covers not very effective and forces not only to move continuously, but to have a constant eye on the 'iconic proximity radar. The absence of variations on the theme that would have ensured greater variety is felt. Specialists The developers offer five mi professionsfour of which are available from the first minute, while the fifth (reconnaissance) is unlocked only after completing the campaign. The specializations are those to which titles of this kind have accustomed us, therefore we find the machine gun, a classic all-rounder good for any occasion; the demolisher who can handle heavy weapons; the technician and his deadly portable turret; the doctor, the only one to rely on to restore health; the scout with its support gadgets. The player's progression is stratified both through the experience accumulated by the character and from that obtained with the use of weapons. In the first case, by leveling up, new skills are unlocked, divided into cores and modifiers which in turn can be universal or specific depending on the class. These perks are represented in the form of rectangles or squares to be inserted into a matrix on whose sides are the salient characteristics of the class which preclude the installation of certain types of modifiers. To give a practical example, the technician cannot link the extended duration to the turret ability, because the latter remains on the field until it is destroyed; vice versa it can do it with charged coils, devices that emit electric discharges which in this way increase their effectiveness. The intertwining of the modifiers is an aspect which, while not new, is implemented in an excellent way and above all is concretely appreciable on a mission. The arsenal is also well done, which faithfully reproduces the Hollywood one, complete with decals. In addition to the aesthetic aspect, the feeling of rifles and pistols is also satisfactory, albeit with ups and downs. Among the less successful ones, the Pulse Rifle that Aligi Comandini complained about in our test, while the short-range ones, such as the shotgun, know how to be ignorant to the right point. As mentioned, weapons also increase their stats with use; in addition, each has three slots in which to install modifications to reduce its reload times, increase its range, improve its accuracy and so on. These upgrades are not tied to the character's class; therefore, the Kramer Magnum maintains its grade regardless of whether it is contested by a technician or a physician. Alone or in company By now it should be clear: Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a title that makes recurrence one of its cornerstones, because only by continuing to kill xenomorphs can improvements (even aesthetic) be obtained for your fighter. Adding to the replayability rate comes the horde mode, which is unlocked after finishing the campaign. Then there are the daily challenges and the ~malus~ cards, which further raise the challenge rate in the face of an experience multiplier. The risk of boredom, high due to the very structure of the game and the reduced number of maps, should be avoided by the cooperative nature which is limited to the internet (no local network, unfortunately). Even when playing offline, the team must consist of three elements; if this is not possible, the remaining two are controlled by an unsatisfactory AI that is usable only up to the normal difficulty level (the second out of five). Already starting from the third, errors are much less tolerated and the need to be supported by something more than two simple machine gunners is felt, given that it is not possible to choose the class of the Alpha and Beta bots. About ten hours are required to complete the campaign on a normal level, some of which are spent on gaining experience. During our tests we ran into only one block of the game; the most annoying bug is represented by a delay in the response of the commands, which sometimes seem not to be understood. It happens, in the most frenetic moments, that you have to press the left mouse button several times to start shooting.", "date": "2021-08-23", "grade": "6.5"}
