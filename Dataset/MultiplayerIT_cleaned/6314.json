The complete series consists of six English-language episodes. The following text is reasonably devoid of anticipation. When Telltale Games announced a series based on Game of Thrones, we thought it was its trump card. Instead the first two episodes, as well written as ever, seemed to herald a much less exciting season than that of The Walking Dead or A Wolf Among Us. Well, apparently we were wrong: The Sword in the Darkness is the episode that finally made us take this new series seriously. Meanwhile, already from the first image we noticed an improvement from a graphic point of view. The backgrounds are still dull and barely mentioned, a plague that afflicts Telltale's prehistoric game engine, but now the brush effect with which the textures were created makes a good impression. Some frames look like hand-painted paintings and do justice to the happy artistic direction that had been penalized up to now by the mediocre technical realization. Mind you, it's not The Witcher 3, but it doesn't even need to be, so that's fine. Let's see instead the content of the episode. The Forrester house is cornered. His fate is in fact hanging on the choices of every single member of the family. Everyone has a crucial task to perform, and everyone must succeed all the way. With Mira living in King's Landing, Gared confined to the Wall, and Asher currently trampling the distant desert of Meereen, there's no way for those left at home crushed by the boot of the Whitehills to know how things are going. Rodrik in particular, lord in name but not in fact of House Forrester, can only hope that distant relatives keep the pact of loyalty that unites them. In the meantime he already has his work cut out to avoid further bloodshed within his own castle. And as if that weren't enough, his enemy's daughter reveals information to him that makes him feel even more alone and helpless. After carefully sowing, the third episode of Game of Thrones prepares for its bloody harvest! With us or against us This first season of Game of Thrones is all about loyalty. The plot works relentlessly around this concept. Asher is divided between his uncle Malcolm and his adventure companion Beskha. Mira must choose between Rodrik and Queen Margaery, while Gared is torn between his duties as the Night's Watch and the demands of Chamberlain Duncan. As you can see, the dilemma revolves between two irreconcilable goods in this case: remaining loyal to the family or remaining loyal to oneself. What struck us is the care with which the authors have sown during the first two episodes, to then reap the fruits of choices that seemed negligible and instead turn out to be cogs in a vice that tightens all the characters with ever greater strength. And the more they try to free themselves, the more they end up pressed from all sides. George Martin is a master at putting his characters in front of increasingly cruel obstacles and conflicts, but the authors of Telltale are no different. It's true that our choices don't change the main story, but The Sword in the Darkness shows us that every word spoken in the past can come back to haunt us. The subtle but lethal thrust with which Cersei corners Mira based on the choices made during the secret meeting with Tyrion is a perfect demonstration of this. It also highlights Telltale's expertise in making characters created by Martin and familiar to audiences from the novels or television series speak and act. In that regard, the last line of the episode, spoken by one of the most beloved heroines of Game of Thrones, is so in tune with the character and powerful in the subtext, that it leaves us more in suspense than it has been able to. a blade suddenly planted in little Ethan's neck. Finally we can also say that we are anxious to know how it ends.", "date": "2015-05-25", "grade": "8.0"}
