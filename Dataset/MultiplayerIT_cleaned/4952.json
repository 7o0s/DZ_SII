{"name": "Yooka-Laylee", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181731-yooka-laylee-yooka-kazooie-banjo-laylee.html", "text": "In 1998 Banjo-Kazooie began with an evil witch, a kidnapping and a blind mole; in 2017 Yooka-Laylee begins with an evil multinational who wants to take control of the world by taking possession of all the books, including one with incredible powers that will force us to pass the game to recover the one hundred and twenty pages that compose it scattered throughout the levels. Several guest stars appear in Yooka-Laylee Twenty years ago the world of video games was still naive and a sister to save was more than enough pretext to go on an adventure. Today he is more cynical and older, like us after all, and can only refer to his economic mechanisms to motivate the player. Otherwise the game is more or less the same, even if the bear Banjo and the bird Kazooie are gone, replaced by the chameleon Yooka and the female bat Laylee. In 1998 3D platformers were dominant, the inevitable evolution of the more commercial genre for 8 and 16-bit platforms on which economic and technological efforts were concentrated; while today it is a genre for nostalgics that needs the popular push, incidentally a fundraiser on Kickstarter, in order to exist. History has never lacked irony. In short, while Rare hasn't made Rare for years, some of the developers who made it up at the height of its glory have gone back to basics, giving themselves the name of Playtonic and trying to redo what they did damn well. So here we are again playing in a colorful world full of grotesque and cute characters, scattered across wide levels and full of things to do. Have we reviewed Yooka-Laylee: the return of 3D platformers in style? Or a game out of time? Flavors of yesteryear Yooka and Laylee's adventure begins softly. The first hour of the game is used to familiarize yourself with the gameplay: between tutorials and demonstration levels, the various functions are explained to us on the screen by the other characters. Nothing too complicated, actually. Initially you don't have many moves available: Yooka and Laylee can jump and spin to hit enemies; they swim, eat butterflies to recharge their energy and little else. The levels are real mazes Talking to a cute snake you get new moves, such as the roll that allows you to climb otherwise unapproachable slopes, stunning ultrasonic waves, gliding, more effective combat techniques and so on. While some are seemingly optional, it's best to buy them all; only then will you be able to fully explore the vast levels that make up the game, levels we'll talk about in a bit. The control system is incredibly reminiscent of what it was then. In fact, if you have played Banjoo-Kazooie, but also partially Conker: Bad Fur Day, you immediately find yourself at home and understand why there was talk of a ~spiritual sequel~ throughout the development. Paradoxically, Yooka-Laylee has more points of contact with the first Banjoo than with Nuts & Bolts, the 2008 Banjoo-Kazooie, a clear sign that the path taken by Rare in recent years was not the one that many would have really wanted to follow. The feeling is that of the time between jumps, slides, long sections of swimming, objects to find, increasingly insidious monsters, secrets everywhere and an incredible flexibility that binds in an exceptional way with the variety of situations offered. There are also some coin-ops playable. They work like minigames However, this eye to the past also means that there is much less attention, compared to the more lacquered productions, for the idiosyncrasies of the players. Let's say that at the beginning we too were taken aback by the need to have to re-learn how to jump. In recent years we have become accustomed to locks on the platforms so as not to fall off; at structured levels to never make us repeat too much of what has already been done and at increasingly accessible challenges, made so with a thousand design tricks. Yes, what we call ~good design~ is often just a form of preventing gamer incapacity. From this point of view, Yooka-Laylee is not interested in modernity. Playtonic is well aware that its potential audience is not made up of kids looking for a pastime, but of mature gamers who want to get back stimuli that they haven't been able to find for a long time, so let's go to the festival of bastard jumps that make us crash into the void in case of error, based on timing and ability to judge distances; away also to the very difficult boss fights, which make the proverbial seven shirts sweat: already the first seemed to us enormously more difficult to beat than many final bosses of more ~modern~ titles. Giant mazes Layer composition is also thought out withold players in the lead. Apart from the junction areas, all placed inside the book-sucking factory, the levels of Yooka-Laylee are gigantic labyrinths full of platforms, secret passages, ponds, ruins, and much more, in which you spend many hours to explore. The camera is not always optimally positioned The goal in each one is to be able to find all the pages of the book that has been stolen from us and some feathers, useful as currency for the skill merchant. Looking for something else, such as special bonuses, always well hidden, which increase the characteristics of the protagonists, or ghosts, which are also not easily identifiable, which give access to other bonuses. In each level there are also fixed characters, that is, who return from the previous ones, who yield bonuses or pages. For example, there is the tonic seller, which are special bonuses that are unlocked by performing certain actions and which can be activated one at a time, or there is the talking mine cart linked to skill contests in which you have to collect a certain number of gems while trying to avoid enemies; or even the 80s arcade crocodile who lets us try his coin-ops (accessible in the levels, in his arcade in the factory or even from the main menu) and so on. To unlock each level you need to collect a certain number of pages and use them on one of the tomes scattered around the factory. Finding pages is the main objective of the game Of each level it is also possible to unlock additional areas by spending other pages. It's not strictly necessary to do so, but if you want to see everything the Playtonic title has to offer, you can't avoid it. When we explore we have no obligations whatsoever: given the main objective, we can go wherever we want, within the limits of our current abilities. For example, to activate intangible platforms we will have to stimulate totems with Laylee's ultrasound waves; or to overcome completely dark caves we will first have to acquire Yooka's power to exploit the properties of swallowed objects, so that we can shed light by eating fluorescent berries. There are dozens of situations like this and, as we said, the variety is really great. Only in the first level between transformations, hidden areas, towers to climb and puzzles to solve there is some for a few hours and going forward the time required to collect a decent number of pages in the individual levels increases further. If you want to collect everything then, it's really going to take many additional hours of gameplay. In fact, Yooka-Laylee's longevity varies greatly based on how much time she spends exploring. Punch in the face If fans of Banjoo-Kazooie and, in general, of good 3D platformers can close the review here and go buy Yooka-Laylee confident of finding the game that's right for them, others will probably be interested in hearing about its defects too. The most evident is a certain lack of polish, which makes some moments of the game ~dirty~. The books represent the game levels. In particular we are referring to some problems in the animations and some gleaning too many, not justifiable even with nostalgic love. In particular, the camera tends in some cases to position itself a bit as it pleases and not to frame the scene from a useful angle to understand how to overcome the current obstacle. Nothing tragic, given that at most you lose some energy or repeat a section, but in some cases it can be annoying, especially when the sections to be repeated are particularly long or when you die. Another problem is the writing. Yooka-Laylee has really ugly lyrics, which seem to come out of a 1998 platformer. In this case, sadly, that's not a compliment. Some jokes are spot on, especially the meta-videogame ones, and there are some really funny situations, like a quiz we are subjected to to unlock an advanced area, but in general the texts are elementary and not at all natural. To understand if the problem is in the Italian translation we tried to select the English language, discovering that the quality does not change much. Even technically, the Playtonic title is not exactly the best: the levels are beautiful to look at as a whole, but if we focus on the single object, we immediately notice that we are not dealing with a large production. You probably also chose not to overload the game world with details to make it always readable, but in essence, don't expect a benchmark for your system. However, fans of the genre will pay little attention to it, as they will be enjoying what is in all respects one of the most beautiful celebrationstions of the 3D platformers of recent years.", "date": "2017-04-04", "grade": "8.0"}
