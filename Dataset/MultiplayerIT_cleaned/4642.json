A coincidence? We don't believe. In fact, the Nintendo-branded console represents the perfect cult object for those who at the time were already old enough to hold a pad in their hands, thus enjoying masterpieces that even today, after more than twenty years, can be remembered and replayed with great pleasure. These are more or less the same things we said about the first NES a year ago, when Nintendo kicked off a nostalgia operation whose long wave is unlikely to subside in the short term. This was confirmed by the recent announcement of the Mini edition of the Commodore 64, almost confirming the success achieved also from the commercial point of view of the operation performed with the NES Mini, inevitably followed by the arrival of an SNES Mini which for some time now seemed only a formality. Far from wanting to disappoint its large group of nostalgic fans, the Big N has launched the reduced version of the 16-bit console spotted for the first time in Japan in 1990 on the market a few days ago, purchasable for 79 euros and apparently less subject to to the NES Mini's quantity problems: after a weekend in his company, here's what we think. Watch out for nutrition! Some reports of malfunctions of the SNES Mini have appeared on the Internet, which would suddenly shut down if connected to inappropriate power sources. Among these there would also seem to be Nintendo Switch with its USB ports, together with the iPhone charger on the wall socket. As far as we're concerned, testing with both PlayStation 4 and an amplifier didn't give any problems, just as using a PC's USB output to power the SNES Mini shouldn't give them at all. Also beware of using HDMI switches for video output, as they would appear to be another malfunction factor, even with the use of an adequate power supply for the console. Can't be smaller Taking the SNES Mini box in your hands gives way to a series of rather particular sensations, mainly dictated by the awareness of having in your hands one of the milestones of video games that returns. Opening the package we witness the prodigy of technology, which leads us to hold in the palm of one hand the reduced version of a console that maybe years ago made us fight with our parents for its space on the desk or in the living room. Watching the unboxing videos doesn't do justice to the excitement of holding the SNES Mini in your hand, increased by the attention to detail that Nintendo has also expertly placed in this edition of its console, cared to ensure that the reduced version is as similar as possible to the 'original. All the elements of the old console are therefore present, even if in reality the compartment dedicated to the cartridges does not even have a flap to be able to simulate their insertion. In a different way compared to the NES Mini, this time Nintendo has decided to leave the attack of the controllers unchanged from an aesthetic point of view, at first glance identical to the seven-pin ones of the original SNES. In reality it is only a facade, because with the finger it is possible to open the front door which hides the same ports seen on the NES Mini, to which other peripherals such as the Wii nunchucks can therefore be connected. On the back of the console, however, there is the bare minimum to allow it to work on modern screens: an HDMI output and a USB connector, for which once again Nintendo provides us with a cable without an adapter. Like a year ago, therefore, you have to make do to find something that is good for powering the SNES Mini: it is useless to think about it for a long time because by now Nintendo has accustomed us to this kind of thing. Where the Japanese company deserves an earful instead is in the length of the controller cables: from the 80 centimeters of the NES Mini we have reached about 1.4 meters, still too little to allow comfortable use on the sofa at home. Considering that even the included HDMI cable is certainly not very long, the impression is that Nintendo wants for some strange reason to force us to sit on the floor or, as we are about to see, close to the console to take advantage of its features. Rewind! Starting up the SNES Mini is practically immediate and allows us to scroll through the list of games that Nintendo has included in the system in just a few seconds. They are twenty-one in total, less than the NES Mini but as we have already seen with a decidedly high general quality, even if given the vastness of titles available for this platform, there are certainly no shortage of excellent ones. For details, we refer you to the article linked a little while ago, limitandoci here to point out some games starting from the most curious, undoubtedly Star Fox 2. More than anything else due to its fate, given that as fans of the Nintendo scene will know it was in fact practically completed but due to a series of commercial choices was never released, also due to the imminent arrival of Nintendo 64 on the market. Turning on the Internet it was already possible to find the finished ROM online for some time, but in fact Star Fox 2 is now officially released for the first time in many years. While recognizing some gimmicks in the game that would later become part of the series in the titles released in subsequent years, it must be said that by playing it you can understand the reasons that led Nintendo to cancel it. Especially in the flight phase the controls are rather difficult, it is also short and not very refined, but even so it is still a gem to have in a series that includes titles of absolute value, even after so many years. Among those aged better we find the role-playing games Earthbound and Final Fantasy III (or VI, if you prefer), but there really is something for all tastes: platformers are obviously strong thanks to masterpieces such as Donkey Kong Country and Super Mario World , while perhaps a sportsman is missing beyond Super Punch-Out!!. Although perhaps it has not aged very well, Super Mario Kart can still offer moments of fun when played with a friend, thanks to the inclusion in the package of two different controllers, the same in the mapping of the keys to the original version. Despite the time passed, the yield in the hands is more than satisfactory, even if the addition of a home button would not have hurt in functional terms. In fact, the only way to exit a game is to press the reset button on the console, which can also be used if you want to access the home screen to manage game saves and a special rewind function introduced for the occasion : the time varies from title to title up to a maximum of about a minute, thus being able to go back in front of a challenging boss or another particular moment. If Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts is the game you want to play on the SNES Mini, rewind will become your best friend. Everything as it once was The choice not to modify any element also concerns the ROMs loaded on the SNES Mini, kept intact compared to the original versions of the games. All the characteristics found at the time are therefore present, including glitches and frame drops that occur in some game situations: a choice perfectly in line with the nostalgic soul that accompanies the creation of SNES Mini, which in any case, like its predecessor, brings with it some extra element in the visual field. In addition to the classic 4:3 video, games can also be played in original resolution (so-called ~pixel perfect~) or with a CRT filter that reproduces the effect of old televisions. In the latter case, however, the definition of the image pays the price. If you are an incurable collector, know that the American version of SNES Mini reflects the one marketed at the time, different from the ~Super Famicom~ edition (much more beautiful) sold in Japan, Europe and other territories. An unobtainable mini console? The NES Mini's availability issues were the subject of much debate at the time. This time it seems things are going better with the SNES Mini and the console is currently available for purchase. It is also true that some rumors relating to some sold out situations are coming from America, but stocks and supplies should be guaranteed to a greater extent than in the past.", "date": "2017-10-03", "grade": null}
