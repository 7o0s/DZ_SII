The game, a dating fighting game starring beautiful girls dressed by a fashion blogger suffering from nail polish withdrawal, is the spin-off of a series of erotic visual novels with strategic elements called Koihime Mus, whose publication began in It's long gone 2007. Don't be surprised by the necklines: at the time of the Three Kingdoms they were fashionable Koihime Enbu is therefore part of a series of products that includes, among others, manga and anime of the order. The story behind the Koihime is a retelling of Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great Chinese novels. However, the differences are substantial, starting from the tones, which are decidedly less serious. Although the setting is ancient China and although the events told take place in the same historical period, i.e. during and after the Han dynasty, in the Koihime the male characters have been abolished and the battle is overweight girls who belong to the warring factions. Moreover, in the visual novels there was no lack of explicit sex scenes (sometimes you have to rest from the war), which however failed in the fighting game. All this preamble serves to make you aware that the references made by the girls in the dialogues, which can be read between one fight and another, require knowledge of the events of the series to be fully understood. To be fair, you don't lose much in not understanding them, as they aren't particularly well written. We also imagine that many of those interested in the game are either fans of the Koihime, or are fighting game enthusiasts at meetings who want to know how it compares to other titles in the same genre. Koihime Enbu makes thirteen overweight girls fight each other: could we not review it? Mode The PC version of Koihime Enbu comes after that coin-op, playable only in Japanese arcades (apart from a few imported pieces), and after the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 ones, which never arrived in the West and can only be purchased on import. Some sceneries are really beautiful In fact, the latest version published is also the only officially playable by us. That's a shame, because the multiplayer mode allows for cross-play with other versions and, as we'll see, there really is a dearth of players online. Once the controller is configured (you can use your favorite arcade stick to play, since Koihime Enbu is compatible with practically all dedicated peripherals), we start the game and select the first of the available modes, namely the Scenario one. This is the classic story mode in which, in addition to fighting each other, the stories of the characters are also followed through dialogues, sometimes very long (it can be seen that it is taken from a visual novel). Those interested in a more direct approach to the action would do well to select the Arcade mode, identical to the Scenario mode but without the narrative part and with the ability to customize the clashes by choosing the level of difficulty, the duration of the individual matches, the of rounds to win and the support character. If you want you can train against a puppet in Training mode, but if you know any other exponent of the genre you won't need it, since the game system is really simple and most of the super moves are performed in a basic way (half-moons to go -go and zero drama). We will spend a few words on the Online mode later. Now it's time to start hitting. The ABC As we mentioned, Koihime Enbu's game system does not present major problems for those accustomed to fighting games. The moves are tied to three keys (A, B and C), with a fourth (D) for grappling and a fifth (E) for taunts. Scenario mode is filled with dialogue Some super moves are spectacular (but nothing earth-shattering) The aforementioned supporting character doesn't do very much. Trivially, it is to be considered an extra super move that consumes a cell of the ~Tactics~ bar (it is located in the lower part of the screen and fills up by landing hits or taking them) and which is always performed in the same way for all characters. For the rest we are faced with an elementary vision of the genre. Koihime Enbu should be considered more a way to give fans of the series stuff to consume than an attempt to say something in the world of fighting games. Not that it's badly done, mind you: the thirteen playable characters are well drawn, despite a characterization of manner, still in line with today's Japanese standards, the animations are accurate and the super moves are spectacular. It just lacks a lot of finishing touchesstrictly mechanical terms. For example, it is not possible to anticipate the moves by a few moments, as in other fighting games, and there is a lack of technical parries, even if there is recovery in flight after a hit. The AI gets the job done, especially on the higher difficulty level, but never offers an insurmountable challenge. On the other hand, the lower difficulty level allows even a child to finish the game by pressing random keys... Some imbalances in the damage of the moves and their usefulness also suggest that the developers had no competitive ambitions in the development phase . In short, the war girls do their job, but a game system like that of Street Fighter V or like those of the most famous series of Arc System Works (BlazBlue, Guilty Gear), are very far away. In fact, more or less at the same price as Koihime Enbu - indeed, saving something - it is possible to buy a jewel like the very recent BlazBlue: Chronophantasma Extend, with which it is also easier to be able to play online. Koihime Enbu's online mode deserves a few separate words, given its problematic nature. Meanwhile it is difficult to find other players, which is not a defect attributable to the game, as for the amount of sales, obviously not exceptional. However, even if you manage to find some unfortunate person to fight with, you risk that the lag will frustrate all your hopes. In short, at present the Online mode is difficult to classify as successful. If you want to challenge each other against some friends, you should focus on the Versus mode, which however has the technicality of requiring the physical presence of both players in the same room.", "date": "2016-05-25", "grade": "7.0"}
