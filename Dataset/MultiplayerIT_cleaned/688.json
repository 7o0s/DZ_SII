{"name": "Catan", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/catan.html", "text": "We hexagon Settlers of Catan, this is the full title of the original board game, was born in Germany by Klaus Teuber, and achieved good success all over the world thanks to a game mechanic that is not too complicated structurally but at the same time profound and rational. While certainly not the first electronic conversion of a board game, that of Catan intrigues first of all for the high-sounding name that the developer bears, and secondly for the unconventional choice of N-Gage as the host platform. Feelings of estrangement aside, let's talk about the actual title, which certainly doesn't start off on the right foot when it comes to welcoming a user who does not know the rules of Teuber's work. The tutorial section of Catan is in fact the worst that can be offered in a product of this kind, with a few training steps paradoxically consisting of non-playable sequences often without textual captions: we therefore find ourselves observing the moves of the CPU on the screen, with only your intuition to help in understanding the game mechanics. A truly egregious slip by Capcom, which forces the buyer to learn the rules on his own skin, game after game. In any case, the game develops on a board made up of 19 hexagons, each one representing a certain type of raw material (wood, bricks, wool, grain, minerals), and on the edges of which the participants have the task of building roads and settlements to then be developed in the city, in order to accumulate points and wealth: the player who reaches ten points first wins. These are the basics of the gameplay, which proceeds regulated by the roll of the dice and is enriched by a whole series of variables (bonus cards, trade between the participants and the presence of a thief icon that you can exploit to your advantage by getting a 7 on the dice) capable of making it, if not exactly frenetic and compelling, certainly profound from a tactical point of view. Less is more? Catan proves faithful to the original board game even in purely cosmetic terms, presenting itself with a fairly functional but also objectively rather poor graphic design. Colored hexagons and stripes are essentially all that Catan offers to the eye, even if the pleasant design of the characters and illustrations helps to improve the situation a little. Not that such a product should amaze with special effects, for heaven's sake, but something more could be done, especially in terms of clarity of the game interface: Catan uses a system of text-free icons, which is due to their reduced dimensions, and for their obvious intelligibility to neophytes, proves to be ill-suited for the purpose. Even the sound sector of the Capcom title denotes a quality level closer to mediocrity than to minimalism, with essential sound effects and extremely repetitive musical accompaniment. Aspects on which it would have been easier to turn a blind eye, if only Catan had proved brilliant in terms of the playful offer, but unfortunately this is not the case. Flying over a single player mode evidently devoid of major attractions (however commendable the effort by the developers to insert a mission-based section), the Capcom product disappoints especially in terms of multiplayer, contemplating only the game via Bluetooth up to a maximum of 4 users and closing the door to the N-Gage Arena service, used only to upload one's own scoreboards. Too little, also considering how finding three friends equipped with consoles and games is a difficult undertaking to say the least... Comment Catan is a rather ambiguous product, not only for the genre it represents and for the all too high-sounding name of Capcom behind it, but above all for the decidedly inappropriate attitude with which it presents itself to the user. Without a properly done tutorial and consisting of a flat single player mode and a multiplayer limited to only supporting four users via Bluetooth, Catan turns out to be a convincing board game in terms of game mechanics, but which leaves much to be desired in terms of sheer play offering. For true enthusiasts only. Pros: Game scheme faithful to the original board game Tactically deep One of a kind on N-Gage Cons: Graphics and sound at the bare minimum Unsuitable tutorial and game interface Disappointing multiplayer A Capcom production on N-Gage would in itself be cause for clamor, considering how  to put it mildly  the Nokia platform is not one of the most popular handhelds by the big Japanese software houses. However, the case of Catan is truly striking, given that everything would have been expectedoriginated from the house of Street Fighter and Resident Evil except the virtual transposition of a board game...", "date": "2005-12-16", "grade": null}
