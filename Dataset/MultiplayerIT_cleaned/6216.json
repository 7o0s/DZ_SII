Among clearly incomplete games, alpha versions, reissues of old glories of the past, it has become equally difficult to give due prominence to those titles that may be worthy but which risk being overshadowed. Among these is certainly The Red Solstice, the first work of Ironward, a tiny software house in Zagreb, which we had already tried in a preview published exactly one year ago, in conjunction with the positive fundraising campaign launched on Kickstarter. After several updates, the definitive version of this particular title has also been completed, which in the meantime has garnered numerous acclaim even among users who have decided to support Croatian kids by purchasing the Early Access version. Among the things that immediately catch the eye is the presence of the much anticipated campaign in single player, on which it seems to us that the greatest efforts of the programmers have been concentrated in recent months: this is precisely the aspect on which our test is mainly based, given that the multiplayer, which is basically the real beating heart of the game, has not undergone revolutions but has rather been the subject of careful balancing work. Let's start immediately to describe the efforts of Sergeant Tyler (he is exactly the same one whose traces are sought in cooperative games), sent to Tharsis with his team to investigate what happened during the red solstice, the most violent storm that occurred on Mars since the planet was colonized by men. For those who have missed the previous episodes, we are in the presence of a title that can rightfully be defined as a cooperative MOBA, but also a strategic one without resource management. The long-awaited single player campaign turned out to be disappointing as the servers went empty Finally the single player The first level is just used to familiarize yourself with the control system, with which it seems to us that the programmers have had quite a fight. In fact, the player controls the single Hunt, while the three team members follow him without blinking an eye: however, by pressing the space bar, it is possible to enter a tactical mode in which the passage of time is slowed down and it becomes possible to issue orders even to other members of the group. From the moment in which they cannot interact with the scenario (action for the exclusive prerogative of the protagonist), the fellow soldiers prove to be fundamental pawns to be positioned in strategic defensive points, while our darling takes care of the primary objectives of the mission. This tactical variant, obviously impossible to implement in the online game, did not fully convince due to a certain cumbersomeness in issuing orders; it would have been much more intuitive to allow permanent control of each unit or, conversely, to exclude it altogether. One gets the impression that the developers wanted to put two feet in the same shoe: on the one hand it was necessary to keep the MOBA/hack & slash setting that characterizes the multiplayer sessions in order not to completely distort the game structure, on the other it tried to simulate the presence of other human players without succeeding effectively. The result is a cumbersome experience devoid of the bite that should entice you to continue with the plot, of which we will not reveal too many details: it is enough to know that it does not save itself in the repertoire of clichs and various platitudes involving synthetic viruses, botched experiments, scientists crazy and of course dozens of monsters. Aside from the tactical pause, the solo game quite faithfully follows the cooperative one, in which it is basically necessary to move from one point to another on the map, eliminating the most difficult enemies in the meantime and above all paying attention to the ammunition always in short supply. The difficulty level proves to be challenging even on a normal level: since the second mission, where the computer aids stop, the challenge rate soars and even simply reaching the next checkpoint requires a good dose of strategy. Thinking of setting off to conquer the point indicated on the map, perhaps taking advantage of some gadgets recovered along the way, quickly leads to the game over screen: it is necessary to thoroughly study the shelters on the map and the peculiarities of each soldier; sometimes it will be necessary to lengthen the road to reach the inevitable supply points,in other cases we will have to retreat to study the weak points of the enemy waves. This scheme works very well when confronted with other players in the flesh, but inevitably loses momentum in solo. The result is that we often fell into the temptation to abandon Sergeant Tyler's labors to see if any servers were filling up again. Multiplayer dying? We initially wrote that the competitive mode of The Red Solstice represents the true backbone of Ironward's production. Well, never as in this case would the use of the conditional be appropriate as it is really difficult to find active lobbies. During our week of testing, we were rarely able to join a group of seven other players, and in those cases we had to wait several minutes for the coveted last slot to fill. Discussing with the diehards who have continued to follow the development of the title, we realized how the community, despite the numerous positive reviews, has gradually diminished despite the continuous updates from the developers. It is to be hoped that the exit from the Early Access phase and the arrival (hopefully adequately advertised) of the definitive version can provide a further vital charge to this interesting project that can give good satisfactions provided that one applies it with a certain dedication: only by accumulating several hours of play is it possible to master its mechanisms and get the better of the most demanding maps. In this direction, the fluidity of the network code is commendable, with low pings and almost always absent lag: these are combined with excellent stability that allows you to live the scarce hour required to complete a session without worries. As we wrote (and as confirmed by the various changelogs) the various updates have gone in the direction of optimizing the clashes. In fact, there are still eight classes, while there are six levels. Not everything is available right away, but you will have to accumulate experience to gradually unlock upgrades and levels. The protagonist's progress is stimulating and the skills with which he is enhanced are appreciable from the first minutes and do not give the impression of having been added just to make up the number. One of the strengths of The Red Solstice is precisely the excellent balance between each type of military: knowing how to coordinate the forces in the field is one of the most demanding and at the same time rewarding challenges of multiplayer sessions, especially when the most mangy, such as the Hardcore mode (with monsters much stronger than the common) or the Red Storm, in which the players' defenses are reduced with each alien horde. An offline version is also available with allies controlled by the CPU: in this case it is possible to activate the tactical pause and faithfully reproduce what has already been seen in the single-player campaign, but we sincerely advise against taking this absolutely soporific mode into consideration. Graphics a bit poor, but it doesn't look bad The user interface is probably one of the aspects that has undergone the greatest number of revisions over the course of these months and which still today continues to be subject to more or less marked tweaks: even the eye claims its share and it must be admitted that the work of the guys from Zagreb has been channeled in the right direction, with a set of icons finally in step with the times and a decidedly more pleasant general look than the stocky one that distinguished the release tested last July. There is obviously no shortage of corners to be rounded off but overall we cannot complain about the game engine either, the Razor Engine developed internally by Ironward. The view is typical of real-time strategy: there is the possibility of zooming to view the marines in detail, but in the end you will position the camera at the highest possible point to have a more complete view of the map. The settings are very dark and bare, to the point of being anonymous. There has been widespread talk of the numerous stylistic influences that have guided the Zagreb-based software house: from the atmospheres of Alien or X-COM to the references of Warhammer: Dawn Of War and the old Syndicate, but here we also like to mention the mod for StarCraft II called Night of the Dead and made by three Malaysian guys, a real source of inspiration for their Croatian counterparts. The level of detail is not one that makes one cry out for a miracle and indeed sometimes one regrets a certain flatness in the locations, which however are often pleasant and suitable for the purpose for which they were designed. Even the enemies as a whole are uninspired,retrieved from the usual repertoire that generations of players have grown up with. The soundtrack was on the same wavelength, while the special effects seemed particularly adequate.", "date": "2015-07-08", "grade": "6.8"}
