Beyond the ~narrative~ pretext, Battlefield 2142 hardly differs from its predecessors: we are once again faced with a team-based FPS, capable of handling up to 64 players, in which coordinated action is rewarded. However, the juxtaposition with its predecessors does not concern only the ~ontological~ aspect but also the weapons and means (the variety and quantity are always at the top), it will be easy for those accustomed to the series to understand that, beyond the futuristic look, we are faced with objects similar in all respects to those already seen in the episodes set in other historical periods. The similarities continue regarding the classes present (fortunately more and more customizable, with a very large number of elements to unlock) for the virtual soldiers, a level design of the maps in all respects similar to those seen in the other episodes and the presence of a democratically elected commander at the beginning of a game round and who will have very precise and exclusive tactical and strategic tasks and which will often prove to be decisive for the good progress of our battle. ...but not quite If up to now we have highlighted all the blatant similarities of Battlefield 2142 with its predecessors, it is time to make the news manifest. The latter are essentially two: the first concerns the presence of the Walkers, these gigantic units (the only truly futuristic ones) that closely resemble the ED209 of ~Robocoppiana~ memory and other war machines seen in a thousand Japanese manga. Despite a certain latency in the execution of the commands and an equally slowness of movements, the Walkers (translated in ~Walkers~ in the manual...) are almost perfect war machines that require a large amount of lead to be shot down enough to be able to be considered in the same way, with a perhaps improper comparison, of the end-of-level bosses who once headed the action arcades of the past. undoubtedly the ~Titan Mode~ is the added value of Battlefield 2142 Titanic Enterprises The other new aspect of Battlefield 2142 concerns the new ~Titan~ mode. Once you have decided to enter one of the available maps, in practice you will have to work for your team to be able to bring down the monumental flying fortress of the opponent. Easier said than done, as they say in these cases, given that the undertaking is truly titanic: first you will have to be able to lower the shields that protect the Titan and to do so you will first have to conquer the missile emplacements. The more you conquer, the sooner the spaceship will finally be penetrable. But this is only the beginning since once the shields are lowered, you will have to be able to enter the fortress: to do this you can use a half-wheel or get launched by an APC capable of turning us into human bullets and making us reach the sky. Once the landing operation has been carried out, the action moves inside the fortress: here we return to a more ~canonical~ situation in which we will first have to make our way through the opposing resistance and then get to the core of the Titan, previously destroying some emplacements surrounding. As you can easily understand, the mode is absolutely intriguing, deep and requires a good deal of coordination between men of the same faction; undoubtedly the ~Titan Mode~ is the added value of Battlefield 2142. Unstable Battlefields Having analyzed the characteristics of the more strictly playful component of Battlefield 2142, let's now take into consideration other aspects of the production of Electronic Arts starting from the stability of the code. Unfortunately there is no good news in this regard given that in addition to the urgent need to immediately install a patch a few days after its release (otherwise, at least on the test system, the servers were not even displayed...), the game continued to be excessively unstable. Probably by the time this review is published, new updates will have been released that will have solved the still existing problems but certainly we could have wished for a more in-depth compatibility beta testing in order not to fall into such situations. we are faced with a very spartan graphic representation which however favorably affects the gameplay Graphics engines not too futuristic Another aspect of close proximity between Battlefield 2142 and its more direct predecessor (Battlefield 2) concerns the use of the same graphics engine which has only undergone an optimization work that is not even too evident to a visual perceptionalso thorough. Even if the game is anything but mediocre in its aesthetic aspect, it is certainly far from being considered as one of those ~next generation~ productions that, unfortunately still not too frequently, we are seeing on Personal Computers. We are dealing with a very spartan graphic representation which, however, favorably affects the gameplay since we have not encountered any fluidity problems with the parameters set by the program's automatic setting. Moreover, the use of the same Battlefield graphic engine has also left unchanged the minimum recommended requirements to play BF2142. All you need is a 1.7 GHz processor, 512 MB of ram and a video card with at least 128 MB of memory to be able to battle on the net without any problems. An Internet connection is essential even for the single player. No particular report for the sound with adequate effects while the last negative report concerns the uploads once again too large not to mention the very heavy process that is put in place in case you decide to change the video resolution: for optimization of the shaders we will have to wait a good number of minutes, a decidedly excessive waiting time for us wargamers... Conclusions Battlefield 2142 is a sort of futuristic graphic restyling (a modification at the highest levels, we allow ourselves to say) of a series much appreciated by fraggers from all over the world to which two substantial innovations are added: the first concerns the presence of the splendid Walkers, perfect war machines with exorbitant firepower, the other is the new Titan mode which guarantees an even more profound, strategic and even spectacular approach to gameplay which otherwise remains very faithful to the line already traced by previous Digital Illusion productions . If you manage to turn a blind eye to some stability problems still present and to a graphics engine that is already two years old, Battlefield 2142 can only be warmly recommended, provided that the online war operations produced by Electronic Arts have already been your liking in the previous installments of the series. Pros Battlefield is a guarantee The Titan Mode is a major novelty The Walkers are splendid destruction machines Cons Some instability problems still not solved Graphics engine ~recycled~ from Battlefield 2 Excessively heavy loading Hunger breeds war Strengthened by a very large community, the Swedish programmers of Digital Illusions (I wonder if anyone still remembers their first Amiga productions dedicated to Pinball machines...) are back on the market to offer us a new chapter in their most successful series. The multiplayer FPS par excellence (or almost...) moves to the near future where, due to a new ice age, resources for humanity are starting to run out of stock and this, unfortunately, as in many other moments in history of humanity, meant war. Two factions will be facing each other over the limited supplies: on one side the European Union, on the other the Pan Asian coalition in a global and permanent conflict told in installments from time to time in the loading screens.", "date": "2006-11-06", "grade": null}
