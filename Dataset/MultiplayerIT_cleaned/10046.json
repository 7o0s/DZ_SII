Regardless of the ideas of each of us about hunting as a sport, in fact, faithfully reproducing sessions, perhaps even rather long ones, in which one throws the hook and waits for some fish to bite may not be the closest thing to the common concept of ~fun~. Gameloft tries to change the situation a bit, presenting us with a product that not only does everything possible to liven up the typical action of this video game genre, but adds to the basic package a huge load of upgradeable equipment, races and tournaments to face , numerous locations to visit and a comprehensive fish database. After the introductory phase consisting of a short tutorial, therefore, we are face to face with a map on which there are many places that we can explore and which will be the backdrop for our fishing sessions, whether they are completely free or fall within the optics of an official competition. You travel the world like sailors... The gameplay of Fishing Kings is basically based on the actions that we have to perform each time to catch a fish. Our boat stops at a predefined point within each scenario, but we can move the camera to locate the point where to throw the line, then tap it on the touch screen. At that point the accelerometer integrated into our Apple device comes into play for the first time, which allows us to mimic the gesture of ~launching~ with the fishing rod, always holding the iPhone horizontally. Once it has arrived at its destination, the bait begins to descend inexorably towards the seabed, but we can ensure that it does not touch the ground and instead continues to move to attract the fish's attention, precisely in two ways: by shaking the iPhone or acting on the reel with a finger, rewinding the line little by little. When a fish tries to swallow the bait, we must first ~jerk~ the rod to hook it, then try our hand at a sort of push-and-pull minigame: when our prey tries to escape, we must tilt the device in its own right direction and try to keep the tension bar in a neutral zone. Too much loosening would mean losing the fish, while too much pulling would break the line. When the prey is tired, we can finally act on the reel and with a final ~jolt~ hoist it on board, to then decide whether to keep it or release it. During free fishing sessions, collecting fish makes us earn money, which we can spend on improving our equipment as well as buying essential accessories for fishing in certain locations. The game uses a prize system that gradually unlocks the new stages and offers us competitions and tournaments via a virtual PDA, to which is added the database we mentioned at the beginning, on which we can write down all the fish breeds with which we are in contact. The systematic repetitiveness of the action is therefore mitigated by a side dish that has never been so rich and well-kept, which spurs us to visit all the places on the map and to participate in all the tournaments. Technically, then, the Gameloft developers have done an extraordinary job: the rendering of the scenarios is superb in terms of detail and lighting, just as the water has been done really well. Too bad that the animations of the fish turn out to be very limited right away, undermining the degree of realism of the simulation, and too bad for the frequent drops in the frame rate.
