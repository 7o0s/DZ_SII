Waiting for a new ~idea~ that manages to relaunch the trend, therefore Disney Infinity 3.0 owners will be able to see the obsolescence of their Starter Pack delayed and continue playing with new content starting with this Play Set, dedicated to Marvel world and precisely titled Marvel Battlegrounds. Marvel Battlegrounds is one of the best content ever released in the world of Disney Infinity We were four friends at the bar One of the main points in the promotion of Disney Infinity, and one of the concepts that its publishers and developers have always wanted to underline with great intensity, is the ductility of a product that on paper is able to adapt and mold itself around the user's creativity . Especially in the Toy Box component, i.e. the editor that has been a key component of the package since the first episode, everything has been done to demonstrate how it was possible to create experiences capable of ranging from racing games to platformers with one's own hands. from action adventure to strategic and so on. An enormous ambition which however often had to collide with the limits of the interface and with imperfections of the gameplay; thanks to a high-level Play Set, made by expert hands, that vision has now - at least in part - been realized. The aspect that deserves to be underlined in the first place is in fact the name of the developer to whom Disney has entrusted: it is in fact the Canadians of United Front Games, a team of proven ability to which we owe the excellent Sleeping Dogs and the discreet Little Big Planet Karting. The substantial novelty compared to the Play Sets of the past, which practically in all cases were developed on the basis of action-adventure mechanics with missions, lies in the decision to propose a totally different gameplay, and built starting from the highest quality element of the entire package of Infinity 3.0, or the combat system. Marvel Battlegrounds is in fact a 3D fighting game with arenas that is very reminiscent of the historic Power Stone by Capcom, to be played in single player but (better still) in multiplayer for up to 4 users. The connection with current events instead lies in the film Captain America: Civil War to be released in May, and in fact the Play Set package includes both the miniature to be placed on the portal to unlock the content, and the statuette of the aforementioned protagonist. In this sense, it should be noted the disappointment for the choice to include only one character in the purchase price (as always set at around 35), whereas in the Worlds published in the past there were two. An unfortunate decision, which we feel like underlining. However, the bitter taste in the mouth remains for a while, because Marvel Battlegrounds is undoubtedly one of the best content ever published within the Disney Infinity brand. The quality of the work of United Front Games is in fact evident from the first moments of the game, when - after the initial tutorial - the first real battles are faced. The team has in fact succeeded perfectly in enhancing the good that had already been done in the combat system, enhancing it to the maximum in a spectacular, immediate product with a frenetic pace and well balanced in its components. There are essentially two modes available, Versus and History: the latter allows you to tackle a series of levels connected to each other by a very weak plot, which revolves around the super villain Ultron and a series of replicants to be defeated one after the other the other. A flaw lies in the extreme brevity of this mode, which can be completed in less than an hour, but with the incentive of replayability thanks to the ability to get points to upgrade your characters, as well as the presence of a series of extra challenges . However, where Marvel Battlegrounds offers its best is in multiplayer games, as already mentioned up to 4 players. The list of characters available is close to thirty (all the Marvel ones released so far on Disney Infinity 2.0 and 3.0), each of them obviously equipped with unique attacks and distinctive characteristics. Very interesting is the fact that it is not necessarily necessary to buy all the ssmall tattoos to be able to use them: in fact, it is enough to place them on the portal only once to be able to ~unlock~ them, a factor which therefore favors the exchange with friends. Furthermore, thanks to tokens that can be earned by playing, characters not obtained in the manner described above can also be used for a limited time, making everything much more accessible and sensible. A robust series of modifiers and rules to be applied to the fights then give further depth and variety to the game. Once on the field, we find ourselves fully appreciating the work of the Vancouver team both for the good level of detail of the arenas (8 in all), and for the dynamism that characterizes the latter, which change during the duration of the fight revealing new areas or distorting its original appearance through extremely choreographic solutions. An extreme spectacularity that is also enhanced by the special moves and those linked to the power discs, absolutely hilarious in their scenographic exaggeration. It's just a pity that no online mode is contemplated, which obviously could have literally exploded the value of a Play Set that sincerely surprised us anyway. One last curiosity: for the first time a World of Disney Infinity necessarily requires an internet connection to be played, since - unlike the others - it is not already present on the Starter Pack disc.", "date": "2016-03-28", "grade": null}
