To defend themselves from their attacks, the last remaining men build three huge concentric walls that enclose the remaining gatherings in the form of districts, with the wealthiest classes occupying the central part of the titanic structure. For dozens of years the walls held up, so much so that a real religion was born around them, but one day a giant never so tall and powerful appeared from the outer wall, who with a kick broke through the robust wall and let in hordes of his fellows. A bloody massacre takes place, with countless losses even among the parents of the protagonists, on one side Eren Jaeger and on the other the unpublished character that we will have the task of creating to play the A.O.T. 2. A solution, the one devised by Omega Force, which tries to respond to two different needs: the first is to enrich the experience as much as possible, returning to the first events and carrying them forward until the conclusion of the second season of the anime, the all under the supervision of the author of the manga, Hajime Isayama; the second is to embroider around these same episodes new situations, experienced from a different point of view, which are not necessarily linked to what happens in the original story. Solid foundations If you have played with A.O.T. Wings of Freedom, a year and a half ago, it is clear that you will experience a strong sense of deja-vu, emphasized in this case by a heavy reuse of old cutscenes which, however, do not connect well with the new and more refined graphic setting. As mentioned, the point of view changes: in the initial sequence we are but helpless spectators of the events that lead to the reappearance of the female giant in the middle of the central district, and on this basis also the simple tutorial takes place which has the task of introducing us to the control system of the game, fundamentally unchanged: the Square button allows you to fire the grappling hooks of the equipment for three-dimensional maneuvering, allowing us to ~jump~ from one wall to another like new Spider-Man, but following a faster and more dynamic, while the X button allows you to open the gas to project us rapidly forward when we are in mid-air. Once we have identified a giant, we will be able to anchor ourselves to various parts of its body and then, using the grappling hook again with the Triangle button, try to hit its only weak point, the scruff, to eliminate it with the supplied blades. It is a system that works very well and which showed great reactivity and immediacy in the first episode, receiving new ~strategic~ features in the sequel: by pressing the left backbone, we will be able to order the members of our eventual team to attack the selected target, with some truly spectacular sequences and devastating automatic combined attacks in case they are famous characters, such as for example Mikasa, Mike, Oruo or Captain Levi. Similarly, a second menu will allow us to use special skills, rockets or nets useful for capturing smaller giants, for research purposes. In all this, however, we will be limited in actions by the indicators of integrity of the blades and the gas, which we will consume more or less quickly depending on the type of equipment selected and how ~furiously~ we will use it: a rather frustrating situation where we are in the amidst challenging combat and there are no nearby fuel stations. In this regard, a new mechanic has been introduced that allows you to create these points of interest starting from specific areas and selecting the type of structure we intend to build, whether a simple recharge center or perhaps a turret that automatically fires against enemies . All over again The introductory phase of A.O.T. 2 takes place in conjunction with the conclusion of the first season of the anime, but as those who follow the series will certainly know (the manga, in particular), from that point on Isayama's story becomes slower and stingier with events, arriving moreover to reveal in a frankly stupid way two fundamental secrets of the plot without any crescendo, out of the blue: a waste that the cartoon tries to remedy in some way, but which has naturally left the developers in a somewhat complicated situation . Faithfully following the story, as in the first tie-in, would have been unthinkableile, but in the same way creating a completely new and parallel one would have risked dissatisfying those who still wanted to find the various Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, etc. in the game. The solution of the unpublished character responds precisely to this need, but it could have been managed better, first of all by assigning him spoken dialogue (and therefore limiting the choice of voice in the editor to only two options, male or female) in order to make it more pleasant the even frequent exchanges with the other characters, in which we practically have a silent scene. Then there is the question of the ~rewind~, because after the immediately initial phase of the game we return with a flashback to the training and therefore to relive situations already widely explored in A.O.T. Wings of Freedom, missions included. This aspect of the experience will certainly open the doors to those who have not had the opportunity to play with the first chapter of the series, allowing them to recover the whole story, but it will inevitably end up tiring those who know those things by heart between manga, anime and tie-ins. However, this is not the only problem of A.O.T. 2: if it is true that the equipment for three-dimensional maneuvering becomes useless in the absence of grips, therefore in the open areas outside the city walls, it is precisely in those contexts that most of the second season takes place and this is reflected in a evident on the quality of the gameplay, greatly deteriorated in terms of confusion, glitches, interpenetrations and real bugs. These are aspects also present in the debut chapter, but here they are somehow emphasized due to scenarios less suitable for three-dimensional combat. When you are close to a low building, the grappling hooks only slam you against the wall and you have to proceed sideways in order not to get stuck, perhaps in a dangerous situation. In the same way, facing several giants in a small area is something incredibly confusing, thanks to a camera that by force of racing cannot keep up with everything that happens. In the presence of drier missions, the defect would have remained limited, but unfortunately we note the will to drag it out where we don't think it was absolutely necessary, fielding special giants that really take a long time to be killed, between a break and the another to refill blades and gas. In these situations, the combat system proves to be inadequate: the huge enemies bend over on their backs, approach each other, rub on the ground and it becomes really difficult to hit them behind the head, with each empty attempt creating frustration on the way of the waste of resources. Playstation 4 trophies The forty Trophies of A.O.T. 2 are obtained by completing the six chapters of the campaign and completing all the secondary missions, but also by dedicating yourself to the rich side dish offered by the game: strengthening relationships, forging a certain number of collaborations, eliminating a certain number of enemies or unlocking all the available characters . City life In terms of mode and setting, A.O.T. 2 picks up in many ways when seen in the first episode, with a main campaign that follows the events of the series and a set of side missions that can be accessed via a city hub. Our character is invited to dialogue with everyone and to provide, where possible, ~motivational~ answers to improve the friendship with the various NPCs and make them level up, unlocking their skills. For what? Naturally to use them directly in the secondary mode, also and above all based on multiplayer. There are three possible options: a four-against-four competitive mode based on the score, therefore on whoever makes the most eliminations within a time limit; a co-op focused on side missions or single player campaign; and finally the Predator Mode, in which for the first time we will control a group of giants with the aim of devouring human beings. There is no doubt that in structural terms there has been an enrichment of the offer, but the lack of refinements (the animations, in particular) prevents us from appreciating the jRPG-style elements, which get boring after a very short time. The in-game action, on the other hand, gives us very intense and spectacular sequences, which however are in a clear minority compared to the problematic situations we have previously described. Even on the technical front we move between ups and downs: the developers have used cel shading very well to create polygonal models faithful to the characters of the anime, and in the same way the urban views are beautiful to look at, but are relegated to a mere background for our battles, crumbling in mannernot particularly convincing when a giant hits them. In these and other moments, that is, when things get more chaotic, the frame rate unfortunately collapses miserably, going from sixty frames per second in the quieter phases to something probably less than twenty, even on PlayStation 4 Pro, maintaining in all cases the obvious pop-up effects to which unfortunately the engine used by Omega Force has always accustomed us. In short, it seems that A.O.T. 2 serious flaws precisely in the finishing stages, i.e. when any problems are identified and then have to be solved: was there no time to do it?", "date": "2018-03-15", "grade": "7.0"}
