{"name": "Tropico: Paradise Island", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tropico-paradise-island.html", "text": "Hasta la vista, Siempre! As mentioned, the introduction of some predefined scenarios is the most interesting part of this expansion. This novelty is in fact addressed to the different types of gamers who enjoyed the original title, as they vary from those with a purely military background to those with a tourist background. As far as the first type is concerned, we will generally have to deal with a series of revolts that have broken out among the people due to widespread discontent, or come to terms with complex situations of political instability; to do this we will have at our disposal generally more active armed forces, a more submissive military police and even some perhaps secret ones capable of offering free (but not entirely pleasant) rehabilitation to less condescending citizens... If instead of the original game we preferred tourism-related issues, we certainly won't sit idly by this time either, as we will find ourselves faced with situations, certainly not simple, in which we will have to manage to make the ecological aspect coexist with the tourist one. If we succeed in this aim, then we will also be able to see our little island populated by Eco-tourists, people who are not rich but capable, with their mere presence, of increasing the degree of reputation of our management. Another rather important innovation, in our view, is undoubtedly that of the management of the architectural planning aspect, since now it is no longer necessary to place the buildings in a very calibrated position (a bit one of the defects of the Impression management systems, where sometimes it felt like some errors just happened due to incorrect placement of buildings) as it happened in the original game. In addition, it is now possible to rotate buildings 360 for better space management. A note to the graphics of the game, absolutely unchanged, and to the interface which is now, if possible, even more intuitive and user-friendly: in fact, without having to open the menu continuously, it is possible to retrieve and modify the main information even faster. Finally, a mandatory mention for the new music added (all worthy of being in one of the many Latin American Festivals scattered throughout Italy), and for the narrator who occasionally gives us a ~Viva el Presidente~ that makes us always pleasure! Hasta la vista, Siempre! the Conclusions After having fun with the (many) additions to this Paradise Island, there remains only one doubt: why publish a version containing the original game and the expansion by selling it at full price, and not sell even just the Add-on ( exactly as was done for the recent Operation Flashpoint)? Although Paradise Island is a more than spot on expansion and further increases the pleasure of playing with a fresh and fun title like Tropico, there aren't many reasons why the player who has already finished it should pick up his wallet and consider the investment: this naturally applies for purely economic reasons, because from a playful point of view the expansion in question cannot be criticized in the slightest for what it offers, on the contrary... However, if the price of Paradise Island had been less than 20 Euros, there would have been no really excuses not to add it to the already brilliant original title, but that being the case we can only recommend the purchase only to those who do not own the original title (you don't know what you've been missing), or to players who, having recognized the great value playful of the expansion, they are willing to spend the same euros spent to get Tropico just a few months ago. Back to the tropics... One thing you can't disagree on: Tropico was one of last year's most original titles. It is not for nothing that the entire editorial team was happy to be able to award it the title of best management game of 2001, and it is clear how much curiosity we approached this expansion, which arrived in stores a few weeks ago. There is really a lot of irons in the fire, and in the next few lines we will try to understand if it is worth investing more money in an Add-on that is sold at full price, but which does not need the original title to be played. As regards the ~surrounding~ novelties, we include some particularly successful buildings (among all the condominium, consisting of small luxury apartments), new industrial buildings and a new tourist service. On the other hand, the tourist attractions have greater importance, which now see the possibility of renting nature-saving Bungalows,tennis courts and, no less than, ports for yachts: to top it all off, the possibility of stealing money from tourists with the new Mini Golf service. And if the wealthy guests aren't happy yet, there's always the new restaurant with Gurmet or the cinema: it's possible to guess from these small details which aspect has been focused on in this expansion, namely tourism. In fact, the introduction of villas on the beach and the availability of a single new government building (the military base) also reinforce the idea: the same cover image speaks for itself, with the two tourists with suitcases ready to enter our small tropical paradise... Alongside this novelty, which in any case would have been possible to download with a free add-on from the Internet, there is the true heart of the expansion, which is the introduction of new predefined scenarios to face.", "date": "2002-02-13", "grade": null}
