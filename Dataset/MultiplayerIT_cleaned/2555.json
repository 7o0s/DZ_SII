{"name": "Messiah", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/messiah.html", "text": "The story of the Messiah In the usual catastrophic future to which we have become accustomed for years from films and cartoons, a dictatorship is leading society to degradation, also thanks to computers (who knows what processors and graphics cards will mount inside) but above all the so-called Fathers who, once established their base on the Moon seek to bribe Satan, it being impossible to bribe God to aid them in world domination; at this point we come into play by playing the role of the Cherubino mentioned above with the not so ~angiolesque~ name Bob to put the situation back in order. Is it technically at today's levels? Messiah, it's good to say it right away, even if on the box as recommended configuration it mentions a P2 300, 16mb video card (under direct 3d protocol or better Glide if you have a voodoo 3 like me) and 64 mb of ram, after having tried the game on other PCs too, with at least 128 mb of ram which will decrease various slowdowns in the game action; then if you have a processor that is not exaggeratedly faster than the recommended one and a nice SB Live! or Aureal 3d you should play comfortably at 800x600 with all the detail to the maximum with the wonders of the Environmental audio or A3d protocols! The graphic detail is quite good, the characters are made up of a good number of polygons, they move naturally and the variety is ensured by guards, scientists, policemen, robots, etc; the fluidity (whose threshold can be set in the options) is quite good, also taking into account the light sources, smoke effects, moving fans, artificial mists and the characters that populate the playing area but there are also unpleasant clipping effects and pop-ups that occasionally diminish a good visual evaluation; from an audio point of view we have excellent music by the now ubiquitous Tommy Tallarico (who already composed music for Dave Perry at the time of Cool Spot on 16bit machines) ranging from electrifying rock for moments of combat to absolute silence when perhaps you are about to approach to a highlight of the story, convincing sound effects, a good translation into Italian of the speech (which is not present in large quantities anyway!) and the aforementioned support for the 2 main positional audio protocols for pc. To remedy possible malfunctions (for friends bugs) of the game it is good to have the latest drivers for both the video card and the sound card in addition to patch number 2 (which now makes possession of the first useless) which I recommend installing before starting to play. In any case, by going to https://www.messiah.com/troubleshooting.htm you will find exhaustively described the solutions to the possible problems that can be encountered with Messiah as well as the benevolent effects of the patch, without however thinking that the game is very buggy in the manner of Sin or Ultima Ascension. Bob's skills Once the various options have been set (resolution, audio protocols, keyboard or joypad settings, etc) and watched the introductory full motion of decent quality, we see Bob enter the body of a guard and after a few seconds of astonishment of our own virtual alter ego the poor guy gets possessed by our little angel. Bob is able to possess all the enemies that we will meet along a path based on old cities, laboratories, sewers, etc. The possession of the enemies is precisely the peculiarity of this video game, given that, for example, having entered the body of a guard, the other guards will not suspect in the slightest that the enemy is closer than they can believe and many times in their dialogues (translated entirely into our language , even with some bad words, right from the opening scene) they complain precisely that they can't find us or that we are (according to them) just children. Once you have taken possession of a body, therefore, you will also have to exploit the characteristics of the cluster of polygons you have replaced in a profitable way for your ends: a door that a scientist can open can only be opened by him or if you are about to leaving a body for one more suited to the situation it will be enough for you, if you are really sadistic, to throw yourself from a dizzying height to smash the legs of the unfortunate person on duty to ensure that he cannot chase you or if you are skilled enough, leave the body where there are many enemies and start possessing and dropping more bodies in the shortest time to make them kill each other! The large amount of characters to own (which also includes, um , girls of easy virtue ^^;;) introduces another interesting aspect: being able to interact also with the various weapons of thegame, which for the record are nothing special in terms of originality, but present in good numbers such as shotguns, flamethrowers, pistols, welders (they will be useful to you on more than one occasion), harpoons and obviously punches, kicks and chokes that remind me of Metal Gear Solid, Konami's masterpiece finally in the pipeline for Windows platforms (who knows that one day the sequel too). A divine game? I get angry when a video game, due to some oversight or a not excellent playtest from stupendous, is branded with phrases like ~It would have been excellent if ...~ or ~too bad, it will be for the next occasion~; the excellent artificial intelligence of the game which obviously deserves applause from a programming point of view makes the game extremely difficult given that Bob being unable to attack when he doesn't have anyone he is easily vulnerable and if already a guard with almost perfect aim (at the lowest of 3 difficulty levels) forces us to flee to try to lose it when there are 2 or more death is certain, also because, alas, the camera system is anything but excellent and if every now and then I wonder why the button for unobstructed view of play area doesn't work (either via keyboard or via my MS sidewinder) escaping from guards when the camera rolls is practically impossible; I repeat, the artificial intelligence is excellent, you cannot think otherwise when a resting guard sees you, his colleague, with a gun in his hand, starts hitting you, the other guards run over hearing the noises, the body of the possessed victim is destroyed and you without the possibility of offense who start frantically looking for a (useless L) escape route 7 Summing up Faced with a perfect single-player game concept on paper (there is no trace of a multiplayer mode, nor are there rumors of a patch that subsequently enables it in the manner of System Shock 2), able to skillfully mix elements typical of platform games ( even if some jumps to make are too millimeter), adventures (the fact of overcoming certain areas gradually possessing the right character) and fps (sniper weapons and shooting scenes), with an above average technical realization , I don't feel like recommending it to anyone who has little patience or to anyone who wants a video game to finish in a short time and without worries, it being understood that a difficult game, unlike a frustrating one like in this case, is always welcome in a flood of video games that finish in a day or less. P.S. : if you decide to buy it anyway, pressing ESC during any moment of the game and typing ucantkillme will activate God mode. The Messiah of video games? It seems like forever when 3 and a half years ago I went to a friend's house to see a cd-rom full of news attached to the famous Anglo-Saxon publication Edge for the major videogame platforms of the moment among the videos present, the one of a videogame stood out for PC featuring a blond and chubby Cherubino who foreshadows a potential killer game from those few moving clips; or at least thought so Dave Perry, boss of Shiny Entertainment, extremely confident in his new project, just look at the enormous delay to reach the shelves of the shops (and the cancellation, among other things, of the Playstation version). After this long preamble, let's analyze whether Perry's latest effort will carve out a space in a much more aggressive market than 3 and a half years ago!", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
