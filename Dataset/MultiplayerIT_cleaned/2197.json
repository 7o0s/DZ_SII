{"name": "Mad Dash Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mad-dash-racing_a.html", "text": "He ran between rivers of fire and traps In Mad Dash we will have three different types of characters available: the Dashers who during the race will be able to use a kind of turbo that will allow them to increase their speed, the bashers who will have the ability to destroy many of the obstacles in the race, and the gliders who instead they will be able to make impressive leaps. By conquering 10 meteorite fragments that you will find along the way you will be able to activate all three of these special abilities to your character, but as soon as you fall, the fragments will be removed from you and you will lose your abilities. The multiplayer mode is the strong point of this game, in fact the fun to play against 3 friends is very different from what you feel playing alone against both During the races we will be able to place traps with which to block our opponents, or knock them out while overtaking Graphics and sound The creation of the characters, even if in a cartoon style, was successful for the developers, in fact they are quite detailed and pleasing to the eye: even the tracks are well done, they are full of shortcuts and rich in textures. The voice of the characters is not exactly the best, even if they are at a good level, but the music that will be the background to the races that will take place on the various circuits will compensate for this small lack. Ready....Set...Goaaaaaaaaaaa This game is suitable for those who have many friends, in fact it is much more fun to play in multiplayer with friends than in the single campaign, which in the end may not be the best of fun, however the game is of a good level, and will certainly be entertaining all those who decide to buy it. Pros: Fun in multiplayer mode Lots of special skills to use during the races Cons: It loses its charm in single player Once finished in single player mode, you will hardly pick it up to play it alone! A cartoon (foot) race!! This game could be taken as the XBox counterpart of Sonic R on sega saturn, in Mad Dash we will compete alongside a rather strange gang, with which we will have to go through numerous levels to collect fragments of a meteorite that instills magical powers. A very powerful sorcerer named Hex has decided to conquer these fragments to acquire their great power, and thus become invincible", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
