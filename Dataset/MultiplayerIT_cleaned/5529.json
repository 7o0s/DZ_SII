The game itself remains the same, that is, it is a painful journey of mourning in a dark and imaginative world, full of wonderful creatures that emit fluorescent lights, creating a dreamy and unique atmosphere. The story follows the dual track of reality and fantasy, in which the second seems to deny the first, but which turns out to be the only way to accept a painful and ineluctable truth. The little hooded protagonist, initially alone, soon finds a travel companion whose identity will be revealed in the advanced stages of the adventure, which itself lasts just over a couple of hours. We don't want to reveal much more about the plot, but know that it is the key element of the game, the one around which a world made of dark caves, deserted villages and imposing timeless architectures was built, which for composition recalls some works surrealistic, made up of spontaneous and apparently unconnected associations. The whole world of N.E.R.O. it seems to be a dreamlike theater where the conflict between the painful acceptance of reality and the desire to escape into an illusory universe is staged. The player is called upon to observe its evolution in the allegorical tale of a gang of criminals who have found refuge in the dark recesses of the game's caves and woods, mixed with the emergence of the repressed which gradually becomes more and more inevitable. The narration is conveyed by floating writings that support the various environments and which, in their brightness, end up strongly characterizing the visual style. We reviewed the PC version of N.E.R.O. Nothing Ever Remains Obscure: let's discover the improvements Puzzle If from a strictly narrative point of view N.E.R.O. manages to involve the player, motivating him to reach the conclusion, from the playful one he commits several missteps. The title of Storm in a Teacup is thought of as a walking simulator, ie it requires a lot of observation and understanding of the composition of the various elements to be truly appreciated. In short, as the genre wants, it requires the intellectual and emotional participation of whoever is on the other side of the screen. Unfortunately, sometimes it also requires you to solve simple puzzles, based on the interweaving of three basic mechanics: direct interaction with some buttons placed on pedestals; throwing magic balls at glowing buttons and pressing plates on the floor. The puzzles themselves aren't a huge obstacle to overcome, as they are simple and require very little thought. The problem here is that they feel unrelated to the rest of the game. By making an effort we can interpret them as overcoming the various blocks that prevent the protagonist from accepting reality, but in this case it is all our work, because in strictly rhetorical terms they fail to communicate anything, or at least fail to enrich the story in any way . Even the mechanics of searching for fragments of photographs (one photo for each area) scattered around the maps could have been managed better, so as not to become a nuisance (the fragments are small and not very visible). In essence, the player is led to believe that the playful part has been put there more to lengthen the broth than for real expressive needs of the plot. PC version Many of you will be wondering at this point what are the improvements that have led to the raising of the vote compared to the Xbox One version. As we mentioned at the beginning of the review, Storm in a Teacup capitalized on the criticisms received. If you go to read the old review, you will notice that among the cons we reported ~Italian is also missing in the subtitles~ and ~Frame rate and cleaning problems~. Well, both problems have been solved, given that now the floating writings are also in our language (some particularly cared about it) and that we did not have any fluidity problems with the test configuration. It should be noted that some text has some repetition problems and that there are various redundancies, but in general a good job has been done. The use of the mouse to aim, on the other hand, has physiologically resolved another of the reported problems, largely due to the use of the joypad, i.e. the difficulty of hitting the targets with the luminous spheres. In short, the PC version of N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure is overall better than the other and is certainly the best way to enter the world of Storm in a Teacup.", "date": "2016-05-04", "grade": "7.5"}
