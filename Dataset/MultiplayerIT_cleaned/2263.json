{"name": "Versailles 2 - Il Testamento", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/versailles-2-il-testamento.html", "text": "History It is the year of our Lord 1699, when the young Charles-ouis de Faverolles arrives at the King's court, in that splendid complex of palaces and gardens which is Versailles. The historical moment is critical, as the King of Spain is seriously ill and has no heirs to leave his kingdom to. The powerful of Europe, therefore, are weaving secret plots in order to get their hands on the Spanish possessions, while our young protagonist is trying to make ends meet at court. History Emerging from the crowd of boasters and lackeys is not easy in Versailles, where strict rules of behavior are the basis of social success. One word too many, the wrong dress on the wrong occasion, a secret not kept or kept for too long could lead to rapid social decline. And precisely in this scenario of intrigue and subterfuge, our alter ego will do everything to win the favor of the most illustrious and powerful characters. But what are Faverolles' aspirations? Why does this young man, of Spanish origin, want at all costs to find powerful connections at the King's court? In his heart, the young Faverolles dreams of being able to reach his beloved, Elvira, who is right in Spain, but for this he needs a diplomatic passport and so, driven by his passion, he will do everything to obtain the documents that they serve. He doesn't know, Faverolles, that this adventure of his will intertwine with the destinies of the whole of Europe, thwarting conspiracies and, who knows, creating others. All he wants is a passport to Spain to reach the woman he loves. Love, therefore, but also, and above all, adventure and mystery intertwine to give life to a fresco of imposing proportions which depicts the ambitious struggle for power and conquest in 1700 Europe. Graphics and Sound In the role of a young adventurer, therefore, we will be able to explore Versailles and visit its characteristic places, the most important and fascinating ones. We will be able to chat with the people who populate its streets and gardens, we will be able to make important friends and win the favor of famous people, who will allow us to take advantage of privileges and special licenses. What is offered to us by this atypical product is the possibility of visiting almost every corner of Versailles through a guided tour cleverly disguised as a video game. From a technical point of view, Versailles 2 certainly doesn't shine in terms of graphics, given that it is based on obsolete software with severe limitations. The only resolution available is an old 640x480x16 and the game is entirely in two dimensions. The graphic engine allows, in its primitiveness, to rotate the gaze at 360 (solid degrees, of course...) in order to see the whole environment that surrounds us. Ultimately, bitmap backdrops and rendered scenes, but nothing 3D that could upset our latest generation video cards. Moving in a totally photographic environment and rotating your gaze in every direction, essentially to see spherical photographs, requires very few hardware resources and in fact one wonders why a higher resolution has not been chosen, given that by now PCs are all capable of handling such an amount of information. Probably, the authors have come up against the need to fit all the videos and images into just two CDs, so they will have had to discard the idea of a higher video resolution. Graphics and Sound But it's not every day that you talk to a duke and then look up and observe the frescoes that decorate the rich ceilings of Versailles. And, on the other hand, the movies are made very well, with a rendering studied in detail and a level of compression that does not penalize the quality. The care taken in drafting the screenplay is then reflected in an excellent direction that enhances the contents of the plot, without getting lost in useless documentary-style sequences. In essence, then, we are dealing with bitmap backdrops, moreover in low resolution, intriguing films and a novel plot that would not look out of place on the shelves of a library. In short, a game for more demanding palates of content than of technique. As already mentioned, this is not the classic game for hardcore gamers but, in its atypical nature, it manages to give a sound lesson to much more famous and sophisticated games, at least as regards the dubbing in Italian. The voices are well characterized and surprisingly never out of place, always relevant to the situation and with a fairly good French pronunciation. The music is performed by an orchestra of twenty-five elements,the recording is unobtrusive and the accompaniment during the game is always appropriate. There aren't particularly sophisticated effects, there isn't surround sound or EAX support, but honestly it's not the game where you feel the need for so much technology, so that's just fine. Gameplay, story and interface Playing Versailles 2 - The Testament is simple, very simple, both because it is a title with an extremely simplified interface and because the overall difficulty is calibrated to very low levels, but let's see better, starting from the interface. At the bottom we find a bar containing the inventory boxes and a few additional icons. The inventory, in fact, consists of a series of boxes in which the objects that we will find along our adventure are inserted. We won't be the ones to collect these objects, but they will automatically become part of our luggage, perhaps after reaching a certain goal or after talking to someone. Luckily the bar has disappeared, because it's really ugly... The dialogues, furthermore, while always being funny and intriguing, cannot be interrupted, as can the video sequences, so every time one click too many will start a dialogue already heard, we will have to put up with it all in full, again. Gameplay, story and interface This fact allows me to introduce one of the least pleasant aspects of the whole game, namely its lack of interactivity. Advancing through the plot is all too easy, given its extreme linearity, and we will always find ourselves in a situation where we will be able to do nothing but go forward, explore a couple of areas, just the ones that are activated from time to time, and solve the puzzles that will be proposed to us, very easy puzzles, by the way. In short, the sensation is that of moving on a track and of being able to proceed in one direction only, without too many degrees of freedom. The only difficulty is encountered at the beginning, when you have to deal with a rough interface that creates a bit of disorientation, but then you get used to it in a short time and without too much pain. The puzzles, as we have said, are always very easy and the more challenging ones require knowledge of information taken directly from the documentation connected to the game, but they can also be solved by making attempts and this does not bode well, in the overall judgment. Added to this is the slowness in proceeding along the various routes mainly due to the obligatory fades, which slow down the passage from one area to the next. Despite being three acts, the linearity of the story, the limited exploration and the ease of the puzzles will drastically reduce the time necessary to complete the whole adventure, but fortunately the great compendium on the history of Versailles, the habits at court, the historical picture and the rest of the rich documentation accompanying this title, so that it will remain installed on the hard disk for a long time, even after Faverolles has revealed the intrigues of the court. Conclusions How can we evaluate a title like Versailles 2? How can we judge a game that isn't a game and a historical archive that isn't just that? In reality, as you have read from the rest of the article, we are dealing with a product with many lights and many shadows and which cannot be evaluated without taking each of them into due consideration. The outdated graphic aspect and the rough and slow game interface definitely undermine its playability and, for this reason, the overall quality suffers a lot, however we also have an interesting plot and engaging and well-made cutscenes, as well as a respectable audio section, with music created by a full orchestra and very well dubbed dialogues. In itself, if there were only this, the game would be barely interesting, reaching a limited sufficiency and nothing more, but given that to complete this title we find a rich historical section and an in-depth documentation on Versailles and the court of the Sun King , created by the highest authorities in the sector, the overall opinion grows considerably. It is obvious that we are dealing with a product made for an audience that is not that of traditional players and it is also obvious that the features introduced have been calibrated accordingly, so the importance that the graphic aspect and the slow interface is very small, compared to the importance of accurate historical reconstruction and accompanying documentation. If, on the one hand, the adventure is too linear, on the other it allowsthe player to experience a slice of life at court, almost as if he were playing the protagonist of a historical novel. Taking stock, and taking these factors into due account, in the end Versailles 2 is a pleasant and intriguing title, but not for everyone. The fragger, like the hardened adventurer, will have to keep their distance as this is not a game for them. First of all, a brief introduction... Versailles 2, despite what one might easily think, is not a traditional video game because if, on the one hand, it looks like a classic graphic adventure, on the other it includes a real virtual guide to the eighteenth-century neighborhoods of the Sun King. Behind this title lies a painstaking work that has involved important historical and cultural associations, such as the Reunion des Musees Nationaux and Le Chateau de Versailles, which have the undisputed merit of having created an encyclopaedic work full of news interesting about what life and customs were like at court, in an age of splendor and decorum.", "date": "2002-01-26", "grade": null}
