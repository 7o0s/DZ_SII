{"name": "Governator 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/governator-2.html", "text": "In the new Herocraft title we will impersonate a phenomenal cyborg, the latest model of the governor class, and we will be put on the battlefield with the sole purpose of destroying a military base in a Central Asian country, which has inexplicably fallen into alien hands. It is a classic two-dimensional shooter with clear references to the saga that has characterized this genre, namely Metal Slug. The terrorists we will have to face are scattered in abundance in each level, and will succeed, with their number, in causing us considerable problems. The enemies are not only humans controlled by aliens but also cyborgs, all equipped with different types of weapons and capable of putting us in difficulty in different situations. Fortunately we will be able to respond with pistols, shotguns and rocket launchers, like real Terminators. Technically the Herocraft product is good, the sprites are very colorful and very detailed with well-characterized enemies and with excellent sequences describing their killing. We mentioned the difficulties encountered in the game, unfortunately these adversities are not only made up of enemies, but rather a level design that seems to have been created specifically to see the player suffer. The lack of possibility of aiming and shooting diagonally is quite inexplicable and proves to be a very strong lack, and if this were not enough, the difficulty of controlling our cyborg in forward leaps is at least absurd. To blow up the governor we will have to press up and to the right, the slightest uncertainty will be fatal, given that the robot will remain in mid-air perhaps falling right on the mine we wanted to avoid. During our test we also noticed an exaggerated slowness in the response of the cyborg to the commands given by us, a problem that is really difficult to bear. Overall, Governator 2 proves to be a fairly ironic and light-hearted title, which does not present any innovation and which simply follows in the footsteps of Metal Slug while not offering the same quality.
