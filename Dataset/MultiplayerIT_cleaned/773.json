{"name": "Sid Meier's Civilization IV - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-civilization-iv-recensione.html", "text": "A dutiful introductory hat: the secret of an announced success By 2005 there was nothing left to do but turn to the past and look for the weak points of such a successful series to smooth out any rough edges and attempt the feat of producing, for the fourth time in almost fifteen years, a title that could be considered valid alternative to the predecessors. Civilization rests its fortune on a series of factors that have always distinguished it in a market populated by clones and similar that could have undermined its authority. Longevity and depth are the fundamental ingredients of the winning recipe. Longevity that guarantees the title a multi-year fortune, depth that gives depth to the game, that brings new experiences to each game, that gives the feeling of a powerful structure behind artificial intelligence and that makes numerous elements available to the buyer game to avoid the boredom effect. There have never been, in the history of the evolution of this title, particular technical achievements such as to define it as a forerunner for who knows what new graphic technologies or for the introduction of revolutionary game systems. Already the first Civilization managed to amaze with the ambitious project of proposing the ~game of civilizations~, enclosing, in a single title, the entire human history. In a market strongly conditioned by the incessant demand for ever more powerful hardware, capable of offering video games that are increasingly advanced from a technical point of view, but less and less characterized by an appeal that can make them truly unforgettable, a title like Civilization has the merit of offering years of enjoyment for all lovers of the strategy genre. Analysis of a classic There is nothing never seen in Civilization IV, everything brings to mind the previous chapters. Those who have already had the pleasure of knowing Sid Meier's masterpieces will have no trouble recognizing the classic mechanisms of the game. Despite the operations of refined aesthetic surgery to the graphic apparatus (now characterized by a brand new graphic engine) and to the game interface, the structure of the gameplay remains unchanged. We find the turn based approach, the interface of unit movements, the management of land resources, just as the game modes remain unchanged. Everything as it once was, but with that extra edge capable of making this title a new best seller. However, it is worth presenting the game as a whole, offering an excursus to all those who want to approach this series for the first time. Civilization is a turn-based strategy game, which offers the player the opportunity to live a historical-style game experience, going through history through the journey made by man from the dawn of civilization to the present day (and beyond). At the start of the game, the player chooses a people to lead along the dense meshes of history; each people is assigned a historical character who will represent the player's avatar and to whom two characteristics are assigned, these characteristics constitute the ~character~ of the people that will be formed, influencing its behavior. Once the people have been chosen, the time comes to select the planet on which to develop civilization; there are different types, whose climatic or morphological characteristics can affect the game in different ways. A desert planet, for example, will be characterized by the scarcity of food resources, a tropical climate will be characterized by the presence of numerous forests; a planet with abundant seas and lands arranged in archipelagos will be the ideal scenario for a type of game based on navigation and all maritime activities, while a planet characterized by the presence of a single large continent will see land connections more developed. The aim of the game is, first of all, to develop one's own civilization by overcoming the difficulties imposed by the presence of other peoples (stable and nomadic) in the vicinity of one's settlements and conquering the most important scientific discoveries that allow one to progress from a technological and of artistic and cultural achievements. Crushing enemies by subjecting them to one's own power is one of the three ways to achieve final victory, more suitable for those peoples who base their power on aggression and expansionist militarism. Another way to reach the final goal is to excel in the search for highly advanced technologies (typical of the last playable era, the space era) capable of allowing the construction of spaceships capable of conquering new planets (hence the famous spin-off Alpha Centauri which started right from this point and developed the game idea into aor futuristic and alien scenery). Finally, there is the possibility of concluding the game by conquering the palm of people with the greatest cultural influence in the world. The structure does not change Once you have set your game options, it's time to take part in the game and build your own civilization. The initial endowment includes a unit of warriors and one of settlers. Settlers are units used to found new cities. Finding a suitable place for the foundation of the former is essential. The territory has different characteristics both from a military tactical point of view and from that of resources. The map is divided, like a giant chessboard, into small squares. Each square represents a portion of territory with its own characteristics, which portray the type of terrain and the presence of particular resources. The management of this aspect of the game is very important, the morphological characteristics of the terrain can influence not only the speed of movement of the units, but also grant bonuses and penalties during battles. The structure does not change A city should be founded near areas particularly rich in raw materials and resources for the development of the economy and population. Raw materials, in particular, represent an enormous source of income and power, as they are very rare, precious and useful for having access to increasingly advanced technologies. The management of this aspect of the game is very important, the morphological characteristics of the terrain can influence not only the speed of movement of the units, but also grant bonuses and penalties during battles. Once the city is founded, the time comes to start the recruitment of units and the construction of the first buildings, in parallel with the planning of scientific research. The units constitute the main element of control of the territory, both from a military point of view and from that of efficiency. The ~workers~ can be used to build infrastructure (mainly roads and, where possible, railways) and structures useful for exploiting the resources scattered throughout the territory. The borders of the first domains are highlighted by a continuously growing area that expands over the territory in proportion to the growth of the influence of its civilization. The influence is constituted by the cultural level reached; the city can in fact produce buildings that increase the culture of the population and in this way attract special characters capable of further enhancing the influence. The construction of infrastructure becomes essential when you reach locations rich in resources. In fact, to use them, it is necessary to connect the production structures to the cities via the road network. When a city is connected to resources and raw materials, previously inaccessible levels of production can be unlocked, thanks to the introduction of new materials essential for the construction processes. While cities expand and civilizations make their first significant discoveries, scout units explore the surrounding territory in search of new areas to control and civilizations to come into contact with. Through the gates of time Although it is not a novelty, nor is it the exclusive property of this saga, the ability to probe every single historical era with the same depth gives Civilization a majestic appearance. The care with which the various eras have been crafted is reflected in the large number of units, buildings, wonders, technologies and historical characters contained in this game. This may be why the ubiquitous Civipedia (an accurate encyclopedia of civilizations) provides not only data relating to the game itself, but also historical insights. What is most striking, however, is the ability with which this game manages to renew itself while maintaining the same freshness it presents during the early stages of the game. The powerful discoveries that can be implemented in modern times perfectly replace the initial technological achievements while maintaining the tension of research at high levels and the will to be the first to put their hands on the new scientific achievements. Furthermore, the war scenario manages to change continuously by proposing continuous developments to face, such as when, having reached the atomic age, the explosion of H-bombs forces players to abandon the territories made toxic by radiation. Diplomacy: the art of adding grist to one's mill Diplomacy is another key aspect of Civilization. The relationship with other peoples is based precisely on the agreements and negotiations that are completed. Depending on the characteristics of each population it will be more or less easy to reach theestablishment of sufficiently solid relationships to allow the exchange of goods or the stipulation of treaties. In the early stages of the game it may seem convenient to treat the diplomatic requests of known peoples sufficiently, since one does not see the threat that could derive from inaccurate choices. Well in Civilization IV the relationships between populations change according to the choices made from the beginning to the present. If a people's trust has already been betrayed once, for example by suffering an attack during a period of peace regulated by a treaty, it will hardly be possible to re-establish a relationship of peaceful cooperation. Then, when the number of peoples with whom one comes into contact grows, the problems can increase, because each people is in turn in relationship with the others, forming a dense network of relationships that influence each other in a reaction to chain, just like it happens in the real world. A trading partner may not welcome your cooperation with other peoples deemed enemies. To all this, which was already largely present in the previous chapters of the saga, we add one of the innovations of this title: the introduction of religions. News: What big ears you have - said Little Red Riding Hood At this point it is necessary to dwell on the innovations that differentiate the new title from the previous ones. As already mentioned, the introduction of religion is an element of absolute novelty in the gameplay. In fact, religion has an enormous weight both on cultural influence, and in relations with other states, and in the constitution and maintenance of particular social orders. In the game there are the 7 main religions, they can be ~discovered~ by achieving certain objectives in the technology tree. Being the first founding people of a religion (or the first to have discovered it) gives the possibility of founding sacred cities and of obtaining considerable bonuses. Cities consecrated to one (or more) religions also have significant benefits in maintaining good humor in the population and can produce a limited number of missionaries, capable of bringing their religion to other cultures. The greater the presence of these characters in the territory, the greater the chances of seeing an important religious figure born within a city, with extraordinary powers, capable of donating special buildings or of sacrificing himself for his own people by donating a considerable number of benefits. In addition to the importance of taking part in the race for the foundation of a religion, the aspects connected to the diplomatic relationship with other peoples must also be taken into consideration. Furthermore, religions are not exclusive, but just to add a little spice to the game, it is possible to have more than one cult among the population, which can cause problems of public order. On the other hand, the establishment of a state religion entails taking a position towards other peoples, creating a further level of interaction in diplomatic and cultural relations. News: What big ears you have - said Little Red Riding Hood In every aspect of the game we notice a greater attention to the details and data that the player can draw on to obtain useful information for optimal management of the city and the territory. As per tradition it is possible to view the details of the city. From this interface we access generic information on the state of health, mood and socio-economic organization of the population. Notable innovations can also be found in the management of armies and battles. First of all, the units now suffer bonuses and maluses in correspondence with the type of territory on which they are fighting. It follows that certain units are more effective than others in certain areas, and real specialized platoons can be formed. This novelty is linked to a second, no less important one, which absolutely enhances the system for managing the seniority of the troops. In the previous chapters, in fact, the troops earned bonuses for seniority, but there was no possibility to change other combat parameters. Needless to make a comparison in numbers: Civilization IV doubles its predecessor in almost all fields, starting from the buildings present, 100 against the 29 of the old chapter. Civilization IV adds a pinch of typical RPG management to the upgrade, allowing the player to choose, in correspondence with the increase in rank, which aspect to enhance; in addition to the generic strength, in fact, the values of specialized combat can be improved. For example, it is possible to give troops combat bonuses in particular types of territory (such as desert or forest) or with", "date": "2005-11-02", "grade": null}
