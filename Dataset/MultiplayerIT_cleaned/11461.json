{"name": "Wordox: Ruba Parole", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wordox-ruba-parole.html", "text": "Scrabble is in all respects one of the simplest and at the same time enjoyable multiplayer experiences available on mobile, so it is not surprising that Vivendi is trying to build on the success of the EA Mobile product. As announced at the beginning, however, Wordox is not a simple clone (also because in this case the legal repercussions would have been inevitable), but a puzzle with significantly different mechanics. It is always a question of composing words, but their value is not defined on the basis of the complexity of the letters used, but rather on the length of the lemma. It is played on a grid of small squares, on which the letters made available must be positioned (vertically or horizontally): once a complete word has been formed, the player earns as many points as the squares occupied. Each participant is assigned a color of the tiles, since in the event of intersection with a lemma composed by an opponent, the letters involved automatically pass into their possession. To complete these simple mechanics, two types of special squares intervene within the grid: the orange ones allow you to accumulate extra points which will actually be counted when passing over the pink ones, which also involve a reset of the game board. The goal of each game is to reach the pre-established score target before the opponents, which makes Wordox more frenetic and less reasoned than Scrabble, also thanks to a skimpy time limit allowed for the composition of the words. Compared to the EA Mobile product, the Vivendi title also has the advantage of supporting pass-the-handset multiplayer for up to four players, even if in the end the playful experience of Scrabble is overall more satisfying. Perhaps the fault of the excessive underlying simplicity of Wordox, but a weight is also covered by a questionable vocabulary, capable of giving unknown words for good and canceling perfectly sensible terms. Another sore point of the product (also common to the illustrious colleague) is the subtlety of the single player mode, in fact practically non-existent. While boasting decidedly more lively and colorful graphics and a multiplayer mode open to four players, Wordox therefore ends up not getting very far, prematurely losing its bite and leaving the throne to Scrabble.
