{"name": "Il MOBA dei record", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123012-league-of-legends-il-moba-dei-record.html", "text": "There has been a lot of talk about League of Legends in the last two years, but the first version of the game, also released on retail shelves, dates back to 2009. Since then, the production of street Riot has made it, quickly becoming the online game most shared on the planet, to the point of representing, perhaps, one of the reasons why Valve also decided to bring the original Warcraft III mod, Defense of the Ancients, back to life. In fact, League of Legends and DOTA 2 largely share their origins, given that both were developed with the precious contribution of the modders responsible for the original game formula. To date, with DOTA 2 now officially released, the ~war of numbers~ between the two software houses is very difficult to interpret, given that Valve has always tends to be rather protective of its statistics. In any case, although the post-release of DOTA 2 has seen excellent growth, at the moment the records are firmly in the hands of Riot, which can still boast more than thirty million unique players per month and a peak of connected users more than five million at the same time. Let's go over the reasons for this success together, also analyzing the updates of the last period. Let's find out together why League of Legends is the top online game of the moment One player, one hundred champions The true heart of the experience offered by League of Legends are the 115 champions available so far, a number that continues to grow. For Riot, this is a constant work in progress, as through community feedback and analysis of statistics, each of the frequent patches contains small and large adjustments to the abilities of the characters. This is accompanied by occasional revamps, i.e. patches more targeted to a single champion that completely review its statistics and, occasionally, also update its appearance. The attention that Riot places on the development of individual champions has increased over time, and a practical example is represented by Lucian, the latest release, the result of over a year of work on design and balancing. The progressive unlocking of the champions, which can be purchased both with real money and with in-game currency, represents one of the main initial pushes to the player's progress, also considering that Riot offers the possibility of using some of them for free with a weekly rotation, so as to grant a test before disbursement. From Defense of the Ancients to LoL League of Legends, just like DOTA 2, is a direct descendant of the original Defense of the Ancients map, created by some members of the Warcraft 3 community, and in fact maintains several of its founding characteristics. The main map, known as the Rift of the Summoners, is presented in the classic three-path form, with the opposing bases and ten Champions divided into two teams. All players start each game at level one and work their way up to 18, progressively unlocking four attack skills, and purchasing items from shops with the money accumulated by killing opposing NPCs and other players. Thanks to the balance operated by Riot, most of the League of Legends game sessions take place in a rather orderly manner, especially if the participants are players with a certain amount of experience on their shoulders. A few twists are never lacking, but the low mana cost of attack skills, the rapid accumulation of gold and the limited size of the map lead to very structured developments, which mostly follow a classic three-movement progression. With the team initially divided on the paths, they move from checking the lines to advancing towards the towers, then reuniting the team to launch the final attack. Another peculiarity of the League of Legends gameplay is the great speed with which the Champions move around the map, instantly changing direction and launching physical and magical attacks in a fraction of a second, leading to clashes that not only see a large number of abilities used simultaneously , but they can also result in nothing done, with mutual disengagement and escape (a rarer event, for example, in the main competitor from Valve, where the clashes often end with an elimination). This is also thanks to the summoner spells, another peculiarity of the game, i.e. two freely selectable skills from a pool that has a total of 13. Among the most used, in fact, there are those expressly dedicated to escaping from ganks and one-on-one clashes . Runes and Masteries also play a very important role in the gameplay mechanics. These work like classic MMORPG skill trees (see Worldd of Warcraft), with points unlocking as your summoner level increases. The Runes, on the other hand, are to be purchased (again, with in-game currency or real money), and provide bonuses relating to the basic characteristics of the individual champions (attack, defense, basic speed and many others). Naturally, a player intending to use more champions will need to have different configurations of Runes and Masteries aside, adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. Overall, as demonstrated by the many sites full of statistics on the percentages of wins achieved by individual champions, the overall balancing work done by Riot is remarkable. Should some champions prove to be too effective, or presumed to be so, in some of their aspects, the Draft mode and the Ranked games (in which you can only participate after reaching the thirtieth summoner level) allow you to ~ban~ three champions on each side first of the beginning of the battle, adding a further strategic aspect to the balance made by the software house. As for the level of challenge offered, League of Legends actually offers an initial learning curve that is less steep than its main competitor, due to a large number of factors, including the absence of deny (we explained what it is in our two-part guide), skills with lower mana cost, faster movement, kills that don't steal money from the victim, and so on. Nonetheless, once you pass the early stages and reach a summoner level around 20, the matchmaking will start to do its job, and you will find how often other players with more experience and organization can impart lessons in humility, confirming how the ability of the individual and team mechanics matter far more than any rune set. But how much does it cost me? The microtransactions in League of Legends have been handled very carefully and, at times, rather aggressively, but this does not mean at all that the game falls into the infamous category of so-called ~pay to win~. As often happens with free to play productions, there are two distinct currencies, Influence Points, which are earned for each match won (or lost, but to a much lesser extent) together with experience, and Riot Points, which are purchased instead with real money. The items in the in-game shop, which vary from skins modified for champions, to various experience and gain Boosts, up to Runes, can be purchased with either currency (with the exception of boosts , which require real money). Naturally, getting up to summoner level 30 without spending a single euro will take some time, while opening your wallet and spending an amount equal to the cost of a new game in the shop, the operation will be much shorter, thanks to a couple of XP Boosts well placed (be careful though, because this will take you to the level cap making you earn fewer Influence Points than expected, then forcing you again to wait, or spend, to complete the Runes). In other words, real money spent in League of Legends can make leveling faster, and, in the very short term, offer slight advantages over those who haven't yet completed their rune collections, but once the level cap is reached, the whole situation is destined to balance out again. Even the purchase of the samples takes place according to the same philosophy, however, considering that ~discounts~ are made on rotation on the prices (both real and virtual), by checking the shop often it will not be necessary to open the wallet, unless you are in a particular hurry . Alternate modes Summoner's Rift isn't the only mode offered by League of Legends. In fact, the client menus offer several alternatives, among which the most recent is the Howling Abyss map, which hosts the so-called ARAM games. We have already extensively discussed their characteristics in the dedicated special, and we will not dwell here, limiting ourselves to confirming how the mode represents an excellent diversion from the classic games, offering much shorter and more frenetic battles, even if a pinch of strategy is always necessary to obtain good results. Selva Demoniaca is instead a map that hosts two teams of three players. With some differences, such as the greater availability of gold and the starting from level 3, it is a speeded up version, and with only two lines to control, of the Summoners' Rift, which lends itself to shorter games (maximum half an hour ) and hectic. In the central part of the map there are two Altars, with bonuses for those who manage to gain control of them. Completely different design instead for the Valley of the Crystals, map for cfive players structured in a ring with control points arranged all around. In the central part, buffs are available for those who manage to conquer them, while the completion of short missions will lead to bonuses for the whole team. Each of these modes has been the subject of a precise study by the developers, and balanced with changes to the shop (some items are in fact exclusive to certain modes) and to the general balances. The result, overall, is an enviable play offer. Although the Rift of the Summoners always remains the point of reference (and, not surprisingly, the only one to host ranked matches), the alternatives all have interesting peculiarities, in particular ARAM (or Howling Abyss), which manages to condense with effective the last phase of a normal game in a few frantic minutes.", "date": "2013-09-09", "grade": "9.0"}
