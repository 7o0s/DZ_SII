{"name": "L'allegro chirurgo robotico", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143615-underground-lallegro-chirurgo-robotico.html", "text": "Grendel Games is a Dutch studio specializing in the so-called ~serious games~, a way of understanding the video game that arose a few years ago (perhaps in reaction to the invasion of ~casual games~, we suspect), which wants to exploit the ever greater technical possibilities of medium to emancipate it from the role of ~mere~ entertainment and make it useful even in areas, precisely, more serious than everyday life. Underground, for example, was even created to replace the cold, complicated and very expensive simulators that both medical students and already established surgeons use to train themselves to perform laparoscopic surgery, i.e. (we quote from Wikipedia), that ~surgical technique that involves performing abdominal surgery without opening the wall~. As such, for a thousand reasons, we are unable to judge it; but Underground has also been released on the eShop for the enjoyment of all players, and we, as usual, are here to tell you what it is, how it is, if it is worth keeping an eye on and buying it. It was born as a support for surgery students but, as a game, how is this Underground? Scalpel! Swab! wiimote! The most suitable way to take advantage of Underground in all its potential would be to obtain the dedicated ~controller~ from the same manufacturer, a rather complicated and cumbersome device of which two Wiimotes are an integral part, at the modest sum of around 200 Euros, very less expensive than the corresponding professional simulators, but definitely not within the reach of a common player. According to the developers, with this gadget the game should train the surgical profession faster and more efficiently than with traditional machines, while making the doctor/player have fun. Obviously we have not been able to get our hands on this contraption, and even if we had had it available we would never have been able to evaluate the actual advantages in this sense: it is enough for you to know, and we will close the discussion on the surgery issue here, that the US National Center for Biotechnology Information sponsored the operation in an initial preliminary study, and a comprehensive and comprehensive scientific study is being published. For us layman players, Grendel Games has seen fit to implement the GamePad (initially the title was expected on the Wii, but four years of development have suggested the move to the new Nintendo flagship): the two analog sticks cover the function of the two Wiimote . But what exactly is Underground? This is a puzzle game strongly influenced by Lemmings and which also owes a little something to the latest Mario Vs. Donkey Kong (which, however, in turn derived from Lemmings, and the circle closes), only that instead of the very stupid suicidal animals there are intelligent robots trapped, as can be inferred from the title, in complex underground mines, which do not move forward towards the end of the level if the road is not practicable. And the task of the player, driving Swank, a powerful and versatile flying automaton equipped with a nice pair of telescopic arms, is precisely to make the road practicable, eliminating obstacles, creating special ones to prevent the robots from going to their deaths. certain or to make him take a certain direction more complicated than normal which however passes for a piece of Quadronite (the more one collects the more the victory is complete), and building, recycling the wreckage found around, bridges, stairs and so on . Since the game is framed from Swank's perspective, more or less three-quarters from above, in the foreground there are precisely those two arms that can be controlled independently of each other, with the Wiimotes in the ~professional~ version, with the sticks on the GamePad , and which can be equipped with three different tools, interchangeable in real time thanks to the touch screen: a drill, pincers to grab various objects, and a welder, very useful for melting. Awakening things that shouldn't be awakened A classic, in the mines, from the time of Tolkien onwards. And the mines of Underground are no less, given how complicated they are, full of dangers and obstacles, enemies on which to intervene directly or by sending the strongest robots to meet them, and also bosses who close off each of the four areas, to them vault composed of a series of levels, in which the game is divided. Just the level design is one of the first things that catches the eye: always well done and very intelligent, not only does it gradually become more complicated as one might expect, but it also manages to accompany the player in making better use of Swank's potential. In the beginning, for example, one could also useand only one of the arms, but then, little by little, new elements are introduced which must be tackled with both, perhaps passing in real time from one tool to another with great dexterity. All this, we repeat, with a curve that rises in an exemplary manner, without ever putting the player in a hurry or anxiously (for example, there is no time limit) and indeed also creating situations of total stasis in which, however, one can study in depth the level and plan all the moves. For this reason, Underground is not a particularly difficult game, although it requires a lot of study and also a good skill with the pad: it leaves the player all the time to decide what to do and how to do it, and even if a level has to be repeated, because they let themselves die all the robots or even simply because not everything possible has been collected, it is done with great pleasure precisely by virtue of this accessibility that introduces us to great complexity. However, to undermine this idyllic panorama there are a whole series of small problems: for example, you will notice an AI of the automatons that is not always very fine, sometimes they do not take the path they should even if you have done everything right. Above all, however, the problems reside in the controls and in the camera, and are linked to each other and basically due to the premises of the whole operation: the arms are in fact made to respond 1:1 to the movements of the Wiimote, and it is clear that sticks cannot give the same accuracy. Sometimes you will find yourself, for example, unintentionally making stalactites collapse (in fact, to make them fall, simply tap them twice) from the ceiling and have to start over, just as you will sometimes have to reconsider your movements better to go and intervene on a very small. In turn, the camera is linked to the movement of the arms: moving them closer zooms in, vice versa moving them away. Even this seems to be due to the nature of laparoscopy, but it cannot be said that it is a solution that particularly caters to those who simply want to play. In short, they are manufacturing defects that are also of a certain importance, but which can be easily overcome by getting used to it, and which do not affect the very pleasant development of the adventure and the increasingly complex and inventive puzzles. Performance made even more pleasant by graphics which, although deliberately dark and although sometimes betraying its Wii origins with models that are not extremely detailed, sometimes poor textures and clipping phenomena, generally make a great effect given the amount of elements on screen, the quality of the visual effects and the choice of colors, but above all by a sound that is scarce in variety but exceptional in quality, very John Williams-like, and by a surprisingly moving and touching story, told in a very original way: excellent cut scenes totally devoid of speech, delicate and poetic.", "date": "2015-01-16", "grade": "7.4"}
