Beyond the vicissitudes related to the development and the exit of Fumito Ueda from Sony to create his genDESIGN studio, thus participating in the project as an external professional, many things have changed in the gaming world in these seven years since the announcement. However, the iconic Japanese developer has remained true to his convictions: although informed and up-to-date, he is not interested in the latest trends that have invaded this particular sphere of entertainment, having the deep conviction that a video game must excite and tell a good story . Despite the important time jump compared to his previous creations, The Last Guardian is closely connected to that way of understanding video games and, perhaps surprisingly, this idea has not aged particularly, and indeed has been enriched in terms of gameplay for adapt to some of today's dictates that are now due. We are here to express our opinion, reducing spoilers to a minimum even at the risk of giving you a less in-depth review than usual. The time has finally come, we have played The Last Guardian in its final version The mysteries of life The first thing to do, as is sad practice by now, is to download the day-one patch. Just over 1 GB, which even seem few given the latest trends, aimed at solving bugs and supporting PlayStation 4 Pro and HDR; the total disk size is about 14 GB, testifying to the nature of the title that has its roots on PlayStation 3. Technical data aside, we approached the game with strict respect and as great fans of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus , but also with further awareness and experiences gained over time, thanks to titles that in the meantime have redefined the adventure genre such as The Last of Us and others on different systems. The Last Guardian focuses in its entirety on the story - in the form of flashbacks - of a boy from a remote village who knows where, who somehow finds himself in a valley from which it is apparently impossible to escape. Waking up in the company of a creature with mythological features, as evidenced by the initial sequence which shows some of those that really existed in the collective imagination. A relationship destined to evolve over time, because the vicissitudes of the two protagonists will lead them to a profound connection, until they become the backbone of the production and affect the dynamics of gameplay. The setting is made up of imposing structures that are lost as far as the eye can see, heights that cause dizziness just by sticking your head out, obstacles that require ingenuity to overcome. The collaboration between the two is therefore fundamental, because the boy can move easily in narrow spaces or climb buildings when there are only small holds, on the back of the creature he can jump between very distant points or defend himself from the animated dangers that populate the setting. In the opening bars, Trico's trust must be earned by removing some spears stuck in his body and feeding him, then perhaps using elements of the scenario to indicate the actions to be performed. The creature will not always respond promptly, and only after several hours of play will there be greater harmony, which will allow you to tame its behavior using some gestures (executable with R1 plus one of the four front buttons of the DualShock 4). Or at least try, because maybe there will be a mirror with the features of an eye to prevent him from continuing, something else that diverts his attention: in The Last Guardian the boy is monitored all the time, while his partner enjoys his own intelligence artificial and an instinct typical of animals. But what is Trico, ultimately? We analyzed and retraced its behavior throughout the game: in our opinion it is mainly a feline, a grown cat that scratches with its paws, which has the typical expressions of an adorable cat, which it evaluates with its eyes before jumping the distance and positions himself with his butt. But it also obviously has the features of a bird and the typical behavior of a dog, capable of interpreting the gestures of its companion, becoming attached to it and following it even in times of difficulty. Each player will draw their own considerations by experiencing the interaction with this creature firsthand: it is enough for you to know that thename Trico is among the most accredited candidates for the next feline that will live in the writer's house. Another ~passive~ protagonist is this sort of fluid which is found inside the small barrels that serve as food for Trico, but which also flows from some amphorae and seems to give life to armor stubborn in kidnapping the boy and barring the way for the two either way. In terms of level design, the adventure follows a similar progression, and the first few hours are beautiful but without jolts: you learn how to interact with Trico and use him to overcome otherwise impossible distances or heights, you face environmental puzzles during which you have to activate levers or procure food - very classic - you learn the first narrative information. Always and above all in the early hours you move in limited spaces, and the camera reveals some problems both when it acts on its own and when you try to manage it with the right analogue, becoming schizophrenic in proximity to a ceiling or a close wall , even more if on the back of Trico. You try to move an elephant in a room, but that doesn't mean that it could have been done better. Playstation 4 trophies The Last Guardian offers 24 trophies, of which 7 are gold. Completing it for the first time brings a fairly low percentage of completion as a ~gift~, less than 30%: to obtain all the trophies, activities that represent spoilers are necessary and which for this reason we will not tell you about, together with for example the need to complete the adventure in less than 30, 15 and 5 hours, feed all the barrels to Trico, have the creature's head stuck in all the holes (!). It will probably be necessary to finish the adventure at least a second time to obtain the coveted platinum. Loneliness and company Paradoxically, following the sequence of the bridge shown during E3 in Los Angeles which occurs after about 4-5 hours of play, the situation improves from every point of view: the camera is less tantrums, the platform phases acquire complexity and airiness , the puzzles become ingenious - exploiting for example the water, the physical power of Trico, the interconnection of gears and towers - the story begins to pick up pace and there are events involving other antagonists. Giving rise to aggressive sequences with a high emotional rate, during which our actions can affect those of others. Among the best sections we have those in which the boy moves on wires suspended in the void, with the need to reach those mirrors mentioned above by climbing numerous structures; you also have to rack your brains a little more to figure out how to proceed. The control system is extremely similar to that of ICO, which offers among other things the triangle for jumping and not the usual X to which we are now accustomed. In The Last Guardian we have elements from both chapters, but the greatest similarities are with the original one, also in terms of level design. The presence of Trico, who can be ~scaled~ in a similar way to the giants of Shadow of the Colossus, serves to make the gameplay dynamic like never before; however, clinging to the creature is automatic on the occasion of large jumps or escapes, without the need to leave a special key pressed. Rather the relationship between the two is reminiscent of that of Wander and Agro, but in the case of The Last Guardian it is much more pronounced, important in terms of gameplay and a fundamental pillar of the narrative component. On a couple of occasions we got teary-eyed at what we saw on the screen, and it was exciting to notice small details such as Trico's concern, his rolling in the water, his growing affectionate, creating a connection that predictably explodes in the last stages of the adventure. Finally, unlike the other two works by Ueda, the story is told in a simple, direct, methodically progressive way, to the point of being less surprising if we want. In any case, there are different interpretations once the credits are over, which make you think about some actions performed in the first person during the previous hours of the game. We completed The Last Guardian in just over 12 hours (timed!), a duration that is absolutely adequate for the type of experience it offers; by starting over it is possible to unlock alternative costumes for the boy, linked to the number of barrels fed to Trico, leaving the rest of the replayability to the desire to relive some passages of the adventure. The menus offer a choice reduced to the bone, with few options related to the camera and audio: we found the constant suggestions of commands that appear arbitrarily in the first few hours a bit annoying, we would have appreciated an optionion to deactivate them as soon as you become familiar with the control system. We have not forgotten the graphic sector, which in its artistic vein manages perfectly to convey that sense of grandeur and solitude of the settings, as well as giving memorable glimpses in the exteriors. There are several elements that betray nature across generations of the product, especially as regards the effects used, which are few, or the interaction with water and textures, often monothematic and not comparable with those of the latest generation games. There are also touches of class such as the wind interacting with Trico's feathers, the animations of both the latter and the boy, the enormous polygonal mass of the creature and the structures of the valley, truly able to convey the grandeur of the whole. In a strict technical sense, The Last Guardian therefore suffers from ups and downs, but the strengths listed and the artistic level return an overall impact that is largely satisfactory. We played the entire title on PlayStation 4 Pro with a 4K panel capable of interpreting the HDR signal, which the game automatically supports without the possibility of deactivating it. In this configuration we found a smooth and aliasing-free image quality (we don't know what rendering technique was used), together with perfect fluidity at 30 frames per second in most cases: in some external sections a motion rather marked blur, which depending on one's sensitivity can be more or less annoying. The HDR does a great job in outdoor scenes when blinded by the sun, in those indoors thanks to a great contrast between the lit and unlit areas. An improvement compared to the game on the ~smooth~ version of the console is certainly noticeable, which pays off above all in terms of frame rate - far from being as fluid as on the Pro version - but fortunately it shares all the remaining advantages that we have listed a few lines above . As far as the musical sector is concerned, the excellent soundtrack created by maestro Takeshi Furukawa and played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra accompanies the protagonists in a timid way when required, more incisive in moments of greater emotional tension, resulting in a fine workmanship also from the point of view purely technical. If we really want to go into virtuosity and comparisons, the soundtrack of Shadow of the Colossus, composed by Kow Otani, enjoyed a superior variety and arrangements, with some truly unforgettable pieces. Even that of The Last Guardian defends itself, but is more monotonous and lacks that unforgettable song that defines the entire production. Inside the Collector's there is a code that allows you to download a special application to listen to the soundtrack directly on PlayStation 4, with the option to export all the songs (nineteen) in Stereo MP3 format on a USB stick.", "date": "2016-12-05", "grade": "8.6"}
