{"name": "Un ninja per Wii U", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/113400-ninja-gaiden-3-razors-edge-un-ninja-per-wiiu.html", "text": "The return of Ryu Hayabusa was one of the most burning disappointments, even if partly expected, of 2012. The third chapter of the polygonal version of the Tecmo ninja had too many problems to be true, not even justified by the separation from Itakagi, which the series l 'he had invented a few years ago. Not a total rejection of our review (which we invite you to read at this address to know everything about the game from the plot to the mechanics), but in short, nothing that was really worth playing. Now, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is out in the WiiU launch window, a revised and corrected version of last year's title with a series of additions that patch up where the mistakes were made last year more serious. An important release in some respects, given that Nintendo is the publisher of a game recommended for over 18s and above all given the chronic lack of this type of title on the previous, millionaire, console of the Kyoto house. A good sign more for users than for fans of the ninja. Where do I start from? The plot is the same, very bizarre, but at least with a series of additions in the cutscenes that will help clarify the more obscure passages of the plot. The problem is that, in any case, it is a game that will put you in front of absurd things, as already mentioned in the first review, and which were not necessarily missed. That said, Team Ninja has listened to some of the criticism from the past year and first of all made Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge a more difficult title, one where you can't play casually without thinking carefully about what you're doing. This was achieved by ensuring that when you throw a ninpu the energy is only partially restored, thanks to the enemies that hurt more and a more massive presence of ninjas with rocket launchers, which however were one of the negative additions of the second episode, as they slam you into the ground all the time, interrupting Ryu's animations. However, it remains softer than the second chapter, except for some worse balanced points (just the balancing of the difficulty can be seen that it is the result of additions here and there), and in fact the life-saving logs or energy potions in the shop do not return. In this new version, however, the inventory checks out with more weapons that are unlocked throughout the story such as the Wolverine-like claws, the double katana or the mythical scythe, all of which can be upgraded by spending the karma that accumulates by eliminating enemies. With Karma you also buy new techniques, since not all combos are immediately unlocked, extra energy and, above all, more types of ninpu, which can also be upgraded. There is also the entrance of the beautiful Ayane with a couple of playable missions on her own and some scenes that will make the most sensitive sigh for love, seasoned with a gameplay that is completely different from Ryu's. The plot intertwines in its own way, the settings remain uninspired, but the whole thing is a pleasant, small diversion from the usual. A bit like the Sigma versions. The PlayStation 3 / Xbox 360 version Also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge has enjoyed a series of interesting improvements and corrections on a par with the release on Nintendo Wii U. The inclusion that will undoubtedly make historical fans of the saga happier are the hundred Ninja Trials, a real marathon of arenas in which to fight waves of increasingly difficult and challenging historical enemies. This is a mode that dramatically lengthens the longevity of the title. There is also no shortage of new weapons, such as the double sword, complete with an area shock wave. The so-called Lunar Staff, the lunar stick, a historic weapon for the franchise that takes us back to the first chapter on Xbox, can increase its destructive power thanks to an upgrade that actually makes it a sort of huge mace, with the plus to generate Ki faster, not forgetting that finally the Kusari-Gama scythe can be used to jump over enemies by attacking them from above. On the side of the special powers Ninpo of the protagonists Ryu thanks to the Pungent Void, creates sharp blades of void along his own arms, to slash easily each enemy, while Cicada Surge interrupts enemy attacks at the cost of Ki. The allies have also benefited from some additions: Ayane thanks to the Phantom Spear can strike effectively from a distance, Momiji attacks with her lethal sharp spear naginata, while Kasumi, playable once the title is completed, relies on Mugen Tenshin shots. Gamepad or Pro Controller? Combat is smoother and basic enemies don't need infinite series of hits to die and dismemberments are also reintroduced, violentissimi, which only make you smile a little when you find yourself held down by an enemy who no longer has the arm which, in theory, is squeezing our neck. They are venial sins, however, in the face of an evident effort to improve things, which however does not detract from the air of a saga that risks being lost along the way. Also because the gamepad doesn't help much, if not to navigate the menus without pausing, while to use the ninja sense, which shows us where to go in the stages, or to throw the ninpos, the touch buttons are soon abandoned in favor of the related classic digital keybindings. Among other things, given the increased difficulty and the amount of combinations to be made, the gamepad is not exactly very comfortable, due to the size and arrangement of the analog triggers that are used several times, making us recommend the Pro Controller which, if you have to buy it aside, it's a nice additional expense to the game. There's also the co-op mode, again as in Sigma, which, if a little confusing, is still an addition to last year's offering. The graphics have remained the same with the usual beautiful animations but uninspired settings and a general aspect that is now too dated compared to other titles that distance themselves too clearly, cared for as they are, but we are sure that Team Ninja, given the additions made with this chapter, be ready to start again from this point of view.", "date": "2013-04-02", "grade": "7.5"}
