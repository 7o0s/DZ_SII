{"name": "Warhammer 40.000: Squad Command - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-40000-squad-command-recensione.html", "text": "Seek honor with your deeds and you will know no fear! With the creation of this Squad Command, THQ is returning Warhammer 40,000 to its natural environment, i.e. a turn-based strategy where you do nothing but fight: in most cases, the aim of the missions involves the annihilation of all opponents, or at least it is a sufficient condition for the completion of the stage. The single game mode offers us a total of fifteen levels, whose narrative development is told through very high quality animated sequences. At the beginning of each stage we will be called to manage our team of six units with regard to the weapons supplied, which in the early stages are pre-established and then gradually enriched with new elements, giving us the possibility to choose which secondary weapon to equip as well as the number of shots available. This is not a choice free from consequences, far from it: just like in the board game, each of our soldiers has a certain number of action points that can be spent in a turn. This means that we can take a certain number of steps and carry out an attack, but also only one of two things. Furthermore, each weapon affects action points differently: depending on the weight and amount of ammunition, it can limit the character's movements. There are melee (swords, spears), projectile (rifles, machine guns), blast (rocket launchers, plasma cannons), and zone (flamethrowers) weapons. Burn the heretic. Kill the mutant. Purify the impure. In each round we can move team members (selecting them individually or not) within the stage and plan their actions: if there are no enemies in sight, we can spend all the action points for movement. Pressing the Select key gives access to a ~technical~ overview of the map, which includes the reporting of each hostile unit. Enemies only manifest themselves when they enter the field of view of one of our soldiers, and it is at that moment that we can manage the actions in such a way as to carry out an attack. Even the precision of each shot depends on the action points spent: wanting to fire twice with a rocket launcher, for example, we will necessarily have to come to terms with the aim, risking missing the target. Each weapon (apart from the melee ones) has a particularly precise viewfinder, which however frames the target only when there are no obstacles between us and him. However, in Squad Command barriers are a problem up to a certain point: every element of the setting is interactable and can be destroyed, so we can eliminate everything that prevents us from delivering a aimed shot if we have enough soldiers capable of doing fire. The same goes for the opposite: we can take cover behind walls, rocks and so on, bearing in mind that the enemy can destroy these barriers with a few well-aimed blows. Pain is an illusion of the senses. As the missions follow one another, we will be able to use very different and increasingly powerful units: we will start with the simple Ultramarines and then move on to the White Furies and the Salamanders. The human soldiers will also be joined by vehicles of different types, agile and fast or slow but unstoppable, including the terrifying Dreadnought. There will therefore be a great variety of situations which will contribute to making the burden of a limited structure less heavy (you just fight). In this sense, the multiplayer mode deserves a separate discussion: you can challenge each other with two PSPs, even if you own a single copy of the game, but above all you can play online and compete against opponents from all over the world, even organizing teams of four participants. You can create a GameSpy account in seconds, using only the PSP: from this point of view, things work much better than with Sony titles. Unfortunately, however, the quality of the connection is not always the best, and sometimes you have to deal with a little lag. The outcome of the games is certainly not affected, since it is a turn-based strategy game, rather the action in this way is a little too slow and the ~dead spots~ are always lurking, sometimes turning the games into something boring. The wise learn from the death of others. We have already mentioned the animated sequences, which truly boast an extraordinary quality. But the rest certainly doesn't disappoint: the character design is excellent and the soldiers are perfectly distinguishable despite their small size, the scenarios are always convincing and feature a huge number of interactable elements, which play a precise role in the game's economy. The weapons have a perfect visual rendering, and the aiming system has no defects whatsoever. If we want to findand a lack of the graphics sector, we can mention the sporadic uncertainties in the frame rate when events of a certain magnitude occur on the screen. Or the management of the view, which however is more a game design problem than a technical defect: the ~pointer~ moves using the d-pad and not the analog stick, and the latter is assigned to rotate the camera which however it is limited to a few degrees and therefore it is not very practical in some situations (framing an enemy behind a wall, for example). The sound is excellent both for the effects and for the music, with a great atmosphere. All the speech is translated into Italian, acted quite well. Finally, the control system is well organized and is intuitive already after the first game: the back buttons allow us to scroll through the units, while the Square, Triangle, Circle and X buttons are used to perform the various actions: move the characters, switch to attack mode, shoot, etc. Comment Overall, Warhammer 40,000: Squad Command certainly has flaws: marginal things, such as view management; or more relevant, such as the linearity of the action and an artificial intelligence that is not exactly at the highest levels. In reality, remaining within its genre and keeping in mind the adherence to the board game from which it is taken, this new THQ product is really good: technically valid, full of variety in terms of weapons, characters and vehicles . Long-lived enough to keep us busy for at least a week, and then try our hand at an online multiplayer of sure interest, which perhaps suffers from the intrinsic nature of the product (turn-based execution). If you know the Warhammer 40,000 universe and you love strategy games, here's a title to keep in mind. Pros: Great graphics and sound Lots of different soldiers, weapons and vehicles Online multiplayer Cons: Limited view management Artificial intelligence that can be improved Monothematic missions", "date": "2008-01-29", "grade": null}
