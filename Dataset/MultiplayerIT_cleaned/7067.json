The fact that behind the project there is one of the most recognizable teams in the panorama, however, is curiously not the main reason why DNF Duel deserves your attention. This spectacular game based on Neople's Dungeon Fighter Online - an MMO with the curious peculiarity of being a scrolling fighting game with multiple classes available - it is in fact a choral effort, not only in the company of those who manage its intellectual property, but also of a team of developers that we haven't heard of for a while: those Eightings who we owe the exaggerated (and much loved) Marvel vs Capcom 3. Considering the inspiration of the newly named team and the fact that on their pedigree there is one of the most appreciated (and undoubtedly discussed) fighting games ever in the competitive scene, we therefore expected an absolutely insane video game, conceivably even capable of breaking the barriers resulting from the relatively low popularity of the Dungeon Fighter brand in the West. We certainly weren't disappointed: the imprint of both teams at the helm is stronger than ever, just as their excesses are crystalline; so today we will try to explain to you in this handy review why DNF Duel must be kept an eye on by enthusiasts, even if it carries with it many risks. The Way of the Button DNF Duel: Certain classes have moves that hit three-quarters of the screen. No, that's not an exaggeration It doesn't make much sense to focus on narrative in this article, but we still think it's worth pointing out how from point of view DNF Duel content, if nothing else, tries to offer moderately well-finished singleplayer modes. Sure, it's the usual ~Arcade Mode/Survival~ duo, only this one is accompanied by a more structured story mode than the average - with chapters dedicated to each individual character, dubbed dialogues and quality artwork used for interludes - and by a truly complete tutorial, full of advice dedicated to each member of the roster and inevitable challenges on combos of increasing difficulty. Too bad that the story itself is forgettable to say the least: it is a simple excuse to make sense of the battles, and living it with this or that other character seems to make very little difference. You will complete it with only one of them to unlock the last selectable warrior, and then you will probably forget about the mode entirely to dedicate yourself to the rest. a genre where usually everything revolves around complex mechanics and systems. In fact, the most curious thing about DNF Duel lies in wanting to be a technical fighting game with enormous simplifications in execution. In fact, elaborate directional inputs are not needed here: the work of Arc System and Eighting uses a system that closely resembles what was seen in Granblue Fantasy Versus, characterized by the possibility of performing special moves with a pressure of a specific direction and a single key. In DNF Duel, however, using this expedient does not cause any malus (in Granblue it led to a slower recovery of the move), there are even two keys for the specials, and to take advantage of the more powerful and useful ones you will have to consume a dedicated energy bar which recharges quickly during battles. Add to this system two normal attacks that link together with incredible ease and super in turn executable with a touch, and you have one of the most intuitive fighting games ever to emerge from a Japanese team; a real boon for beginners or people with dexterity problems. DNF Duel: the commands will also be simplified, but if you believe that there are no complex combos you are wrong But if we are dealing with such an easy fighting game, where does the ~technical~ element we were talking about at the beginning of the paragraph reside? Well, the technicalities derive from a mix of factors: the first is the advanced mechanics, given that the game still contains them; the second is instead simply the management of the roster, whose diversification is such as to give shape to a gigantic range of possibilities in battle. Returning momentarily to the mechanics, we are mainly talking about the possibility of interrupting certain moves with a maneuver called Conversion, which not only guarantees an extension of certain combos, but also returns some of that ~mana~ necessary to use the more powerful specials. To this are added proprthe variable age of the moves (with shots that rebound the opponent against the wall, or can strike when he is lying on the ground) and the general need to manage resources in the best possible way to maximize one's effectiveness. In the defensive field, on the other hand, the Eightings have made available to the player a block button, a dodge with slight vulnerability at the end of the animation (still very useful), and a guard cancel which is essential for freeing oneself from the opponent's pressure in some cases (basically a counterattack that costs in turn slash). It's a good mix, which doesn't allow you to approach the game like monkeys even though anyone can perform a medium-level combo with their eyes closed. That said, this isn't exactly a title where perfect distance management boasts the importance seen in other titles... on the other hand it is difficult to focus on millimeters when the attacks of most of the roster have a range that covers more than half screen. Choose your fig... choose your god Yep, the roster. Let's talk about it, because it's when you scroll through the sixteen characters available in the game that things get really fun. As mentioned before, the Eightings in the field are mainly known for Marvel vs Capcom 3, a title where the balance was already set so high that it is no longer visible to the human eye (the name ~Dark Phoenix~ still brings up traumas between fans). Well, in DNF know that things are much, much worse: the fighters of this title are basically archetypes of everything that can be unbalanced in their ~style~, and each of them has at least a couple of moves or maneuvers capable of make anyone who has dabbled in fighting games for a while exclaim a curt ~he really can't do this~. Want some examples? Well, let's talk about the Troubleshooter, who can bounce a character across half the screen with grenades and mines and melt any life point bar with a little resources available; or the Swift Master, who not only moves at the speed of a flying cougar, but can reposition the enemy in the air during combos and has gigantic normals; or the Crusader, who can literally place instant projectile-like walls behind enemies, and has defensive tools that allow him to fight back almost anything in the game. It doesn't matter who you decide to fight: practically every single warrior in DNF Duel has characteristics that would be illegal in any other similar game and is capable of disintegrating your life bar with the necessary resources. The situation is such that the resource management the real ~comeback mechanic~ of the game (basically mechanics capable of overturning a match when you are low on life points): the mana bar grows with the loss of life, and taking partial damage guarantees the use of the aforementioned Conversion to cancel moves, therefore it is seriously plausible to dominate a match, only to then be massacred by an opponent with super available and top mana in a matter of seconds. Undoubtedly adrenaline, but certainly not bread for those who love slower and more thoughtful experiences. DNF Duel: No one expects the wheel of inquisition. But it always comes It must be said, as Marvel VS lovers we love this kind of philosophy, as well as the chaos and absurd situations it causes. The developers are also perfectly aware of what they are doing, because otherwise they would not have included combinations that take three-quarters of the life points for each individual character in the challenges (clearly showing their most hallucinatory mechanics every time). Yes, because so called DNF Duel seems like the freest and craziest fighting game in the universe, but you just need to play it with a little experience to realize that in reality everything is very calculated: the hitstun of the shots is very precise and varied based on the number of attacks; only certain shots bypass these ~protections~ to prevent too long combos, and in addition the presence of a block button that can be used instead of the common directional buttons guarantees protection from lateral mixups (the attacks that confuse by suddenly hitting from the opposite side), justifying the presence of numerous characters able to teleport or strike from behind. In practice, it is a more limited system than it seems, despite being calibrated towards the very top. Your guard will not save you DNF DUel: playing against a Ranger is an experience... problematic Actually the fact that this game lacks the subtleties of the latest King of Fighters or the flair accompanied by the myriad of options of a Guilty Gear Strive is not a problem considering the personality shown, however this does not mean that the system lacks from thepossible problems. In fact, we sincerely believe that balancing a roster of this kind is bordering on impossible and that this can cause serious imbalances at high levels, once the training mode is given to the real competitive sorcerers. In addition, mechanically there are two potentially abusable elements that didn't completely convince us: the use of the ~guardbreak~ and the temporary gray damage. In fact, parrying in this game only partially protects against damage: each hit combo blocked contributes to inflicting the so-called ~chip damage~, which is conveniently indicated by a gray bar superimposed on your normal life. The basic normals and specials do not eliminate the gray, but if it reaches zero your character still goes to the other world, and there are ~combo closing~ specials that can convert it into real damage. Nothing serious if explained in this way, a pity that in the game, considering the general madness of the characters, it is possible to put monstrous pressure on the corner, sometimes unstoppable if you don't have the resources to make a guard cancel. Continued attacks such as the Inquisitor's wheel, in certain unfortunate phases of a match, can therefore break your guard without you having a chance to counter if inserted into the right combos... a problem also present in the beta that does not seem to be in any way been adjusted in the version of the game we tested. Of course, we are talking about borderline situations, but finding one of this type so early does not bode well for the rest, and we suspect that much more abominable crap will emerge among the pros within a few weeks. DNF Duel: the animations of the super are, as usual, stratospheric There are no problems if only from an online point of view. Unfortunately we were able to fight little on the net (due to the game servers being activated very late compared to when we received the code), but the games played have always been stable and the beta represented an excellent example of the general performance. The netcode of the game is also rollback of excellent quality, plausibly due to the experience gained in this field by Arc System with Strive. It is a pity that the house has not listened to the fans regarding the lobbies, since in the ~player games~ once again we have the usual rooms with three-dimensional and arcade avatars where one can position oneself to play, which, although aesthetically pleasing, represent little more than a poorly intuitive applied to a normal lobby. The matchmaking of ranked games is also quite basic, but at least that immediately gives you the possibility of looking for a game while you train in the various single-player modes at will, and it seems to us an excellent choice. Finally, as regards the technical sector, there is absolutely no protest at Arc System's mastery of creating titles that look like moving souls despite the three-dimensional graphics. We DNF Duel played it on PC and it seemed extremely stable as well as aesthetically splendid. Animations, general detail, and spectacularity are always at exceptional levels, and it's really no surprise that Arc is commissioned fighting games of this type by houses like Neople. They are really on top of the world when it comes to graphics in the field. The real doubt at this point is only one: considering its excesses, and the not exactly powerful brand in our area, DNF Duel will be able to overcome the price barrier entry and to gain a substantial and lasting community? Hard to say, especially in a competitive ecosystem like that of fighting games. Yet, despite the big doubts about the balance of the title, the extreme accessibility of the basic mechanics could open the door to many enthusiasts kept away from the execution barriers typical of much of the genre until now. Of course, they will find a great video game waiting for them with a crazy roster, capable of entertaining like few others.", "date": "2022-06-28", "grade": "8.2"}
