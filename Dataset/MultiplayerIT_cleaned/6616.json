For a couple of years the activity has been expanded to include mobile platforms as well, with titles characterized in most cases by pixel art graphics and very immediate and accessible gameplay. In a remarkable production momentum, just a few weeks after the publication of the excellent Platform Panic and the pretty Roller Polar, the team has now also released Gunbrick on iOS and Android, the evolution of a concept already published in flash in 2012. Gunbrick is an extremely good puzzle game that confirms the qualities of Nitrome However, Gunbrick is a product of a different thickness compared to the most recent releases of Nitrome, and this can already be understood starting from the price of  2.99 ( 2.50 on Android) which places it directly in the ~premium~ range of mobile titles . It is basically a puzzle game with platform elements that is based on a surreal and rather original premise: in a future where cars have become obsolete, there is instead the Gunbrick, a rolling cube equipped on one side with a shield and on the other with a small cannon. For reasons that are not particularly clear, the protagonist of the game, after ordering one of these innovative means of transport via the internet, finds himself using it in 2D levels populated by dangerous traps and many different enemies. We were talking about the predominant puzzle element, and in fact Gunbrick requires a certain amount of gray matter to be tackled. In practice, crawling on the screen in one direction or another generates the rolling of the cube, which allows you to cross the settings; but this is only the most basic command, to which others are added which help to strengthen the gameplay. In this sense, the management of the weapon is fundamental, which is in fact placed only on one of the sides: shooting to hit an enemy or (more frequently) a switch, an action that takes place through a simple touch of the screen, therefore requires having positioned the cube on the ~right~ side, precisely aligned with the target. When, on the other hand, the cannon points downwards, the shot provides a real propulsive thrust, thus allowing you to reach elevated platforms, obviating the vehicle's inability to jump. But if the weapon is directed to the left or right, the shot also generates a recoil effect, which moves the Gunbrick by an entire ~box~ in the opposite direction. This is a key element, because the vast majority of the puzzles of the Gunbrick title are based precisely on the concept of rolling the cube with the correct side towards the elements to interact with, or with the shield positioned on what would otherwise cause its explosion. A strategic key that requires a certain degree of reflection in the face of each one's movement, because the puzzles are designed and created precisely to make the most of this interpretation key. In this sense, the level design set up by Nitrome is really of great depth: the different elements that make up the puzzles are presented and introduced in a progressive way, thus allowing the player to adapt to the growth of the difficulty curve without particular traumas. Furthermore, it is precisely the challenge rate that is balanced and satisfying, guaranteeing a progression that is never too simple or too complicated (even if there are some slightly frustrating peaks). Everything is then even more pleasant in front of the delightful two-dimensional pixel art graphic component, truly remarkable for its variety and level of detail and with a remarkable characterization: Gunbrick thus becomes not only a very pleasant title to play, but also to look at. In a decidedly positive picture, however, some defects must also be reported, starting with the absence of any secondary element capable of stimulating replayability: the levels must in fact simply be overcome without any type of evaluation or counting of deaths or similar factors. A lack that reduces any ~additional~ stimulus, and which appears even heavier in the face of the reduced longevity of the product: there are only 36 levels present, which can be completed in a couple of hours. Once you get to the end, there is no further reason to keep Gunbrick on your device, if not the hope of future updates that can somehow extend the overall life of the product.", "date": "2015-01-20", "grade": "8.0"}
