{"name": "Pharaoh: A New Era", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pharaoh-a-new-era-recensione.html", "text": "This is a strange era, in which remakes often make more noise than completely new games, it is not clear whether due to a certain dissatisfaction with the present or due to the fact that in this way ways of playing can be recovered which otherwise the great industry would ignore. The review of Pharaoh: A New Era can only start from the observation that sometimes looking to the past is really the only way to understand where we have come. From 1999 to today Ancient Egypt is always fascinating After all, thinking about it, the fact that a 1999 game is still considered one of the tops of an entire genre should make everyone think, even those who don't play the genre in question. We too remembered Pharaoh with great affection and we don't hide from you that the news of the remake initially excited us, but as inveterate skeptics we still tried to understand immediately if these memories derived more from a prejudice given by nostalgia than from the real qualities of the game. As we expected, playing Pharaoh: A New Era we found ourselves doing things that mainstream city builders / management often no longer ask you to do, with dynamics that you almost avoid simulating so as not to make life too difficult for the casual player , with relationships between the buildings to be constructed and the economic and social systems that are almost ignored, always for the same reason. Not that valuable city builders have not come out since the days of Pharaoh, sometimes even more complex than the title of Impressions, but there is no doubt that they have often been marginalized in favor of other genres, despite the fact that they enjoy many admirers, especially on PC. Gameplay Pharaoh: A New Era has remained very similar to the original, even in appearance At first glance Pharaoh: A New Era appeared to us to be a very faithful remake of the original. The impression was confirmed over time. Of course, the graphics have a higher resolution and are more defined. Furthermore, there have been some changes which we will discuss in the course of the article, but in principle the game is the same, net of the innovations introduced at the time which today have been acquired by many other city builders, such as for example the construction system of houses, in which building areas are simply indicated on the map, then leaving the burden of building on them to the virtual settlers. In fact we are talking about the central nucleus of the entire gaming experience, given that other systems develop around it that serve to direct urbanization, making some areas more or less attractive. All of this has the objective of growing the population, so as to achieve the main objectives of each of the approximately fifty missions available, which also include those of the Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile expansion. Usually to win you need to reach a certain quota of the population, have certain buildings or be able to build impressive monuments such as the pyramids, which require large investments and a huge workforce. In any case, the starting point are the basic economic activities, such as agriculture (regulated by the floods of the Nile and by the whims of Osiris, to whom it is advisable to dedicate holidays to obtain its blessings), clay mines, handicrafts and whatnot. In the meantime we must remember to take care of the health of the population, with doctors and pharmacies, manage their safety, erecting police stations, and make sure that all the inhabitants are fit and happy to stay in our cities, building recreational activities, squares to meet , improving the quality of the roads and filling them with monuments, all without forgetting that each map has its own specific characteristics, which require careful planning if you don't want to find yourself unable to grow the city as much as necessary. Some information is not very clear Basically the management part has remained almost identical to that of the original, with the level of challenge that has not been retouched downwards as many feared. So right from the first maps, problems in keeping the population will begin to emerge, then the natural economic hardships will come that will force you to make choices, perhaps favoring a slower and more reasoned growth, where trying to accelerate it would prove lethal for finances . In any case, don't worry, because the first missions give you all the information you need to play better and gradually introduce you to the many game systems, also explaining some of the more advanced mechanics. After the tutorial missions, new elements are added mission after mission, so as to always keep the interest high, the same oneswhich are removed in some advanced maps to increase the challenge. We will manage to make our kingdom prosper in Pharaoh: A New Era Like the original, therefore, one of the best elements of the game remains its dual nature, namely the ability to combine city builder mechanics with puzzles that emerge from the very structuring of the maps and which keep the interest high for the whole countryside. So you never have all the tools available, but you must be able to take advantage of those left active to figure out how to win. Never as in this case are the restrictions imposed to make the game. For example, it may happen that instead of directly producing food, you have to create something else to use as a bargaining chip on the market for supplies, or you may be called upon to do something similar to collect the material needed to build the most big. The news of the remake The high resolution graphics look good Pharaoh: A New Era is a very light game. The remake has been thought out intelligently, effectively leaving the graphic style unchanged, but redesigning every element to adapt it to the higher resolutions achievable by modern systems, while keeping the original design intact. So it is possible to play in 4K with very clean graphics, although not quite a PC squeeze, since we are always talking about 2D anyway. The same has been done with the animations, which remain simple but effective. Having said that, it is surprising how you don't seem to be playing a title conceptually dating back more than twenty years ago, a sign not only that the original was excellent, but also that less steps forward have been made since then than they would have been could have done. In all of this, expect a very demanding and long-lived title, given that, when it meshes, the missions become tour de force for more than two hours. So you can safely bypass the hundred hours of play only with the main campaign, also by virtue of the fact that not all missions can be successfully completed on the first attempt. Pharaoh: A New Era is a challenging title Also considering that scenarios can be played and that there is a sandbox mode, let's say that enthusiasts will have bread for their teeth for a long time. Unfortunately the remake is so faithful that there are also some defects left, such as a certain lack of useful information to achieve certain objectives, which remain quite obscure (nothing insurmountable, however). It must also be said that the developers have not done much to try to surpass the original, detaching as little as possible. It's probably good for those looking for nothing else and for new players, but for those who know Pharaoh inside out, something more could have been done. Also noteworthy is the presence of bugs which in some cases could block progression. We haven't had any big ones (just some broken animation), but we've searched and found that they are quite frequent. Nothing that can't be fixed with a few patches.", "date": "2023-02-23", "grade": "8.0"}
