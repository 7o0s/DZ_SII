Despite this hustle and bustle, the big N hasn't forgotten his portable console and, just in these days, Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World has arrived to continue the happy series of conversions from Wii U, as happened previously with Hyrule Warriors Legends and, most recently, with Super Mario Maker. The result of this transposition immediately gave us the feeling of having the connotations to be the one that succeeded better than this trio. Before explaining why, we need to say a few words for those who missed the original on Wii U: Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World is a 2D platformer in which we have to help Mario's old friend, in a woolly version, to save all the his friends Yoshi who, at the beginning of the game, are kidnapped and divided into balls of yarn by the evil, or rather, mischievous Kamek. To do this, you have to explore many colorful levels that seem to have come out of the hands of the best knitters and, each of them, is full of secrets to discover; therefore, it's a game type that favors exploration rather than a frantic race for the finish line. The presence of Poochy already in the name of the game immediately catches the eye since, in this Nintendo 3DS version, Yoshi's dog friend has a much more active role compared to that of the Wii U version in which she was present as an aid as an alternative to the various bonus pins (also present in this version) or in some mandatory levels: a section is dedicated to her with some mini-games which we will talk about later but which, in essence, serve to accumulate the beads useful for Yoshi to buy the pins in the his adventure. For the release of the game on Nintendo 3DS, the Poochy amiibo was also produced by Nintendo which, in addition to unlocking a time trial for the dog, can be used at any time and have the same helper function it had on Wii u. Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World is a very successful conversion with lots of new game modes Make your own Yoshis! Before talking about the many innovations that Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World introduces, let us state that the highly entertaining local multiplayer of the Wii U version is absent and it is possible to interact with other Nintendo 3DS owners via StreetPass only to exchange the various personalized creations of the Yoshis and that the gameplay of the game has remained substantially unchanged, as well as Yoshi's abilities, who can create balls of wool by gobbling up enemies, jump and simulate a propeller by keeping himself in the air for a small amount of time if you hold down the jump, perform a powerful dunk from above and shoot the accumulated balls with a handy viewfinder that indicates the trajectory of the launch. The items to collect in all the levels that make up each of the six worlds of Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World are also the same: 5 balls of yarn that will rebuild a new Yoshi (the one brought to safety), 5 flowers that if taken in all levels they will give access to a special level and, finally, the beads as a currency useful for buying the various bonus pins and hearts needed to complete a level 100%. The rich baggage of novelties of this conversion for Nintendo 3DS begins with the level selection interface which is no longer the square that was on Wii U but is made up of a series of tents which can all be recalled from the touch screen and in front of the which moves the sweet dinosaur in the top screen. Two tents are dedicated to Yoshi's skins and, while the skins obtained through amiibo are grouped in the first, all those from completed levels are gradually added to the second. Within this last tent we have access to another interesting novelty, the editor for creating custom skins for Yoshi: it is an interface, available in amateur mode and in professional mode, with which you can color each part of the little dinosaur individually using, in a very intuitive way, the stylus on the touch screen being able to also see the preview on the screen above. In addition to the free coloring of Yoshi, as you complete the game levels, you can get some special patches (other ~skins~, essentially) that can only be used in the amateur creation mode. In the memory tent, in addition to being able to access all the music and see all the enemies of the game as in the old version, we also find something new: the daily movies, smallClips lasting a few seconds featuring Yoshi and Poochy but which are really colorful and fun and at the end of which you are asked a question about the movie itself which gives you as a reward, answering correctly, additional beads. These movies are perhaps a trivial gem (for which your children will go crazy) but they definitely raise the evaluation of this excellent conversion. Super Poochy runs In the tent-kennel dedicated to Poochy it is possible to access the already mentioned mini-games all attributable to a type of gameplay similar to Super Mario Run: the dog runs automatically and can jump, duck and bounce over the enemies' heads. In the mini-game ~Poochy at breakneck speed~ there are three main objectives: in each of the six courses present, ranging from collecting a certain number of beads to other specific objectives depending on the situation; moreover, in each level, the woolly quadruped can burst all the balloons and recover her three puppies scattered around the map. These soft wool puppies will accompany Yoshi, taking the place of balls, in case you decide to face the main game mode in a relaxed level: they will also show you every secret present in the various levels and will help you with the enemies. In relaxation mode, Yoshi also wears a pair of very comfortable wings that replace the helix jump and allow him to float infinitely. Poochy can occasionally enter the ~gold rush~ which becomes available if Yoshi completes a level with the laughing flower in hand (obtainable if at the finish line you manage to catch the petal of the flower you are passing through): in this race the the dog must always run within a level equal to that of the previous mode but in front of her there is a Lakitu who leaves a series of golden beads and the goal is to get as many as possible. The last minigame becomes available, as already mentioned, if we use the Poochy amiibo sold separately or bundled with the game: as was already the case for the Wii U version, support for Nintendo figurines is complete, however, on Nintendo 3DS you can place one on the touch screen at any time to take advantage of its skin without having to go through the marquee and, if you use a Yoshi amiibo, another one will appear that will imitate your actions. A final marquee with all bosses that can be tackled separately becomes available after beating the game. The 3D effect As anticipated, the 3D effect is rendered very well: it creates a certain depth especially in situations where there is a zoom on Yoshi and it is never annoying for the eyes. It also doesn't affect the frame rate in the slightest. As usual you can do without it, but it's an addition that makes some levels truly spectacular. A rainbow of colored wool in 3d The explosion of colorful fabrics from Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World has been carefully converted and making the most of the potential of the Nintendo 3DS, the frame rate seems even higher than the original and has no slowdown or loss of quality, even in 3D . Although the textures are much simpler and some very nice effects, such as the surfaces that sink under Yoshi's feet, have been removed on the Nintendo handheld compared to Wii U, the feeling of being in a world made of wool remains. The zooms on Yoshi from the original version have also been maintained, with perfect use of the camera, which made the whole environment around him enormous; indeed, this feature almost seems to have been designed for the small screen of the portable console. The musical motifs of the Wii U version are all there and some are new and specially written for the part of the game dedicated to Poochy, therefore, they have a quite frenetic rhythm being a kind of ~racer~. As a last gem we can only be happy with the interface full of shortcuts, constantly present on the touch screen and which you can use to scan an amiibo, choose a level to play, select a pin or as a simple summary of the objects found in the stage you are playing .", "date": "2017-02-01", "grade": "9.0"}
