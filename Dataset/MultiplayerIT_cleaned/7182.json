The Italian development team, one of the most experienced in the genre of driving games, has in fact ventured into the various WRCs and even the official motocross championship, a partnership that is back in vogue precisely with the release of MXGP for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This time, however, the product is more about realism than a distinctly arcade approach; and so, in addition to the riders and the real events of the MX 1 and MX 2 classes (the latter updated to the 2013 edition, however, and with some defection), here is the offer in terms of modalities that focuses on the classic: ~Instant Race ~ to face a race with random values, ~Grand Prix~ to try a single course event, ~Championship~ to experience the competition in its entirety, ~Career~ to start from the bottom and gradually gain popularity and more advantageous contracts, ~ Time Challenge~ to improve one's performance on the single circuit and finally ~Multiplayer~, an online multiplayer mode with the addition of bots to limit any defections and therefore deliver more demanding and engaging races. Despite a couple of interesting ideas, the MXGP offer does not stand out from the competition Green light It takes just a few minutes to enter the mechanisms that regulate the MXGP riding model, and which are substantially modified by the style that we select from ~basic~, ~medium~ and ~pro~, as well as by the management of the brakes, the rider's weight and of the change. It goes without saying that using the ~basic~ style we will encounter a very permissive and shallow experience, whereas by opting for the ~pro~ style we will be able to fully appreciate the innovations introduced by Milestone, in particular those concerning the physics of pilot. Instead of relegating complete control of the bike and whoever rides it to the left analog stick, in fact, the game tries to distinguish the two things by assigning their management to the left and right stick respectively. This translates, for example, into a certain way of performing the traditional ~scrub~ maneuver, i.e. the aerial inclination of the motorcycle to minimize the time in flight and gain precious tenths; but also in the skilful balance of weight on the front or rear depending on the situation, favoring a rocket take-off or a slap-up landing after a jump. Gameplay elements that go perfectly with a ~strategic~ vision of the tracks, the progress of which must be memorized to understand when to brake and when to go full throttle, when to anticipate the curves and when instead there is a way to cut them, but also and above all how to deal with the unevenness and the inevitable ramps. At first you often end up off the track, which is rather frustrating, but with a little practice it is possible to avoid these drawbacks and appreciate the goodness and delicacy of the approach to motocross. Red light Unfortunately the positive aspects of MXGP collide quite clearly with a series of problems that should not be underestimated. Firstly, the flattening of the offer compared to the previous MUD: FIM Motocross World Championship, which thanks to the arcade interpretation and the World Tour mode was able to offer alternative entertainment to what now stands as the traditional Milestone menu for licensed racers, and who got a little tired. Secondly, if on the one hand a ~soft~ line was maintained as regards collisions between the pilots, reduced to a minimum also to avoid situations of excessive frustration during the frequent crowds, on the other there was an excessive simplification of the dynamics that regulate handling with respect to the ground and any ruts created by the bikes that have previously traveled the track. Put simply, it doesn't really feel like running on mud. To this we must add a technical sector that not even on PC manages to convince, despite the high resolution and the presence of theoretically advanced effects. The polygonal models of motorbikes and riders are well done, but the same cannot be said of the other figures that gravitate around them (with decidedly ~old gen~ sequences, see when the engineers approach), while a certain desolation of the landscapes as regards the circuits. The choice of bright colors brings with it a certain cheerfulness, but the very evident pop-up effect of the ground textures is very annoying. Nothing to say, however, for the sound, between rock guitars and effects capable of faithfully reproducing the ~rumbles~ of the factory bikes.", "date": "2014-04-18", "grade": "6.5"}
