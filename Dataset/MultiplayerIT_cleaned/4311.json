Wargaming.net's tanks have proven to be extremely resilient, and over time have built up their own extremely loyal user base. A user who is perfectly at ease in the curious (and winning) mix of MMO, action, strategy... and cannonade of heavy vehicles. We'll tell you more: It took a while for that to happen, but today World of Tanks is a much different game than you might remember. Version 1.0 marks the transition to a new era, characterized above all by a significant graphic and sound update, but also by other important gameplay details (the improvement of the Workshop in primis). Let's go back to discovering the (free) work of the Belarusian team, thinking of both veterans and newcomers. More beautiful than ever World of Tanks has had a makeover, and it's the first detail that catches your eye when you start a new game. Over time, probably also thanks to the revenue from microtransactions, the development team managed to switch to a new, extremely high-performance graphics engine. The difference compared to the first beta is abysmal: where seven years ago the aesthetics of the title was one of the first questionable aspects of the production, we are faced with a renewal capable of squeezing our PC and also adapting to all the other situations. The available settings are so many and so detailed that Wargaming.net has even published on its website a guide to graphic settings called ~performance first aid~, in which it takes the player by the hand and shows him the recommended settings based on his system. Every single element of the game has been graphically revised to enhance the overall glance, with obsessive attention especially for details such as water, terrain, light sources and shadows. World of Tanks, among other things, remains a project in progress: it is difficult to imagine it, but the developers will still continue to work on the natural environments of the title, and have other adjustments in the pipeline. Among the most important, the collision between the tanks and the ground, improvements to the vegetation and the waves of the streams, and the increase of the objects in the scenarios, perhaps one of the few flaws that we have noticed so far. Finesse aside, the entire World of Tanks was completely overhauled in the 1.0 beta. This means that the thirty battlefields present have been updated to take full advantage of the potential of the new graphics engine. One at a time, design improvements have been introduced in every single place: those who have already had the opportunity to try the title probably won't recognize it immediately when returning to shoot cannons at Ruinberg, Fisherman's Bay or the Fjords. New maps are also coming, the Glacier for example is already available, and more will be added in the coming months. The same quality has been sought in the sound sector, which has also been completely revisited. War is a serious matter, and the Belarusian team was not satisfied with anonymous background accompaniments, even bothering the Prague Symphony Orchestra to create the soundtrack from scratch. The difference can be seen, indeed in this case it is felt: the title has never really suffered from an annoying audio sector, but it was certainly not memorable. It is probable that an even better compromise between the violent sounds of war and the delicacy of symphonies could be found in the future, but at the moment there is really no reason to complain. Even deeper Putting aside the online component of the title, stabilized and improved with constant support, the heart of World of Tanks is the same as it was then. What managed to be appreciated by the public right away, by virtue of an obsessive attention to every single detail of the protagonists: the tanks. If you like shooting with a tank and war scenarios fascinate you, the production of Wargaming.net is the right one for you. Let's also add that it is designed for online cooperative, in which teams of two players compete for portions of territory, bases and crawlers. The strategy is therefore a fundamental component of the title, and if at the beginning everything seems quite simple, after the first few hours the game begins to show all its depth. The control system is extremely intuitive: the usual combination of keys used for movement (WASD) is accompanied by mouse support for aiming and shooting. The scroll wheel of the device allows you to enter sniper mode, with a close-up view of your opponents. It turns out to be fundamental, because only by bringing the perspective closer can we aim for the weak pointsof hostile wagons. By shooting at random we will only risk wasting precious time, while the enemy armor will simply not be pierced by our shots and will leave the antagonists unharmed. At the end of each of the many game modes proposed, among which we mention Assault, Domination and special missions, World of Tanks will reward us with an increasing series of credits and experience points. The former are used to buy new vehicles and equipment, the latter to research modules with which to enhance your tank: the two aspects are linked and always proceed together. There are even special internal achievements that can be unlocked by completing certain actions. For example, during the tutorial it is possible to obtain ~boot camp sniper~ for hitting an enemy vehicle with at least eight shots during the battle. Speaking of tutorials, it is highly recommended to complete it in its entirety before jumping into the online component, because it allows you to deepen each of the aspects that make the developers' production so rich. Among other things, the tutorial teaches players how to hide their tank in vegetation, how to get around too large groups of enemies, and many other details that enrich the strategy of an incredibly complex game to master. On the occasion of the launch of version 1.0 the Workshop was completely revised. It is basically your own base of operations, where our vehicle sits nice and quiet at rest on a grassy clearing, allowing us not only to admire it, but also to dedicate ourselves to its enhancement. We can browse the catalog to buy new tanks, improve every single aspect of the one we have (from the cannon to the efficiency of the tracks), or modify the operators of the team. That is, in essence, the soldiers who from time to time will pass to pilot it. Each of them has more or less useful skills and specifications, and suitable for different styles of play. You will probably spend several hours sifting through the various possibilities offered by the game menu: there are so many vehicles available, the new equippable items all have different stats, and it will take a lot of time (and credits) before you can buy them everyone. But imagine the satisfaction of leading a sweaty behemoth from start to finish, made devastating on the battlefield thanks to our efforts: the learning curve of World of Tanks is very steep, but if properly mastered it rewards the player. Consider well whether it is worth spending real money: if you have the time to play for hours and hours on the battlefield, you will probably still unlock most of what interests you on your own.", "date": "2018-04-10", "grade": "8.5"}
