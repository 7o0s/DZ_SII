{"name": "Broforce", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/158280-broforce-brofist.html", "text": "Search the dictionary for the word ~action~ and you will find the Broforce logo, but be careful, because the page will probably catch fire between your fingers, the dictionary will explode into small pieces of paper and your neighbor from upstairs will break through the ceiling and he will swoop into your living room wearing an explosive belt. Playing Broforce is like entering a storage facility of highly flammable liquids with a lit flamethrower. You know for sure that everything will blow up, you just don't know how. At first glance you might think you're in familiar Metal Slug territory, but only because Broforce borrows many elements from side-scrolling action games. In fact, there are hostages to free, flags to raise (all strictly stars and stripes), explosive barrels and ammunition boxes. What has never been seen before though are the fully destructible levels. Every block of pixels can be erased from the screen, and this overturns all the rules and destroys any strategy. Improvisation must become your mantra, reflexes your resource. Also because the developers built each level like a mined house of cards. If we rocket off a gas cylinder, it can hit an enemy kamikaze, who runs and ends up detonating himself right next to a barrel which in turn brings down a bridge from which two enemies fall that we didn't even know were there. Or it happens that while we are digging a tunnel we save a hostage, our character changes and instead of a machine gun we find a rocket launcher in our hands, the excavation operation gets out of hand and a chain reaction is triggered which makes a rock fall on our head. Hell, even the biggest armored enemies sometimes end up falling on their own from stomping on the ground! But the really surprising thing, the aspect that made us bow our heads out of respect, is that all this unpredictable chaos is almost always tameable thanks to one's skills. Just be quick, attentive and ready to change strategy in flight (literally) to finish the main campaign with a smile on your face. At the end of the game, the Hell zones are unlocked, for which we advise you to recruit some flesh and blood Bro. With a co-op mode that allows up to four players on screen, there's room for your entire group of friends. Broforce makes us feel like certain action movie heroes who emerge unscathed from a nuclear explosion It's me coming to get you Broforce is a parody of the muscular action films of the 80s and 90s, so it is understandable that there is a blaze of flame and devastation in its levels. Before sowing death in a game area, however, we must reach our destination by flying over the world map aboard a small helicopter (with which, among other things, we can mow down harmless seagulls). Our enemy is a generic terror-monger who must be forcibly Americanized. Only after the first half of the game is added an alien threat (whose species seems to come straight from the Alien films). Monsters or fanatics that they are, for the champions of democracy it doesn't change a damn thing. The goal is always to clear the level, kill a man in a suit and tie with devil horns and escape hanging from the ladder of a providential helicopter, leaving behind a world in flames and a patriotic US flag flying high in the air. sky. What makes this comic narrative truly special, however, are the heroes called upon to stop the threat. Each team member is an adaptation of a famous movie hero. There are dozens of them, and they are all fantastic. Rambo, Commando, Judge Dredd, Machete, Ripley, Robocop - name one and most likely you will find it in the game. If you remember, we mentioned that by freeing a hostage the character changes, and that's exactly how it works. You start each level with a random hero among those unlocked and only one life available. For each hostage saved we add a life to our reserve and at the same time we change our hero, always chosen at random from those available. The beauty is that each hero has a specific weapon that requires a different approach to the levels. Blade for example uses the katana, Indiana Jones stuns enemies with the whip (note that his special weapon is the legendary revolver with which he kills the swordsman in one of his films) while the Terminator uses a heavy machine gun with a crazy recoil . In short, you will have understood what the point is: the randomness with which we pass from one hero to another contriIt helps keep Broforce always varied and unpredictable. Above all, it forces us to continually review our style of play. Some heroes have similar weapons, but in general they are different enough to make each playthrough unique. Furthermore, the heroes are very balanced with each other, so it is rare to find yourself in difficulty because we have encountered a less effective character in a given situation. However, Broforce's offer does not end there. In addition to the main campaign there is the aforementioned co-op, local and online modes (multiply the chaos factor for each additional player), a versus mode, the terrifying Hell and Ironbro modes and an editor to create custom levels. To be picky, one could say that a few more settings would not have hurt and that the types of enemies are not many, although this lack is compensated for by the fair amount of bosses. But a game update is very likely to fill even these small gaps. Now that the Bros are on the loose, nothing can stop their advance.", "date": "2015-11-01", "grade": "9.0"}
