However, this has not affected the ambition of Miniclip, which with Mini Football aims to further streamline the structure inaugurated by FUT, putting on the plate a much more arcade gaming experience and a rose water managerial component, obviously without missing out the usual load of microtransactions, advertising and pay-to-win dynamics that modern free-to-play games have by now accustomed us to presenting. Mini Football starts from the exact same assumptions of FUT: at the command of a low league team made up of illustrious strangers, you have to try to win games to accumulate wealth and resource packages and thus improve your team to compete with increasingly stronger opponents who guarantee even richer rewards in case of victory. The classic cycle that is potentially infinitely repeated which is the lifeblood of free to play, and which is here declined without major variations on the theme: there is the dual currency system, the advertisements that appear from time to time and which they can be watched to speed up some operations and of course a shop where you can buy game materials with real money. Also absolutely average are the notorious paywalls which after a few hours appear as a divider between users who do not pay anything and those who stimulate the growth of their team through in-app purchases, with the former who will soon end up clashing against unbeatable opponents . Put like this, Mini Football might seem like a mediocre product in all respects, and instead it has undoubted merits that reside in particular in the execution of its gameplay. To begin with, the management part is clear and essential in the interface but without renouncing a certain amount of depth in the contents: it is in fact possible to modify not only the aesthetic aspects (shirts, shorts, socks, boots and so on) but act directly on the type of training desired and on the interpreters in the field, who can be leveled up with a few simple taps. Even once down on the green turf Mini Football asserts itself, while adopting an arcade approach that has very little to do with real sport, among super deformed players, plenty of slides, very rapid shots and passes and referees who almost never stop the action. The matches are rhythmic and fun, also thanks to an effective control system consisting of a virtual stick on the left side and three buttons on the right side assigned to the main functions that change depending on whether or not you are in possession of the ball. There are naiveties (goalkeepers are really scarce and it's all too easy to score from a corner or a free kick), but Mini Football still brings home the result in relative fluency. It's just a pity that the fun risks being short-lived, and not only due to the bottlenecks we have highlighted above, but also and above all due to the evident use of bots passed off as real players who really flatten the experience. To complete the picture, we point out a pleasant technical sector and little more, with colorful graphics but rather stingy with details and a sound that is limited to the homework.", "date": "2020-10-02", "grade": "7.5"}
