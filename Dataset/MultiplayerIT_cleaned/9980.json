These are extremely skilled warriors who practice ninjutsu, a martial art that mixes combat techniques and military strategy. The ninjas move in the dark, in silence, and their only goal is to complete the mission that has been assigned to them. To do this, they can use conventional weapons or decidedly atypical solutions, such as throwing knives and shurikens, without forgetting smoke bombs. What we didn't know until today, but which the developers of Halfbrick Studios were keen to make known, is that ninjas... they hate fruit. Viscerally. To the point that, when they see any fruit fluttering, they can't help but slice it with the sword. A story that doesn't stand? Of course, but by now the ~ultra arcade~ genre has got us used to everything, and ninjas who slice fruit on the fly don't make much of a stir. Mixed cold cuts Fruit Ninja is a simple videogame that for the usual, accessible sum of 79 cents offers us two different modes characterized by the same ~survival~ type structure, i.e. with a ~one-off game~ that can last a few seconds or hours, depending on the our skill and our luck. The ~native~ game mode sets us the goal of hitting as many fruits as possible to establish a record and possibly compare it with our friends or with players from all over the world through the interesting functions of the OpenFeint social network (more and more popular in iPhone and iPod Touch titles). We control the sword directly via the touch screen, drawing the blows in the way we like best: placing our fingers on the screen only at the right moment, with quick and precise gestures, or always maintaining contact to intercept the targets more easily. The various fruits appear from below and describe a random trajectory which, due to the force of gravity, quickly leads them to fall in the same direction. We have to be able to slice them, perhaps hitting more than one at a time, before they disappear from the screen. The game ends when we miss three targets or when we accidentally hit one of the bombs which at a certain point begin to be thrown into the air together with the fruit. The second game mode, introduced with the latest update, shuffles the cards a bit: there isn't a maximum number of mistakes we can make, but a time limit within which to slice as many fruits as possible. On a technical level, Fruit Ninja presents the usual fixed scenario on which the various types of fruit that we have the task of hitting alternate, represented by well-made polygonal models that react convincingly to the ~cuts~ and leave their shoulders a splash of juice that changes shape depending on the power and degree of inclination of the blow.
