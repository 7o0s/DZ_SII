Mega Man 11 should only be the first step of a revamp aimed at celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the franchise, actually born way back in 1987 on the NES, and for the occasion it was chosen to honor tradition, only partially modernizing form and substance. A controversial choice that will probably make the fans of the android who grew up with him in the 90s happy, but also a risk that Capcom has decided to face with a budget price. Tradition and innovation, we said: in the next few lines of our review you will find out if it is a strategy that has worked. The novelty of the Double Gear Compared to titles such as Mega Man 8 or the various Mega Man X, which were rich in cinematics, this Mega Man 11 lacks in the narrative component, limiting itself to telling us a story of few pretensions through dialogues and illustrations. Despite this, there are some interesting insights that longtime fans will appreciate: the game, for example, sheds new light on the conflicted relationship between Dr. Light and Dr. Wily, explaining when and how they separated their streets. It turns out that, in his college days, Wily had invented a device capable of enhancing robots and transforming them into extremely powerful control devices, but the board of directors had rejected the project and instead endorsed Dr. Light's. After so many years and defeats, Wily suddenly remembers having designed that device and decides to use it to enslave eight Robot Masters and sow chaos. Light, at this point, instructs Mega Man to save the world with the Double Gear that Wily had built many years before, starting this new adventure. The Double Gear is a new mechanic consisting of two separate functions, as the name suggests. By pressing one key, Mega Man can unleash more powerful shots than normal, while by pressing the other, time slows down and the Blue Bomber can dodge enemies more easily. Both power-ups share a gauge that recharges whenever the player deactivates them; however, if the player uses the Double Gear too long, overheating prevents it from being reactivated for any length of time, leaving Mega Man exposed at the worst of times. The Double Gear also serves a desperate function in that the player can press both buttons simultaneously with a dying Mega Man to fire a super-powerful blast. It is clear that Double Gear greatly influences the way you approach the various stages, giving a different flavor to what would otherwise seem like any Mega Man. The most interesting thing, however, is that we have come across very few passages that require you to use the Double Gear and which instead can be overcome even if only with great precision in the movements or with the help of Rush, the trusty robotic dog who this episode acts as a springboard from the beginning and, later, also as a propelled jet. The game designers of Mega Man 11 have devised some platform sequences in which the Double Gear becomes necessary to fit well a couple of difficult jumps or dodge the seemingly impossible blows of the enemies; in this way, one does not get the impression that the new mechanics distort the physiognomy of the series, firmly supported by the historical capabilities of Mega Man which translate into the slide and the three power levels of the loadable cannon. We are therefore back to the early days of the series - we cannot stoop, for example - but the Double Gear is not the only surprise that deviates Mega Man 11 from pure tradition. Eight bosses full of panache In truth, Mega Man 11's various stages don't stand out particularly in terms of originality, but each of them adopts a unique and characteristic style that makes the experience sufficiently varied. The Acid Man stage, with the underwater rooms and currents that push Mega Man in various directions, is a case in point, while we have some more ambivalent feelings about the Bounce Man stage and the balloons to bounce on to find the exit of the various rooms, trying not to end up against the evergreen barbed ceilings. In general, the various stages appeared to us quite diversified in terms of puzzles and obstacles, although the variety of enemies does not exactly make us cry out for a miracle: Mega Man 11 often recycles the sameopponents, limiting himself to changing the colors and sometimes the shapes, but not the behaviors. The story changes, however, with regard to bosses and mini-bosses. In each stage there is at least one rather characteristic intermediate boss, then the Robot Master who awaits us at the end in his personal room. We have to admit that in most cases the minibosses have given us a hard time more than the actual Robot Masters, but these are certainly among the most original that Capcom has created in the latest iterations, above all because they follow erratic patterns and unleash particular powers once a certain residual life threshold is reached: Block Man, for example, grows larger and fills the entire screen, while Tundra Man becomes very fast and much more difficult to anticipate. In these cases, the powers of the Double Gear come in handy, in short, and the Speed Gear in particular, but it is true that Mega Man can use the weapons of the various bosses against the other Robot Masters, inflicting greater damage as usual. The weapons - which change not only the color of the android, but also the appearance of his helmet and glove - are decidedly creative and lend themselves to various offensive and defensive strategies during the stages, and not just in boss fights. It must be said that Mega Man 11 is a decidedly demanding title, not to say that it is really difficult even at the lowest difficulty levels, which limit themselves to increasing the number of attempts or decreasing the damage that enemies can inflict. There are four difficulty levels - beginner, easy, normal and superhero - so it is possible to customize the game, even if only at the beginning, since you cannot change your mind once the adventure has begun. However, Capcom has also implemented Dr. Light's laboratory, where it is possible to exchange the bolts found in the various stages for a whole series of consumables and power-ups that the player can buy and then activate at will between one stage and the next. other. In this way it is possible to buy extra lives or regenerative tanks, for example, but also modules that intervene directly on the gameplay, such as the one that automatically loads Mega Man's cannon or the one that prevents slipping on icy surfaces. There are also modules that prevent the Mega Buster from recoiling or that prevent enemies from stunning Mega Man every time they hit it. In this sense, in short, Capcom has counterbalanced with a certain degree of customization and a generous distribution of checkpoints what is a surprisingly demanding level of difficulty, especially if you decide to use Double Gear as little as possible ... which we suspect will become the goal of increasingly popular speedrunners. In short, on the level design front, the Japanese developer has worked more than well, while we must admit that the technical sector has disappointed us a bit. The polygonal restyling of Mega Man and his friends, as well as the new Robot Masters, has hit the mark: the models are cared for and animated very well and in general one has the feeling of playing a completely two-dimensional title even if in reality it is almost everything polygonal. No, what made us turn up our noses was instead the soundtrack, truly forgettable and subdued by the standards of a series that has given famous tunes still today, and the very little care placed in the creation of the scenarios. The backdrops, especially indoors, are sparse and anonymous, barely animated and decidedly uninspired. It's a shame because everything else works: the game flows very smoothly both in portable mode and with the Switch housed in the Dock, without uncertainties, and the effects give a more modern and spectacular flavor especially to the boss fights. In short, Mega Man 11 is suspended in limbo between the past and the future: Capcom has religiously respected the tradition also in the structure, giving the first eight levels a sequel of four stages which constitute the usual fortress of Wily, and stretching the longevity with a series of challenges in the Extra section of the main menu which also includes a gallery, the inevitable leaderboard and even a kind of page dedicated to the businesses unlocked during the adventure.", "date": "2018-10-01", "grade": "8.0"}
