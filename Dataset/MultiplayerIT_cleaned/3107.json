{"name": "Fancade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fancade-la-recensione.html", "text": "A game of games, in the sense of collecting assorted mini-games, is often a cheap operation of copying something and duct-taping it together, but rarely can a title emerge that truly makes sense and has a specific identity like we see in this review of Fancade. Created by Martin Magni, an indie developer who has already made himself known with the release of Mekorama, Fancade is a strange game and by its nature very fragmentary, but also held together thanks to a truly marked style and a remarkable quality applied to the individual micros - gaming experiences, which make them something more than very short non-binding pastimes. Mind you, it is still a collection of gameplay ideas that we have already seen elsewhere, but if nothing else they have been well selected and packaged in a very captivating way, all of them working very well and even quite demanding, in some cases. However, the element that perhaps most characterizes the game and which could represent the special weapon to ensure its longevity is its complex editor. It is obviously a matter of seeing the grip it can have on the public, but already from the first days of presence on the stores, the activity of users in terms of content creation seems really promising. In fact, Fancade allows you to build game levels starting from the minimum pieces made available, through a system that is actually not very simple but translates into ample creative freedom for those with the right inclination. It is to all intents and purposes a game maker that allows you to create game experiences that deviate even strongly from the path imposed by the presets present in the main mode and just see what is already available among the best levels created by users to get an idea of the possibility. We even find schemes that reproduce a sort of Minecraft in miniature or other different experiences, all obviously set on the prearranged choices (exploration in 3D environments, racing games, platforms or other basic structures of this type) but which can also lead to considerable digressions. The system is not very easy to use, so to find out more, we refer you to a complete tutorial on YouTube that explains how to create content or to the video shown in the next paragraph. The game of games The main mode of Fancade is called ~Quest~, but don't expect a development in any way linked to a form of narration: it is basically a sequence of worlds to unlock, each containing various challenges divided into levels. Each challenge is essentially a mini-game, which must be tackled in more or less long sequences with progressive difficulty, with each level represented by a floppy disk that is inserted into a sort of console. These are games characterized by immediate gameplay, but not to be taken lightly, given that some levels can represent considerable challenges. Among the forms that the game takes within the various worlds we find ideas already seen elsewhere, this being a sort of anthological collection of various gameplay solutions already tested, complete with quite evident quotations. There's a sort of labyrinthine adventure that recalls Monument Valley and Fez (or Mekorama himself), a jumping and physics-based racing game that recalls Trials, a 2D platformer, a puzzle that presents a kind of variant of Snake and a game based on dropping objects in a hole like in Hole.io and Donut County, just to name a few. The various micro-structures of the games are therefore largely derivative, but everything is well blended also thanks to an artistic direction of considerable impact, as well as being simply an effective assortment of small fun gameplays, all easily enjoyable with simple touches on the touchscreen, perfectly designed for mobile use. Obviously these are extremely simple games but to which one gladly returns even for very short game sessions to be faced at different times. However, the Quest represents only a part of the Fancade experience, which finds its most original and varied part in the Arcade mode: here are collected user creations and individual mini-games built with the editor, as well as those preset by the 'author, and there is truly a great variety of ideas, some quite remarkable even if always built on simple and immediate elements. Fancade is distributed as free-to-play with the presence of commercials, which appear periodically between one game and another but are not too intrusive, as well as a waiting system that requires a few hours for the bridges to be completed to go from one world to the other. Both of these iThe inconveniences can be eliminated by switching to the ~Premium~ version, which unfortunately presents itself as a sort of subscription, allowing free access to the game for a month for just over one euro or for a year for around 10 euro.", "date": "2020-05-06", "grade": "7.5"}
