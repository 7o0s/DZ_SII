{"name": "Dark Souls Trilogy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-souls-trilogy-recensione.html", "text": "Dark Souls, it is not the first review where we say it, is a franchise that has been able over the years to conquer a large and absolutely exalted group of fans, in love with its dark and decadent atmospheres and above all with its gameplay, attributable to the action-RPG genre with typically dungeon crawler elements, but with an above-average level of general challenge. By proposing an old concept but for years ignored by many modern developers, based on a ~hard~ and no-frills gameplay, but precisely for this reason capable of giving so much satisfaction, the developer From Software has found success and given life to a new sub-genre , that of souls-like. Now, for fans who somehow missed all or some of them, and for those who want to get closer to this category of products, the Dark Souls Trilogy is available, a standard edition containing the three chapters of Dark Souls, of which the first two remastered in high definition, and all the contents of their DLCs in a single box set. Three steps into delirium Since we all know the three games by now, and therefore it would be at least repetitive to stay here and dissect every aspect of them, in this review we will mention their main mechanics and what are the most important contents between one chapter and another or, in case of the two remastered versions, between them and the original counterparts on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Starting with the first Dark Souls, which includes the Artorias of the Abyss package: here we find the gameplay and even many bugs of the original, but a frame rate finally stable and fixed at 60fps even in those areas, read The infamous city, where in the 2011 version there were appalling drops, to the point of making it even more difficult for the player to pass the area. The online sector has been improved (remember that to take full advantage of the characteristics of the three games, the ideal would be to always keep the connection active) with settable matchmaking, a password system to facilitate the participation of online friends and the possibility of playing in six simultaneously (elements taken from Dark Souls III), instead of four as in the past, both in PvP and in PvE on dedicated servers and no longer peer-to-peer. Dulcis in fundo, Estus Flask halved for invaders and the inability to summon allies in rapid succession. In Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, which comes with the three DLC Crown of the Sunken King, Crown of the Old Iron King and Crown of the Ivory King, From Software has instead shuffled the cards, increasing the number of enemies on the screen and differentiating their position from the original. So where before there was a huge armored knight, now there's maybe a three-headed Hydra, and so on. The developer has also improved the description of objects and equipment, and increased the text lines for some dialogues as well. Again stable 60fps and online set up for six players. Plus, new bonfire rapid transport screen that highlights the three areas where players are most likely to be encountered, new system that allows you to control the range of users that can be encountered, and the novelty of ghosts that remain in the player's world longer, without returning to them if time runs out during a boss battle. Finally introduced a new invader called Forlorn, which is controlled by artificial intelligence. Closes the Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades trilogy, which includes the base game and the two expansions Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City, everything has remained unchanged. The title, released three years ago on next-generation computers and consoles, has all the pros and cons that you can read in its direct review. Therefore, compared to the two predecessors, it plays better, winks in some aspects at Bloodborne and Demon's Souls and among the most important innovations it offers slightly more dynamic and fluid fights thanks also to a better and more ~natural~ response to the commands of the protagonist ~, in addition to the introduction of a blue bar positioned under that of vitality which is used to cast the revived spells and activate some special moves, Combat Art, with white weapons. From the point of view of the multiplayer game, up to six cooperative or PvP multiplayer games and, as in Bloodborne, matchmaking between people from different continents and the ability to set a password for network games has been implemented: if even your friends use it and are in the same area as the player, then you can limit cooperation to only these people. A rich package From a technological point of view, apart from a greater definition at the resolution of 1080p, some effects and an improved light and shadow system with good use of ambient occlusion in tight spaces, in the two remastered titles everything is more or less the same as in the past. In fact, the few aesthetic tweaks cannot hide the ~dated~ nature of the first two chapters, while Dark Souls III is different: these, also due to a question of age and development (it was released in 2016 and made specifically for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC), is more refined and obviously the most beautiful to look at, with overall good textures, a discreet full-screen motion blur but a framerate that is not always very stable and lower than the others, that is to say at 30 frames per second. However, having tested the collection on a smooth PlayStation 4, we don't know if, as for the single edition of the game, patch 1.11 is available which, adding support to the Pro, offers an increase in the framerate up to around 40-50fps. In any case, today as then, even the older ones make the same claim from a visual point of view thanks to the artistic vein of the From Software graphics, and therefore to the excellent design of the creatures and game areas, capable of giving unforgettable glimpses with magical and sometimes dreamlike tones. Ruined structures, sometimes imposing, emerge from nowhere like skeletons of a lost civilization, while abandoned villages and forests full of mystery alternate recreating a series of locations full of atmosphere, sometimes beaten by a biting wind, gloomy and decadent, with paths increasingly narrow and dark that often lead directly into the jaws of some monster. A real dark fantasy show. To make the experience more suggestive there is also an audio sector which on the one hand tends to exploit natural background sounds to give the player a greater feeling of loss, lost in a hostile and unknown world. On the other hand, he doesn't disdain when it comes to proposing songs full of atmosphere, composed by Motoi Sakaraba and Yuka Kitamura. The music of the entire saga, 110 tracks for over six hours of listening, can be downloaded via a code available inside the package. The art of the souls-like We close our review with a brief description of the mechanics, in favor of those two or three readers who do not yet know the series and the genre. The strength of Dark Souls lies in their gameplay and their absolutely evocative background. Dark, fascinating and very difficult, but without ever giving the feeling of being unfair, they are action-rpg that punish the inattentive player, the one who always makes the same mistakes, who gets distracted or advances headlong without a minimum of foresight or strategy. On the other hand they reward those who have patience, those who ~study~ the paths, statistics, upgrades, behavioral routines of enemies and even bugs! It's not sadism, but the will to push the player to operate in a certain way, inviting him to reason and not be afraid to try again and again until he finds a solution to the ~problem~. The crux of the experience obviously remains the combat, to be approached paying particular attention to an infinite number of aspects, including the scenario, which in itself can be a valid ally to get to the bottom of the battle, but also a dangerous obstacle if it is exploited to your advantage from your opponents. The areas are changeable, and to cross them successfully without forgetting anything, it is necessary to explore every nook and cranny in search of useful objects, but also of gadgets, switches and mechanisms to activate, especially in the vicinity of some bosses. So moving with circumspection, analyzing the environment or defending yourself and attacking with the right timing, perhaps from behind, are fundamental elements for surviving and collecting the precious souls as a prize, essential for buying weapons or repairing them, for obtaining new items, spells and more . Conversely, as we wrote above, haste or approximation are the ~best~ way to push yourself towards frequent deaths. Equally important is the analysis of structures and equipment in the game given that the apparently cryptic story unfolds piece by piece under the eyes of the gamer as he progresses in the adventure, provided that he is willing to devote a lot of time to a deep analysis of the scenarios, reading and putting together the descriptions on objects and weapons like a puzzle, listening to the other characters, and so on.", "date": "2019-03-09", "grade": "9.0"}
