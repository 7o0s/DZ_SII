{"name": "No One Lives Forever - The Operative", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-one-lives-forever-the-operative.html", "text": "~Excuse me, do you have to light?~ ~Certainly.~ FLAAAAAMMMMB! For his missions, Agent Archer will be sent to every part of the globe and will see weapons of every caliber and power at his disposal as well as a truly extensive series of ~little spy items~ worthy of the best 007 film. In fact, for each mission we will have to decide which war objects to face adversity with by choosing from a large arsenal in which we will find everything: machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols of various calibers with and without silencers, special bullets (dum dum, phosphorus .. ..) and so on; but ~spies do not live on weapons alone~, and in fact, among the selectable equipment, there are also lipstick-bombs, blowtorch-lighters, camera-glasses, the ever-present narcotic perfume and the deadly hair clip with the functions of ~pick locks~ and ~poisoned dagger~. The interesting thing is that all these objects are not present only for beauty but can really change the evolution of our game and lead us to exciting successes in our missions. In fact, being able to not attract attention and finish our task in the most perfect silence and anonymity really gives great satisfaction; of course the various levels can also be tackled ~head-on~ by launching an assault and devastating anything that moves on the screen... but, obviously, in this case we will be called upon to face very alert and very numerous enemies. In fact, the AI of our opponents is really well done: they will get agitated if they hear the sound of gunfire and we will see them take cover behind the architectural barriers present in the various levels if targeted by our fire; they will even do their best in somersaults and feints in an attempt to dodge our attacks and hit us! If hit, depending on the location, they will limp or hold onto their arms and attempt to flee to survive or reach reinforcements. Despite these certainly valuable aspects, however, we must note that in some moments even this good AI has some ~blunders~ (as we young people say): in fact, sometimes it happens to kill an enemy a short distance from one of his buddies without him noticing the least of the departure of one's partner, or to mow down opponents who remain well in the open to receive our blows... Returning to the weapons topic, it should be noted how we will be called to alternately use the objects of our arsenal in order to overcome the various obstacles; in fact, it really rarely happens that you don't find it necessary to switch from the pistol to the sniper rifle (which thanks to the management of the mouse wheel provides a precise and spectacular zoom) to the machine gun, which greatly enhances the tactical side of the product, making it very varied the situations in which we will find ourselves immersed in the various levels. Between one mission and another or between an objective achieved and the next we will be able to enjoy numerous videos made with the same engine as the game (as current fashion requires), well-made videos that will gradually introduce us to our antagonists and our allies explaining also the plot of the story and its intricate plots. Despite the sympathy of the dialogues, however, I accused, in some moments, their excessive length which led me to skip these interludes in order to be able to throw myself back into the action of the game. It should also be noted that the product is not localized in Italian and therefore both the subtitles and the speech will be appreciable only by those who understand the universal English language... something that will make non-users lose much of the magic of the product. English speakers. Going back to talking about the Plot of the game, it must be said that it is really well done and will not fail to amaze us with numerous twists and surprises, as well as taking us into numerous and always different situations. In fact, we will be involved in a plane crash and we will have to jump without a parachute trying to catch one of our opponents, we will find ourselves immersed in shootings in Cairo or we will run on the roofs of mountain houses, we will have to escape from sinking ships ... or everything that a good secret agent is called, by script, to do! Kate's heart But what drives this game? The engine used is LithTech in its 2.5 version, and I must say that it performs well in terms of fluidity and the graphic effects presented. We will be offered atmospheric effects such as snow and rain and the lighting sources are really well rendered, starting from the beam of light emitted by our torch to the street lamps and reflectors that we will find in the various levels. Beautiful, even if not excellent, especially when seen in motion during cutscenes, the skisn of the various characters we will meet. However, some programming problems should be noted which on some (rare to tell the truth) occasions will make our enemies pass through walls or closed doors. In ~No One Live Forever~ a really good job has also been done as regards the characterization of the locations and the attention to detail: if we enter a kitchen it will in fact be possible to find: knives, pantries, pans... in a bar we will see bottle counters etc etc ... all really well cared for ... perhaps too much! In fact, I would have preferred to be able to interact with all this goodness that is offered to us ... but apart from something that we can destroy, we will not be given the possibility of collecting the various objects and using them in our missions, which would have significantly increased playability and would have brought this title among the best of the genre (think how nice it is to be able to wear a coat found around and camouflage ourselves as hotel attendants or grab and throw a butcher knife found in a kitchen). Spy Vs Spy Obviously, like almost every new generation title, the multiplayer mode is implemented and some maps are included in the game both for game and for teams and deathmatches, moreover there is the possibility to play ~Unity vs Harm~ or a team mode which provides the possibility of challenging each other divided into two factions with the aim of intruding into the opposing base to photograph its secret documents. I haven't had the opportunity to try the game on the net but, given the peculiarities of the product, I imagine it's a really interesting experience (especially the idea of being able to create a team of secret agents who compete against each other to acquire information excites me.. . given the weapons and objects present in the game, the possibilities for action are really many!). A nice level editor would obviously be desirable... but for this we just have to wait and hope! Mission over, return to base So let's sum up this game. First of all, the innovations introduced that make it truly spectacular as a ~shooter~ are to be commended: if you want a comparison with other titles of the genre, we could define it as a ~hybrid~ between Thief, Soldier of Fortune and Half Life, or rather a game dedicated to the slaughter of opponents, but which requires tactics to survive adversity. Longevity is also good: played in medium mode it will keep us busy in front of the monitor for quite some time, both for the difficulty of the missions and for the curiosity dictated by the developments of the plot. A demerit note to some missions; despite the beautiful and varied locations in the long run you suffer from a certain repetitiveness of the objectives and methods used to achieve them. Positive vote also to the sound, well done and with really themed 60s-style music, the sound effects are also commendable. Evaluation ~undefined~ (having not tried it) to the multiplayer mode. However, a certain ~poverty~ in the number of maps made available should be noted (10). Moral of the story, for lovers of numbers, let's give this product a nice 9. Shut up... Shut up... Squeeze... Zak! Beep! Here agent K7-22 mission ended, the terrorist was neutralized. Send in F-26 units to recover corpse. I travel to meeting point X-18. If you've always wanted to be a secret agent, or if you've always been fascinated by the beautiful women that the good Bond accompanied, this is the game for you! In fact, ~No One Live Forever~ will see us take on the role of Cate Archer, an attractive girl who decided to embark on a tough career as a spy in the 60s in the pay of Unity (a secret agency whose purpose is to preserve peace in the world). However, life for our agent in a skirt is not exactly rosy; the world of spies is in fact purely male-dominated and only the premature departure of a large number of Unity agents will allow Cate to take action as an operative agent in order to carry out the currently pending assignments and unmask the murderer of her work colleagues.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
