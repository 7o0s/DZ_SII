{"name": "Arcadegeddon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/arcadegeddon-recensione.html", "text": "Since services such as Game Pass and PlayStation Plus have made their way into the living rooms and bedrooms of owners of a home console, a very large range of independent experiences have had the opportunity to infiltrate the digital library of subscribers, offering themselves virtually free to the curiosity of those who had the pad in hand. Without an economic entry barrier to curb their spread, games like Outer Wilds, Unpacking, Undertale and What Remains of Edith Finch have managed to make even those gamers who had never touched an indie in their life fall in love, perhaps due to gaming habits very distant from the independent market. From our point of view, this has often overturned the work of the critic and the purpose of his analysis, when at the center of it there is a video game arriving on a subscription service. The exam does not focus only on the purchase advice, but also on the download advice, which can be suggested in no uncertain terms even when the product is the victim of some imperfection. Among the PlayStation Plus games of July, for example, to accompany the much more renowned Crash Bandicoot 4 and Man of Medan we find Arcadegeddon, an interesting third-person co-op shooter with roguelike elements that you probably wouldn't have looked at if you didn't had been included in your subscription, and which now has the potential to turn you into the month of July with its extraordinary personality. So here's in our Arcadegeddon review why you should definitely keep an eye out for this indie rough gem. The last arcade in a cyberpunk dystopia Gilly, the arcade owner Arcadegeddon is developed and self-published by Illfonic and, as often happens with other titles that cannot have a large publisher behind them to bear the costs, the US studio's shooter also experienced an early access phase before facing a real its launch in these days, arriving not only on PS4 and PS5 in the Essential tier of PS Plus, but also on PC and Xbox family systems. The game was born from a not exactly original plot concept, but squares around a solid and captivating gameplay formula that undoubtedly represents the strong point of the entire production. Arcadegeddon in fact tells of a dystopian future, identical to many others, governed with an iron fist by ruthless megacorporations which over time have incorporated all forms of independent entertainment to subject them to their will. Only Gilly's arcade, the uncle of the protagonist, resists by all means the threats of the Fun Fun Co., a company that has every intention of suppressing the last remaining arcades in the city. Gilly has developed a game that could save his establishment, but the corporation infects it with a virus and we will have to hack into the code to clean up the malware, all the while trying to impress the other patrons of the arcade with a high score from anthology. From these narrative premises a third-person shooter, roguelike and cooperative develops, whose attempts within the game developed by Gilly will always be different from each other thanks to the procedural levels so dear to the reference genre. However, here the narrative component is much less cumbersome than other roguelikes and our only goal will be to complete the missions made available by the various factions of players present in the arcade to win their help, trying in the meantime to defeat all four the bosses currently included in the game. We weren't crazy about the fact that the plot is really stripped down to the bone (in fact, it only develops in very short junctures linked to simple on-screen dialogues), but after a few hours it was easy to understand why the developers' choice: Arcadegeddon it gives its best when the bullets start flying and, once you have tasted its gunplay, you will have very little desire to get lost in a few too many chats. A bomb of gunplay The intense shootings of Arcadegeddon The gameplay dynamics of Arcadegeddon is quite basic and unfortunately it will not make you scream at the miracle when we tell you about it. Once inside Gilly's game, just eliminate all the enemies in one area to move on to the next, or complete a series of objectives such as capturing or destroying some points of interest to unlock the level exit. Each progress contributes to feeding a counter which, upon completion, makes one of the game's four boss fights accessible, all quite engaging even if not particularly inspired. It is clear how Illfonic's title focuses entirely onThe quality of its shooter module, made truly captivating by the huge variety of weapons available to the player. The first impact with Arcadegeddon is lukewarm, almost insipid, but once the very boring initial gun has been replaced with one of the 35 weapons included in the game, it is easy to realize all the potential of the project. Each of these is original and well-characterized, and while some resemble classic archetypes such as assault, shotguns and sniper rifles, others allowed the team to unleash their creativity. From the Pixel Popper that loads enemies with data to make them perform in spectacular explosions, to the Aperture 3 that launches razor-sharp discs capable of dismembering enemies, each weapon is different from the others and find out which one is best suited to your style it is one of the pleasures offered by the Illfonic title. Weapons, like power-ups, are only found during the game, by opening hidden chests filled with loot that follows the same color theme made famous by the most famous looter shooters around. Only by accumulating the deadliest tools of death and equipping various passive buffs can you hope to get to the end of a game, the difficulty of which increases every time you pass a stage. Actually, it can also be increased manually in the shops that appear from time to time after a level, in order to receive more experience points and a significantly higher highscore. A setting of Arcageddon You can deal with all this alone even in offline mode, but as a game session that saw us fighting side by side with Chuck Brungardt, the CEO of Illfonic, showed us, in Arcadegeddon a close team is the real key to victory . After a run, in fact, it is not possible to access the upgrades that significantly modify our protagonist's chances of survival: he can spend points to unlock passive bonuses that are not very incisive and new types of unique skills that lend a hand in combat, as well as to accumulate experience with each weapon in order to bring it into Gilly's game from the very beginning of the attempt. Except for these three elements, there are no systems dedicated to becoming more and more performing, so it goes without saying that only experience - and teamwork - will be able to lead you to the final victory. The four-player online co-op it is central to the developers' vision, albeit with a peculiar aftertaste. Each participant is in constant battle with the others for the highest score, to the point that during the game, in the shops, it is possible to undertake quick PvP matches that reward the winner with additional prizes. PvP multiplayer can also be reached in the game hub, and is naturally meant to be a fresh diversion from more demanding sessions. Objective fully achieved, even if we don't know how much the community will be carried away by this alternative mode. Jet Set Radio meets the Gorillaz The exquisite character design of Arcadegeddon A title focused on co-op and interaction with other players could not fail to offer a vast arsenal of customizations with which to make your protagonist unique. The aesthetic elements are really many, they are unlocked by bringing home the secondary objectives of the factions, and allow you to adorn the character with a large number of accessories, even if after about ten hours of play it is possible to have already obtained most of the sets present in store. Illfonic is already working on new customizations, and the hope is that net of a somewhat repetitive endgame, the team will be efficient in proposing new features to its audience of gamers soon. In the words of the developers, the design of the characters and more in general, the artistic style chosen for Arcadegeddon refers to the style of Jet Set Radio and the influences of Gorillaz's punk, in a mixture of colors and patterns that we found spot on, even if not totally innovative. It is difficult to talk about the technical sector for a game that is not looking for any graphic fidelity, however it is useful to remember how the title is the first to use AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution on PS5, the equivalent of NVIDIA's DLSS which promises to improve performance significantly on game consoles that support it. During our test we never experienced any drops in performance and while we could not expect anything less from a game just out of early access, bugs and glitches were also incredibly rare during the adventure in Gilly's arcade. Last, but not least, the reference to the splendid soundtrack composed by Illfonic, full of dubstep and electrronics that fit perfectly with the setting of the game.", "date": "2022-07-10", "grade": "7.5"}
