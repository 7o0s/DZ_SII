Of course, some developers have succeeded and their name has remained engraved in the minds of fans, but as we well know it took decades for history to really repeat itself. In the case of Rogue Star, it all starts with a heartfelt homage to Elite, the masterpiece released in 1984, which saw us explore a galaxy and seize its many opportunities aboard a spaceship. Lots of atmosphere, some interesting narrative interweaving, a simulation component not to be underestimated and voil, David Braben and Ian Bell had served up a timeless classic. But how to translate that kind of experience on mobile devices, trying to minimize losses? The plot of Rogue Star sees us play the role of a brave and fairly experienced pilot, who puts his skills at the disposal of the highest bidder. A mercenary in the good sense of the term, if you will, who moves from one orbital station to another, mainly completing delivery missions, with the aim of accessing the entire spectrum of his solar system and making a name for himself. These few words are enough to describe in a rather precise way the structure of the title developed by RedBreast Studio, which strikes from the first moments thanks to a soundtrack of extraordinary quality, epic and compelling, capable of dramatically raising expectations with respect to what will be then the actual game. A calculated risk? Rogue Star is a space adventure full of charm and atmosphere but with a couple of flaws to fix Planet Earth calls Team G It doesn't take much to get into the spirit of Rogue Star. After a short tutorial, the game leaves us free to explore the portion of space unlocked up to that moment, by accessing a star map and selecting our destination from those available. At that point we witness the spectacular launch sequence of the spacecraft and a leap into hyperspace that takes us to a ~human~ distance from the target. Traveling it normally would still take too much time, so we will be able to touch the planet on the screen to advance rapidly, at least until we are faced with a convoy, a handful of space pirates or both. Convoys often represent an opportunity, as we will be asked if we want to escort them for a stretch of road, obtaining a different reward depending on the case. If we accept, our task will become to protect the ships from the attack of the bad guys, trying our hand at space dogfights that represent the most exciting part of the gameplay, but also the least successful one. The options relating to the controls are in fact few and you have to be satisfied with what the house passes, which translates into a fairly precise management of your spacecraft, but in a collision detection that is too pretentious for commands based on the touch screen. The result is many, too many blank shots, and it's a shame because an energy balancing mechanism (which can be used on weapons, shields or the engine) adds a certain strategic depth to the clashes on paper. A second limitation of Rogue Star is then represented by the general repetitiveness of the structure, an element taken up in practice by Elite. Added to this is the lack of upgrades for the vehicle: to obtain greater resistance to attacks, improved firepower and higher speed, it is necessary to buy a new spacecraft, a rather expensive operation considering the list prices of the various models . To be able to scrape together the money necessary for this purpose, one must therefore access an auction house and bet part of one's savings to obtain packages of a certain value, but the practical yield of these sessions is not exactly exciting, as is the design general of an interface a little too anchored to old interpretations. On the other hand, the in-game graphics are good, fluid and full of interesting effects and solutions, although the level of detail leaves something to be desired.", "date": "2015-04-24", "grade": "7.8"}
