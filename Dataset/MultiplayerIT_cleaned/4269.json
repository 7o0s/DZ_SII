The use of two-dimensional and caricatured representation has already been successfully tested in horror titles such as Home, Lone Survivor or even 2Dark and Corpse Party, even if in these last cases the style adopted remains less disturbing than the raw pixel, which allows for distorted and ~lo-fi~ as in this Distraint: Deluxe Edition, revised and corrected version of the previous Distraint: Pocket Pixel Horror. It is curious how the game manages to remain suspended between an apparent tranquility tinged with an almost humorous self-irony and moments of pure horror, complete with turns towards extreme gore. The cartoonish style chosen to present the deeds of the young and ambitious Price certainly dilutes the dark tones of a story that could otherwise be unsustainable for many players, but makes the sharp contrasts with the scenes in which the horror breaks out even stronger and more impressive . The precarious balance between the banal wickedness of financial bureaucracy and the metaphysical terror that penetrates situations strongly rooted in reality, and therefore even more dramatic, is what determines the continuous tension one feels when playing Distraint. It is a sad and disconsolate story in principle, but which carries with it a substantially positive message: a warning about the risks of a life devoted to professional and monetary affirmation and an exhortation to go beyond the superficiality and look to the deeper values of existence, all hidden inside a small and simple 2D adventure. Price's story has something Kafkaesque in its telling of the little big horrors of the legal bureaucracy that puts money before empathy and solidarity, bartering humanity for a comfortable seat on a board of directors. Price's story Distraint is a graphic adventure that could be described as point and click as its core mechanic, despite not having a pointer. It tells the exploits of Price, a young debt collector who tries to make his climb within the company he works for by carrying out some uncomfortable eviction for his unscrupulous superiors. The prospect of a good salary is tempting, but the protagonist finds himself increasingly torn apart by his insecurities, because the awareness of being on the wrong side makes its way more and more into his mind and despite the attempts to let other people's dramas flow over him, the doubts about the inhuman conduct requested of him by his superiors become an increasingly untenable elephant in the room. Precisely this metaphorical figure - as we discover with horror at a certain point in the game - is extremely threatening, becoming a sort of disturbing and oppressive presence. Price has to deal with foreclosures and in particular carry out three evictions, in each of which you find yourself having to explore various environments and solve puzzles ranging from the mundane to the extremely bizarre. The game takes place on a two-dimensional scrolling plane, with the settings usually divided into corridors and rooms, scattered with characters and puzzles to solve. The puzzle design isn't particularly inspired and mostly serves to underpin a narrative that overrides every other aspect of the game, although there are some pretty nifty moments throughout the short adventure (which ends under three hours on average). . Definitely something more than a walking simulator in terms of gameplay in short, but not exactly comparable to a real traditional graphic adventure for the study of puzzles. In some phases the tactile interface adopted for the mobile version is decidedly uncomfortable, with the need to press the arrow keys again at each screen change and in some cases a lack of responsiveness in highlighting the elements of the scenario with which to interact. Furthermore, an excellent translation into Italian of the texts on the screen should be noted.", "date": "2018-05-11", "grade": "7.5"}
