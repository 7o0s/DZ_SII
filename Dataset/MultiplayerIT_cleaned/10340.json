Le Origini del Mistero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72391-scooby-doo-le-origini-del-mistero-dove-ce-un-mistero-ce-scooby-doo.html", "text": "Version tested: Nintendo Wii. The gang of the famous cartoon born in the early 70s and which has come down to the present day is back in a new and hilarious guise! The characters are always the same, but younger than their television counterparts (not for nothing, the title speaks of ~origins~): thus the two inseparable favorites, Shaggy and the faithful Scoodby-Doo, are found again, accompanied by friends Fred, Daphne and Velma. The leitmotif of the whole adventure is a trip to the Keystone International Food Festival... but obviously everything won't go smoothly: during the individual stages the ~Mysteries & the like~ group will have to face four articulated cases, defeat ruthless monsters and unmask the bad guy. The story is enriched by a large number of introductory films absolutely in line with the television ancestor, characterized by a balanced mix of fear and humor, complete with demented scenes and laughter in full American sitcom style, elements that will surely be able to snatch a smile even to the most serious player. In addition to the four fun episodes, an extra section, where you can get lost in watching special video content, and one for rewards, where you can find out about mission-related objectives that allow you to win additional trophies and where you can buy them eclectic customs and thus acquire new skills. Scooby & co. An undisputed quality of the game is the variety that characterizes it from the first moments: interesting, above all, are the different settings in which the player is catapulted. Each episode is in fact a mini-story in its own right: the second chapter is particularly fanciful, entirely set in an amusement park infested by diabolical creatures of all kinds, such as ~murderous~ rag dolls or evil ~jack in the box~. The suggestive atmospheres are always accompanied by a large amount of music, thanks to which the player is even more involved in the proposed mysteries. The cases to be solved are articulated through a variety of different levels, among which the so-called ~pursuits~ stand out, in which the characters only have to think about running as fast as possible, and the direct confrontation with the Boss, whose defeat allows the moving on to the next environment and winning the mask of the now fallen from grace villain. Another strong point of the game concerns the usable characters: the peculiarities of each one do not stop at mere aesthetics but each one has unique qualities that distinguish it from the others; for example, the athletic Daphne is able to climb pipes, while the nice Shaggy is equipped with a useful grappling hook to be able to reach the highest floors! Finally, the title is also varied as regards the entire game mode, in which moments dedicated to exploration alternate, with the collection of ~Scooby Snacks~ (biscuits for dogs with which it is possible to make purchases in the ~ Extra~) and Hearts of Courage (useful for restoring energy), and moments in which the main task is to find clues for solving the puzzle and progressing the story. A bit for all tastes Even the more technical side of the game is well structured. The presence of simple and not too articulated commands makes everything very pleasant even for less experienced players, especially if you use the WiiMote plus Nunchuck combination. From time to time there is no shortage of suggestions on the keys to press to interact with the different objects or on the moves to be made to defeat the enemies; sometimes even these tips are characterized by the freshness and sympathy that pervades the entire game and it could happen that you are told that to kill an evil monster it is necessary to ~move the character as if he were crazy~ (it gives a good idea, but above all it works Really)! A peculiarity of the story is that in each chapter the protagonist is always paired with another component of the ~Mysteries and the like~ and there is constantly the possibility of changing the character by pressing the C key, for a simple whim or to satisfy the requests imposed by certain puzzles or passages within levels. And for those who are tired of playing alone, it is really interesting to discover the Multiplayer mode, which can be implemented both in cooperation and by challenging a friend - whoever catches the most Scooby snacks wins. The localization work was also nice, which made it possible to have both the writings and the dialogues completely in Italian, even with a well-made dubbing. The only drawback found in the game is the automatic save mode: very convenient for the forgetful but less favorable to those who may not have the material time to finish the level. If so notn you have still reached a decisive point and you leave the game, all progress will be lost, with the exception of only the clues collected. Comment Good balance between the ~scary~ atmosphere and the typical humor of the series Fun alone, hilarious with a friend Well done environments, enemies and puzzles Completely in Italian The save system could have been more efficient", "date": "2009-12-03", "grade": null}
