{"name": "Io Sono Mostro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/io-sono-mostro-recensione.html", "text": "Io Sono Mostro, the mysteriously Italianized name of I Am Monster, is the latest effort by PikPok, a development team particularly active in the field of mobile devices. Over the years, the New Zealand studio has given us small pearls such as the post-apocalyptic endless runner Into the Dead and the crazy puzzle game Monster Ate My Condo, in which huge monsters fed themselves by putting entire apartments of different colors under their jaws. Well, the passion for kaiju still seems to be going strong in the PikPok offices, and so here we are at the helm of a real team of giant creatures, committed to dispensing death and destruction within large metropolises. Io Sono Mostro is basically a casual game, since no particular skills are required to play it: the movement of the monster we control is automatic, the scenario fills up randomly with enemies to face (generally soldiers, turrets and large armored vehicles). and their elimination is also entrusted to automatisms, with the exception of special abilities. In fact, where the normal blows of the monster should become ineffective compared to the damage that is suffered in the meantime, it is possible to activate one of three available powers, which recharge over time and allow the targets to be destroyed almost instantly, so as to be able to pass to the following ones. The formula is enriched in various ways: other creatures are added to the starting creature, to be summoned through a special portal, and you can switch from one to the other in the middle of the action by simply pressing a button. The switch becomes a fundamental maneuver as the degree of challenge rises, given that the monsters that go to the bench have the opportunity to recharge and the same goes for their special abilities. Gameplay and structure Does the wanton destruction of I Am Monster lead to anything? Although the mechanisms that regulate the action are almost completely automatic and random, the increase of a specific indicator allows at a certain point to leave the scenario to devote oneself to a boss fight against another creature, in an atmosphere similar to that of the classic King of the Monsters 2 but without the same depth. Also in this case, in fact, all that belongs to us are the special abilities and the possible transition from one character to another: just download everything we have on the target and it will be done. Well, unless some time has passed and the challenge has not risen considerably, which usually happens in freemium productions and which in the case of this new PikPok title touches quite new points as regards monetization techniques. The progression of the protagonists, their growth, the unlocking of new powers and new monsters depends in fact on the research of the scientists, which it is possible to carry on for small stretches by taking advantage of advertising videos and free bonuses, but which in general requires the payment of real money . And here the proverbial donkey falls, because when the paywall starts to make itself felt (not in the first few hours, it must be said: at least in this the authors have been far-sighted), Io Sono Mostro can ask you for a monthly subscription from well 10.49 euros which includes a certain amount of crystals, DNA and extra rewards, or let you choose between in-app purchases that start at 5.49 euros (in promotion) and go up to 109.99 euros. What is uncovered is therefore a rather frightening Pandora's box, which certainly remains optional but is presented in a somewhat invasive way, with the real risk that younger users will buy something without wanting to. It is a pity that the developers wanted to use such an aggressive approach, because the Io Sono Mostro experience seemed very simple but pleasant to us, characterized by splendid cartoonish graphics and an engaging sound sector.", "date": "2019-01-14", "grade": "6.5"}
