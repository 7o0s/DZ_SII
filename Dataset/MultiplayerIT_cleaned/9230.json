Whatever the medium used. A tour of the bookstore and the eye catches The Bloody Chamber, Angela Carter's anthology in which stories like Beauty and the Beast or Snow White are reviewed in a darker light; or Forever Neverland, a story that tells of Wendy's psychological disorders after returning from Neverland. In the cinematographic field, just look at the last year in theaters, with some (unhappy) interpretations of Alice and Little Red Riding Hood. And what about video games? Without disturbing some excellent works from the indie scene, the avant-garde of this trend is associated by most with American McGee's Alice, a successful action platformer for PC with which the American game designer had earned a large group of fans about ten years ago. At such a distance from the first chapter, the arrival of an official sequel means a lot especially for this particular slice of enthusiasts, while many others have limited themselves to following the development of this bizarre and disturbing interpretation of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece with curiosity. Our return to Wonderland, however, was more agonizing than we expected. And not necessarily in a good way. We are all mad here The plot of Alice: Madness Returns picks up the events of the first chapter from where they were interrupted ten years ago, with Alice grown up a few years and apparently determined to leave her fears and psychoses in the old Rutledge asylum. Now the protagonist has moved to a decaying and filthy Victorian London in an attempt to fight the ghosts of the past and to discover the truth behind the mysterious fire that killed her family and was the cause of her mental problems. The British capital acts as a prologue between one chapter and another, allowing the player a few brief moments of exploration in a setting that is as dark as it is charismatic. Among the streets of London Alice is helpless, dominated by the oppressive urban scenario and the people who inhabit it; but it is precisely when you would like to better explore these streets full of prostitutes and clubs full of drunkards that the complexes resurface in Alice's mind and force her to return to Wonderland. After defeating the Queen of Hearts in the last episode, this time the plague that has struck the enchanted land and its inhabitants is an infernal train that devastates everything in its path: destroying portions of Wonderland, this gigantic locomotive tears also Alice's memories and mental balance, forced to stop her before it's too late. Thanks to the fantastic universe and the incredible characters born from the genius of Lewis Carroll, once again American McGee has seen all the inspirations served on a silver platter for an effective stylistic reinterpretation: exploring his Wonderland means traveling between incredible worlds in the company of crazy creatures, although, paradoxically, the least characterized character seems to be the protagonist. Considering her troubled past and her mental instability, Alice was expected to be a more restless, schizophrenic and unstable character, but if we exclude the constant trips from London to Wonderland, we find ourselves in front of a rather normal girl. Playstation 3 trophies By playing Madness Returns it is possible to unlock about fifty different trophies, although most require simply advancing from level to level. Most of the time the player is asked to collect Alice's secret memories, eliminate a certain number of enemies or unlock and wear new clothes, although there are more original trophies, in which to carry out particular attack combinations or defeat bosses using a particular weapon. A slow agony Unfortunately, if Madness Returns excels from a stylistic point of view, it fails in its technical realization. Even if you want to turn a blind eye to a now quite dated graphic, you notice all the ingenuity of Spicy Horse's programmers and artists: Alice's model fluctuates sensationally for the entire duration of the game, where the bad textures, in addition to ruining the environments more pleasant, they are often loaded late. The coup de grace is given by a sometimes dancer framerate and the numerous invisible walls that violently tear away any illusion of being able to explore Wonderland. Let me be clear, they would be defects with which one could easily live with, if it weren'tthat the game stumbles sensationally in an attempt to offer a long-lasting and always engaging experience. In order to prolong the player's visit to Wonderland, each chapter of Alice: Madness Returns offers unnecessarily stretched levels and ideas that are always the same, which hit rock bottom with very boring horizontal scrolling shooter sessions and a repeated Game of 15 which, thanks to the heaven, it can be safely skipped. We would have much preferred a shorter but more intense game, in which to abandon a new setting before we can even get tired of it, and instead Madness Returns makes all those mistakes that any two-lire game design manual tries to advise against. And it's a real shame, because pad in hand the game turns out to be a perfect blend of platform and third-person action: nothing can be objected to the goodness of the controls, both as regards the frenetic combat phases, full of combos, dodging and devastating attacks, both in exploratory sessions, in which the ability to float and perform triple jumps in the air makes even the most intricate of situations intuitive and never frustrating. The weapons are then all upgradable, offering the player one more reason to go in search of power-ups and little secrets hidden here and there in the various levels.", "date": "2011-06-17", "grade": "7.0"}
