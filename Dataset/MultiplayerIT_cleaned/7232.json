An obviously long and painful job, since it took all this time to reach the App Store in a universal version for iPhone and iPad. The most interesting thing, on paper, about Glorkian Warrior lies in the collaboration between James Kochalka, a talented comic artist and Pixeljam, an indie team to which we owe titles such as Dino Run and Potatoman. A combination that has created a bizarre mix between a classic shooter in the style of Galaga, platform elements and a cartoon, with a massive dose of humor. An interesting recipe, but sufficient to justify the 2.69 requested? Glorkian Warrior is a solid arcade shooter full of personality Three eyes are better than two Since the presentation on Kickstarter, things have changed a lot for Glorkian Warrior: in principle, in fact, the platform component should have been much more marked, with a vertical development of the levels. There should have been Canabalt-style sections, as well as levels featuring a pixel-art graphical style closer to the Pixeljam experiences. Finally, it should have appeared on PC and Mac, and possibly also on Linux. But in four years a lot of things change, other projects go forward, new ideas replace the old ones, and the market indicates the ideal development environment with more precision. And so Glorkian Warrior has become an iOS game (although the PC / Mac conversion is not excluded) and its ambitions to understand and compress all those different gameplay elements have more realistically reduced and simplified. The result is therefore, basically, a shooter that recalls the great classics of the genre, such as the aforementioned Galaga: the aim of the game is to move the protagonist, precisely the bizarre pink Glorkian Warrior, to the left or right trying to knock down the alien invaders of various sizes and shapes without getting hit by their bullets. All this thanks to a comfortable talking backpack capable of automatically firing simple shots at first, and then possibly increasingly complex and effective attacks by collecting the relative bonuses. But they are not the only things to recover, because the eliminated aliens can also release tasty crackers (yes, exactly) through which to unlock additional objects and elements. We were talking about the platform elements, but in reality it is only a sketch that is limited to guaranteeing the ability to make jumps, through which to eliminate enemies walking on the ground simply by leaping on their heads in Super Mario style. Too bad that the control system has some problems managing this action, often making it unnecessarily complicated. Therefore, if Glorkian Warrior is a very immediate and simple title in its mechanics, this does not mean that it is not a demanding game: on the contrary, Pixeljam wanted to set the level of difficulty decidedly high, creating a product intended to guarantee frequent and numerous player deaths. Although the heroic warrior is able to sustain a couple of blows in fact, the energy bar can only be restored thanks to the collection of very rare and infrequent extra hearts; moreover, already after a few minutes, the screen tends to fill up with aliens as numerous as they are dangerous, with the various types that are distinguished by different movement and attack patterns. The need to always stay alert and with your eyes wide open is therefore fundamental, but even in doing so it is not absolutely unlikely to find yourself facing several deaths and attempts in the space of a few minutes trying to improve your record. Alien invasion Aware of the risk of repetitiveness that a similar approach would have generated, the programmers had the excellent idea of inserting a certain space for randomness in the development of the various single games, which in fact never propose the same situations as regards the series of aliens to meet. Similarly, the presence of challenges, through which to obtain extra crackers, also helps to increase the variety. However, in the convincing and fun gameplay developed by Pixeljam there seems to be a misstep, basically attributable to the effectiveness of the protagonist's ~base~ weapon: too weak and not very effective, to the point of making the situations in which you find yourself able to be very frustrating only count with it, after the previous power up (all have a fixed duration) has disappeared. A penalty in our view excessive, especially sand it takes place during a challenging battle perhaps with a boss, and not necessary in the face of the already substantial level of difficulty imposed. Instead, where Glorkian Warrior appears difficult to criticize is in the audiovisual component and everything that surrounds the actual game: provided you appreciate the style of James Kochalka, remotely comparable with that of Matt Groening, the title developed by Pixeljam is in fact a irresistible condensed demented humor supported by colorful, detailed graphics, certainly not surprising from a technical point of view but extraordinarily full of character and personality.", "date": "2014-03-25", "grade": "8.0"}
