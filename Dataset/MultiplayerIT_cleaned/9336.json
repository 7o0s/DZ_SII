In fact, the development team is mostly made up of programmers from cult JRPGs like Persona 3 and Etrian Odyssey. But there is actually something else in common. PlayStation 2 was certainly the central console for last generation JRPGs, just as Nintendo DS offered us the most valid Japanese Role Playing Games of recent years. The genre, lately considered increasingly stagnant and unnecessarily convoluted, has proliferated on Nintendo DS in defiance of the modest technical capabilities of the handheld, often focusing on the originality of features such as the touch-screen to offer experiences in which cinematic graphics leave room for gameplay and narrative. Radiant Historia by Atlus is in fact a real point of arrival for the JRPG genre on Nintendo DS and as a swan song it reveals itself, without too many compliments, as one of the best productions of recent years. Constants The plot of Radiant Historia revolves around one of the most common leitmotifs in fantasy fiction, yet we have rarely happened to follow a story centered on overused time travel so intelligent and well told. But let's go in order. Stocke is a kind of secret agent for Alistel, a kingdom afflicted by a progressive desertification of unnatural origin which seems to be caused by the kingdom of Granorg, dominated by the tyrannical Protea. During a secret mission, Stocke finds himself in his hands a magical book, the White Chronicle: our protagonist thus acquires the ability to travel through time and reach certain crucial moments in history, in which one choice rather than another can involve a totally different evolution of events. Accompanied by a band of captivating and well-drawn supporting actors, Stocke will have to travel back and forth between timelines to prevent the war from reaching a catastrophic end. Here the narrative of Radiant Historia is deeply intertwined with the gameplay itself and the freedom to move between parallel universes based on the different decisions of Stocke is basically the key to the entire game. Complicated? Let's take an example. In one timeline Stocke might need an ability or a character he can't meet, perhaps because he's dead, and this leads to different outcomes; the player will then be able to travel to the past to save that character and follow the different unfolding of the story. The process is very simple and offers a very unique and original experience, which leads to many ~wrong~ epilogues and at least two main story lines, one ~true~ and one ~alternative~. It is clearly not possible to completely manipulate the course of events, in fact the crucial moments force the player to choose one of two options, but it will then be possible to return to that time node to change the course of events at any time. The price to pay for such an original playful and narrative solution is the obligation to re-read the numerous textual sequences that lead to the ~choice~ of the moment, a fact that in the long run can prove tiring... if it weren't for the possibility of accelerating its development or skip them entirely by pressing a key. Variables As a good JRPG, Radiant Historia does not fail to challenge the player in numerous fights between the party, made up of up to three characters, and the enemies on duty, initially visible during explorations and which it is possible to hit with Stocke's sword to put them to sleep and gain an advantage at the start of the actual fight. The combat system of Radiant Historia is undoubtedly one of the most original and ingenious that we have ever played in recent years. Basically, combat takes place in turns and the enemies are placed on a 3x3 grid, facing our heroes. Radiant Historia offers at this point two truly peculiar characteristics that it is absolutely essential to master in order to get the better of the most powerful and aggressive opponents. First, the player can manipulate the order of actions by exchanging the turn of one of his characters with that of another character or even an enemy. This allows you to compile the order of actions in the way that best suits us, favoring the execution of combos and chains of upgrades and depowering. This is connected to the second feature of Radiant Historia, or the possibility of ~moving~ the enemies themselves on the grid with the special abilities of our characters. An example? It is possible to place a harmful trap on a cback, pushing enemies on the boxes closest to the party, thus reducing their offensive capabilities based on the new distance and placing them all on the same box on which our third character will launch a powerful elemental magic. In essence, the player must carefully manipulate both the turn order and the positioning of enemies to take full advantage of them, sparingly consuming the points necessary to use skills or spells. This system grants an exquisite strategic depth to a seemingly simple battle-system but full of inventiveness and twists (enemies that exploit their positioning or that are impossible to move, for example) that will never fail to offer the player the right level of challenge, forcing him to think to get to the bottom of the most difficult battles. Doc Brown approved The already excellent picture is completed by a respectable technical sector. While not crying out for a miracle, the graphic design of Radiant Historia is very solid: the game offers a convincing combination of polygonal settings and two-dimensional sprites and the detail of each location is very high, thanks above all to a careful and precise use of the color palette. However, the best is given by the sprites of characters and creatures, especially during battles, which always prove to be defined and full of excellent animations and make the already hilarious fights even a pleasure for the eyes. The visual rendering is therefore over the top but does not reach the peaks of excellence reached by other productions for Nintendo DS, especially as regards the special effects of spells and skills, rather coarse, nevertheless Radiant Historia maintains a nostalgic atmosphere that combines perfectly with the novelties offered by the gameplay. To frame everything we think the soundtrack, undoubtedly one of the best of Yoko Shimomura: it is no coincidence that the package proposed by Atlus also offers, as often happens for the games produced by this zealous company, a mini-CD containing some songs from the soundtrack . The acoustic accompaniment is truly exceptional, Radiant Historia offers truly engaging and emotional songs, which are well suited to the atmosphere of the game and to the various situations, gracing the player with an excellent musical variety.", "date": "2011-04-21", "grade": "9.0"}
