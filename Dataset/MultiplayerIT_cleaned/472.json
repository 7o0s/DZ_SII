{"name": "Suikoden Tactics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/suikoden-tactics.html", "text": "Return to the Island Nations Suikoden Tactics begins seven years before the events narrated in Suikoden IV, but soon time passes and the story begins to run parallel to the adventures of Snowe and company, clarifying the many obscure points and telling us something more about some of the characters encountered wandering the seas of the fourth official chapter. The protagonist of this episode is Kyrill, a young man obsessed like his father with the study of the mysterious Rune Cannons: his research will intertwine with the war between Kooluk and the Nations, leading to unexpected results. The plot of Suikoden Tactics is certainly not a masterpiece of originality: it is indeed all too obvious and predictable, even if some pleasant twists and turns appear here and there, making us want to continue at least to see how this story will end and how will place in the chronology of the saga. Unfortunately, the anonymity of most of the cast makes it difficult to really take an interest in the fate of the new 108 Stars: as in most games of this type, our fighters will often be poorly characterized, revealing themselves as mere pawns in the strategic clashes that we will have to face. All the narrative attention is focused on a small group of protagonists, however not particularly charismatic: after the narrative sparks made by Final Fantasy Tactics years ago, or by the more recent Disgaea, Phantom Brave and La Pucelle, it was reasonable to expect something more, also considering the saga of which this Tactics takes the place of, among the most famous ever despite its ups and downs. Battle Artist Suikoden Tactics clearly appears as a Strategy-RPG designed for a young audience: the disarming simplicity of the structure contrasts with the playful elaborations of Nippon Ichi in his tactics, perhaps a little exaggerated but undoubtedly more complex, profound and satisfying. As expected, in Suikoden Tactics it is possible to assemble a group of heroes to tackle the various missions proposed by the game: by taking advantage of the available Skill Points that can be acquired by progressing, it is possible to partially customize the various heroes, making them stronger and expanding their fighting possibilities. The Runes are back, of course: by equipping them we will make our units able to cast spells at the enemies. The classic battle-system of the series is therefore partially adapted to a certainly not innovative strategic dimension, in which two interesting but not particularly new elements fit together. First of all, it is possible to make some characters talk to each other: clearly inspired by Nintendo's Fire Emblem (series in which some similar characters increase their abilities by being close to each other) this tactic allows you to enhance Cooperative Attacks, encouraging the player to develop a good group of like-minded heroes and carefully planning moves and positions on the battlefield. This also applies to the elemental panels: divided into squares as in the most classic of scenarios, the maps in Suikoden Tactics often have areas influenced by a certain element; this means that in that area a unit of the same element will enjoy a bonus, while a unit of the opposite element will logically be disadvantaged. Moving and positioning your units on the battlefield, keeping in mind the turn order represented by a simple bar, and considering the pros and cons of distancing like-minded characters are the most interesting strategic elements in Suikoden Tactics: then, there is much little. The scarce difficulty proposed by the main campaign and by the optional side-quests is mainly caused by the artificial intelligence of the enemies, really quite low: not only do they often suggest through balloons what their next move will be (a bit like it happened in the Duels of the mother series), but often attack the player's army without a precise strategy, repeating the same cycle of suicidal actions, soon becoming cannon fodder for an experienced player who manages to manipulate the discrete tactical elements present in each mission in his favor. The possibility of freely enhancing one's characters and personalizing them with the various Runes and skills available is a good incentive to search for the ~perfect platoon~ but a timeless casual-gamer to devote to the exasperated grind of the experience (a bit like what happened in Disgaea) will not encounter any problems in completing the game: whether this is a defect or an advantage, it is up to the various types of users to decide. Rhapsody Suikoden Tactics presents a technical realization not dissimilar from the dozens of games belonging to this genre: the three-dimensional isometric maps, very accurate in texturing and realization, are the theaterof the clashes between the various units, small polygonal models made in cel-shading, colored and animated discreetly. The strong point in the fights are definitely the spells: the power of the Runes often manifests itself in a show of gaudy colours, sometimes spectacular and of sure visual impact. Unfortunately the character design in this episode really leaves something to be desired, and the cutscenes do not enjoy that directorial touch due to the graphic setting which would have benefited them by underlining any emotional impact. The soundtrack, however, does not disappoint: Konami has always been able to give us splendid music for each chapter of the Suikoden saga, and this Tactics is no different. The remixes of the songs heard playing Suikoden IV turn out to be better than the originals, and the tracks that form the backdrop to the battles are extremely enjoyable. The dubbing, on the other hand, is really terrible: the actors are often not very suitable for their role and recite the various lines with a rather amateurish cadence. Such a pity. This Suikoden Tactics closes the parenthesis of mediocrity that afflicted the saga after Suikoden III: with the fifth chapter Konami has finally changed the music. Suikoden Tactics is not a bad game, mind you, but like the fourth episode of the saga it lacks not only an evident lack of ideas, but also a technical-ludic realization dancer: the game, too simple and linear, is still enjoyable above all for genre newbies; on the other hand technically every good visual and sound element seems karmically balanced by obvious flaws, primarily an unpleasant character design and bad dubbing. Those who enjoyed Suikoden IV will find the answers to all the narrative puzzles in Suikoden Tactics, and those looking for a simple strategic RPG just have to open the package. Everyone else can expect better. Pros: Concludes the story of Suikoden IV and reveals the backstory Nice soundtrack Very simple game system Cons: ... Too simple game system. Various graphics and sound glitches Low difficulty The tradition begun by Squaresoft in 1998 with Final Fantasy Tactics continues: more and more software houses decide to exploit the success of a more or less famous series, creating ~strategic~ episodes, sometimes even narrative accessories to the contuinity of the saga. For example, this is the case with Onimusha Tactics for Game Boy Advance. However, Suikoden Tactics wants to be an almost necessary complement to the story written by Konami for Suikoden IV: not only do numerous characters known in the most mediocre and criticized episode of the historical RPG series make their appearance during the game, but some plot-holes are finally filled, to the delight of fans of the saga. And yet, it seems that the same shadow of mediocrity that hit Suikoden IV also hangs over this one-of-a-kind chapter, originally titled Rhapsodia in Japan...", "date": "2006-06-07", "grade": null}
