In fact, among the various mini-games of this ~series~ PixelJunk Racers is perhaps the weakest one: the first episode certainly doesn't have many fans, despite the original idea after all, so Q-Games tries again this time with what is a sort of expansion, so much so that owners of the first episode will be able to download this PixelJunk Racers 2nd Lap for free. All the others, however, will pay 7.99 for a package that also includes the first PixelJunk Racers, integrated with the new features designed for this sequel. The real question is: is it worth it? Wow! The first impression is quite positive: PixelJunk Racers 2nd Lap sports a very clean graphic design, at 1080p, and a moderate and pleasant color choice. However, one game is enough to dampen the enthusiasm: the tracks, about ten, are absolutely static, except for the little cars that whiz along the lanes of the track; toy cars which, in turn, are tiny dichromatic sprites with virtually no animation. The final visual rendering is therefore quite sparse and monotonous, although the movement of the tiny vehicles appears extremely fluid and natural: clearly, the budget price of PixelJunk Racers 2nd Lap does not imply amazing special effects, but some more animation would certainly have been welcome. The accompanying music is bearable but the speaker will force you to turn down the volume in no time with its annoying and monotonous cheers. Thankfully the design of the tracks is quite inspired and their increasing complexity makes the more advanced challenges interesting, especially in the competitive modes. They are essentially three: one will allow you to compete against the computer or your friends; the second competitive mode allows you to create teams to face elimination races; finally, the third mode is certainly the most interesting and original, unpublished in this sequel: in fact, you will be able to challenge the ~ghosts~ of web players, essentially their records and their own games. Of course, the final result can be sent to the relevant Leader Board, so the Ghost mode guarantees a certain longevity to a title that, essentially, relies only on the single player mode. Playstation 3 trophies PixelJunk Racers 2nd Lap offers fifteen Bronze Trophies and one Gold Trophy. In general, Trophies are acquired by achieving particular objectives in the various tracks and game modes, especially in the Tournament mode: for example, you will have to obtain at least twenty gold cups in each Tournament race or meet some special requirements in certain tracks. Competitions and prizes The main game mode in PixelJunk Racers 2nd Lap consists of Tournament. It is basically a series of challenges offered to the player in series of four at a time: to reach the second quartet of challenges it will be necessary to complete the first four and then a fifth test which will unlock the subsequent races. Each challenge must be tackled on one or more tracks and the player's performance will determine the quality of the final prize, from bronze to gold. The various races are essentially a variation on the basic theme of PixelJunk Racers 2nd Lap, which is actually very simple: the player controls the automatic movement of a toy car in only two ways, accelerating (by pressing the back buttons) or moving the toy car in adjacent lanes by pressing left or right on the D-pad. That's all. It is an essential control system which, paradoxically, does not work very well on the most convoluted tracks due to the high speed of our sprite which will not only become difficult to follow with the naked eye, but also to move in time in so that it doesn't hit other sprites moving on the lanes, especially when they move themselves. At that point, especially in speed races, one has the clear and unpleasant sensation that it is luck that manages the game, not our skill. It's a pity because the variety of challenges proposed is decidedly interesting: in some, for example, we will have to overcome as many cars as possible without ever hitting them; in another we will have to complete a certain number of laps in the shortest possible time; in yet another we will have to maintain a certain speed to stay inside luminous circles until they explode. Unfortunately, however, the player is forced to repeat each challenge for one or more tracks in order to earn the prize and failing a track will mean having to start over: frustrating, to say the least.", "date": "2010-10-12", "grade": "5.8"}
