The latter are among the few in the history of video games to be able to boast of having succeeded in paying homage to the popular DC Comics superhero, almost perfectly recreating the universe and all its charm. Undoubtedly thanks to Rocksteady Studios, the London developer behind the two aforementioned projects, who however decided to take a break and leave his post at Warner Bros Games Montreal for this third episode of the saga. The Canadian team, seen at work on Arkham City's Armored Edition for Wii U, has the hard task of maintaining the high quality of the series with this Batman: Arkham Origins, a prequel that offers users the opportunity to control a Batman at times brutal, impulsive, temperamentally different from the one they are familiar with. Batman: Arkham Origins chronicles the beginnings of a young, restless and inexperienced Dark Knight Christmas in Gotham City Batman: Arkham Origins is set a few years before the events of the first episode of the series. To be precise, two years after Bruce Wayne's return to Gotham, when Batman was still considered something of an urban legend, Gordon was a captain and the police commissioner was the corrupt Gillian Loeb. Therefore, as mentioned in the introduction, users will find a Dark Knight at the beginning, not yet mature and tempered by countless battles, but not naive for this. The narrative device of the prequel, we say it immediately, is not to be considered an end in itself, but rather a way to deepen the knowledge of the superhero, and find many of his most famous enemies, such as the Hatter Fool, Joker, the Penguin and Bane, when they were still engaged in their shady dealings and had to cross their boxing gloves with the Bat Man. In Gotham City it is almost Christmas and the snow-covered streets are crowded with citizens engaged in shopping. Yet, in a somewhat magical context, there are those who have very different plans than getting involved in the typical atmosphere of the period, such as the boss of the Black Mask underworld. The criminal decides to put a large price on Batman's head, unleashing a ferocious manhunt not only by eight of Gotham's most famous villains, including Copperhead, Deathstroke and Killer Croc, but also by the policemen themselves, who they still don't know whether or not they can trust the mysterious black-suited vigilante. Indeed, to be honest, the Dark Knight will sometimes deal with cops as ferocious as the worst criminals, given that much of Gotham's law enforcement is corrupt. The hero therefore has the dual task of escaping the continuous sorties now of professional assassins, now of improvised opponents, and of finding the one who unleashed this manhunt, to find out what is behind his initiative and another event which we do not reveal to avoid spoilers. The plot will gradually unfold along the course of an adventure which on a structural level is very similar to that of the two chapters published so far by Warner Bros. The gameplay of Batman: Arkham Origins in fact does not differ much from that of those who preceded: it is a product focused on exploration in sandbox-style environments, on action, including stealth, and on a valid combat system, enhanced by a series of extra elements, such as the detective mode, capable of enriching substantially the experience. Blood on the snow In a nutshell. the game can be thought of as structured in different sections having a main story, where you can follow the pre-established path through a series of missions connected to the story, and optional secondary tasks. These can be obtained in various ways, such as by investigating and collecting a series of clues scattered throughout the play area, or by intercepting police calls. To be more precise, during the exploratory phases Batman can occasionally intercept the radio contacts of the police and decide whether or not to intervene to foil the crime in progress. Or proceed on your own path, giving up the potential gain of those experience points useful for improving yourself and your equipment. To these situations are also added a series of missions outside the main narrative context, called Wanted, which are linked to each other by a dedicated subplot. The purpose of thissort of game within the game is to catch a number of bad guys and stop their plans before it's too late. Deactivate in time the bombs stationed in various points of the city by Anarky, aka Lonnie Machine, find the weapons that Penguin has hidden before they end up on the black market, or block that crazy Riddler are just some of the tasks that Batman is called to complete. Staying on the subject of alternative missions, the crime scenes to investigate are more original, useful for varying the gameplay and for stimulating the player to rack his brains. In these sessions the detective skills of the superhero (and of the user) will find bread for their teeth: using a mix of technological gadgets and intuitions, the Dark Knight can save an informer to gain the sympathy of the police, try to rebuild a homicide through a real-time scan, or prevent it. And again, avoid a robbery and whatever else has happened or could still happen in a certain area, assuming the identity of the culprits and their modus operandi. Gathered the clues needed to identify the criminals, can then begin the manhunt on the streets of Gotham. Otherwise you can go to the Batcave. In Origins it has a fundamental role, as it not only acts as a game hub, for example allowing the masked hero to review the skills already unlocked, to wear alternative suits to the main one or interact with the butler of the Wayne house, Alfred. But also because it can act as a gym, given that it is completely explorable and interactive, and as a place for analyzing the clues gleaned. Thanks to the Bat-computer, the masked hero can in fact review, from various perspectives, the material collected at the scene of a crime, complete with a video simulation of the event reconstructed in slow-motion, for a 360-degree view of the tragic event. All in an environment extremely in line with the most recent cinematic incarnation of the Bat's adventures. Xbox 360 goals There are 50 achievements and 1000 player points to unlock in Batman: Arkham Origins. As always, they range from the most basic ones, which are obtained simply by progressing in the adventure, to those that require disabling an entire network of repeaters or deciphering a series of compromising data. Up to the more complex ones related perhaps to the improvement of fighting techniques or to the achievement of the maximum level in the path of Dark Knight, Shadow Vigilante or Protector of Gotham. The lost city While not a huge space, especially when compared to truly free roaming products, the Gotham of Origins is still freely explorable, about twice as large as that of its predecessor. Therefore, a rapid transport system has been implemented along the lines of those already seen in other games, using the Batwing in this case. To recall the half-wheeler, however, you must first deactivate the enemy towers that we guard the individual areas. Alternatively, the Dark Knight can always move quickly through the streets of the old and new city by taking advantage of the classic handholds to hang on, throwing himself from one point of a building to another, or jumping nimbly on the roofs. In these cases, the user is given the sensation of being on patrol in a real city, ready to intervene from above at any moment to stop the criminals. The latter, as per tradition, will certainly not welcome Batman with open arms. Once engaged in a fight with them, it is immediately evident that the combat system is similar to that of Arkham City, except for a couple of tweaks, such as the introduction of a monitoring system that evaluates the efficiency that the player has in battle. In other words, the product monitors the way it fights, the length of the combos or the fighting style it has adopted, then assigning it a vote and experience points. For the rest, the feeling with the controls of the previous productions has remained unchanged: there is the usual button used for shots, the one for dodging and gradually all the others. However, the clashes turn out to be quite varied thanks to the discreet artificial intelligence of the enemies and a diversification of their attack patterns, due in part to the presence of new opponents. Among these, those experts in martial arts stand out in particular, good at counterattacks, and the super-armored ones, very difficult to eliminate as they are immune to normal blows, and which must therefore first of all be ~stripped~ of their protections. In fact, at the more advanced levels, the clashes seemed more brutal than ever and sometimes with an uncertain outcome. Accomplice as apworth described, the level of general difficulty seemed to us to be calibrated a little higher than in the past. Instead, the approach in the boss fights varies a lot, which in some cases require you to be faced in violent one-on-one fights, made more spectacular by a very close shot and dedicated animations. The player's quick reflexes and the skillful use of counter-moves by the masked hero are decisive in these situations, often the only way to emerge victorious from the fight. In short, fun and choreographic like few others, these phases are full of possibilities and in some situations even challenging to master. In the most extreme cases, in addition to the gamer's skill, the special moves certainly make the difference in battle, which can be activated after a combination of appropriate keys and the occurrence of particular conditions, in addition to the Bat Man's gadgets. Alongside the classic ones such as smoke bombs, grappling hooks and explosive gel, just to name a few, there are also new ones such as gloves equipped with electric shocks or a sort of multifunctional Batclaw. The latter proves to be very useful as it allows Batman to simultaneously hook two targets, then making them crash into each other if they are human beings, or to grab a couple of objects to then throw at enemies. It can also be used to create connection points between two buildings, using the middle cable to move in balance. Batman and Robin To complete the picture of the offer proposed by Warner Bros Games Montreal there is an interesting multiplayer mode. This engages a total of eight users divided into three teams: a solution commissioned by Splash Damage, the English company specializing in the creation of additional maps for online that has taken care of the section, to create more varied dynamics within the scenarios to play. Two gamers impersonate Batman and Robin, while the remaining six are divided into two teams of three henchmen attributable to the figures of the super villains Joker and Bane. While the former have to land the enemies one after the other, weakening their morale until they retreat, moving, if desired, in the shadows and exploiting architectural elements such as the Gargoyles and the underground ducts to take their victims by surprise, the others have to worry about stay alive and hold as much territory as possible. Controls and modes for those who play as the two heroes do not differ much from the classic ones of the saga, with a mix of stealthy movements, careful use of gadgets and a few but lethal moves necessary to defeat the opponents. The question is very different for the gangs headed by Joker and Bane, whose members have to deal with third-person shooter gameplay strongly based on teamwork. Going from cover to cover, the small three-man teams have to watch their backs and find the right moment to empty their magazines against their opponents, while also trying to capture and defend the control points spread out on the map. In short, between a full-bodied single player mode and a fun multiplayer component, the longevity of the product is largely guaranteed. And once finished, you can always start the adventure again by choosing another difficulty level among the three available, or by selecting New Game + or I am the night. Moving on to analyze the technical part of the product, from a graphic point of view, the Xbox 360 version of Batman: Arkham Origins tested by us stands on the excellent quality standards found in Arkham City, without apparently losing performance despite the greater extension of the map. What is certain is that the timing of the adventure in a town wrapped in snow and tinged with the colors of Christmas lights helps to make the scenography special and very fascinating. Batman and his villains are made with great attention to detail, not only in the fidelity with which they are reproduced compared to the comics, but also in terms of the complexity of the textures. The cheesy enemies, on the other hand, are made in a slightly less refined way, even if to notice it, especially during the most chaotic fights, you need to be equipped with a scanner like the Bat Man. For its part, the audio component is excellent, with the Italian dubbing whose quality is confirmed on the standards of the previous episodes, and therefore can easily be compared to that of the localization of a cinematographic film. Finally, the sound effects are effective and the soundtrack is beautiful, which accurately accompanies the Bat Man in his determined march against the criminal", "date": "2013-10-25", "grade": "8.5"}
