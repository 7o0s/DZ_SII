More the second than the first, in truth: beyond the classic Tetris, in which it was necessary to fit a certain number of blocks and fill lines to continue the game, without worrying about the shades, there are many titles that have instead focused on color combination, from Columns to Puzzle Bobble. In Push Panic we have neither editable columns nor bubbles, however: in fact, square-shaped blocks, sometimes of variable dimensions, characterized by different colors, descend from the upper part of the screen. Our goal in each stage is to eliminate a certain number of these blocks, while trying to score as high as possible. The control system is based entirely on the touch screen and asks us to touch the blocks we want to ~mark~ (which are therefore visually ~marked~), and then touch them again when we want them to explode. Eliminating only two blocks will not produce many points, so we will have to try to connect many of them before proceeding with the elimination, possibly helping us with the score multipliers which will start to arrive at a certain point. Touch and run Push Panic offers four different modes, all to be tackled in single player. ~Classic Game~, the main mode, is made up of fifty stages of increasing difficulty, in each of which we have the task of eliminating a greater number of blocks. At the end of each internship, our performance is evaluated and we receive such recognition as to push us to subsequently retry the same challenge to overcome the established records. ~Score Panic~ is a ~survival~ type mode in which the game goes on to the bitter end and we simply have to try to get the highest score possible, then comparing ourselves with the global leaderboards and with the results of our friends via OpenFeint or Game Center . ~Color Panic~ applies changes to the basic gameplay, forcing us to eliminate only blocks of a single color, while ~Time Panic~ is the classic mode where we have a time limit and we have to try to reach a high score quickly. Unfortunately, an online multiplayer mode is missing and we hope it will be added by the developers in one of the next updates. The best would be to have a sort of split screen, with the possibility of downloading additional blocks into our opponent's box with each chained elimination. Anyone remember Puyo Puyo? The mechanisms that regulate the gameplay of Push Panic are certainly immediate and can count on the excellent responsiveness of the touch screen of the iPhone and iPod Touch, capable of accurately transposing every touch and allowing us to play even very quickly. What is missing a bit is the thickness, in the sense that with increasing difficulty the trivial strategy is evidently put aside in favor of speed and reflexes. Finally, ~extra~ blocks such as score multipliers, bombs or ~chains~ (useful for extending links to blocks of different colors) do not constitute a significant variant. The technical aspect of the game is very pleasant, with a simple but effective style, assisted by excellent color management. The ~physical~ context in which the blocks move is quite convincing and gives its best when we detonate a bomb, with the surviving bricks showing evident cracks. The action is accompanied by a functional sound, which unfortunately does not leave its mark. The tested version is 1.0.1 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2010-12-08", "grade": "8.0"}
