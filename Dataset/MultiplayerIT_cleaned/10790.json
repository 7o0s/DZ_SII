{"name": "Naruto Ninja Destiny II - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ninja-destiny-ii-recensione.html", "text": "The epic deeds of Naruto return once again on Nintendo DS: it is evidently a lively period full of surprises for all lovers of the Japanese saga, after the latest releases on all new generation consoles and portables. For the small Nintendo console it is the second chapter arriving on European territory in a short distance: it is Ninja Destiny 2, a game that offers an unprecedented storyline compared to the animated series and the manga, a rich selection of characters and a top-notch graphic sector level. Dattebayo! (Naruto) The care placed in the artistic sector is noted since the appearance of the main game menu, colorful and animated like a cartoon. The amount of options and modes doesn't make you cry for a miracle, however; there is no real Arcade-style challenge, as any good self-respecting fighting game should offer. For the single player there are only two options: Vs CPU, in which after choosing the characters and the stage a fight begins, or survival, which sees us tested in an endurance match match after match, in an attempt to establish the record of opponents beaten without ever dying. However, the heart of the playful experience offered by this new Naruto chapter is represented by the story, whose plot is totally original compared to the series and starts from the Leaf Village and then unfolds in a fairly simple and banal adventure, with a plot without too many twists and turns. scene and emotions: after the defeat inflicted by his ex-friend Sasuke, Naruto leaves the village trying to improve his fighting techniques by teaming up with other Ninja masters. Both Nintendo DS screens are used: the upper one is delegated to represent the play area, with an isometric bird's-eye view, entirely 3D, while the underlying screen houses up to six ~macros~, or keys touch-screens that activate various functions and special items such as energy recovery, some combos, shurikens and so on. In a lower right corner of the upper screen, a small map of the area appears indicating our position and the point to reach. Perhaps this last option makes the exploration of the game areas a rather useless action, as it is difficult to go far from the path that leads to the goal; it is human nature to save time, if this is possible, and with the right path in front of your eyes the exploratory element is reduced to a minimum. It is evident that the target to which Ninja Destiny 2 is thought is purely the pre-adolescent one. Your eyes belong to me! The story is narrated through pleasant anime-style cut-scenes, with a text entirely in Italian and well adapted. The plot serves as a pretext for us to face a series of fights that unfold between one dialogue and another, facing about thirty characters from the anime, with some surprises. Once the main story is finished, an option called ~Mission~ is unlocked from the menu, through which we can go through a series of dungeons as if we were in a sort of RPG with level ups, items and statistics. These are mostly bonus mini-games that are given as a reward once the main ~quest~ is finished. The ~RPG-like~ setting is also maintained in story mode, to some extent. Once the village has been abandoned, the game map becomes decidedly wider and we see the infamous random encounters, typical of every classic Jrpg production. After a while the clashes become more and more insistent and frequent, and since the enemies are more or less the same (the ninja-bandits), the random factor of the encounters starts to get boring after a while. The fighting game mechanics follow what has already been seen in Clash of Ninja and other home console titles: fast, frantic matches full of moves and combos. The configuration of the keys, however, makes the action more cumbersome and difficult to manage as the mapping of the jump and parry is decidedly out of place. The jump is made by pressing the X key (rather than the up arrow of the directional cross), while the block is the backbone R. The special moves, which can be activated after having accumulated enough chakra energy, are all too simple to perform and many they aren't even very spectacular. Moreover, in the event of an enemy attack, these cannot be avoided or stopped because they are not anticipated by any animation, sound or graphic effect. Where the leaf dances, the fire burns The technical sector is much above the average of what has already been seen on DS in titles of the same genre. The nice cel-shaded style is well suited to the small screen of the Nintendo laptop, and the fights are impressiveenhanced by numerous graphic effects, transparencies, explosions, particles, fire, water and much more. The animations, excellent, follow the episodes already appreciated on the most powerful consoles. The real Achilles' heel are the backgrounds, all in bitmaps and not very inspired. During the exploratory sessions, however, the excellent polygonal models of the village and the environments are appreciated, built with great detail and many elements on the screen. The animation of the character, in these gameplay segments, however, needs to be reviewed as it is too jerky and mechanical: while enjoying entirely 3D graphics, moreover rotatable at will by pressing the L and R backbones, Naruto seems to run only in the four cardinal directions, with no animations in between. The audio part is very accurate and also boasts original voices taken from the anime, numerous effects and clear and well-sampled sounds. The musical accompaniment is not very varied, but does its duty by giving the game an oriental and manga-like atmosphere. Fortunately, there is a versus combat mode that uses the Nintendo DS wireless, to challenge a friend of ours close to us, but it is not possible to go online with the Wi-Fi Connection. The possibility of being able to choose one of the Hokage characters is also excellent: the cast of Naruto Ninja Destiny 2 is truly complete.", "date": "2009-03-28", "grade": "5.5"}
