Developed by Studio Fizbin, Minute of Islands was awarded an honorable mention in the Excellence in Visual Arts 2020 category at the last Independent Games Festival. What we found ourselves facing is therefore a very inspired game that embodies many interesting aspects. For example, a solid narrative component stands out that wants to lead the player to reflect on numerous aspects, through the metaphor of the world. narrative and interpretation Minutes of Islands: the suggestive setting Let's start from the narrative incipit: you will take on the role of Mo, a young but expert repairman (mechanic if you prefer) who has the task of maintaining and repairing gigantic machines belonging to an ancient civilization that inhabited the archipelago in which the game. A dark threat lurks in the depths of the sea and we will have to find out the truth about what happened in those islands, about Mo's past and about the weight that weighs on the young woman's shoulders. Between a mystery, a pinch of horror sauce and a strong emotional component, the game passes by quickly, with a rhythm of its own that captivates the most reflective minds and tries to conquer even those who are often doubtful in front of the more narrative works. The choice is in fact that of a game with two faces: on the one hand the narrative and on the other the artistic style. As for the first point, the story that revolves around Mo's abilities and tasks to restore the giants and protecting the archipelago from the toxic cloud, offers several clear ideas through a direct narration but also tries to tell numerous stories through an indirect and silent narration that only the gaze on the setting can notice. Minute of Islands: Mo on his boat On the other hand, however, an artistic style that pushes the most extreme points of the contour outlined by the cartoonish features of the game towards different shores including horror. Mind you, these are not scares, it is not the claustrophobic anxiety of a haunted house, but being in front of a crude and no-frills painting, unsweetened situations based on the player's awareness that that place hides greater crimes and faults than you might think. Both of these aspects are then supported by the strong characterization of the few really important characters. Mo, is then at the center of a particular psychological study based on suggestive interludes that lead the player to interpret what is seen. The thin thread that holds the reins of the work is this constant desire to make the player reflect on situations or themes that are not universally interpretable in a defined way. It will therefore be the user who chooses the nuances of the title, emotional traits that we have hardly found ourselves facing in a game in recent times. Accessory gameplay Minute of Islands: the exploration of the archipelago The gameplay in this sense is just a tinsel, a playful addition to a narrative adventure that refers to the canons of the genre using small puzzles here and there, interactive moments with quick time events and exploration sections of the setting. The gameplay is therefore really an appendix of the work that takes its time. A time that in the direct narration runs against the urgent end that awaits Mo and the archipelago if the giants don't work again, but that in the indirect narration supported by shots and moments of gameplay expands this time, leaving the player the pleasure of discovering and interpret.It took about five hours to complete the Studio Fizbin adventure, including missions and collectibles (we suggest you do not leave them behind as they are very important for understanding some plot elements). Even on a musical level, the game tries to support the narrative in the best possible way. The silence of the Archipelago is broken by some pressing sounds that remind the player of the adventurous nature of the short journey undertaken. Minutes of Islands: Mo meets a shady character Precisely this previously mentioned linearity somehow left us with a bitter aftertaste. The game is in fact completely based on travel and narration but does not exploit certain moments or possible handholds to try to divert the player from a well-defined choice. The strength of the interpretation of certain choices, signals or moments is less in others in which the phantom hand of the developer feels preponderant. A gameplay perhaps more varied in situations and decision-making crossroads would have sharpened some commendable aspects of the work, going to mask a lineartoo much basic ity.", "date": "2021-07-04", "grade": "7.8"}
