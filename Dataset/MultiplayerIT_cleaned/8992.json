{"name": "Disney Universe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94847-disney-universe-salviamo-luniverso-disney.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360Disney Interactive, as we know, is a planetary super-power in terms of licenses and franchises related to entertainment, especially cinema, many famous names capable of moving millions of fans who have also gradually been inconvenienced in the videogame field. The usual strategy is that of the tie-in, or the game linked to a particular event belonging to another media environment, in this case a cinematic film: the new Disney or Pixar animated film comes out, or the film with real actors produced by Buena Vista, and here the appropriate video game responds on the videogame level, which moreover hardly reaches memorable qualitative results, but this is another matter. Disney Universe, on the other hand, starts from a different assumption, and this already puts us in a different attitude compared to the usual evaluation of the ~game based on~ which very often raises eyebrows, twists mouths and curls noses regardless. This new Disney Interactive production, on the other hand, was born first of all as a video game, certainly focused on well-known driving elements such as settings and famous characters from the Disney universe, as the title itself specifies, but starting from an independent and mainly playful design, not bent on needs narrative and structural dictated by the need to remain faithful to a brand that naturally belongs to another sphere of multimedia entertainment. In short, unlike what often happens with tie-ins, Disney Universe immediately appears as a real game, designed to amuse and thrill first of all thanks to the gameplay itself, where the elements taken from the various high-sounding licenses are indeed characterizing but more of a side dish, rather than fundamental props on which to build the entire scaffolding of the product. It is a game obviously aimed at a very young audience and we must take this into account in the evaluation, but which lends itself, by virtue of its predisposition to multiplayer, to being enjoyed perhaps by adults and children all together, without boring (not too much , at least) none. A universe in danger The basic concept is very simple and rather closely resembles the various titles in the LEGO series, inspired by the various film sagas reinterpreted in the manner of TT Games. A maximum of 4 players simultaneously find themselves moving within various worlds based on some of the major Disney productions (Alice, Pirates of the Caribbean, Nightmare Before Christmas, The Lion King, Tron and many others, expandable with DLC), trying to solving pretty basic puzzles to reach the exit of the levels while clearing the zones of enemies. What was supposed to be a sort of Disney-themed virtual amusement park is in fact disrupted by a sort of virus that takes control of the animatronics and various creatures, causing a general upheaval in the peaceful thematic worlds and obviously it's up to the players to put things back on track. place. Each world is based on a classic Disney production and is made up of a series of levels with progressive difficulty, with the possibility of unlocking further worlds by gradually investing the points collected in the game and being able to tackle them, once made accessible, in any order you wish . The game is set up as an action game seen from above with rather elementary but numerous platform and puzzle elements with variable difficulty, with the possibility of moving the character, making him jump, carrying and using objects and attacking with the use of various weapons. usually ~melee~. The main purpose is usually represented by reaching the exit, but special objectives such as saving characters or killing particularly difficult enemies may also appear. The puzzles usually refer to the movement of objects from one place to another, connected to the need to activate levers and switches to reach otherwise precluded parts of the scenario, all obviously also having to do with the various threats present for the levels, from enemies to traps up to natural obstacles. In each environment it is also possible to try to achieve secondary objectives such as collecting a given number of hidden objects, upgrading your costume from level to level or participating in mini-games of various types, while trying to collect as many points as possible from spend to unlock new worlds and avatar customization possibilities. Another simplifying element - probably chosen to help the little ones - is the absence of the ~death~ of the characters, who, when they suffer too many blows, limit themselves to falling to the ground, losing a certain amount of pointsand calmly restart a few centimeters from the elimination area. Group missions Disney Universe is a game to be played in company, this is very clear from the setting given by the developers: after choosing the world in which to act, the character selection screen already shows 4 positions to fill, as if to demonstrate that the predisposition 4-player multiplayer is a natural part of the game. Obviously, you can also enter the game alone, but it is clear how the fun is amplified by the presence of other players capable of multiplying game situations and reviving the action, allowing both to collaborate than to hinder each other, complete with friendly fire and the possibility of stealing bonus points that lead to real fratricidal wars. The level design itself, albeit simple, suggests greater possibilities for multiplayer fun, displacing puzzles in various areas of the levels and often requiring different actions to be performed possibly simultaneously, with a possible division of roles between the various players which determines greater variety of the action. For all these reasons, the absence of online multiplayer represents a notable lack of possibilities for using Disney Universe, which, based only on offline multiplayer, is configured in the same way as a party game, good to bring out in the presence of friends but not very enjoyable otherwise . It is clear that the intent of the developers was to provide a ~party~ game, even looking at the scoring system that decrees the winning player at the end of each level complete with a podium and celebrations. Another ~party~ element is the personalization of one's avatars: all the characters are almost the same but (like the sackboys of LittleBigPlanet) they can be modified with costumes inspired by the various Disney classics, with generally hilarious results. Xbox 360 goals 40 objectives for a total of 1000 points are scattered among the Disney worlds, unlockable by completing levels or generally by achieving certain performances within the game, even by counting the various results obtained in different games. Some achievements require a very particular commitment, but many are unlocked with a certain ease, making this Disney Universe a rather generous title in terms of giving points. So this is Disney Production that is not exactly avant-garde from a technical point of view is another symptom of the childish or semi-casual direction that characterizes the game in question. The cartoonish graphics are pleasant, colorful and humorous but the style proves to be rather flat, despite the certainly not lacking sources of inspiration, drawing from a practically infinite reserve of ideas and creations with a strong evocative and iconic power such as Disney film productions . To tell the truth, if it weren't for the official names used and some typical elements scattered here and there, the link with the high-sounding films that characterize the settings of the game would not even be seen that much, which seems a bit of a waste of resources, having flattened the graphic elements to a different style than the typical traits of the various Disney productions that are touched in the worlds. However, there is a certain coherence in the choice made: the chosen graphic style manages to blend the gaming experience well, maintaining a well-recognizable basic system and in which the characters integrate perfectly, inserting the elements time after time. typical of the various worlds, which in this way do not dominate the chosen style but partially modify it. We are certainly not dealing with a creative elaboration of the caliber of Epic Mickey, to give a close example, rather a functional choice, which sacrifices inspiration in favor of an overall simplicity which favors movement within the scenarios and the instant identification of interactable objects and active elements in puzzles. Certainly the repetition of the elements is evident by remaining for a long time within the same world, but one cannot complain about the net variation that distinguishes one scenario from another in the various game worlds. Something to fix, however, is found on the front of the controls, above all due to a type of shot that sometimes fails to give a precise idea of the distances and directions to take, especially in correspondence with jumps.", "date": "2011-10-27", "grade": "6.8"}
