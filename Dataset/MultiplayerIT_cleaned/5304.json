After the twenty-year milestone, Konami football continues along the main road traced by the adoption of the Fox Engine which marked a big turning point for the now stagnant franchise, reinvigorating its gameplay and aesthetics with the approval of the players who year after year have shown to appreciate more and more the new course of the Japanese title. Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 is therefore called upon to confirm its positive trend, but also to redeem the missteps made by its predecessor, first of all a very infrequent support for squad and player updates. On the other hand, with the coming season, the Japanese developer has also introduced a whole series of innovations regarding gameplay and team management, even the opposing one, by redesigning the algorithms under the command of artificial intelligence and demonstrating how prolonged development on the new graphics engine leads year after year to an ever better knowledge of the means to achieve results that were unexpected until a few years ago. It is very important to point out before proceeding with the review that during the processing we were unable to verify the quality of the online sector and the actual consistency of the day one patch. In fact, both contents are not yet available but we will take care to analyze them properly in the coming days with dedicated insights and contents. Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 features improvements in terms of gameplay and team tactics The season begins There are many challenges that the development team is called to face this year given the bad management choices for patches and updates that characterized the first months of life of the previous chapter. From the referees who seemed to have forgotten their whistle in the locker room, to the latest transfers that took unjustified months to implement. Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 will still arrive in stores with rosters on disk to be updated with the Day One patch available from September 15, but Konami has long announced the presence of constant weekly updates of rosters and player values to make it as faithful as possible its virtual football to real counterpart. Also because this year there have been several improvements in terms of gameplay, all aimed at adding more depth to an always fun and immediate football simulation. Once on the playing field, a few touches of the ball were enough to immediately become familiar with the ~Real Touch~, i.e. the system that, using the left analog stick, allows you to manage the player's movement even before receiving the ball, to anticipate the marker and have greater freedom of movement and maneuver setting. The next step is to use the stick coupled with R1 for the ~First Touch Control~ to perform first touches to be used to suddenly change direction or to place the ball on a teammate and launch in speed with a one-two. Each player will have his own way of moving and handling the ball based on his physical characteristics and abilities, but also with respect to his position on the field and the commands we decide to give. Whether it's controlling Cristiano Ronaldo or a less famous colleague of his, PES 2017 returns a very convincing ball-and-chain feeling especially for plays in tight spaces and for building a dense network of passes, also thanks to the pace of play generally slower than last year's. The merit as well as the fine and precise control system is also the large amount of animations that have been added to further expand the variety of situations that can be seen on the playing field. The result is a remarkable fluidity made possible by the smooth movements of the players who transition seamlessly from one animation to another. Dribbling, shifting the center of gravity, feints, shots, crosses and deep passes give the feeling of having full control over the players, shifting the balance of the gameplay towards the skill of the players, pad in hand, thanks above all to the very accurate ball physics which makes it particularly important to impart the right force and direction to the ball. In this sense, it will be even more important to exploit the peculiarities of individual players by avoiding engaging in complex plays with awkward players or attempting to shoot in depth by controlling the taller and heavier forwards. The goalkeepers also enjoyed a good number of di new animations, aimed above all at increasing their quality and reliability. In practice, we notice a greater variety in the outings, a more careful positioning with the tendency not to leave the posts prematurely to give away scoring chances, even if it happened that some rejected ones ended up comfortably on the feet of the attackers for an easy tap- in. The importance of the team The feeling with the game system has convinced us and the management of the team is no less thanks to the great customization freedom left by Konami. First of all, adaptive artificial intelligence makes its debut in Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 which allows the CPU to gradually adapt to our style of play by intervening accordingly to exploit the weak points of our defense or to defuse the most dangerous offensive weapons. For example, if we opt for the central breakthrough by repeatedly passing the ball to the most talented player, the opponents will start to double it, while if we prefer long balls on the wings they will tend to widen the defense shirts to better cover the side lanes. Each strategy has pros and cons, but such a reactive and always well-disposed computer forces the highest levels of difficulty to change their tactical approach countless times during the match, for an always challenging level of challenge. Through the appropriate menu we can select up to four advanced instructions, two in attack and two in defense, to be applied during the game. We can use the tiki-taka to build a dense network of passes with the teammates who will meet the ball, or we can bet everything on quick counterattacks or on the game on the flanks, while in defense we can aim to tighten the markings on the ball carrier or concentrate on penalty area defense. In addition, we have the possibility to choose the level of aggression of the team to intervene on the center of gravity of the formation, bringing it to close in its own half to defend the result strenuously or to pour it towards the opponent's goal for a more effective offensive. The extreme ratio will be to bring all the players into attack, with the possibility of also bringing the goalkeeper up into the opponent's penalty area in the event of a last minute free kick or corner kick. Speaking of full-flag shots, Konami has introduced a handful of tactics to try and get the most out of our playstyle and lineup. By pressing the left arrow of the directional cross you have access to four quick strategies of immediate implementation: for the attack it is possible to make the rooks enter the run from outside the area, bring all the players inside, place them on the far post, or keep the more classic configuration with six players in the area and the others in tow. In defense, however, there are man or zonal markings. During the match, the players' behavior on the pitch significantly changes and manages to create more interesting situations than in the past, it being understood that once the tactic has been decided, it is then up to us to direct the ball with the right trajectory and power. A lot of freedom therefore, but the great quality of Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 is that thanks to the adaptive artificial intelligence mentioned above, it will be above all the opponents controlled by the CPU who will use all the tools at their disposal properly, adapting to the situation: if, for example, they are advantage with a weaker team than ours, in the final minutes they will stall near the flag, or on the contrary if we are playing a qualification for the Champions League they will not hesitate to bring everyone in attack and try everything. Barca mania One of the most historically discussed topics related to Pro Evolution Soccer is licensing. PES 2017 bets everything on Barcelona by offering the most in-depth experience possible thanks to the exclusive partnership signed with the Catalan club which allowed them to bring the stadium, logos and official kits into the game as well as having exclusive access to the players to best reproduce them on the pitch from play. The immediately most important aspect is the return of the Camp Nou, present exclusively in PES 2017. Against the Premium Club status, the Camp Nou has been recreated in the smallest details, not only as regards the exterior and the stands, but also for the neighborhood that rises around it framed with an aerial shot during the presentation of the match. The work continues inside where we find fans inflamed by their favorite team who sing the Blaugrana anthem at the top of their lungs as the players arrive, animate the stands with spectacular choreographies and make themselves heard throughout the match with chants and cheers addressed to the favorites most representedtherein, Messi and Iniesta above all. The players respond with a superfine technical realization made possible thanks to 3D photographic scans of the players' faces, particularly appreciable especially during celebrations and replays. Here the detachment from the players of the other clubs is evident: a match with Bara is enough to realize the better visual rendering of expressions and somatic features compared to high-profile players who are in any case very well made but lack that realism possible thanks to the scanning facial. In the same way, the most used tactics are re-proposed for Barcelona such as the tiki-taka typical of the Catalan team which will give its best in building a dense network of passes to reach the net, but obviously all the other strategies remain available as well to be selected in the appropriate menu if you prefer a more inclined approach to lateral insertions or playing on the wings. There will also be a whole host of special content for the modes, such as historical kits and past glories of the likes of Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Puyol and Xavi to be used as Legends in MyClub. Playstation 4 trophies PES 2017 offers 41 trophies, divided into 2 Golds, 12 Silvers and 26 Bronzes and the ever-present Platinum. First of all there are those related to training, with the tests that must be passed at least with a silver rating, and then you will have to spend several hours in the Master League and in Become a Legend to go on to win in the various championships around the world. You go online with the MyClub mode and the Divisions to climb to the sound of victories against other players. Problem licenses The counterbalance to such an accurate experience with Bara is the loss of many other licenses which probably place PES 2017 among the titles with the least official teams in the last period. In fact, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are the only ones who are saved in a Spanish league that is no longer licensed, which therefore sees the remaining eighteen teams and those of the Spanish Serie B bring totally invented names, as well as logos and uniforms. Italy is doing a little better, which although it does not have the official Serie A license presents all the teams faithfully reproduced except for the usual Sassuolo which has become Sansagiulo to which is added Juventus which has turned into PM Black White. The departure of the Campione d'Italia team is a heavy blow given that it also brings with it the Juventus Stadium, one of the few officially licensed stadiums that appeared in the last edition of Pro Evolution Soccer. Like last year, Serie B is also totally free of licenses. The Argentine, Chilean, Brazilian, Dutch (Eredivisie), French (Ligue 1 and Ligue 2) championships are saved, with a predominance of official South American clubs over European ones. Arsenal and Liverpool remain in the two divisions of the English league, while for Portugal there are SL Benfica and Sporting Lisbon. The Bundesliga is missing, with only Bayern Levercusen, Borussia Dortmund and FC Schalke 04 representing the German championship, to which are added the other European teams Club Brugge, Dinamo Zagreb, CSKA Moscow, FC Basel, Besiktas and Dinamo Kiev. In this panorama, the one that comes out most penalized is the UEFA Champions League license, with fewer and fewer official clubs taking part to the detriment of the show. In addition to Juventus, unfortunately Bayern Munich is also missing, a very precious piece among the European teams vying for the final victory. If we add to all this the lack of licenses for other big names such as Real Madrid, Seville, Manchester City, Porto, Tottenham and Leicester, the Champions league unexpectedly loses its appeal. The stadium issue is also critical, first of all the lack of the National Stadium of Wales in Cardiff which will host the 2017 UEFA Champions League final. couple of others, but in the majority of cases this year too we will find ourselves treading the playing field of the Konami Stadium too many times. Compared to last year, the Copa Sudamericana and the Copa Libertadores with the related participating teams are also missing, while the AFC, the Asian Champions League, survives. On Konami's part, therefore, the situation is not the most rosy, but we must remember the presence of the editor and the possibility of sharing the modification data with other users equipped with PlayStation 4, who will be able to indulge themselves in the creation of uniforms, logos and stadiums official to then share with the rest of the community. Fox Engine in great shape The park of modes is almost unchanged compared to the high years, with the Master League and Become a Legend to be the masters in terms of offline content", "date": "2016-09-13", "grade": "8.5"}
