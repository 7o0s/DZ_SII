And it's definitely not the plot, practically specious, and it's certainly not the characters, whose life, death and miracles we know. The first Game Boy Advance installment, Superstar Saga, was critically acclaimed for the brilliance of its situations and for how it almost reinvented a genre, staying true to the bouncing and deeply interactive nature of video games but also to the narrative and relaxed nature of RPGs Japanese. The second episode, Partners in Time, on the Nintendo DS clearly decreed that the change in hardware would not disrupt the franchise, if anything, it would expand its possibilities. But producing a third chapter without becoming trivial and redundant was a delicate operation: we are happy to be amazed and damned satisfied. Koopa's Anatomy Again the story is very simple, yet absolutely well written, absurd and hilarious. We find our beloved moustachioed Bros. in the presence of Princess Peach during a really important meeting: the Mushroom Kingdom is in fact devastated by a sort of disease that magnifies and swells the poor inhabitants. Even Dorastella, a rather talkative stellar spirit, is unsure of what to do and to make matters worse Bowser also gets involved, only this time the hysterical Koopa has ingested a mushroom that allows him to suck up everyone in an instant. Once his eternal rivals have been eliminated, the moment of victory would finally seem to have come... and instead, Bowser was only a pawn of the evil Lord Grin who gets rid of our favorite fire-breathing, exiles him and conquers his castle. Fortunately, however, Mario and Luigi are alive and well in Bowser's, ahem, intestines: thus begins a parallel journey that is nothing short of hallucinating in which the two brothers will secretly help Bowser from the inside, while looking for a way out and a solution to this little problem. The characters converse with each other through balloons typical of comics, carrying on the narration with sparkling and unpredictable dialogues, translated into excellent Italian: most of the exchanges often become hilarious bickering, the situations involving them are so surreal as to tear more than one laugh, and in all this there is no shortage of gags in which the two brothers are the protagonists, especially Luigi. From this point of view, the technical sobriety of Bowser's Journey to the Center goes completely into the background: graphically the AlphaDream product is without infamy or praise, it offers an honest and very clean 2D that focuses especially on detailed, colorful and excellently animated sprites. Some locations are indeed a bit bare, but the variety of settings proposed is remarkable. The soundtrack is also excellent, a compilation of catchy and typically ~Marieschi~ songs that make the experience even more enjoyable. Leap in the dark The very pleasant plot triggers a series of playful situations in perfect balance between reflection and action. Puzzles and combat are balanced in both game ~worlds~: Bowser will have to use flames and brute strength to make his way through forests and rocks in an isometric view, for example, while inside Mario and Luigi will use their jumping skills, the traditional hammers and a whole series of techniques that cross their powers to proceed in the labyrinthine body like a platform, solving various puzzles and riddles. Often and willingly it will be necessary to combine internal and external situations, for example by making Bowser drink to fill the area where Mario and Luigi are located with water, allowing them to swim and reach previously inaccessible points. In all this, the traditional component of RPGs is not missing, the fights, but we are not limited to giving orders and observing their progress since in Bowser's Inside Journey the battles are interactive, forcing the player to keep his eyes firmly on the screen to act and react; in addition, fortunately, the fights are neither random nor too frequent, making exploration anything but frustrating. Our heroes' attacks often involve timing button presses at just the right time to deal more damage or prolong the assault; enemies on the other hand have abilities that require you to press buttons at the right time to be prevented. To these basic rules are added the peculiar special techniques of the three protagonists, made almost like mini-games that involve the use of the touch-screen or rhythmic pressuresof the keys, and the further novelty of the ~pins~ which, combined between the two brothers, trigger various bonuses during battles. Finally, the extraordinary battles of giant Bowser deserve mention, which pay homage to the mythical Godzilla films: in these cases you even have to rotate the Nintendo DS 90 degrees to fight in gargantuan battles to say the least!", "date": "2009-10-19", "grade": "9.3"}
