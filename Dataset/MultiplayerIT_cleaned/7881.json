{"name": "Un nuovo Jurassico", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/117722-orion-dino-horde-un-nuovo-jurassico.html", "text": "A year ago the independent developer Spiral Games offered the public the reviled ORION: Dino Beatdown, massacred by critics and the public for an endless list of bugs that betrayed an exaggeratedly embryonic state. Well that game no longer exists, since with the latest update-expansion-sequel it even changed its name, turning into ORION: Dino Horde. The positive news is that the daredevils who had let themselves be captivated by the dinosaurs on the cover will be able to take advantage of the improvements made by the patch without being forced to pay out the  10.99 necessary for the purchase on Steam again. The change of name born from the diabolical mind of David Prassel, deus ex machina of Spiral, is the son of the catastrophic reputation attributed to Beatdown by the by now unquestionable Metacritic: in fact it would have been difficult to revive the fate of a title whose average score (which, moreover, our Simone Tagliaferri had contributed to lowering) stands at 36/100. Mission failed, since the popular aggregation site has decided to maintain the evaluation of the initial project simply by changing the name of the game: a choice that, in the light of what we were able to try, seemed sensible to us. Dino Horde represents neither a new game nor what Beatdown would have wanted/should have been at the time of launch, but an intermediate step towards what one hopes will become a final and less approximate version (it seems that the software house has the next Dino Prelude). However, the work of the developers is commendable, considering the amount of improvements and innovations introduced, of which we will try to give a brief overview. First of all there are four new game modes, which are added to the hypnotic Survival, the hard core of the entire production whose mechanics, although refined with the patch, remain fundamentally those described in our review from a year ago. New ways to hurt yourself The most particular is called T-Rex Rampage and takes some cues from the rival title Primal Carnage: five players have to contend with a Tyrannosaurus controlled by a sixth user, with the aim of stealing three eggs from the lizard's nest and bringing them back to a safe area. Who controls the beast will be able to regenerate their health by eating velociraptors or human attackers, and will not have to worry about the other dinosaurs on the map. The rest concern PvP and, although they are called in different ways, they reflect three variants of the classic deathmatch and capture the flag. Rocketeer (intended only for stormtroopers) is a free-for-all in which the main weapons used are grenade launchers and missile launchers with the option of wearing jetpacks to carry attacks from above; Ninja Nippers (where only scouts can be used) sees two opposing teams and favors surgical and reasoned actions, favored by the possibility of wearing invisible suits and holding rifles capable of killing with a single shot; Dude Huge (limited to support classes) is finally the classic capture the flag. It should be noted that in any case the players will have to continue to contend even with the swarms of dinosaurs that enliven the action a bit, otherwise limited to a maximum of ten people. Despite the goodwill of the programmers, it certainly cannot be said that the public has warmly welcomed these variants (apart perhaps from the T-Rex Rampage), considering that - understandably - the few game rooms continue to host above all Survival. The appeal of the competitive mode is too low, especially considering the alternatives, often even free, offered by the market. The changelog continues with the addition of six new dinosaur models that add up to the three of Beatdown: therefore, waiting for the players in the arenas there will also be the minute compsognati, the robust triceratops, the stegosaurs, the dilophosaurs, the boring pterodonts and the deadly spinosaurs. Although the fauna of ORION: Dino Horde is now decidedly better assorted, it is unfortunately still affected by the disease of bad animations: with the exception of the smallest and fastest specimens, in fact, the reptilians continue to move in a very woody and far from natural way . Also fleshed out the arsenal with the addition of eight new weapons and two combat vehicles. Finally, additions also on the front of the maps, the total number of which rises to seven. The improvements are tangible almost everywhere, but starting from the poverty of the original content, it wasn't that difficult to do better. Unfortunately, however, the efforts made by the designers have not yet been sufficient to guarantee a decent gaming experience: several bugs, especially in terms of graphics, have disappeared, but remainSome cracks in the net-code which, although revised and corrected, still suffers from fluctuating slowdowns and in some sporadic cases leads to being expelled for no apparent reason from the game lobbies. In the same way, from time to time there are interpenetrations of polygons in which the player gets stuck at the mercy of the hordes of enemies: in these cases, to continue the game, the only hope is to be lifted by a pterodactyl, otherwise all that remains is to leave kill to be returned to the battlefield on the next turn. Prehistoric graphics? From a graphic point of view we are faced with a cheesy title, especially when compared to today's standards, embellished only by a good realization of the dinosaurs (even if the usual deep gorges claim they were ~too~ inspired by those of the aforementioned Primal Carnage) and from a frame rate which, when everything works properly, is at good levels. The models of weapons, vehicles and players, all too anonymous, are decidedly devoid of bite. The level design does not always live up to expectations: some arenas are well structured, while others seem thrown away just to make up the number. Certainly textures and environmental effects do not fall within the category of those that make your hair tear and indeed on more than one occasion we have had the doubt of having launched a mod for the 2004 version of Unreal Tournament rather than a stand-alone title developed on the latest release of the famous Epic engine. The soundtrack rises from mediocrity, well done, while the effects seem to be recovered at best from some other B-series production. At this point it should be clear that not even in this new reincarnation the work of Spiral Games deserves to be be taken into great consideration. The new modes don't add much to the experience of a title that remains content-poor. A greater effort could have been made by enriching the single player offer, which remains absolutely useless considering the lack of bots, or by further refining the mechanics of the survival mode which, to be honest, has been able to create a niche of loyalists who will be happy that you can get your hands on the update. Instead, we advise all the other players to wait for the next releases (Prassel has promised two free DLCs for the summer and updates every two weeks) which could allow ORION: Dino Horde to pass the sufficiency bar, which at the moment still seems difficult to reach.", "date": "2013-04-23", "grade": "5.0"}
