{"name": "Nella Tana delle Tigri!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81605-ea-sports-mma-nella-tana-delle-tigri.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360Often some video games fail to find such a large appeal in our continent as to be able to create an audience as vast as our national sports. This is the case of very popular sports in the USA or Japan, such as Baseball (not even distributed by us) or American Football, which sells a few hundred pieces throughout the boot even in spite of the very high quality of those productions. Even basketball games, despite being quite popular here, are struggling to take off and find no space on the shelves. Today we're talking about a sport that is just as famous abroad as it is decidedly little known by us: MMA, the acronym of Mixed Martial Arts, is a relatively new discipline that is rapidly expanding all over the world. No confusion with the better known UFC, K1, Pride or Dream, which represent only some of the most famous professional leagues in the world with dozens of different variants, federations and rules: MMA is a large generic container that implies all those disciplines based on mixed martial arts, but also has a life of its own with a company behind it and very specific rules. In MMA you fight standing and on the ground with the use of grappling techniques (brought to the ground, chokes, joint locks) and striking techniques (punches, kicks, elbows, knees), allowing athletes of different martial arts/sports to fighting to compete with each other. Lonely in the night goes... Electronic Arts took a large number of the best and most famous fighters in the world (Emelianenko, The Beast, Randy Couture, Shamrock, King Mo, but also the Japanese Kawajiri, Aoki and Yoshida, just to name a few), took the rules base of the sport allowing some variations to the player, and mixed everything in the most famous and beautiful arenas in the world. MMA is the summa of sports based on martial arts. Directing the review to the general public, for the most part unrelated to MMA techniques and technicalities, we focus our attention on the general feeling of the game and the fun that derives from it, with an eye to the atmosphere that the EA simulation transmits to the player who can affect his identification in the fighting ring so much. We leave behind controversy or discussions on the presence or absence of exchanges during matches, and focus on the raw gameplay. MMA includes basic Pride rules and unified general rules. Hits of any kind are therefore allowed: the philosophy that distinguishes MMA is that of allowing the contenders any form of technique with a minimum limitation aimed at safeguarding them. In Pride you can do almost anything (even kicking your opponent to the ground). The matches end with the opponent's knock-out or surrender, for this reason the knockdowns are a fundamental part of the game: once on the ground, you conquer a predominant position over the opponent and you can try to defeat him through joint constraints (with the pressure of specific keys), or by striking repeatedly with kicks and punches, until surrender. One of the improved aspects, compared to the demo released some time ago, is that of being able to avoid a knockdown with a key dedicated to dodging. But vice versa it is not yet clear how the defense mechanisms work once on the ground, as during the adversary attack it is really difficult and complicated to defend oneself adequately. While the indication to repeatedly press the red button ~B~ appears on the screen, in the ring we are beaten to death with no possibility of counter-move or defense. If it's not a bug, or a manifest inability to defend yourself, we are certainly dealing with an unclear concept of the game that inevitably leads to ~game over~ within a few seconds. Out of the ring The UFC league, linked to the developer THQ for years by contract, initially hindered Electronic Arts in creating a ~parallel~ game that would attract the attention of fans outside its circuit, threatening many of its fighters who had lent their faces to the EA game to be kicked out of the league. UFC president Dana White has openly declared himself ~at war~ with the American giant Electronic Arts, most likely after the software house's denial of wanting to develop a new UFC chapter in place of THQ. The three stages of combat The fundamental gameplay of MMA is therefore divided into three distinct phases: the one purely made up of kicks and punches, which is performed standing up; that of sockets and hooks; the one on the ground, with constraints and fights on the carpet. In the first, the control system, the focal point in a sports game of this kind, is taken fromthe already tested and reliable one of Fight Night Round 4, another Electronic Arts game to be precise. Basically, shots are performed with the right analog, alternating them with kicks by pressing the left trigger and increasing power with the right one. With a special key instead, you can try to ~engage~ the enemy, who in turn can try to avoid it with another specific command. Once embraced, the two wrestlers can exchange nice effusions made of stomps, kicks and head butts. But they can also try to throw themselves down, trying to gain a consistent advantage over the other. If you succeed, you are halfway through your task. Once on the ground, the combat system has been decidedly simplified (compared to the colleague UFC Undisputed), relegating all the game action to just three buttons. One to hit, one to escape and the other to inflict the famous ~submissions~ with which we can seek the surrender of the opponent through painful joint constraints. MMA uses a stamina system to regulate the player's fatigue, in practice it is the classic energy bar that is gradually gnawed with each movement of the fighter. Throwing shots at random is never a good technique therefore, unless you want to find yourself overwhelmed by fatigue in a short time and then landed by enemy blows. The game is definitely fun and rewarding, but it feels a little too confusing and fast (with consequent frustrations) when the action moves to the ground, during ~grappling~. The game, as per Electronic Arts tradition, is by no means sparing of options and modes, starting from the classic exhibition and the offline career. The advice is to undertake the full-bodied tutorial before starting anything: through it you become familiar with the three phases of attack and defense and learn how to use the commands and combos. Career, as any modality of this type requires, sees us start as young fighters with high hopes to then plow through the most important rings in the world, after having carried out an endless series of training sessions with the greatest masters of the genre, starting from Bas Rutten and passing by legends like Randy Couture and Rickson Gracie. The goal, in this case, is to try to make us breathe the heavy air of the gyms, where sweat and blood form the backdrop to the harsh and repetitive words of the coaches who try to motivate us at all times in full Rocky Balboa style. The atmosphere is the right one but EA, without making it too mysterious, however, has conceived most of the MMA experience by shaping it around the online multiplayer component, relegating the career to a sort of huge ~tutorial~ that will serve to learn everything it is possible to learn from the secrets of the game. An interesting online option called ~Live Broadcasting~ has been included, in which EA itself will select every week (with criteria based on game statistics) the best wrestlers scattered all over the world and will have them clash in matches exhibited to the whole community of MMA. Interesting modality, but perhaps too selective and dedicated to the lucky few who will be chosen. Xbox 360 goals The Electronic Arts game puts the canonical 1000 points on the plate, this time divided into 49 objectives. A third of them are achieved by completing the career and winning all six available leagues. Another third is represented by the achievement of specific objectives in online multiplayer, while the remainder are only linked to particular or bizarre events, such as winning a match using only fists, or concluding it in the last seconds available. Acquiring all 1000 points will not be an easy task at all! The King is dead, long live the King! The main problem of MMA, in addition to the enormous one of being a sport for a few enthusiasts, is that of exhibiting a roster of fighters limited by the absence of many UFC league champions (see box above). Personally, the mere presence of Bob ~The Beast~ Sapp and his typical ~Bud Spencer~ punch would be a valid reason for buying MMA, but obviously in these cases it is a question of decidedly subjective preferences and linked to one's knowledge of this sport. The Electronic Arts game obviously didn't need who knows what technological miracles, being able to use the excellent graphics engine already developed for the Fight Night series. Great animations, perfect collisions and defined polygonal models frame an almost impeccable realization, which sees some spots only in sporadic pop-ups or in replays that are decidedly too ~different~ from the in-game game engine (by cutting the audience, the detail of the wrestlers increases to out of proportion, but when you get back to fighting the ~wow~ effect is inverse). It is universally known that the UFC league represents the most important and famous slice of the entire MMA universe, with an impressive series of fighters and a solid THQ franchise behind it, but Electronic Arts has been able to create a valid alternative to Undisputed by programming a beautiful game to see and profound to play, with the only ~fault~ of having a staff of wrestlers necessarily reduced and some defects to be filed with the next releases. The road, however, is the right one.", "date": "2010-10-20", "grade": "7.8"}
