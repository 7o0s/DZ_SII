{"name": "Riders Republic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/riders-republic-recensione.html", "text": "An exciting madness. We can't find other words to effectively summarize Riders Republic, the new Ubisoft extreme sports themed game. It is certainly not the first time that the French company has demonstrated its ambitions when it comes to competitions beyond the limit, the difference is that they are now all available in a single package. From Trials to Steep, here there is room for a series of crazy disciplines as much as those who put them into practice in real life, i.e. a group of stunts who, between cutting-edge costumes and means that one would not expect to never found in similar races (try doing a Downhill with an ice cream cart), opens the doors of their personal amusement park to us. All immersed in landscapes inspired by the real world and reproduced to be functional to the game, but also to be watched and explored, if we wanted to take a break from the climb to success to become the Rider among the Riders. In Riders Republic there isn't actually a real goal because the essence of the game is and remains fun regardless. Of course, the competition always has a fundamental role in the economy of the gameplay and is able to foment even the calmest, but the light-heartedness that distinguishes Riders Republic, combined with a very well-structured learning curve capable of adapting to both newbies and for veteran players, the cornerstone of an experience from which it is difficult to detach remains: like cherries, one race leads to another and the stars at the base of our career are irresistible. All resting on a solid foundation that does not limit us in any way, allowing us to face races and events as we prefer, offering new ones based on our choices. In our Riders Republic review we will discover that there is always plenty to do in this crazy and colorful republic. The stars are many, millions of millions Riders Republic, stars are essential to unlock new content If you have played the beta, or just followed the development of the game, then you know that Riders Republic offers not one, not two, not three, but five careers to try your hand at, collecting stars that are the foundation of our journey as Rider: More stars means more unlocked content, be it new equipment, sponsors or competitions. At any moment you can monitor your progression and know both the number of stars useful for unlocking the next reward, and the type of this reward: it goes without saying that collecting stars serves to expand the game and its contents, but it is not something to be lived as an obligation, or of which you feel the weight, because you just need to play. Sure, maybe you need to do it with a little head to complete the challenges proposed in each race but, as written, the learning curve is designed to make this goal feasible for everyone on different levels of complexity. You can focus on the easy goals at the beginning and as you get used to it move on to the more challenging ones - all without any specific path in mind, you can switch from one discipline to another as you like, also because there are competitions consisting of more than one type of extreme sport. From earth to sky Riders Republic, the flight sequences can be deceptive especially in the obstacles to avoid What disciplines, or categories if we prefer, are we actually talking about? It is easy to say: Skis and Snowboards, Mountain Bikes, Wingsuits and Jet Wings. They all revolve around two types of challenges: speed races, in which to cross the finish line first or set the record time, or points races in which our trick skills will dominate. At first glance it might seem like a limited offer, but just choose one of these careers to understand how far Riders Republic really goes: our favorite competitions were those on the bike, while we didn't particularly like those in the wingsuit, partly due to the awkwardness of the tracks in relation to the responsiveness of the controls, partly for mere personal taste. Taking the first discipline as an example: there is a clear difference between competing in downhill or road races, starting from the type of bike used for then arriving at the track, passing through the weather conditions, which affect individual performances. All this without taking into consideration the three levels of challenge that the competitions offer, with relative rewards in stars, capable of giving a further twist to the competitions. There was one race in particular where it was required to complete it without ever braking, within a certain time limit and obviously placing first at a certain difficulty - elements thateme have made it a challenge of an entirely different caliber than the basic version. Amazon offer Riders Republic Limited PS5 - Amazon Exclusive - PlayStation 5 69.99 See Offer The charm of Riders Republic also lies here, in trying to face multiple challenges at once to see the competition transform into something else: it's not always feasible, there are challenges that must be faced one at a time, but when you manage to combine more than one together, the result is an adrenaline rush that we would not be able to get in any other way. Racer or trickster? Riders Republic, a wrong trick can cost you dearly In terms of gameplay, Riders Republic, in being an arcade experience that bypasses any existing law of physics, dispels the few doubts that could have arisen in the face of such a diversity in the disciplines. Each of these brings into play not only different mechanics but, in turn, a perception of its own risk or speed. Clearly riding a mountain bike is not the same as hurtling down a snowy track and this is where the heart of the game rests, in the quality of the game design combined with a level design capable of making the most of the individual disciplines. It's not just a matter of understanding the different tricks and putting them into practice, but also of reading the various slopes, knowing which risks to take and which ones to save for later. There are so many combinations of stunts that water will pass under the bridge before mastering them all, if only because the adrenaline generated by each competition drives us to instinctively use the safest ones, sacrificing spectacularity in order not to run into ruinous falls.In this regard, we cannot deny problems when it comes to integrating game commands and tricks. Let's explain better: at the beginning you are asked between the Trickster and Racer controls model: the first designed for veterans while the second to better accompany newbies. The main difference, however, lies in the fact that the Racer mode allows you to manage the camera with the right analog stick, leaving the execution of the tricks to the buttons; the Trickster mode, on the other hand, recalls Steep and the possibility of performing tricks with the right analog, thus sacrificing control over the camera. In practice, during competitions, this last approach translates into the concrete possibility of screwing up the entire competition for having involuntarily given birth to a stunt. A similar perfection is obtained, regardless of the mode, with the left trigger: being used for certain acrobatics in flight but, at the same time, essential for braking when on a bike, it happens that a slight jolt perhaps caused by a difference in ground level is taken as an air suspension and, while you were thinking of braking in order to adjust the bike, you find yourself unintentionally performing a trick that inevitably leads to a ruinous fall, with consequent loss of time to get back on track, whether it is by rewinding time or quick command to get up. Speaking of rewinding time, in the preview phase we highlighted the cumbersomeness of the system due to the three necessary inputs: the mechanics have not been changed, we would have preferred a more fluid system to get back into the race, perhaps leaving it all to the pressing and releasing of a button. In addition to this, the lack of any haptic feedback should be underlined, which perhaps on the one hand would have made certain competitions less manageable but on the other hand would have given a greater sense of immersion along the different routes. A boundless freedom Riders Republic, the map is huge but the movements are very fast We have already written it and we repeat it to you. Riders Republic stands out for the absolute freedom with which one can progress: despite a very large map, which inevitably drags along the fear of not having a real substance with which to fill it, in this game the activities flow so fluidly that you never find yourself idle or bored. At all times there is always something to do, a new competition to unlock or sponsor contracts to fulfill and, why not, in the meantime you can pick up some oddities (equipment, as the name suggests, very particular) around. In this case it is legitimate to worry about the opposite effect compared to other Ubisoft games: feeling suffocated by the amount of content to the point of developing confusion or, worse, a sort of rejection due to the excessive presence of activity. None of this, because between the diversification in terms of gameplay and the fluidity with which these activities follow one another, Riders Republic is never such a big morsel as to be indgesture. It being understood that, if we want to take stock of the situation (or face more specific competitions), we can teleport to the main HUB and catch our breath, planning the next moves, in the meantime taking a look at the equipment to understand where we are. Not unlike The Crew, in fact, the game is based on the statistics of the equipment related to the career you are facing: at each new level you get a better one, which automatically translates into better performance and the possibility of facing more challenges. challenging. It takes very little to make a difference, but we must not rest on our laurels, because it is still our skills that draw the line between victory and defeat. More effective means only increase the chances of success, in a playground that never seems to end, whose redundancy becomes more perceptible, in the long run, alone. Group fun Riders Republic, the more, the merrier Riders Republic is clearly an experience designed to be lived above all with friends, or perhaps with other players met on the spot. In a world that's always shared, where it's even possible to compete along user-designed courses, there's no end to both the fun and the experience itself. There will always be new competition, whether it's the unprecedented ones whose only limit lies in the creativity of the players, or in the multiplayer that leads to the devastating mass competition, in which sixty-four players compete in a riot of tricks, identical outfits that make it indistinguishable from nearby, multiple disciplines and so on and so forth - confusion at its highest levels, where trying to understand what is happening is pure utopia. It will already be a miracle in itself if we don't crash into an obstacle every ten meters , this is because, although not too refined, the collisions between characters work and very little is needed to be thrown off the trajectory, perhaps while aiming for a trampoline to perform the most beautiful trick of our lives. The only caution for this kind of competition is to take them in the right spirit, to flex your muscles there are all the other challenges. There is no room here for anything but fun. To be more poetic, Riders Republic is a synesthesia of concepts, contents and activities, a harmonic flow that can be directed as we like, finds no setbacks and presents itself in a pleasant technical guise. Technical and artistic sector Riders Republic does not fail to be colorful and flamboyant, in its amusing madness Although it is neither the main focus nor the flagship of the game, the technical and artistic sector of Riders Republic has proved to be a surprise. Graphically it is not a miracle, but it performs well and above all it has not presented any bugs of any kind (perhaps also because openly defying the laws of physics it is difficult to notice anything out of place). The variety of settings contributes to making this crazy world enjoyable, above all thanks to optimal loading management when moving around the map: a handful of seconds and you find yourself at the desired point, or next to a possible teammate regardless of the respective distance. The concept of uploads also extends to races: most of them can be restarted if the trend does not convince us, a choice that takes very little time and facilitates us in our trial and error path.", "date": "2021-11-03", "grade": "8.0"}
