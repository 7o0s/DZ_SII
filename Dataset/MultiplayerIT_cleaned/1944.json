{"name": "Unreal Tournament 2003 - Day Two", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-tournament-2003-day-two.html", "text": "Deathmatch & Team Deathmatch. It should be noted that the designers have given more prominence to the architecture than to the game-flowing of the maps, in almost all categories. That they can be a feast for the eyes is beyond any doubt, but the richness of details, for the purposes of playability, is counterproductive if you don't have a powerful machine, and UT2003 is currently more ~spectacular~ than ~playable~. Once the first impression has passed, it seems like the birth of those famous ~Map Contests~ where you vote for the most beautiful and complex creation, but which in the end ends up in the most important aspect: playability! Unfortunately UT2003 is precisely in this aspect that has ~broken~ big time. A clear example is this DM & TDM mode, which in fifteen maps contained just a couple are saved (this also explains why Epic is hastily preparing the first Bonus Pack containing precisely some additional maps for the DM)! The current ones, in the end, are so boring that defining ~mortal~ is an understatement. The gameflow of most of them is penalized above all by the banality of the paths, which in the vast majority are simple and very short ~mirrored~ (DM-Compressed, DM-Insidius, DM-Leviathan, DM-Training Day), single-room arenas ( DM-Gael, DM-Serpentine), or dispersive and/or expensive in the hardware requests (DM-Inferno and DM-Phobos above all). The ones that leave you with a good sense of fulfillment are Tokara Forest (really excellent!) and Curse3. The latter is one of the few that contains a more fantasy setting of clear ~Quakeian~ inspiration, different from the dark and claustrophobic ones, which find in DM-Oceanic a clear example of how to ~not make~ a map! Dark, full of misleading details and extremely boring! On the other hand, DM-Plunge is fair due to the low gravity and the continuous hopping from one skyscraper to another. But it is almost the carbon copy, even if embellished, of the old and parchment one of DM-Morpheus, contained in the previous UT. Capture The Flag. Another category, identical result: beautiful, heavy and not very funny. Those that have a considerable thickness (CTF-Chrome and CTF-Orbital2) are united by a wealth of details out of the ordinary, which makes them a feast for the eyes, but which end up weighing on the cpu/gpu pair like a boulder. The three most spectacular maps, in absolute terms, are CTF-Maul, CTF-LostFaith and CTF-Magma, the latter almost entirely built with a 3D graphics program, limiting the use of the internal editor only for the final assembly . The quality of this map is unmatched, but in the end the route winds along a triple route (four times that of the summit) excavated in a volcano, surrounded by a sea of ... lava! After the first disruptive effect, it is a simple map, more spectacular than the others as you want, but with a thickness in the hackneyed gameplaying. CTF-Lostfaith, in particular, is created by a series of humid underground caves, with a low layer of water that creates splendid reflections on the walls of the galleries, from which it emerges by coming out into a clearing of a thousand and one nights, with an attached waterfall of ~lovers' bridge~, the only communication route to be the backdrop to our endless battles! Really well thought out, with the only gripe of the tunnel surrounding the bases, which disorientates in the first few games, forcing us to make continuous ~roundabouts~ near the opposing area, before finding the right path. Double Domination and Bombing Run. Counted among the real novelties, these two modes are represented by half a dozen maps each, which have supplanted the much loved - and popularly requested - ~Assault~ category, mysteriously cut in this renewed version of UT. While Double Domination is the right ~evolution~ of a ~King of The Hill~ of prehistoric effeppiessara memory, with a double control to be managed simultaneously for ten seconds, it is, in my opinion, among the most fun to play in a group. In fact, the clashes are mostly concentrated in the vicinity of the two positions, which will turn into high-impact areas of carnage and massacres, where victories will be decided at the last second, with sudden and bloody reversals in the face! There are only six maps, as mentioned, but some are really well made (DOM-Ruination and DOM-SepukkuGorge), while all the others fall within the norm of current standards. Undoubtedly mention Sepukku-Gorge, which is a graphic marvel of clear ~fantasy~ inspiration, with a forest immersed in the darkness of a night illuminated only by the moon, a few lamps and small fireflies animated by a light spring breeze. At the beginning we are amazed by so much magnificence that makes us refairy tales lost in the innermost childhood memory emerge vividly, but the first frag is enough to bring us back to the harsh and violent reality of what UT2003 represents: a grim and merciless game that does not allow for distractions! Yes, one is easily misled by so much graphic richness, that in the end one forgets that in UT2003 one should also ... play! The Bombing Run mode, on the other hand, which on paper is the one that represents the real ~HIT~ of UT2003, is still proving to be subdued, considering that the teams in the field must be so close-knit as to coordinate as a possibly ~unique~ entity . Surely from this category, clearly inspired by American football, playmakers, quarterbacks, defenders, forwards and above all ~commanders~ will emerge over the months, who will manage the team as they remember, with the inevitable schemes and tactical modules studied at the table. On closer inspection, this mode is the most representative for the ideal of a team E-Sport, but like any novelty, it still needs ~a lot~ of running in to truly live up to such a reputation and responsibility. The dedicated maps are once again ultra-reinforced by an extreme wealth of details, useless for the purposes of the game but appreciated for the embellishment they bring. Those most full of atmosphere, however, are BR-SlaughterHouse (slaughterhouse), where blood flows in rivers, and BR-Icefields, which will soon see the white snow that covers it sprinkled with red for what is immediate and direct in the clashes frontal. Also noteworthy is BR-Bifrost (my favourite), of Tribesian workmanship, with a vast central space full of snow-capped hills and ravines, which will elicit more than one cry of joy from lovers of ambushes and those of ~vast~ fields of battle, usually the object of desire of snipers looking for the tactic-busting headshot! Adrenaline, dodging and the twelve ~mutators~. The Adrenaline was a well thought out idea, supplanting the ~Relics~ of the first UT altogether. Only when the amount of one hundred adrenaline-units is reached, can it be ~activated~ via a combination of the movement keys, a bonus that quickly drains the amount. These bonuses are represented by speed, berserk (a sort of quad-damage), invisibility and health regeneration (booster). If we associate dodging and double jumping with adrenaline, we have our beautiful complete picture: our character has become a sort of ~Matrix~, who jumps beyond human capacity, with the added possibility of using the wall to a kind of trampoline, to escape the blows of the opponents. Maybe, but I prefer the athletic and more spectacular evolutions contained in the new Half-Life mod, released a few weeks ago: The Specialist. The mutators have always been a pride of UT, the only FPS so far to have so many by default, capable of changing the game modes even in a profound way. With a normal ~scripted~ procedure it is possible to make ~homemade~ mods. The only prerogative required is a basic knowledge of the game code, which unfortunately is not within the reach of all ~normal~ players. However, the initial twelve ~mutators~ included in the ~package~, are mostly the transposition of those of the old UT (low gravity, instagib, no superweapons), others dedicated to pure playability (BigHead, Zoom Instagib, Arena), others expressly dedicated to UT2003 (quadjump, no adrenaline) and still others of pure ~spectacular~ aspect (floating corpses, slow motion applied to lifeless bodies). In the summa they add little, but we are sure dozens, if not hundreds, of these ~scripts~ will be released in the future. The important thing is to know how to be patient and trust in the imagination of the many fans. Second partial comment. From the subject covered in this second appointment, we have obtained enough elements to draw an opinion, which added to the previous one, clearly outlines what UT2003 is ~today~: a mammoth and advanced graphics engine, around which maps saturated with effects have been set up special and sometimes futile details, of which today very few are able to fully savor (without worries and deterioration of fluidity) this rich mixture of innovation and technology, which adds a lot to the ~show~ aspect, but equally ~decreases~ to the aspect of pure enjoyment. To the many who are ~satisfied~ with minimizing the details, to increase fluidity, we can say that UT2003 without ~special FX~, is similar to dozens of FPS on the market, indeed certainly more ~ugly~, because apparently it seems born more to ~amaze~ than to ~entertain~. In the future, with powerful graphics cards, the impression will certainly be differentwe have today, with a medium-level computer owned by the vast majority of gamers, but the fact remains that the game-flowing of some maps has disappointed in a scandalous way to say the least! Some of them, in fact, are so poor, that they seem like the birth of a novice rappers, who give more prominence to the details than to the ~substance~. The current situation of UT2003 reminds me of another great ~flop~, this time from the cinema, in which everyone had placed great hopes: the Final Fantasy film, which cost millions of dollars and several years of human work, seen pinning the nickname of ~flop billionaire~, because among many graphic subtleties, what was missing was precisely direction and storyscript, which have always been the binomial ~fulcrum~ of every film, however simple and/or complex its workmanship may be technique. We do not currently know if the lack of joy of UT2003 is also due to the persistence of game modes that have now given everything, supplanted by more ~collaborative~ and ~real~ team games (see the case of Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat) . This aspect, however, will be explored in the third and last appointment, where in addition to the analysis of the weapons and models of the characters, the final comment will be drawn up, which will take into account all the aspects, positive and negative, encountered so far. Maps and game modes Leaving aside for the moment the detailed description of each single map (we ask this future task to the UnrealItalia guys) we have however prepared and previously published a ~special screenshots~, which includes the best ~shots~, with a care for the search for the ~the most beautiful corner~ very special. The appreciation of the result seems to be more than sufficient to demonstrate, in all their intrinsic beauty, the structure and setting contained therein. Obviously a static image remains an end in itself, while instead it is from ~playing~ with it that details otherwise impossible to ~discover~ come out. In this review we will limit ourselves to giving a very brief description of the most representative ones, judging - as objectively as possible - what the Epic Games guys have come up with overall, regarding both the different styles / types of gameplay and the maps dedicated to them.", "date": "2002-11-10", "grade": null}
