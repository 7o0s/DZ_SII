However, it was not a question of mere luck, but of having opened the doors to a new genre of games, linked to the possibility of understanding consoles as a tool for real physical activities, to keep fit, in short. As if it were a virus, Wii Fit and its Balance Board, or the platform needed to use the game, have spread throughout Italy for months and, in the face of some criticisms and the excessive simplicity of the original, here comes this which is an expansion, and not a real new episode, adding games, some exercises and a couple of tricks that can make the difference for those who really want to try their hand at this little interactive personal trainer. Even if the substance of the package has remained unchanged, and while not reaching the completeness of an EA SPORTS Active - Personal Trainer, a couple of additions help to overcome what was the biggest flaw of the previous version, i.e. the lack of a goal for stimulate daily training. Wii Fit Plus, in fact, has a method, explained in a summary but clear way, to calculate the calories consumed after each exercise or aerobic game, and for each training session you can set a certain amount to burn as an upper limit. To do this, in addition to obviously having all the exercises and games available right away (in Wii Fit they had to be unlocked by accumulating game minutes), this time two training routines have been added: the personalized one and the Wii Fit Plus one. The second offers combinations of Yoga, Muscle exercises and aerobic games - of these there are 15 completely new and some are really fun - aimed at stimulating different muscle groups, divided by objectives such as ~slimming the figure~, for example. Curiosity The question that many ask is whether you can really keep fit with Wii Fit. Making use first of the simple combinations of the Wii Fit Routine and then of the possibility of chaining them without interruptions, we carried out a few training sessions after which losses of liquids from 500gr to 1000gr were recorded, given that with the second option the recovery times are lower and the training pace is higher. What is certain, therefore, is that if Wii Fit Plus cannot replace a real sporting activity, it can certainly help those who don't have time to go to the gym or those who don't have the space to buy some equipment to keep fit. to keep at home. These combinations can be chained together, creating a real workout, whose indicative duration is suggested right from the start, so you can adjust. The Personal Routine, on the other hand, allows you to ring in as many Yoga and muscle exercises as you like and at will. However, it is not possible to include aerobic games which, while certainly not allowing you to burn the calories of a run or a bike ride, are the best Wii Fit Plus has to offer in this sense. of the personalized routine, the problem of the first version comes up again, that is, if you are not well versed in the fitness topic, it is difficult to find your way around all the exercises available and you risk getting lost in a picture which, to be complete, is barely sketched. Also because the game continues to give more or less useful advice on nutrition and the type of behavior to adopt in order to have a healthier lifestyle, but, if we consider an exercise such as running on the spot, which one is prompted to do without shoes, it would be appropriate, for example, to point out that doing it for too long can lead to micro-traumas to the back which they certainly don't do well. Despite all this, although it is less complete than other products of the same type for the Nintendo console, those who have already purchased the Balance Board can take home Wii Fit Plus for 19.90, finding small solutions to use it better and trying with more conviction to get some exercise within the walls of the house. In fact, by following the calorie goals, the daily progress register and the pre-set routines, it is really easier to follow the intentions of the game with greater continuity. Anyone who hasn't bought the first chapter yet, however, can think of the bundle with the Balance Board which, thanks to the many mini games included, also has an excellent playful reason to be enjoyed for many hours by the whole family.", "date": "2009-11-20", "grade": null}
