A secret of longevity rooted in the philosophy of the team led by Miles Jacobson, which has remained faithful to the simplicity of its origins while being aware of having managed to dominate an entire slice of the market, sweeping away all the competition. Over time, the developers have become increasingly aware of their means, with which they have created a game that is more than a game: a real story, capable of merging reality and fiction, which repeats itself annually for all the players. The documentary An Alternative Reality, dedicated precisely to Football Manager fans, told us extensively about it, as Jacobson himself told us a few days ago during an interview, from which we extracted the most interesting contents to publish them in this review . Also for this reason, let's not waste any more time, because there are so many things to talk about, waiting for Football Manager 2015 to arrive on the market on November 7th. Like other players who have booked it, we too have had the opportunity to sit down on the virtual benches in advance, to go and touch all the news announced by the developers in recent weeks. We just have to immerse ourselves in the part, to find out what we will find this time on the long journey of our coaching career. An interview with Miles Jacobson and his review of Football Manager 2015, looking forward to November 7th! Bug disclaimers Anyone who knows the Football Manager series knows that the downside of a work that pursues the complete representation of reality is the presence of a certain number of bugs, which can be found above all in the first days of life of each new edition. Football Manager 2015 is no different, and that's why when it came to providing us with the code for the review, Sports Interactive pointed out to us the most significant problems the developers are already working on, with the intention, therefore, of seeing them fixed for the official November 7 release. Among these, we find the obvious skating effect of the players on the playing field, the goalkeepers a little too easy to beat, the presence of too many own goals and the need to optimize the artificial intelligence. We have naturally taken all of this into account, balancing it with what we saw with our own eyes during the game we played to write our article. A small revolution The review of Football Manager 2015 this time starts from an element that has been relegated to closure on other occasions: the game interface. If in the past Sports Interactive had in fact limited itself to improving the already existing basic system, this year the designers have given a real twist to the experience offered to the player, through the main hub represented by a left sidebar. Thanks to it, it is possible to access all the main areas of the game, thus reaching them in an easier way: an almost obligatory decision for Sports Interactive, which motivated these changes with the need to make all the elements of Football Manager 2015 more obvious to the players. Confirmation also came from Miles Jacobson, according to whom fans sometimes asked for new features that actually already existed, but which were hidden behind the need to navigate through too many menus to be reached. Now, for the first time, everything is just a few clicks away, including the brand new search bar which is completely similar to that of browsers: by starting to type a name, you can view a series of automatic suggestions in perfect Google style, thus saving further time. Like any radical change, the new interface also brings with it the need to go through a certain learning curve, however quite rapid: the goal is simplified to us by the presence of a contextual tutorial, made available to us to show us step by step the new features added to the game. Role issue Among the new features of Football Manager 2015, we also find the one that the game offers us as soon as we start a new game, to be exact when we create our manager profile. In fact, the various data that we all know has been combined with a new screen where you can choose your own managerial style, in the ways that we have already detailed in the preview phase. It is thus possible to choose aexperience level, on the basis of which to assign a series of points to the various parameters present, intended according to the intentions of Sports Interactive to influence the way in which we will manage game situations. In fact, nothing is denied to the coach, but the choice of a type of coach closer to the training pitch and to the team will give us, for example, the possibility of obtaining greater feedback when we talk about tactical aspects with our players, while vice versa the presence of a manager with more communication skills could help keep press and opponent under control in particularly hot situations. To really evaluate such a component, the feedback from thousands of players and their seasons will naturally be needed, but the impression we had is that actually the choice of a specific ~role~ can influence the various game components, for good and bad, thus creating a real personality for our manager, which was previously lacking. An essential part in the life of every coach is the tactics system, which has already gone through a simplification with which Jacobson and his had retired the slider system. Now, the management of the eleven deployed on the field has become even more intuitive, without losing depth, to also offer some new roles to assign to the players so as to make sure that they interpret their position as we want. There are no sensational novelties, but it is impossible not to notice how Sports Interactive has entered into every single element, implementing a truly successful optimization work, aimed above all at making all the aspects that make up the game work properly. Longtime fans may perhaps turn up their noses at a progressive preference by developers for graphic elements to the detriment of plain text, but we feel we appreciate innovations such as the one that divides the feelings of each player into ~pros and cons ~, thus offering us a detailed and immediately readable photograph of the physical and emotional moment of each athlete in the squad. Interesting and even more realistic is the novelty reserved for players to observe, for whom we can now see a range of values for some parameters, which can be narrowed by unleashing one of our scouts on the current talent. In the past, you will recall that some data was instead hidden, so the novelty therefore makes it necessary to gradually discover the actual skills, while at the same time offering a way to decide in advance whether to go and observe someone else to find what we need. Among the things to review, however, is the way in which some players behave: seeing Callejn ask to go to Chelsea after only three league matches, only to show discontent in the face of our predictable no, left us a bit dumbfounded. while there are also too many complaints from the reserves. It should be noted that, despite Sports Interactive's efforts to add depth, press conferences are always the most indigestible element of the game, a sign that there is something to be reviewed at their root. A chat with Miles Did the reception for the documentary satisfy you? Will we see more initiatives like this? I've been surprised at how positive the reception has been, not just from the Football Manager community. It was in the top ten at the box office, simultaneously on television in 47 countries and in the top 20 on iTunes, it was phenomenal. The rating on IMDB is also very high (8.2 Ed). For the future, who knows what may happen, now we know we have an audience for our game that goes beyond the game itself. People feel close to you also because Football Manager allows them to have real stories to tell. Surely! When they play, people are allowed to create their own stories. With other games, the story tells you what happens, in this case we say ok, this is the universe, play how you want. And that creates better stories for the players, because instead of just being a part of the story, they are the story. Let's take stock of Classic Mode: Did it bring back any old players? Yes, we have seen some players return. I am no longer the director of FM Classic, which Oliver Collyer now runs, and the reason is simple: if I had continued to work on it, it would have become more complicated. FM Classic has done its job admirably, there was also the interesting experiment with PlayStation Vita of crossplay across multiple platforms. Have the two modes helped each other's growth in recent years? Without FM Classic there would have been some interface elements that we introducedthis year. Take the icons for example: I personally prefer everything to be text-based, but since they worked so well in FM Classic, who am I to stop them? I think all the games we've made are able to help each other, by allowing us to learn from how people play them: we want to be able to make as many people enjoy our games as possible. What's the your new favorite feature in Football Manager 2015? That's a weird thing, because my new favorite feature isn't actually a feature - it's how the whole game works as a whole. We have a lot of people working in many areas, and sometimes things don't go as planned, but this year everything is coherent and very believable, because what we've tried to do with Football Manager is create a world where you can lose and believe it's true, an alternate reality. In the 3D engine you make use of motion capture for the first time. Aesthetics aside, did you have to change anything in the engine itself? Many games are driven by animations, ours by AI - animations kick in when the AI tells them to. All the animations are something that the engine already did, but didn't have the graphics component to represent it. The two thousand new animations are just the beginning of what we want to do for the engine: we have also introduced a new management of the lights, but returning to the question what required changes in the artificial intelligence was the new ball physics. When it changes its trajectory, the players have to change their behavior too. How do you experience the absence of competition, now that FIFA Manager is gone? Do you believe that it can somehow harm you? FIFA Manager only sold very well in Germany, but poorly in other countries. We've seen so many brands come and go, I think about sixteen since I've been here, but we have a path: we know what we want and how to take things forward, so whether or not there are other games on the market for us doesn't matter, because we are willing to do what we've been doing for the last 20 years, come what may. It's not something that can affect us. I was very sad when I learned that FIFA Manager would no longer be made, but because I appreciated the work of the developers who fortunately are now working on other games. Have you played any browser-based manager games? I've played a little Top Eleven, as an arcade game it's fun. I think it's tricky to make a manager in the browser, because you have to keep things simple enough for it to be playable. But that doesn't stop them from being entertaining, while limiting their depth. Can you tell us something about the new Football Manager Handheld? It will be out by Christmas, but we won't talk about it until after Football Manager 2015. We'll talk about all the new stuff in November. The novelties of the Classic For obvious space requirements, we focused on the full version of Football Manager 2015 to write our review. Even the Classic mode naturally sees a series of innovations introduced by the developers, led by the co-founder of the series Oliver Collyer. Among them, we point out the arrival of the possibility to skip the entire pre-season phase in the first season, the possibility of uploading larger player databases, new requests to be made to the management and new pre-match meetings to be held together with the team . There are also some new unlockables, unique elements for the Classic mode that are actually equivalent to what we would call cheats elsewhere: for example, you can choose to make a life contract to a player, remove any suspensions hanging over someone's head and even make so that the opponents of the next match are out of shape, with a nice reference to the ~Dodgy Lasagne~ story which in 2006 saw Tottenham lose qualification for the Champions League, following the absence of some members of the starting team. Let's go to the field After making history in two dimensions, Football Manager has for years now included the possibility of simulating our team's matches in three dimensions, through its 3D engine. In this edition, the most important novelty in this sense was the use of motion capture, to reproduce the movements of the players with greater accuracy. Considering that the code for the review was not the final one, it seemed to us that the sector dedicated to simulation needed further refinement work: not surprisingly, the list of reports received from Sports Interactive collects various elements related to the 3D engine.
