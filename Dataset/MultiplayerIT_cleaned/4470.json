Debuting on the App Store and Google Play exactly two years after the release of the first episode, the new effort by Tiny Titan Studios puts us in command of a character who suddenly finds himself playing the role of the predestined, a warrior whose abilities will allow him to free the world from the oppression of orcs, trolls and demonic creatures. Accompanied on our journey by a mysterious creature similar to a will-o'-the-wisp, we'll have to try our hand once again with the original mechanics developed for the series, which mix the typical role-playing and roguelike elements with endless runner-style gameplay. Each new excursion is in fact characterized by a perpetual vertical scrolling, albeit at a constant speed, during which the hero will be attacked by a horde of enemies who will gradually become more tough and numerous, determining the inevitable game over when our vital energy will be depleted. To make this happen as late as possible we will have to touch the touch screen on the left side to raise the shield and intercept, timing permitting, the blows of our opponents and touch it on the right side to slash with the sword. Between one duel and another we will also be asked to avoid traps, collect coins and possibly select alternative routes to discover new secrets and face new threats.

The Hero's Path The gameplay of Dash Quest Heroes certainly raises concerns, especially at the beginning: one gets the feeling that the mix of genres developed by Tiny Titan Studios is a bit forced, that the endless nature of the experience is not compatible with the exploratory ambitions that are proposed during the missions and the combat system itself, it appears not very precise. However, it is enough to get carried away in a couple of adventures to understand the value of this production, which can certainly become repetitive in the re-proposition of the same landscapes, but which encourages us to continue thanks to the many objects that can be unlocked along the way, the new weapons and armor to equip to make the character stronger and more resistant, to the possibility of enhancing its characteristics and special moves. Unlike the first episode, this time the freemium model adopted by the developers is permissive and allows you to play for free without problems, using hard currency where it is deemed necessary to continue after a game over and save the position at specific points on the map; operations which, however, can also be carried out by watching short advertising trailers, which are non-invasive in any case. Between one attempt and another we will also be able to visit some shops to obtain further extras, possibly manufacture high-level objects and check the list of achievements to collect the prizes related to the objectives already achieved, without having to submit to gimmicks such as energy action. In short, during our progression we did not feel limited, and indeed we received abundant gems to feed our desire to run fast, taking advantage of a substantially improved interface from a stylistic point of view (in the original Dash Quest some graphic elements clashed with a bit) and, in general, of a richer and more varied world, with many different enemies (although not always splendid to see) and fairly challenging boss fights, the latter to be faced ~de ferme~, learning their attack patterns and trying to sink the punches whenever we can.", "date": "2017-12-29", "grade": "8.0"}
