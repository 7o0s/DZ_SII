{"name": "In Memoriam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/in-memoriam.html", "text": "Technology and Esotericism Once the game and the required components have been installed (shockwave player 9 and Quicktime 6, included on the installation CD) and the adventure has started, we will be asked for registration, via email and password. This operation, together with constant access to our game's Network, will allow us to receive clues and communications in a manner consistent with our progress. The use of e-mail is very interesting: messages and clues will be delivered to us by the various people who contribute to the investigation, but only during game sessions and on very few other occasions. A good compromise between immersion and invasion, which allows you to enjoy the gaming experience without fearing being overwhelmed with messages or receiving them at inappropriate times. La Fenice will immediately put us in front of a series of puzzles of increasing difficulty, almost all of them with an esoteric background. Solving each puzzle will result in a reward in terms of clues and movies, which will help us solve the mystery. These puzzles will be of the most disparate type, from the riddle to the game of skill, passing through the questions whose answer must be searched on the Internet. Resources and research The heart of In Memoriam, its main mechanics, is to be a sort of 'non-game'. A large part of the game is solved thanks to the clues provided by the Phoenix itself and a massive dose of Internet research and study of the data collected. Our digital colleagues, real non-player characters, will come to our aid above all when we are late in solving some puzzles, and in any case their indications will rarely be limited to a single episode: often, re-reading the messages, indications also for puzzles are found between the lines subsequent. As far as the Internet is concerned, the game has achieved a significant goal: through accurate documentation and the creation of ad hoc sites when necessary (30 in all), it allows the player to carry out searches in a complex but not frustrating way . By guessing the right keywords for searches and using Google as suggested by the SKL Network site, the television that commissions searches, useful sites will always be among the first results, apart from some very sporadic cases. This result is obtained in the simplest way in the world: using adequate meta tags (yes, a look at the HTML code of the pages was a must), almost a lesson for many webmasters looking for higher ranks. Appearance Evaluating In Memoriam from an audiovisual point of view is decidedly complicated: judging it with the most classic videogame canons would be penalizing, and would probably distort it, given its realization. Judged with somewhat broader views, it has an artistic, almost avant-garde flavor which, regardless of personal appreciation, denotes an in-depth and detailed stylistic study. Same thing for the background music, very often reduced to almost hypnotic ambient loops. For the first time ever it is evident that the sound commentary of a video game is repetitive due to a precise artistic choice and not due to a lack of imagination. Let us remember that the CD-Rom is produced directly by the Phoenix, a serial killer with an obviously deviated mind, whose madness shines through in every detail of the CD. The films that will be supplied to us as clues deserve a separate discussion: specially shot in different locations throughout Europe, they have the quality of a good independent film production, and offer an excellent account of the events that involved the two disappeared. The whole game is perfectly localized in Italian, as well as the emails sent to us. Another parenthesis for sites created for the game, which very often only offer foreign language versions. Here too, however, Lexis offers us a little touch of class: Italian sites (or sites that are supposedly made by Italians) are in our mother tongue, French ones in French, etc. Normally if the information is inherent in the text there is also at least an English version; if they are images or something else we will not know what is written there, unless we are polyglots: undoubtedly a valid choice for realism, but slightly frustrating for curiosity, it is also true that this choice never affects the game potential . Play along As we have said in more than one circumstance, In Memoriam is almost to be considered an experiment in interactive experience rather than a videogame. For this reason, it is appreciated much more if you decide to play along, letting yourself be identified despite some obvious naiveties, which, to tell the truth, however, are accompanied by flashes of true genius. The emails of the protagonists, for example,are really well done, and even manage to make the personality of our collaborators shine through: however, do not expect to receive detailed answers to your questions ... even in one case the mail address of a supporting actor returned a ~delivery error~, despite one of our collaborators claimed to have contacted him via email. Nonetheless, it is fun to try and play with your imagination on possible answers, just as it is fun to read the blogs, articles and contents of the various sites, even though you are well aware that it is a fiction. However, a big applause goes to Lexis for the quantity and quality of the material produced, and all in a very plausible way. They have built a sort of private mini-Internet, for their use and consumption, and even with an expert eye the sensation is very often that of being in front of an authentic site, rather than one prepared ad hoc. Play along In short, Eric Viennot, creator of this project, provides an excellent terrain for the imagination to take root and bear fruit. Just leave a little skepticism at home for once and recover the desire to play the role that is required of us. It won't be long before you find yourself taking notes like a true detective... In our task As it is easy to understand, our job in this game is to investigate, with means that are unconventional for videogames but common in everyday life. The game helps us with a minimal but effective toolbar, from which it will be possible to directly recall our tools (browser and mail client), have a summary of the videos already obtained and use the other tools available, which cannot be revealed because part of the game itself. Note how the nature of the game is respected right from the start: no tutorial, no introductory level, no intro, apart from a very short composition. In Memoriam very often displaces the player, with choices that have little videogame: rusty on the rails of the 'classic' game you risk remaining stupid staring at the initial animation loop waiting for a menu to appear, until the Phoenix itself he intervenes with a video message: ~I made you smarter~... welcome to the world of In Memoriam. If you want to bring it back to a known scheme, In Memoriam presents itself with the well-known partially linear puzzle/incentive mechanism: the puzzles are divided into groups, within which each is relatively independent. To move on to the next group, however, it is necessary to have solved all the puzzles of the previous one. Usually each single puzzle has its own independent solution, which fits into the context of the others in its group, but this is not a fixed rule: the rules in this game can practically always be broken ... remember, it is produced by a madman .. . Conclusion In Memoriam is undoubtedly a title of great impact: based on plausible facts, set in contemporary reality, documented with real historical esoteric sources, it would already have all the credentials to amaze. If we add an almost maniacal attention to detail and an absolutely original creation, even if not strictly videogame, we have a sure killer application, at least among adventures. Unfortunately, the same originality is also a weakness: to play it is necessary to be connected to the Internet, given the massive use that is made of it, to have a mail program, a browser and In Memoriam , which in turn evokes the two proposed players: it is not uncommon to have to 'jump' between the three different applications (and possibly the Notepad for notes, recommended), with numerous jumps between tasks. Furthermore, the fact that it requires good familiarity with search engines is not negligible. Maybe a few too many requests for a 'simple' video game. Lovers of adventures, puzzles, challenges and experimentation will hardly be able to do without it. The more traditionalists will find much to complain about. But the problem is theirs, not In Memoriam's... The grade assigned to them takes into account above all the level of challenge and risk taken by the Lexis Numerique in the creation of such a particular product, of its innovative charge and originality. Not just qualities that, especially in this period where few dare to risk and fewer succeed successfully, everyone should respect. Pros: Original and innovative Manic attention to detail Plausible and immersive story Cons: ~Non-videogame~ technical realization Requires a lot of extra skills Some puzzles are really too brainy To begin Before talking about In Memoriam it is necessary to make a premise: the game differs greatly from the classic canons ofvideo game, therefore it requires the player to have the desire to try an experience that is in many ways new and interesting. I myself was initially very skeptical, for a whole series of reasons (from the use of Macromedia tools for the realization to the interactive film aspect that is initially misleading), to then discover several interesting strengths. In Memoriam is a product of the French Lexis Numerique, specialized in multimedia productions, and was created with particular and interesting criteria, which bring it closer to digital art than to the classic videogame product.", "date": "2003-11-14", "grade": null}
