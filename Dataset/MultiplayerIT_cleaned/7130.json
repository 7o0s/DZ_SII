In fact, sound plays a fundamental role in the field of exploration, because the vast urban scenario in which we move has been abandoned for years, after an event that effectively wiped out society as we know it, leaving control of the streets to diabolical creatures called precisely ~nether~; and therefore any noise, whether it is the whistling of the wind rather than the cawing of crows in the distance, or above all the characteristic ~growl~ of monsters, can make us jump and indicate the presence of a possible threat, to be faced openly or to escape from. The nethers are divided into various species, each with different characteristics in terms of danger, resistance, powers and modus operandi: some of them limit themselves to charging with their heads down, others spit out a dark liquid that prevents us from seeing, still others are they have wings and attack from above, or they are huge and can only be defeated through the use of certain weapons. All have the power to teleport a short distance, which makes fights particularly frenetic and challenging, whatever offensive tool we have. However, it is not only them that we will have to worry about, because what we pick up around could be tempting to other human beings... Nether is a fascinating survival game, full of potential which, however, is not expressed at its best Survivors and survivors The character we control in Nether is a hunter, a survivor who, like his fellows, wanders around the deserted city in search of food, bandages, rudimentary materials and weapons to use them as bargaining chips or as a basis for building bizarre but effective tools. such as single shot air pistols or even sniper rifles. We can determine the features of the avatar through a simple selector at the beginning of the game, changing the color of the skin or the clothes, perhaps trying to prefer dark shades to better hide in the dark from some dangerous sortie. In fact, there is nothing friendly in the game world, which has the defect of manifesting its fundamentally empty being in an all too evident way, forcing us to take long walks towards a point on the map where something interesting seems to be happening, or direct to one of the many ~safe areas~ where we can make our looting practices pay off through bartering and maybe get some water (essential for survival). Often tedious walks, which possibly culminate with an unpleasant but functional encounter with what is the gameplay of the Phosphor Games title, which precisely asks to explore, collect, barter, kill or be killed and finally repeat all over again. Yes, because one of the most important elements of this survival is permanent death, which literally frustrates our efforts when we stop living, whether it's at the hands of a nether or another human player, eager to take possession of the objects that we may have had such a hard time finding. Nothing is forever The frustration of seeing one's work frustrated, perhaps at the hands of a sniper strategically positioned outside a safe area, looking for targets with backpacks full of objects to grab, is unspeakable, but it is literally part of the game. So after the first ~reconnaissance~ games, when you finally enter the Nether mechanisms, this search for improvement takes on a deeper meaning than the one initially perceived. Moreover, the developers have built an experience system linked to the account rather than to the single character (as well as a ~global~ inventory, albeit not very large), with permanent perks that go, for example, to improve vitality or the ability to fight, and which join those that we can normally assign to our alter ego when we get hold of some experience points, usually at the end of a successfully completed mission or when we eliminate an enemy. Upgradable skills have a substantial impact on resistance to fatigue, the ability to move without being seen, the use of bladed or firearms, and so on, which means that the longer we survive in the game, the stronger and more dangerous we become . These aspects of the experience find further facets in cooperation with other players, which can take place when joining a clan or creating a group. We wanted to leave each party member free to do as they see fit, which yesit means that we may form an alliance only momentarily and have to constantly watch each other's backs. Never as in this case therefore, to enjoy the co-op to the fullest it is necessary to play with people we know. Look & feel The open spaces, the empty buildings, the grass that grows high on the walls and the many abandoned vehicles undoubtedly contribute to creating the desolate atmosphere of the Nether, and perhaps in this situation even the not so frequent encounters have their own reason. Accustomed to MMOs with decidedly simpler graphics, we enthusiastically welcomed the attention to detail that characterizes the aesthetics of the Phosphor Games title, even if the poor interaction with the environment and the repetitiveness of certain scenarios is not much help compared to the final results. We are talking about a product still in Early Access, which is updated continuously and which is probably waiting for greater popularity in view of the final release, which makes us turn a blind eye to some glitches (such as when climbing stairs) and blocks . On the test configuration the game performs well but not as much as one would expect, given the not very high level of detail, therefore there is a need for greater optimization (as well as better support for the controller). However, what definitely needs to be refined is the gameplay: the idea of hardcore survival and permanent death is fine, both niche but strongly characterizing elements, but the combat system cannot be so approximate and slippery, and at the same so the dead times, in which one wanders in search of objects or enemies, seemed excessive to us. Finally, we should aim with greater conviction at a certain model of cooperative action, also with a view to missions that are more varied than ~collect and transport~.", "date": "2014-05-12", "grade": "6.0"}
