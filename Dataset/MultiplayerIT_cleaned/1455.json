Ten different environments that are distributed through increasingly challenging courses in three classes (amateurs, pros and champions). This is the framework on which its muscles rest, Top Gear Rally. Yes, because we are talking about muscles as soon as the eye is struck and fascinated by the supreme work that is hidden behind the Tantalus 3D engine. It is enough to throw yourself into the classic ~quick race~ to realize that in TGR there is much, much more than what we were used to seeing in racing games on GBA. The feeling of concreteness that the overall vision gives is undoubtedly the best that has ever been achieved in this genre. View of the track always clear, clean and present as far as the eye can see (when you are in suitable weather conditions and the route does not have particular gradients), over two hundred polygons dedicated to reproducing the eight cars in the race, equipped with a beautiful AI that gives life to exciting clashes even between the contenders that precede us and photorealistic backdrops to paint canyons, lakes and sea and mountain landscapes are just the very first elements that make Top Gear Rally the most rewarding rallying experience on GBA. To further embellish an already artfully packaged product, the exceptional playability of the title comes into play, which is put at the service of the visual jubilation described above. Through the simple interface of the Game Boy Advance it is really possible to immerse yourself in every little little facet of this driving experience. The response to every solicitation (curves, trajectory corrections, braking and skidding with the handbrake) is always precise and punctual, a few races are enough to start getting satisfaction and to bring out, perhaps, the only weak point of the game, that is the ease with which the first Championship is completed. It is natural that each player's approach may be different but it is a fact that the first amateur championship (albeit long and full of circuits and variables) fits into the framework as an integral part of the so-called ~learning curve~ to then show up to the other two classes (pro and champions) ready for the challenge with themselves and the opponents managed by the CPU. Wanting to search with difficulty, another small flaw, the lack of an official license should be noted, which however does not affect anything, obviously from the point of view of the enjoyment of the title but not even from the cosmetics. The cars enjoy a truly remarkable detail and even if they don't show trademarks and brands you will find the inspirations to the most famous Subaru, Toyota and so on models very recognizable. Spectacularity governs the entire playing system, bumps that transform into trampolines for jumps at full speed while, in flight, you can already admire the evolution of the track, opponents who systematically aim for the decisive shot to throw you off balance at a critical moment with consequent spins or real 360-degree rollovers (simply priceless if inflicted on the opponent) and atmospheric conditions (snow, rain, mud) which heavily influence the race, forcing you (naturally when entering the championship mode) to always check the weather situation and then choose the right set of tyres. The sound sector, while not entering Olympus, does its duty very well, especially in game. The co-pilot's samples are always punctual and of good quality, as are the ~samples~ of the engines under stress. The music, as ancillary and present only in the passages between the various pre-race menus, does not excite but is anything but annoying. Assorted modes and goodies. The important amount of modes and options offers different approaches to the game itself. We go from the more arcade style of the Fast Race and Time Attack to the decidedly more simulative one of the Championship with attached garage where you can collect new cars (advancing in the championship from circuit to circuit) and develop them ad hoc for the race you are going to face. There is also the Practice in which to customize the track with the classic cones and refine one's driving technique and the multiplayer link mode which also requires the double cartridge. Finally, through a password system it is also possible to enter your times on the official website in order to be included in the Top Gear Rally world ranking. Comment Top Gear Rally presents itself, at times, as a small visual revolution in this genre of games, merging an engine and a care of great impact withn truly refined gameplay. The challenge, while taking shape only in the more advanced modes, is very good and is in any case compensated by a considerable replayability aimed at improving as well as by the enjoyment of the title itself, in the true sense of the term. You really ~enjoy~ the game while you have it in your hands. A little gem. Pros: Wonderful 3D engine Very refined gameplay Modes in abundance Cons: A bit too easy for amateurs The lack of official licenses ... for those who cannot do without them The Game Boy Advance, in an environment that seems unable to do without the dialectical rather than commercial console war, has always lived in a strange condition of untouchability. Nothing has ever managed to scratch the aura of the only true oracle in the handheld sector. Beyond an obvious lack of real competition, the GBA has always enjoyed the largest software park that has ever inhabited a console, regardless of the bittage or the brand you go to examine. Despite everything (especially after the recent appearance of new contenders in the portable realm), the dispute has always arisen about how a 32-bit technology like the one exploited by Nintendo could give more in the management of 3D. The preamble leads straight to a first tangible opportunity to assign Nintendo a few ~rounds~ of the dialectical game we were talking about a few lines above. Top Gear Rally, from the Kemco/Tantalus duo, has several answers in its DNA, many of which are simply exciting.", "date": "2003-12-11", "grade": null}
