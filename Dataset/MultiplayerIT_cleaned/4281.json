We are not thinking only of the recent new chapter of God of War, all focused on Norse mythology, but also of the latest Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia, which we deal with here. The last chapters of the famous strategic series had moved to an incredibly satisfying fantasy universe: without renouncing the usual amount of management content, however, the result was a completely fictional product, extremely distant from the moments of the series that had brought us face to face with Attila or with the Japanese empire. Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia represents a step backwards and forwards at the same time: it looks to the past, recovering the historical theme and a documentary basis; and at the same time inaugurates a precise trend, implied by that ~Saga~ in the title, circumscribing a well-defined time frame... that of the birth of a modern and fierce England, fighting against the Vikings. Game of Thrones... Anglo-Saxon The year 878 AD it represents a very important moment in the history of England. The Vikings have consolidated their occupation in the central-eastern regions of the country and are beginning to seriously threaten the neighboring territories as well. However, they did not reckon with Alfred, King of Wessex (then the western English kingdom), who rallies all available forces and defeats them at the battle of Ethandun. Thanks to the enormous success he is not only remembered as ~Alfredo the Great~, but he is also the first to be recognized and acclaimed ~King of England~. We know that Viking raids and their revenge on English soil, however, continued at least until the first half of the year one thousand: Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia carves out its own niche in the years from the Battle of Ethandun onwards, violent and restless years, threatened not only by the Nordic invaders but also by civil wars. It is the first attempt of the Total War series to embrace a smaller historical period than expected, while at the same time directing a large number of resources in the most faithful historical reconstruction possible. The sources of this juncture of English history are more incomplete than necessary, both from the point of view of the relations between the local sovereigns and in the use of military techniques, let alone with regard to the Normans: all right, perhaps the warlike stories their account are more legendary than real, but they certainly weren't a people of writers. In this way, numerous details of Thrones of Britannia turn out to be plausible reconstructions rather than results of a historiographical inspection, but the overall production is practically never affected and demonstrates once again how a video game can be a very valid tool for cultural study. But let's leave aside our considerations on the educational value of the Total War historical series for a moment, and let's focus on the actual playful offer. The Creative Assembly strategy returns to show itself to players with extremely familiar interfaces and modes for those who have had the pleasure of discovering the previous chapters of the series, not necessarily those of fantasy derivation. The campaign allows us to immediately start our story on English soil, choosing one of the five different cultures present (if we want we can also play as the Vikings). Each of these cultures has two factions each inside, for a total of ten, a stimulus to a surprisingly interesting replay value, especially considering that the proposed approach and level of difficulty changes significantly based on our choice. The different factions compete with each other for the territories of England, but when necessary they do not disdain alliances, treaties and coalition armies, always with a view to personal interest and mutual benefits. Each faction has a very specific historical cultural background, a particular way of fighting, its own lifestyle and above all passive bonuses that will always remain active during the game; newcomers would probably do well to choose Alfred the Great's Wessex faction to start the first campaign, in order to get into the game quickly. Not that Creative Assembly has skimped from this point of view: in an effective dubbing in Italian and screen texts translated into a simple and dry syntax, the developers show us the commands, the possibilities and the many paths to take. A mass of information decidedly bodyyou know, but where it's not so much worth putting everything in your mind in a hurry, as experimenting on the field with the various options proposed by Total War, slowly making them our own. Endless possibilities Whichever faction you choose, English or Viking, Welsh or Gaelic, the goal will be to become great, powerful and important, accumulating one victory after another, be it military, diplomatic or cultural. The vast game map shows our kingdom and neighboring and distant provinces in detail, distinguishing enemies and allies. There are so many parameters to keep under control, enough to have earned Creative Assembly's products the right reputation for quality strategy, even if from time to time some mechanics turn out to be more superficial than others. Not only the economic income and the fame of our leader are important, but also the decisions we will take for the development of our territories and the political games that will take place in the background. Diplomatic relations in Thrones of Britannia are never as obvious as they might seem and certainly are not limited to a handful of clicks to be monitored from time to time: without paying due attention to a precise ally, the latter could turn his back on us in the time of need or worse still allying with populations hostile to us. Diplomacy allows us to make a series of offers or counter-offers to our neighbours: we can marry their sovereign to one of our daughters in an attempt to bind him to us, bribe him with sums of money, lend him part of our army against his internal enemies, hoping that pays us back in time of need. It's just a small taste of a strategic weapon, diplomacy, which in Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia plays an incredibly important role, equal in weight to what you expect to find in evidence right away: brute force. How were problems solved in the Ninth Century after Christ, if not with violence? When it comes to deploying our troops, Thrones of Britannia offers us some more immediate options for those who don't intend to get their hands dirty personally: automatic battles (in which the step is skipped and the winner is determined by artificial intelligence) , surrender (with all its negative consequences) and the actual way in which we manually guide our forces. In the latter case, Total War loads a separate game section (taking longer than we would like) and leaves us free in every sense. Victory or defeat depends on our skills as strategists, but also on an equally high and important number of factors: the troops deployed, their subdivision, formation, their disposition, the level of hunger of the troops, their respect for the commander and much more. A single defeat can have disastrous effects for our kingdom, but then a victory could simply make the friends of the fallen monarch hostile to us, leaving us with more problems than solutions.", "date": "2018-05-03", "grade": "8.0"}
