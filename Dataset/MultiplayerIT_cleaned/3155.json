Martin finally decides to write his ending, perhaps less controversial. Net of these considerations, the franchise created by the American author still has great charm and his world can be the basis for countless stories, especially if set in the past to the events we already know. As in the case of the mobile game developed by Behavior Interactive, which throws us back 48 years with respect to the events of Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, putting us in the shoes of an officer of the Night's Watch who must solve the mystery of the disappearance of Lord Commander Brynden Rivers, known as ~Blood Raven~. The game can count on cutscenes of surprising quality, characterized by a graphic style very similar to that of the Telltale Games adventures, which are used to unravel the events of the plot and form the glue in the single player campaign between turn-based combat and another, involving us, deepening the characters and providing us with good reasons to move forward. Will we get to discover the truth? Gameplay and structure Beyond the excellent cutscenes, which highlight a production value that is anything but trivial for a mobile game, and which we found a little disappointing only due to the lack of spoken dialogues (wanting to keep only the text, because making the lips move protagonists?), Game of Thrones: Beyond the Wall soon reveals its gacha-style strategic RPG gameplay, with inevitable references to microtransactions and a free-to-play model that is only permissive up to a certain point. The first hours flow quite calmly, however, and showcase a traditional but fairly solid formula, which allows you to create your own group of heroes, summon new ones and upgrade them according to well-tested mechanics. All with a view to tackling the six chapters of the main campaign, as well as the extra missions of various special events, some of which allow you to control well-known characters such as the aforementioned Jon Snow and Daenerys, but also Jaime Lannister, Tormund and Melisandre all 'inside specific scenarios. In short, the developers have tried to enrich the game structure in various ways, but as anticipated, the freemium component comes to the surface quite quickly, in the form of very resistant enemies, which force you to repeat missions already completed in order to get the upgrades you need to move forward. The dear old grinding, in essence, which must inevitably be taken into account but which we would have liked to see emerge a little later.", "date": "2020-04-01", "grade": "7.0"}
