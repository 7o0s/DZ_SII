{"name": "Crazy Penguin Catapult", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-penguin-catapult.html", "text": "Crazy Penguin Catapult is a nice and original mix between a puzzle game and a strategy game. To frame it, it is useful to think of the game structure of any Lemmings episode, with stages that must be ~solved~ with a series of interventions by the player. The penguins have decided to rebel against the overwhelming power of the polar bears, and so they launch into a series of kamikaze attacks against their longtime enemies, with the ultimate goal of freeing their imprisoned companions. To succeed in this enterprise, they rely on a powerful catapult, capable of projecting them over the areas inhabited by bears; then they dive like projectiles, destroying everything in their path. It is clear that an action of this type could not be told except with bright humorous tones, and in this sense the Digital Chocolate developers have done a slap-up job: just take a look at the stage loading screens, in which we see illustrations with bears playing bowling using penguins as skittles, or mocking them after having imprisoned them in cages, and so on. Those are wrongs that need to be righted, aren't they? The action takes place in two phases: in the first, we will have to launch the available penguins with the catapult, activating the machine with the right timing so as not to spread our ~bullets~ against the walls of the cave; in the second, we'll see the penguins that we've successfully launched fly over the bears' heads, and we'll be able to make them dive by pressing the FIRE button. The objective of each stage is to eliminate all the bears, even in the presence of obstacles (walls of ice, for example) which must be destroyed by sacrificing some ~ammunition~. The trajectory that the penguins take as soon as we order them to fall is not straight, therefore we will have to calculate the times and distances carefully to hit the target, and we will also be able to count on the ~rebounds~ that will follow the initial crash, and which will be just as useful for removing Bears out of the way: Throwing a penguin into a group of three bears in a row will likely hit them all with ricochets. The layout of the stages appears in the form of a navigable map: we will be able to repeat the missions as many times as we want, especially if we have not been able to complete them 100%. From time to time, the normal levels will be joined by bonus levels, in which we will have to launch the penguins with the catapult inside an enclosed environment, to collect all the objects that are in mid-air. Completing a certain number of stages entitles us to acquire one of the available upgrades: ~burning penguin~, ~explosive penguin~, ~ninja penguin~, increased rebounds, ability to easily penetrate ice, etc. Each of these upgrades is essential for tackling the more advanced stages, where we will find bears protected by more or less resistant structures, or even hidden in hard-to-reach underground areas. The standard game mode is also accompanied by a very simple ~puzzle~ mode, in which we find a table with penguins and polar bears, with the aim of conquering all the boxes. The graphics of the game are really excellent, more for the style adopted than for a purely technical issue: both the penguins and the bears boast a spot-on and nice design, with a good number of animations for every situation. A little more subdued are the foreground elements of the stages, which unfortunately tend to repeat themselves, while the background images are very beautiful. The use of colors is excellent. As for the sound, we have music that accompanies the action in the right way, making it catchy even if not unforgettable. It is possible to adjust the volume independently from the mobile phone, a possibility always very appreciated by smartphone owners. Finally, the control system is extremely simple and intuitive, based on the use of the FIRE button alone to carry out any action or to activate any power-up. PRO Simple, fun, addictive Excellent technical realization Well thought out upgrades AGAINST There are not many levels The secondary game mode is a bit useless Not for polar bear fans...", "date": "2008-02-22", "grade": "S.V."}
