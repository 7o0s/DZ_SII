A system tested in many other titles, but which works badly here due to the poor reactivity of the car on the screen: although the game includes only and exclusively sports cars, the feeling is more that of commanding a truck, such is the heaviness of the steering. Also insufficient are the management of drifts (which it is difficult to direct exactly where you want) and the collision system, apparently completely arbitrary and which does not hesitate to punish the user with a total block of the car for a simple swipe as well as to minimize the collision with a van by applying a negligible loss of speed. Need for Speed: Undercover presents such a variety of gaps that every positive idea - and there are several - is inevitably stifled in the bud: one thinks, for example, of the more than good diversification of available events, ranging from simple races on tracks to acceleration challenges, going through daring police chases and decidedly picturesque sections such as those in which it is necessary to produce more damage than the opposing car within a limited time. The set of cars available during the game is also satisfactory, all reproductions of real models that can be modified and customized using colors, decals and so on. Too bad that these are still aspects that definitely take a back seat when there is no play structure up to the situation. And the technical realization of the product is also not particularly glorious, a situation to which Wii users are now dramatically accustomed. Visually, Need for Speed: Undercover offers quite poor scenarios from a polygonal point of view, debased by poor texture definition and omnipresent (and annoying) pop-in phenomena. Particularly negative are also the use of colors and the exploitation of a questionable graphic effect which theoretically should have represented the refraction of the sun on the asphalt, but which in reality leaves the viewer with the impression that the roads are covered with a kind of patina gelatinous. Only the sound sector is saved from the abyss, and not even completely: the dubbing in Italian is not the best, while the effects do their duty and the soundtrack offers a good musical accompaniment equally divided between the currently coolest genres. Three is (not) the magic number Need for Speed: Undercover is the third installment in the series to be ported to Wii, following the Carbon and ProStreet editions released over the past two years. On balance, EA still does not seem to have found the right formula on the Nintendo console, given that all the titles released so far are results of the ~poor~ versions of the PS3 and Xbox360 counterparts. The hope is that, for future chapters, EA decides to follow the path already followed by important franchises such as FIFA and Skate, which have been able to enjoy ~revised and corrected~ versions more oriented towards the specific characteristics of the Wii. Comment Need for Speed: Undercover for Wii presents all the defects found in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, adding to an already rather problematic picture flaws such as a poorly performing control system, very questionable physical routines and a graphics sector that suffers heavily from the technical limitations of the Nintendo consoles. A large fleet of cars and a good variety of modes available are the only positive aspects of the Black Box product, which fans would do better simply to archive as an unpleasant misstep in the series. Pros Varied game modes Well stocked fleet Cons Flawed gameplay Technically mediocre Unsatisfactory control system Need for Speed: The Fast and the Furious As highlighted several times in the preview phase, one of the innovative features of this Need for Speed: Undercover compared to the previous ones lies in the strong weight given to the storyline component, which sees the user impersonate an undercover police officer who must enter the criminal circuit which revolves around a group of clandestine racers. In reality, the plot is not particularly original or compelling, above all due to a series of cutscenes with real-life actors that end up producing the opposite effect to that hoped: instead of involving the player more, the quality of series B of these sequences makes them involuntarily comic, despite EA's effort to enlist names of a certain level (apart from the sexy Maggie Q, faces already seen in successful TV series are recognizable). the setting is yes open, but completely devoid of content Need for Speed: The Fast and the Furious Unfortunately for Need for Speed: Undercover, this is the first in a long series of defects which, as we will see, mainly concern the gameplay and the technical realization of the product. To begin with, the developers of Black Box have committed a colossal basic ingenuity, providing a setting that is open, but completely devoid of content that stimulates the user to explore: the city is dramatically empty, and you don't even need cross it to switch from one event to another, since it is possible to save yourself the hassle by acting on the game map. And it cannot even be said that the open environment contributes at least to making competitions lively, allowing you to take the path you prefer (as in Burnout Paradise): with another apparently logical choice, the development team has well thought of placing nice barriers in the vast majority of events, effectively reducing the races to simple laps on predefined tracks. Evidently Black Box wanted to take a step back after the criticisms of ProStreet, returning to the free roaming formula: but putting it into practice in this way was completely counterproductive. However, all these are negative elements that the Wii version has in common with its PS3 and Xbox 360 counterparts, but the Nintendo incarnation can also ~boast~ another macroscopic production oversight: the streets of the city are in fact almost totally devoid of traffic, and the few cars that cross your path often magically appear a few meters away from the car you are driving, making a collision inevitable in some cases.", "date": "2008-12-05", "grade": null}
