The map on which the robots move. The menu that is accessed when our flagship arrives on stage. A very... original Super Robot Taisen As mentioned, the greatest attraction of Super Robot Taisen lies in the presence of the Japanese robots known to all those nostalgic for the 80s. However, Banpresto has included original robots in the series from the very first episodes who acted as ~protagonists~ and who developed a main plot around a series of very well-characterized characters. It took several years and several commercial confirmations, but in the end the developers decided to make an episode (two, actually) of Super Robot Taisen in which the so-called ~Originals~ are the masters and are the undisputed protagonists, with total lack of any other robot that is not an original creation of Banpresto. And it is precisely from this Super Robot Taisen Original Generation that Atlus, with an honestly somewhat controversial move (giving up the popularity of the various Mazinger and Gundam right at the debut?), inaugurates what we hope will be a long series of localizations. Robots aside, OG does not differ in structure and gameplay from all previous Super Robot Taisen: it is a turn-based strategy game in which you move around a map and face, with your team of robots, a number variable number of opponents, almost always with the aim of making a clean sweep. The attack/counterattack dynamic is perfect. very clear to fans of the series. In Super Robot Taisen OG they make a comeback... ...all Originals ever to appear in the regular series. The Divine War The home screen of Super Robot Taisen OG is the classic one for the Banpresto series, with the possibility of starting a new game, continuing an already started one or loading a save (two slots are available). Once a new game has started, we move on to another task that fans of the series are used to, namely the choice of character, in this case limited to two profoundly different types: Ryusei and Kasuga. Whichever selection is made, one is immediately catapulted into the plot with dialogues and textual interludes, which make it extremely clear from the outset who are the ~good guys~, who are the ~bad guys~ and what are the dynamics that lead to clash. As in all Super Robot Taisen, also in OG our alter ego will change robots throughout history, gradually passing to more powerful models without prejudice to the ever-present possibility of improving every aspect of all the robots in the team between missions and the other, by spending the money earned in battles to make the various weapons more effective or to increase the characteristics that characterize each machine, and which play a leading role when a fight occurs. Technical realization Super Robot Taisen Original Generation is not the most technically advanced episode that the Banpresto series can boast on the GameBoy Advance. The game remains faithful to the classic setting: the weapons can be upgraded one by one, as well as the characteristics of the robots; and the graphics of the clashes do present a good number of animations, but not as many as seen in the previous episodes Super Robot Taisen Advance and Super Robot Taisen R, much more spectacular from this point of view. But it is in particular the sound that appears subdued: the music of the series has always been excellent, but above all due to the presence of the themes taken from the cartoons, which in this case are obviously missing. The sound effects are the usual, without infamy or praise. As far as the control system is concerned, also in this case there are no news: the two main buttons of the GBA are used for selection and cancellation, while the backbones are used only to speed up the textual phases. The game is translated into English and there is no Italian; but there is no need to exaggerate with the requests, we are still at the beginning of the western adventure of Super Robot Taisen, which we hope will also be long and full of successes. OG's animations are sadly below average for the series on the GBA. Each character has unique characteristics, which can be upgraded in various ways. The key to success is carefully evaluate the possibilities; of success of each attack. Comment Judging Super Robot Taisen Original Generation is not easy, far from it. For the western debut of the series it was reasonable to expect an episode that contained all the most famous robots, even if this meant rediscovering the first releases on GBA, and instead Atlus' choice fell on what is in fact a spin-off, which is presented to the playersfor what it is and cannot enjoy the popularity of its characters. That said, OG has indisputable merits: it is quite long (like all Super Robot Taisen), contains a large number of robots and these robots can be upgraded at will. Moreover, it is possible to assign the pilots as you see fit to mix the cards or simply to favor the approach you prefer. So we are faced with an excellent turn-based strategy, which in this first western incarnation has to face a tough battle relying only on its own strength and hoping that the choice made will give the desired results, despite the lack of rocket punches and the space halberd. Pros: A must for fans of the series Solid, engaging and long-lived Interesting storyline, finally in an understandable language Cons: No cartoon robots Lacking innovations compared to the other episodes Technically inferior to the average of the series on GBA There are quite a few videogames that have never arrived in the West because they are ~too Japanese~, and the Super Robot Taisen series (or Super Robot Wars, which in fact would have been more correct for our local edition) is certainly the most clear of a success that has lasted since the days of the GameBoy and which has been repeated from episode to episode, reaching around forty total releases on the most disparate consoles (GameBoy precisely, but also PSone, PlayStation2, GameCube, etc.). It is a project that sees its strong point in the presence of robots that have made the history of Japanese cartoons (from Mazinger Z to Grendizer, from Gundam to Gotrinitron, from Trider G7 to Godmars...), united to face the terrible threat posed by the union of all their bitter enemies. Western publishers have been postponing the localization of Super Robot Taisen for too long, forcing players to buy the episodes in the Japanese version and precluding any possible use of the plot and dialogues, as well as the correct understanding of the game menus and attacks. Finally the situation has unblocked itself, and the American Atlus has decided to distribute a title of the SRT series in the USA, which then arrived in Italy thanks to 505 Games.", "date": "2007-05-31", "grade": null}
