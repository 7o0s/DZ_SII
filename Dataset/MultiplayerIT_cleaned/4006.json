{"name": "SoulCalibur 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-calibur-6-recensione.html", "text": "~A tale of souls and swords, eternally retold~. Starting the SoulCalibur 6 review with this sentence is a headlong dive into conformity, but ours is a conscious leap, almost necessary, since the chapter we are about to tell you about is in all probability the most representative of the unforgettable motto that has always accompanied Namco's historic fighting game saga. SoulCalibur VI has in fact been defined by many as a ~reboot~, yet it does not actually try to reset the series and give it new life as happened for Mortal Kombat IX: the title of Motohiro Okubo and his boys is a crystalline fusion of souls, finally capable to intelligently unify the competitive elements inserted with the fifth episode (among the most hated, due to the content sacrifice that this entailed) and the many additional factors that had made the saga also loved by an audience commonly far from the genre, all consolidating the original story. And we want to clarify it: although the transformation process was not perfect or totally painless, the final result really amazed us, in all likelihood coming to sit on the throne of his eclectic little family. Unlimited Blade stories We haven't talked about ~consolidating~ the original story at random, because SoulCalibur VI restarts the mythology of the game, but carefully avoids making potentially disastrous cuts and changes for the general progress of the narrative. The development team has practically made additions to the original events - which still see Kilik and Siegfried at the center of the whirlwind of events unleashed by the evil Soul Edge - expanding the individual adventures of the various characters, and creating a sort of amalgam capable of containing them all sensibly. Two different modalities have arisen from their work: the Chronicles of the Soul and the Libra of the Soul; where the first is nothing but the set of adventures of the various characters carefully divided in chronological order, while the second is a curious campaign dedicated to your own personalized character, full of missions, RPG elements and various goodies. As mentioned, one could think of two completely detached modes, but Bandai Namco has done a fine job, and during the Libra of the Soul you will meet almost all the fighters in the game, obtaining ~secret records~ which will then complete the Chronicles with extra info. Put simply, SoulCalibur VI does not offer multiple paths in single adventures like the third chapter, but manages to make the player really feel inside the narrative background, making it a cornerstone of the complex events surrounding Soul Edge and SoulCalibur. The trick used to obtain a similar result is textbook: in the main campaign your alter ego is in all respects a Malfestato warrior - one of the poor people ~infected~ by the wickedness of the cursed sword - who can freely choose whether to be corrupted by negative energies that pervade it, or fight hard to purify them. Based on the moral choices made, you will have to deal with various tasks and fighters, until the final confrontation with the new antagonist: Azwel (the biggest ~modifier~ of the new course together with the addition of Groh). The hard way of bushido We weren't even kidding when we brought up the RPG elements in the speech. In fact, Libra of the Soul allows you to level up your character, select at any time which weapon to use (with relative change of style, based on the preset ones of the fighters on the roster), and even to hire mercenaries and upgrade your equipment thanks to a blacksmith. It works great, despite a slow initial progression and a few too many easy battles; and the motivation is to be found in the constant desire of the developers to offer new more or less interesting subplots to the player, and to vary almost every battle with multiple modifiers. Between clashes with slippery floors, enhanced opponents, malus or bonuses at the start, and much more, it therefore becomes difficult to get bored, within a mode that even allows you to explore the map almost freely (provided you spend some of the money earned during the progress and risk random encounters), in order not to fixate too much on the main storyline. In practice, it is a nice evolution of what was done with the Weapon Master Mode and the Chronicles of the Sword, overall less original but also significantly more fun. Speaking of character creation, then, it is appropriate to detail the editor, because this option is back in full force in SoulCalibur 6, with a good myriadde of aesthetic options - largely taken from the other characters - starting from the choice of race. On the other hand, the player moves in a world where vampires, mummies, elves, demonic creatures, dimensional portals, lizard men (~especially~ lizard men) and... Witchers, at least for the moment, coexist without too many landslides. Also because the guest character of this chapter is still the good Geralt of Rivia, and we are talking about an extra cared for beyond belief, capable of offering a truly unique fighting style that places him at the top of the list of guest characters in the saga ( just a pity that it is not customizable, unlike the other warriors). The rest of the roster, in any case, has very little to envy to our trusted witcher, even with the little sense absence of Shoots at launch and the Season Pass already confirmed. Graceful broadsides On the other hand, the variety in SoulCalibur VI is certainly not lacking: the development team's choice was to recover almost all the most loved classic characters of the series, partially resume their move list, and perfect it with a series of modifications and additions to make each fighter new without alienating his old fans. To add even more pepper there is an important reworking of the Soul Charge: a short-lived temporary enhancement, which has variable effects on warriors, unlocks additional moves, and can overturn a match if used properly. Certain swordsmen (Geralt in particular, but he is certainly not the only one to obtain a hallucinating enhancement from the charge) obtain very important additional strategies thanks to the Soul Charge, which go well with the technicalities taken from the fifth episode - including the Critical Edges (the super, in other words), and the inevitable Reactive Guards - for a combat system that in general manages to be as fast, accessible and fun as that of the second beloved SoulCalibur, but competitive enough to be able to have its say even among the most hardcore aficionados. The only doubt regarding the gameplay of SoulCalibur 6 lies in a new mechanic seen here for the first time: the Inverted Edge, or Reversal Edge, if you prefer. This is a shot capable of absorbing opponents' attacks (even shots in series), which once hit starts a spectacular animation that can be solved with multiple choices. It works, in a nutshell, like a more complex variation of rock, paper, scissors, almost entirely based on luck, and can be irritating if used constantly by one's opponent. That said, it's not an ignorant mechanic if analyzed in detail: using it is risky, as it tends to be slow and easily dodged with a simple side step; moreover, its main effectiveness lies in the ability to reposition the two fighters and eliminate heavy pressure situations, as well as in the bar gain of the super it offers (very important in certain cases, precisely because it is linked to both Critical Edge and Soul Charges). It's being used very little at a high level right now, but we're clearly only talking about pre-launch tournaments, and we expect to see it exploited in some pretty brilliant ways in the future. For heaven's sake, perhaps we would have preferred a faster bar gain and a ~pure~ system, but we really don't think that the Inverted Cut can ruin such a solid base, and indeed its random element makes the clashes even more spectacular to watch, albeit with the right criticisms. Oil and sharpen Therefore, the online remains to be analyzed, which offers inevitable options such as the player's matches in the lobby and the classified challenges, but does not reserve any surprises. More difficult is the netcode, the bete noire of almost every fighting game, which we have not had the opportunity to evaluate precisely before the release, due to the almost total absence of players. Now, the few online matches that we have had the opportunity to face against European users have gone smoothly as oil, so well as to make us smell a potentially more functional and valid situation than that seen in the last Tekken; however, the matchmaking still needs to be fully analyzed, which seems to have problems similar to those of the beta (if you are looking for connections of a specific level, you practically never find matches, and it is necessary to eliminate the restrictions) and requires an active community to be eventually retouched. Overall, however, we are very confident. On the technical sector, on the other hand, we are less ecstatic. SoulCalibur VI is certainly not bad, however it is also very far from excellence, since the level of detail has been significantly sacrificed to favor the use of customizable characters and maintain high fluiditygeneral garlic. Where the first episodes showed the muscles of the consoles to which they belong, here they have gone a bit to savings, with suggestive but blurred arenas in the distance, scenic but not particularly refined particles, and a number of moving polygons that are anything but surprising. In short, the general impression is that of a title with a lot of love and passion behind it, but resources not exactly from Rockefeller to support everything. Not bad, love can be seen, and how.", "date": "2018-10-17", "grade": "8.8"}
