Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Just a few weeks ago Candy Crush Saga celebrated half a billion downloads (we repeat: half a billion downloads) and more than 150 billion games played by users from all over the world. We can therefore speak of a stratospheric success for the match-3 style puzzle game developed by King, who has also created other titles over time and tried to explore different mechanics, even without meeting the same response. We were therefore waiting with curiosity for the release of Farm Heroes Saga, because it is in many ways a real sequel to the ~game with sweets~, however adopting a completely new setting, that of the happy farm, and inserting some innovative elements. The game starts from a very similar structure to that of the other productions of the English team, with the traditional path that is enriched with new stages as updates are released and shows us the position and the results achieved by our friends on Facebook to whom As usual, we will be able to ask for help when we run out of lives or need to unlock a new area. From this point of view, things have not changed, in the sense that there is an inevitable obstacle to overcome by using hard currency (gold bars) or by resorting to friendships. On other fronts, however, it must be admitted that Farm Heroes Saga appears less demanding than Candy Crush Saga and allows you to play for free with less effort, also thanks to the boosters that recharge over time and therefore do not have to be purchased every time. Farm Heroes Saga is a cute and fun puzzle game, even if the genre seems to have said it all by now In the old factory The elements on the Farm Heroes Saga board are not candies, as mentioned at the beginning, but objects that have to do with agriculture: apples, carrots, onions (complete with a teardrop), strawberries, drops of water and rays of sun, but sometimes also eggs and flowers. These last categories represent one of the variations on the theme: in the case of eggs, you have to mate three or more so that they begin to hatch, forming a new type of element, after which they are paired again so that the shell hatches and a chick comes out ready to run away ; in the case of flowers, however, it is necessary to carry out eliminations in the adjacent areas for the bud to open completely. Furthermore, depending on the stage, there are also modifiers that work on the squares of the board, such as grass, which multiplies the value of the eliminated objects, or frost, which requires additional maneuvers to make it disappear. Added to this is a conformation of the stages that is not always linear but, on the contrary, often angular and complex, capable of further increasing the degree of challenge. Finally there are the boss fights, which must be completed by collecting a certain amount of a single type of object to cause enough damage to the enemy. The system described so far manages to obtain a strong characterization thanks to the importance of the combos and bonuses, in this case the multiplication of the value of each single element so that the quota required from time to time can be reached more easily. Too bad that in the end the match-3 style gameplay does not come out sufficiently refreshed by the operation, which was also conducted with attention and attention to detail. The cause is certainly the high degree of inflation of this kind of puzzle game, which by now has said it all on iOS and Android and would need substantial changes rather than small variations.", "date": "2014-01-11", "grade": "7.0"}
