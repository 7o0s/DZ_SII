{"name": "Mercury Meltdown Revolution - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mercury-meltdown-revolution-recensione.html", "text": "Mercury Wii Many of the Wii users who do their utmost to follow the market trend are, at present, rather bored by the attitude of third parties: the developers seem to believe more in the commercial potential of the console than in the purely playful ones. This phenomenon has led to the publication of various titles identical  if not even worse  to the PS2 versions, both in terms of graphics and, above all, in the controls, often only marginally enriched by the particularities of the Wiimote. Mercury is also a conversion, but in the specific case it certainly cannot give rise to controversy: although the subtitle (Meltdown Revolution) may make it appear as a sequel or a spin-off, this is probably the version closest to the one that the developers had in mind initially. The management of the mercury sphere has remained as detailed and credible as in previous appearances, but everything is now supported by the motion sensor present in the Wiimote, which on this occasion proves to be sensitive even to the slightest movements. Puzzle Games For those who haven't had the pleasure of enjoying one of the previous episodes, Mercury is a puzzle game in which you have to lead a small amount of mercury from point A to point B on a given platform. The player does not directly control the sphere, but must direct it by tilting the plane on which it rests exactly as in Monkey Ball, but, contrary to Monkey Ball, the progression of the game is based more on puzzles than on action: this is because the mercury tends to create strong friction with the underlying surface, and its movements are slower than those of the plastic ball in the Sega game. The wiimote must be held horizontally, as is usually done in driving games: although this choice generally limits the freedom offered by the Nintendo pad, in this case it is certainly the right decision, as it gives greater stability to movements. Mercury's physics as mentioned before are excellent, as are the controls (the classic controller is also compatible, but there is no valid reason to use it), but what enhances both aspects is the commendable level design: there are about one hundred and fifty internships, but despite the rather high number, there is rarely a drop in quality. There are many solutions capable of varying the experience, the constant being that of attributing a precise color to the finish line: at the beginning of each level, the mercury is in its natural gray tone, but often, along the way, the player will have to change it - through particular platforms - before reaching the end of the stage. In the first moments of the game this concept is peripheral, extremely simple mutations are requested, such as for example to vary from gray to red. However, as the levels progress, celestial goals will arrive, and the celestial implies the fusion of a Blue ball with a Green one (the colors are subject to the laws of spectroscopy, the three primary ones therefore are red, green and blue, not red, yellow and blue ): in addition to the difficulty of finding the appropriate platforms you will therefore have to originate two different spheres by impacting the initial one against an edge. Mercury can be split at will and at any point where it would actually be possible to split it, thanks to an intelligent application of the physics engine. The situations that are created within the stages are truly extravagant, between enemies - pass the term - mercurophages, slopes of the ground, barriers, platforms and mobile walls: what is even more appreciable is the impression of being faced with a cohesive game , with a decisive overview, in which few elements are left to chance. When does mercury expire? As mentioned before, the game is divided into about one hundred and fifty levels, most of which have been forcefully transferred from the PSP version. The last stages are much more demanding, but in general almost all of them offer a good challenge if your goal is to complete them with the maximum possible score: in each of them there are two bonuses to collect, and the final result is linked to the speed of execution and the amount of mercury lost en route. Getting a high score in the puzzles, as well as representing a hypothetical personal whim, also allows you to unlock mini-games that can be played in single and multiplayer: there are five, quite varied in purpose, quite disappointing in practice. Between a failed clone of Wipeout and a sort of lethargic bowling with mercury balls, the only one to save is a crazy rodeo on a demonic hopping platform. The technical implementation is functional for playful purposes, extremely simpleand minimal in both aesthetics and sound, not particularly refined in stylistic choices but appreciable overall. The one for Wii is the best version of Mercury, as well as being the closest to the original idea of the developers: the control system is precise, comfortable and engaging, while the rest remains on the levels of excellence recorded on Sony consoles. The design of the stages is inspired, the mercury physics realistic and above all perfectly integrated into the game mechanics: Ignition's work will surely appeal to puzzle game lovers, being the best representative of the genre on Wii, but the lack of a multiplayer mode at the height still makes itself felt. Pros Well-calibrated control Heterogeneous design Believable and functional physics Challenging in single... Cons ... but lacking in multiplayer Many stages carried over from the PS2/PSP versions Mercury was presented for the first time years ago, precisely in the PSP launch period. At the time, this Ignition puzzle game was indicated as one of the games capable of showing the general public the technical potential of the Sony laptop, not so much for the graphic design, tasty but not disruptive, but for the precision and realism with which they would be simulated the movements of the sphere of mercury, the ~protagonist~ of the game. Mercury was also supposed to come with an internal motion sensor, in order to make the experience more immersive: however, this feature was abandoned during development, so that the two versions of the game published so far (on PSP and PS2) both lack one of the aspects that would have made this puzzle game unique, at least in the intention of the developers.", "date": "2007-06-26", "grade": null}
