After watching the introductory movie (whose mediocre video quality portends something of a low quality level) we choose whether to play in arcade, Olympics or instruction mode; it being understood that the title is still usable with the keyboard, I recommend immediately buying a sturdy joypad, even better if it is a Microsoft Sidewinder so you can connect 3 more and have fun like crazy in the multiplayer mode which includes up to 4 people at the same time to challenge each other in the various disciplines, as there is no online multiplayer mode (sigh!!! That would have been the icing on the cake!). Let's start from the arcade mode: once you enter your initials and choose your nationality, all you have to do is overcome the 12 disciplines present there trying to get the best possible score. The playability of this game, as well as all games of this genre, is very particular and certainly not everyone will be attracted by the fact that the playability of these titles consists in pressing the keys of your favorite device like the damned to win; more clearly if you are participating in races such as the 100 m speed or swimming you will have to alternate pressing the 2 action keys as quickly as possible to give speed to your virtual alter-ego while a third key, named ~action~ will allow you, respectively at the 2 races mentioned, to lean your body as you cross the finish line or it will allow you to turn around on the other side of the pool; the same type of argument can be made for the 110 meters hurdles, for the javelin throw, for the high jump while for clay pigeon shooting it will be ~only~ enough to have accurate reflexes and aim since all you have to do is aim and shoot. 12 disciplines are enough for me! However, the instruction mode explains well the mechanisms behind each competition and even if a little intuition is enough to understand how the command system works for most disciplines, for others such as weight lifting a very quick tutorial is certainly advisable . The Olympics mode adds virtual rooms where you can train in view of the 12 competitions (the attached photo shows training before the swimming competition). Furthermore, the different difficulty levels are quite diversified from each other and if the first ones will literally make your opponents eat dust, with the last ones you will eat a lot of them unless you are real monsters to press with your fingers (or use the autofire ^_^!) Audiovisual department! Graphically, the Eidos title manages to convince the gamer's retinas with good fluidity (at a cross guess a little over 30 fps) even at 1024 x 768 at 32 bit (on P3 500, 256 mb of ram and G400 max), a certainly more than satisfactory number of polygons as regards the virtual athletes who are very well animated (try doing the high jump or the obstacle course) while the stadiums, whose realization is discreet, with a not impressive number of polygons, are crowded with the ugliest spectators I've ever seen in recent months (and who move even worse), certainly the only negative note of the still good visual department. Audiovisual department! As far as the audio side is concerned, we are a breath away from mediocrity both for the quality and quantity of music (a negligible factor in any case if we take into account the game genre), discretely digitized sound effects while as regards the commentators I am only sorry that the digitized sentences are very few and it is not surprising if in a few minutes you will have already memorized them, even if hearing the voice of the famous voice actor Stefano Albertini can only please (among the many characters dubbed by him we remember the terrible Abigail of Bastard o.a.v.). Concluding... Sydney 2000 proves to be a practically essential game for all those who are fans of the genre and/or want to experience today's Olympics without ever having played such a title; for the former, also due to the fact that there doesn't seem to be any competition lurking (on PC, at least), I can only say to call some friends and prepare yourselves for breathtaking challenges to continuously overcome record after record; for everyone else try it, if you can, before you buy it. You could learn to appreciate a videogame genre born about fifteen years ago and nowadays sadly fallen into general oblivion but revitalized by the excellent exponent of the category here.gory. A multi-event game?? It seems like forever since the release of the last multievent game; if once these titles were released with a certain regularity, for some years now it seems that their release only takes place in conjunction with the Olympics and the fact that in addition to Sydney 2000 here, titles such as ESPN Track and Konami's Field and Sega's Virtual Athlete testify to this. Will the new release of Eidos be able to unseat the memory of the legendary Hyper-Olympics from our hearts, progenitor of the genre but still, strange to say, the most playable?", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
