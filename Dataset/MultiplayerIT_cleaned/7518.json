So what is Call of Duty: Ghosts? It is an ~old gen~ title forcefully transported into the future, which in all its components (campaign, multiplayer, Squads and Extinction) looks at the franchise in its entirety, to stage a series of undoubtedly interesting contents, but which they do a lot to find their own way, especially when we saw how Treyarch has in fact given a significant turnaround to the series with its parallel series Black Ops. Call of Duty: Ghosts fails to replicate the usual winning formula with the same success South America to the rescue The campaign, which lasts between five and six hours if played normally, puts us in the shoes of one of the two ~ghost~ brothers who will learn to be the last line of defense of the United States against the army of the Federation, that is, all of South America united in annihilating the hated Yankees after the implosion of the oil fields in the Middle East. It all begins when the Odin, the satellite equipped with huge rods capable of unleashing the destructive power of an atomic bomb only with the impact, is boarded and used against American territory itself. The United States is brought to its knees, invaded but not broken, with the remnants of what was once the most powerful military in the world continuing the fight against the invader, locked up in pockets always at risk of annihilation. This is the initial situation, then with the progression we will also visit South America, to block the putting into operation of the definitive weapon of the Federation, and to kill the leader, a ruthless and unscrupulous renegade. A brief synopsis for a ~classic~ Call of Duty that offers no less than eighteen missions, not exactly very long and decidedly fragmentary, in which the short time gaps between one and the other are linked together by videos/explanations made in a very particular, not with the game engine, but almost in an abstract way: a nice view anyway. The gameplay is the classic one of the series, scripted and absolutely linear: you spend all your time following someone, from our brother to the other members of the Ghost team. A venial sin inherent in the genre, of course, but never like now does one have the impression of never being in command, also thanks to the narrative stratagem that sees us as novice ~recruits~. The rhythm is good as usual, Infinity Ward stages everything and the opposite of everything, we pass with ease from the depths of the sea to space stations (to tell the truth, these levels are played in the same way...) and there is no shortage of usual silent infiltrations, hasty escapes with an obviously pyrotechnic outcome and the inevitable phases on vehicles. So much variety, in short, but for the first time, perhaps due to a setting that certainly doesn't hit the player in the stomach and which would have been unrecognizable without the usual writing at the bottom left of the screen indicating the place of the action, trigger what emotion professionals call the ~WOW effect!~ The campaign lets itself be played without unforgettable scenes or moments, there are no levels like those of Paris or Hamburg; obviously there is no shortage of very good peaks that also raise the difficulty bar, but more generally you get to the end without the initial emotional investment having borne fruit. Even what should be powerful twists do not excite and are configured as obligatory passages to get to the mocking, but not shocking, final. What in the intentions of the developers should have been the story of a nation on the verge of collapse, in which the military apparatus is reduced to a flicker and which perhaps could have given rise to a different way of understanding the gameplay, does not differ for nothing from many shooters played so far. There is everything expected of a Modern Warfare and this does nothing but create a strong sense of disconnect between what the protagonists tell and what happens on the screen. In short, when it comes to attacking in force, the Americans do it, even in the heart of their opponents' territory, and one wonders why create real partisans of a defeated nation as protagonists when it is the army that has the possibility, as always, to put an end to everything. The dog Riley is also part of this basic uncertainty. From the absolute protagonist of the Internet memes at the time of the reveal, it is reduced to a simple appearance intwo initial missions and then disappear practically completely until the end. And what's more, its use is equal to that of any stealth ground drone seen in dozens of other FPS. The only difference is that it bites instead of shooting. A pity, then, but fortunately we were spared tear-jerking scenes a la Hachiko, even if his yelp when injured can destabilize the most sensitive animal lovers. In terms of design, Infinity Ward does not overturn a script that has been memorized for years: there is so much variety and there is no shortage of small gimmicks to revive usual situations, but more generally the sense of deja vu is recurring. To be honest, it must be said that the pace is always pressing; Infinity Ward also tries to make the environments richer in terms of ~verticality~ but certainly everything does not stand out for its originality and, as previously written, the moments that are remembered are few. Space missions in a second turn into tedious replicas of the marine one made famous in the fish trailer, and when you board the vehicles the situation doesn't improve much. The helicopter assault is staged well, but practically impossible to fail, while the mission in a closed tank is genuinely terrible and makes Battlefield 3 an emblem of realism. Suffice it simply to say that the Abrams are equipped with strafe, with a driving model that defies any logic, and above all that there is no challenge, even if we are asked to break into what is to all intents and purposes the most defended area of the enemy. The artificial intelligence stands at the usual levels. The tight spaces work in its favor, but we have seen moments where, even without the paradoxical and ironic invasive scripts of Battlefield 4, we have gaped at soldiers who remain in plain sight, who expose themselves carelessly from covers, or even worse point the rifle in the opposite direction to where we are. The scene of the escape from the stadium by helicopter is emblematic. From above we observe the soldiers who were shooting at us until just before, remaining motionless on the ground without shooting, not even to ~color~ the scene. A comparison between campaigns If for the multiplayer Call of Duty: Ghosts and Battlefield 4 actually play different sports and leagues, in the campaign the comparison is extremely plausible, with the title made in Sweden which in fact found itself chasing the one made in the USA. Which of the two campaigns is better? Perhaps the most interesting question we have to ask ourselves is which of the two is the least bad... Call of Duty: Ghosts Battlefield 4 Technically speaking, the answer is obvious: Battlefield 4, despite its content mediocrity, is capable of leaving us speechless, at least in the next gen field. For everything else, both have few pros and many cons. The variety and artificial intelligence reward Call of Duty on the wire, but Battlefield 4 has on its side (few, to tell the truth) exciting moments in which the spaces open up almost to Crysis, while for the writing the speech is more complex. Battlefield 4 completely derails in the choice of wanting to stage the human side of men at war, falling into caricature thanks to ridiculous scenes and dialogues, while Call of Duty lacks in the total narrative arc which does not excite, leaves cold and betrays the interesting initial incipit. In short, two similar results: only the way in which the two titles arrive at this uninspiring result changes. Playstation 4 trophies Call of Duty: Ghosts rewards the player with 51 trophies, many of which are related to Extinction mode. Most of the bronze ones are obtained by simply progressing through the campaign, but they also involve us trying to kill opponents in ways other than simply firing our rifle. To bring home the gold you have to work harder, and maybe finish the game on maximum difficulty. Platinum, on the other hand, is the natural prize for having obtained the previous trophies. Small corrections to be made The multiplayer system is extremely simple, but very rich in possibilities and combinations for the player. In fact, from Modern Warfare 3 the system of the three diversifications of the Strike Packages returns, while Treyarch's ~Pick 10~ system now becomes ~Pick 8~, but only in reference to the perks. In fact, weapons, optics, grenades and even ~Killstreaks~ can all be equipped freely, provided you have the so-called relative gold tokens necessary for their release. There is no level barrier to reach, but you need to understand how to spend the tokens, given sparingly when leveling up, but also when overcoming the ~missions~ that involveall aspects of the game turn a bit. If we want we can accumulate the necessary money (Squad Points) to immediately buy the very powerful Beretta ARX-160 assault rifle, but by doing so we won't have the money to buy anything else. Only the perks are obtained by leveling up, but their purchase can still be anticipated by paying in Squad Points. The system works; everything contributes to leveling up and therefore to obtaining points, consequently the player is encouraged to explore the game in its entirety. The three specializations of the Strike Packages worked two years ago and still work today, but being able to move freely we were able to observe some problems to be fixed, which could affect the total balance. Choosing Assault gives you access after only 5 kills to the dog, dear old Riley. In fact, we are practically invincible, both alive and dead, a sort of canine version of the much-hated Martyrdom. The dog accompanies us, circles around us and warns us of nearby enemies, and kills them with a simple touch: there is no escape, therefore. It's just a pity that the dog continues to remain active even if we are killed, accumulating kills waiting for his exit from the scene. The support class does its duty, the right mix between helping the team and offensive ambitions, while the Specialist, the one not equipped with the Strike Package proper, but only with perks, can become a real ninja in the hands of expert players, reaching an incredible total of over 15 skills, almost completely eliminating the loadout and becoming an unstoppable, silent, invisible and lethal killing machine. Here too the balance is at great risk. But what left us most dumbfounded is the choice made by Infinity Ward on the player's energy. With very few shots you die, especially when the opponents are equipped with high-level weapons, which is a bit of a fight with the not always flawless respawn, but never in any case to become a serious problem. Mark Rubin, executive producer of the game, told us that this choice respects a tradition of Infinity Ward, totally opposite to what they do in Treyarch. A vision that can be shared from the point of view of the DNA of the game - fast, frenetic and loud as ever - but it must be said that being shot dead with two shots within a nanosecond, both from near and far, exasperates everything towards the which the detractors of the game lash out. Regarding the new game modes, many of the inclusions are spot on and can be understood as a valid alternative to the most played and loved ~classic~ ones. In our personal ranking we put Search and Rescue, a variant of Search and Destroy mixed with Kill Confirmed, in which there is no respawn, provided that one of the companions collects our tag; Blitz, on the other hand, engages the two teams in a race towards the opposing base, where they ~score goals~ by trampling on a small hotspot and then being teleported to our base. It is useless to move in a group, a ten second cooldown between one goal and another requires not crowding around ~the goal~. Ingenious. But Hunted also seemed like a lot of fun to us, even if more of a pastime than a real competitive mode. We all start with a pistol, the acquisition of the best performing weapons takes place thanks to crates that occasionally fall on the map: in short, great races waiting for the new drop. Of the others, only Infected didn't seem particularly apt to us, while the new ones Cranked and Grind don't have any particular flaws, but they certainly can't steal the show from those previously listed. But another sector in which Infinity Ward has worked a lot is in the creation of the maps, where the American boys have been able to indulge themselves by building playing fields that are on average larger than in the past, something from which the next gen consoles benefit a lot since they can support up to to a maximum of eighteen players, while the ~current gen~ stop at just twelve, often offering a feeling of solitude when the spaces widen. In this sense, the beautiful Stone Heaven is emblematic. A gigantic ruined castle, located in a lush valley and surrounded by several small houses, also reduced to piles of stones. In practice, the perfect medieval village, nestled between hills and streams, all in the name of a level design in which the raised points and the remains of the structures to be used as roofs are predominant. Not only the external areas of course: the rest of the castle, with moss running along its walls, is largely passable. But the best is the ability to always keep an eye on the map in its entirety. You want from the castle, you want from the hillock on its sides, you want", "date": "2013-11-05", "grade": "8.0"}
