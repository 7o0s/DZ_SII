His body is new, therefore, but the memories are those of Starkiller and resurface immediately, so much so that the boy flees immediately after his awakening to reunite with the beautiful Juno Eclipse, wherever he is. Darth Vader and the troops of the Empire won't let that happen, however, and will follow him to the limits of the known universe to subdue his conscience or eliminate him. Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II therefore also arrives on Wii after a not exactly unforgettable debut episode: on the Nintendo console the conversion of The Force Unleashed, curated by Krome Studios, was afflicted by a truly mediocre technical sector, according to of many in line with the portable edition for PSP, as well as a control system that left something to be desired in various situations. Although it cannot in any way compete visually with what is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which however use three different engines to manage graphics, physics and special effects, this sequel entrusted to Red Fly Studio immediately stands out for a greater care in development and better implementation of motion detection controls. However, those who expected a Star Wars game in which it was finally possible to control the lightsaber in real time via the Wii-mote will be disappointed once again: four years after the release of the Wii, it now seems clear that the implementation of this feature is in fact a Nintendo exclusive. Your effort is bigger than mine Beyond the controversy, it must be said that, also and above all in this sequel, the good old Starkiller has at his disposal a repertoire of attacking movements and maneuvers that will be the envy of anyone. By repeatedly pressing the A button on the Wii-mote, you can perform a classic combo with lightsabers, while holding the controller horizontally the character will use their weapons to deflect projectiles fired by enemies. The health and strength bars automatically restore when calm, and the second allows us to use the mysterious energy of the Jedi to grab objects and throw them at a target of your choice (C button), create powerful shock waves in able to overwhelm opponents (by waving the Nunchuk) and fire lightning bolts similar to Emperor Palpatine's (by holding down the Z button and shaking the Nunchuk). By shaking the Wii-mote, various special attacks are performed (in a completely random way, apparently), while by acting on the d-pad it is possible to activate the ~jedi sight~ to identify the weak points of the structure or of the enemy in front of us , make a quick sprint forward or (if the relative indicator is full) enter ~rage mode~, a sort of bullet time which, once the targets are locked, allows us to eliminate them all in a single predetermined attack sequence . Although the gameplay of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is basically linear, interposing some simple exploratory phases between the fights, or at most some small puzzles, this abundance of action makes the clashes quite fun and fairly spectacular. The good variety of opponents also contributes to this result, which are distinguished by features, characteristics and modus operandi, always shuffling the cards on the table and even putting us in front of quite demanding situations. I will not be... your father! The downside is the management of the view, which is really bad: it is possible to center it by pressing the C button on the Nunchuk and rotate it using the ~+~ and ~-~ buttons on the Wii-mote, but during fights it rarely follows the correct movements of our character, forcing us on many occasions to strike blindly. Secondly, the episodes narrated during the single player campaign are heavily ~scripted~, that is, from time to time a battle must be concluded for the event to occur that allows us to continue the exploration. We also add to the list of defects the implementation of quick time events, sometimes too invasive, as well as the brevity of the experience in general: five hours are enough to complete the story, and the only accompanying mode is an anonymous local multiplayer for four players. Moving on to a purely technical analysis, as mentioned at the beginning, The Force Unleashed II looks much better than the first episode for Wii: the polygonal models feature decent animation and a good level of detailor, so much so that the protagonist faithfully reproduces the features of the actor who lent him the face (Samuel Witwer, who some of you will certainly remember in the role of Davis Bloome / Doomsday in the eighth season of Smallville). The scenarios suffer a bit from the flatness of the surfaces, practically devoid of textures, but it was evidently a choice made in order not to burden the graphics engine too much, which actually manages to manage the environments in a fluid way (apart from rare cases ). The Italian dubbing is of a good standard, with a fairly convinced and involved interpretation, while the classic music by John Williams accompanies the most spectacular sequences in the best possible way.", "date": "2010-12-17", "grade": "7.5"}
