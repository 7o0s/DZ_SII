{"name": "American Conquest: Divided Nation - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/american-conquest-divided-nation-recensione.html", "text": "Let's get hurt The latest GSC Game World effort is set during the American Civil War. Leading the northerners or southerners we will have to face the pitched battles of the period by moving large masses of troops on some of the most famous battlefields in history. Fifty-five battles, nine campaigns and five usable factions should represent an excellent business card for anyone who wants to relive that important historical period. Here too, as in the previous episode, the reconstruction of the events is decidedly accurate and one of the strong points of the entire production; the research work is evident and a lot has been done to make the battles as plausible as possible. American Conquest: Divided Nation is identical to its predecessor, except for a few minor details Once you start the game, however, you immediately notice the first lack: there is no tutorial. Not bad if you played the previous episode. Not bad even if you can read English since the manual is quite comprehensive. Unfortunately, if you don't fall into one of the two categories above (the manual hasn't been localized), your learning curve will be slightly steeper, especially when you're tackling troop odds and how which to manage them. Choosing the game mode (campaign, single mission, random map or multiplayer) we will finally be ready to take to the battlefield. Shadows and Fog Single player games play out quite differently from multiplayer games or casual maps. In the former we will usually have to manage a large army right away, we will have a large amount of resources and we will not have to waste time building or managing collection and accumulation buildings; in short, given a certain amount of resources, we will have to manage the movements of our armies to try to overwhelm the enemy. In multiplayer mode and on random maps, we will instead find ourselves grappling with problems more typical of RTS; we will have to build buildings, create an adequate workforce to collect the various necessary resources, generate the most powerful army possible and set off to charge the opponent. The system is quite run in so much so that if you have played the first American Nation you will find it almost mirrored. The interface is typical of the genre and allows you to manage the units discreetly. In reality, one often feels the need for a few more options to manage one's army, especially if one is aware of the presence of some comfortable innovations developed in recent years. Still speaking of needs that had to be fixed with this second chapter, we cannot fail to mention the fog of war, which has remained unchanged. Already in 2003, a coverage of the map that did not take into account the effective field of vision was absurd, especially in a strategy that aims for realism. Reviving today a system that gives troops an arbitrary field of vision established on the basis of who knows what calculations is quite frustrating. Just to give an example, we can scrutinize the situation of a forest, if it falls within our ~visual circle~ but we cannot observe an entire free and, theoretically, clear plain if it is too extensive. Shadows and Fog But let's go back to the single player mode to notice what is certainly the best realized aspect of the game: the artificial intelligence of the enemy. In fact, as in the previous version (forgive the constant looking back... but so little has changed in substance that it couldn't be done otherwise) the CPU proved to be an adversary capable of putting us in trouble on more than one occasion, even lower difficulty levels. In fact, facing pitched battles fought between hundreds of troops still has its charm... pity that in the meantime Rome: Total War has been released which, with similar hardware requirements, allows you to move a greater number of units in a completely three-dimensional environment, managed by a state-of-the-art graphics engine. In fact, it is precisely starting from the outward appearance, adding to it the chronic lack of innovations, that American Conquest: Divided Nation shows all its undoubted limits. Goodbye my Concubine The graphics engine is that of the first episode, which was already technically backward at the time of the release of Cossacks (the first game to have used it... imagine now). Sure, graphics aren't everything in strategic games (although by now there are many titles of undoubted depth that are also pleasant to watch), but finding yourself after two years still having to see microscopic troops with scarce details and bad animations, scenarios poorly refined, monotonous and con few colors, environmental effects that seem to come out of the early nineties, and so on and so forth, don't really make a good impression (in fact one wonders why a 2.0 GHz processor is required as a minimum requirement to do it run and even a 3.0 GHz one to play better). Of course, if the photocopy effect were limited to graphics, we wouldn't be here complaining too much. In reality, even the game dynamics has remained, as reiterated several times during the review, substantially unchanged, with a few insignificant adjustments, a certain inconvenience of the interface and, above all, the old strategies of the previous episode reproposed without too much restraint. In a few simple words, Divided Nation looks more like a large data disk than a real new game; a mere change of scenery that does not take into account the progress made in recent years. To increase the astonishment in the face of this ~operation only for ardent fans~, we also think about the price of Italian distribution which is really very high compared to that practiced abroad. It is not clear why in Italy this game should cost about 20 more than in England (just to give an example), also given what it has to offer and given that the production costs will not have been as high as those of titles that are also sold by us at budget price, since the first edition. it looks more like a big data disk than a real new game Hardware boxes The requirements required to play American Conquest: Divided Nation are strangely quite high (could it be the fault of the number of troops on the screen?): we are talking about a 2.0 GHz processor (3.0 Ghz recommended) 256 MB of RAM ( recommended 512 MB), a 128 MB graphics card capable of displaying a resolution of at least 1280x1024 (playing at 1024x768 is possible but not recommended...obviously the monitor must also be able to display the recommended resolution) and 2.5 GB of free hard space disk. The game was tested on a 3.4 GHz P4 with 2.0 GB of RAM and a GeForce 7800 GT graphics card with 256 MB and had no issues with fluidity, although a graphical bug rarely occurred which made the colors jump. The same problem manifested itself on another computer with an AMD processor (2800), 1.0 GB of RAM and a GeForce FX 5900 XT graphics card. Final comment The game is too similar to the previous episode to impress. There are no obvious innovations, neither at a technical level, nor at a gameplay level. Even the defects have been maintained, in a kind of masochistic continuity that does not do justice to the research work behind the production. I am sorry to have to note that a very good title has not received the deserved developments while remaining glued to itself. Having said that, we can only reiterate its undoubted merits: accurate historical reconstruction, great refinement at a strategic level, very marked longevity and playability which, in any case, is well established and will satisfy those who madly loved the previous chapter. Pros Excellent artificial intelligence Great historical reconstruction Long-lived Cons Aged very badly Technically inadequate No major innovations The Civil War The first American Conquest came out over two years ago. The proximity to Cossacks (they were practically identical), the possibility of leading a large number of troops simultaneously in some of the most important battles in American history and an excellent historical and strategic accuracy earned him more than fair judgments from critics and a certain success from the public. And so, after passing through a subdued data disk, here we are at the official sequel. The years go by, the mid-seasons are back, the Xbox has reached the 360 version and the graphics cards have made huge leaps forward in terms of various effects and number of polygons moved every second. But there is something that does not seem to have wanted to evolve. American Conquest: Divided Nation is identical to its predecessor, except for a few minor details. But we are going too fast and the paragraph with the criticisms can be found below. Now we have to describe the game.", "date": "2006-01-09", "grade": null}
