{"name": "Immortale  brutto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98576-neverdead-immortale-e-brutto.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 Immortality, or rather the low level of challenge of today's video games, is one of the most debated topics lately with users who remember the past of three lives and then game over as a sort of videogame golden age. where only the strongest (today we would say the most skilled) could boast of putting his name in the standings. NeverDead, developed by the British Rebellion and published by Konami, makes a mockery of this diatribe by making us impersonate the immortal Bryce, the classic anti-hero with a lightning joke and smoking guns. This does not mean that the game is easy, far from it, unfortunately, however, the difficulty is not given by the intrinsic challenge rate, but by some serious problems that strongly undermine the gaming experience. Touch me again and I'll kill you! The narrative premises are still interesting. The demon hunter Bryce Boltzmann during the clash with the fearsome king of demons Astaroth is cursed and made in fact an undead in the face of the departure of his beloved. Five hundred years later he still continues to do this work, but he is increasingly disillusioned, from the spotless and fearless knight he was, he finds himself a digital version of the great Joe Hallenbeck, hoarse voice and hanging cigarette. Everything revolves around the dismemberment of the protagonist. We can lose a leg and then noticeably limp. Leave your arms on the ground and then wander around the level helplessly trying to roll over what was lost due to the automatic hang-up, or worse, move a talking head towards your body as quickly as possible, perhaps using the dash before the little scavenger demons get there they eat. Digestion of the demon is the only way by which it is allowed to see the loading screen, but before the gastric juices go into action, a sort of quick time event gives us the opportunity to get back into the game. In principle, it being understood that if our hunting partner Arcadia dies it is game over, you could reach the end of the nine to ten hours of play without ever seeing the check point loading screen. This solution is certainly convenient, but as we will see later it only exacerbates some rather significant critical issues. But what kind of game is NeverDead. We are facing a classic third-person shooter without covers, like Devil May Cry we could say, with the combat system equally divided between firearms and sword. The supplied arsenal is certainly not very vast, pistol, machine gun, assault rifle and shotgun to finish with the never too acclaimed M-79 grenade launcher, but very important thing we can take up two weapons, one in each hand, and this is determined by meet the different types of enemies. Whoever touches does not die The little various enemies are structured with the classic game of Chinese morra, or each weapon has its opponent of choice, the switch between the various guns is therefore highly recommended. Furthermore we have at our disposal a cumbersome but huge broadsword which, in addition to being necessary to slice lead-immune halberd demons, can also be used to destroy parts of the game environment such as walls and columns, which, falling, carry with great joy a good number of demons. In this sense, NeverDead brings well-studied mechanics into play, the ~tactical~ variety is not lacking, on the other hand we are immortal, so why not set ourselves on fire or get shocked to enhance our blows or even better throw our arms and make them explode when necessary ? And if this were not enough, it is possible to spend the accumulated souls to buy a substantial series of bonuses to our weapons and skills which in fact determine the way we want to play. There is a bit of everything, from sword upgrades to weapon upgrades, through boosted projectiles, sprints, the aforementioned explosive limbs and much more, but also the fundamental bonuses to the automatic regeneration time of limbs and the highly recommended by the developers themselves bullet time when someone attacks us from too close, which should make us have a little doubt ... Unfortunately, all this attention to combat dynamics gives way to a good number of important critical issues. Xbox 360 goals NeverDead rewards the player with 42 achievements. They are obtained simply by progressing in the game or by killing bosses but they also involve us in finding all the hidden collectibles for the maps. The more difficult ones are related to less immediate contextual actions such as killing demons using the environment, destroying at least a quarter of the museum, avoiding traffic on the bridge and much more. Still? No thank you The first is the extreme repetitiveness and chaotic nature of scontri, all ~graced~ by a camera that trudges behind the events and does not allow us to understand the origin of the attacks. Secondly, dismemberment, rather than something really useful in the game economy, quickly becomes a bore, more punitive than really useful, a feature therefore more than forgettable. The game is always the same until you drop in certain situations. The scheme is only one, with very few variations on the theme. You enter a room (corridor, or arena) and wait for the appearance of enemies that spawn endlessly from nests. Until you destroy them they will keep coming out blocking access to another area. And that's that. And so until the end of the game. Fortunately, the enemy fauna increases as much in number as in species and with it our arsenal, thus giving us the possibility of applying all those previously mentioned tactical variants, it is certain that the continuous repetition of this scheme tremendously kills the bite, arriving immediately to make us talk about boredom and banality. There is no shortage of variations on the theme, in one level, in total darkness we are asked to set ourselves on fire to light the way out or as when we are in the presence of some environmental puzzles in which we have to use our heads, metaphorically and really. In short, there is no shortage of good moments, especially towards the end of the game when the spaces widen and we are strengthened properly, but they are very little in front of the eightieth nest to be knocked down by slashing blindly. The bosses, as it should be, are the most interesting enemies we find and we are committed to exploiting all the possibilities of attack, including the environment. They're pretty big and even have different attack patterns, but they too can't help but fall into the tunnel of repetition. Towards the end of the game we will meet them again several times as a sort of filler surrounded by dozens of enemies of all kinds, with the aggravating circumstance of no variation in terms of attacks. And if their energy bar continues to regenerate, as for the penultimate one that blocks our way, we are faced with absolutely repetitive, very long and not very fun clashes. Go-go tested The camera must also be taken into account. It is enough simply to say that when one is surrounded by enemies it is not uncommon, indeed it is the practice, not to see the direction of their attacks, and this leads to the loss of limbs as a direct result, since a caress is enough to fall apart. We therefore understand the advice of the developers to buy the bullet time in order to have more time to dodge blows and slashes. And if you are left with only your head you are constantly snookered by the objects on the screen and this is a problem if you want to escape from the scavengers. It is possible to use the sprint to escape in search of the numerous ampoules of instantaneous regeneration, but given the obstacles, visual and otherwise, and the disconnections of the terrain, it is a continuous trudging on the ground trying not to be digested or worse than large warheads that make poor Bryce in the air. The millimetric precision that the head requires to hook onto the neck then cries out for vengeance and what is even more serious is the automatic hooking of the limbs which occurs only in the event of a somersault. In short, from a distance you can better manage your arsenal by concerting your attacks, but when you are surrounded by explosive pigs, bomber harpies, rocket-launching demons or even worse halberds everything becomes terribly confused and you end up in a blind button mashing. We close with the multiplayer. The game offer expands online up to a maximum of four people with numerous variations on the horde mode both in cooperative and competitive versions. They are quite interesting, but mechanics and problems are repeated here without interruption. From a technical point of view, the work done by the developers is certainly appreciable, even if it doesn't make one cry for a miracle, especially in terms of effects and quality of the environments. The best thing about the game is the work done on the design of the enemies and bosses, visionary and disturbing, with good detail and complete with little angels embedded in the limbs. Bryce is no different, fluidly animated in all physical conditions and above all well built in polygonal terms.", "date": "2012-02-01", "grade": "5.5"}
