In addition to the intrusive notifications or ruthless grinding that often haunt mobile games, the overall experience is almost always spoiled by poor balance and a confused and incongruous sense of progression. Everything is modeled in order to push, almost force, the user to put his hand to the credit card, and Real Racing 3 still remains one of the most sensational examples of how microtransactions can completely compromise an otherwise flawless game. Released a semester ago on the App Store, the first Sid Meier's Ace Patrol fell right into this category: despite being a solid and fun strategy game, it received criticism from users due to its free-to-play nature which in many ways has affected the amount of content and its variety. With Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies, 2K Games has thus made an unexpected about-face, proposing a sequel without any in-app purchase and whose contents are all accessible after the initial purchase. Pacific Skies brings Ace Patrol back to the skies, but with a strong feeling of deja vu But is it a sequel or a reskin? However, the abandonment of the free-to-play model is not the only novelty. Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is a real sequel to the original, no longer set in the skies of the Great War, but this time focused on the aerial battles of the Second World War. Therefore, the forces involved also change, although this time the nations are halved, allowing to take sides only on the side of the Japanese or the United States. However, the present campaigns remain four, given that each of the two parties allows you to lead both the Navy and the army. However, it should be emphasized that, although the historical scenario has changed, Pacific Skies proposes the same and identical mechanics of the first Ace Patrol. Once again, Firaxis's game mixes the structure of a classic hexagonal wargame with the aerial battles of Andy Moore's excellent SteamBirds, with the player who in his turn must select the box in which to move his units and carefully decide which ones aerial maneuvers perform. Thus we find ourselves facing a sort of chess game in which to anticipate the enemies and displace them with the right strategy, perhaps by encircling them or by being chased until they are within range of the allied anti-aircraft guns. However, you have to be careful not to endanger your pilots, given that once shot down it will be necessary to complete some missions before they become available again: in the options it is even possible to activate the permadeath, thus making the loss of a character and his properties irreversible. skills unlocked. The variety in strategic terms emerges above all after the first successful missions, when you begin to use bombers and reconnaissance aircraft or when your pilots learn more complex special maneuvers, such as rolls, loops and Immelmann's turns. However, it is evident how the transition from the First to the Second World War is only purely aesthetic: the new planes move in the same way and are equipped with the same and identical special maneuvers as the previous ones, and even if the scenarios have been largely redesigned, the feeling is just that of playing the chapter released six months ago. The type of missions has also remained unchanged, with the player having to eliminate an opposing squadron one moment and the next having to escort a transport or shoot down a bomber before it reaches its base. Thus we find what was the main flaw of the first Ace Patrol, a lack of variety that is accentuated mission after mission. The game interface is also intact, with all the pros (few) and cons (many) already highlighted in the previous chapter, while the same goes for the degree of difficulty: unless you play at the highest levels, intelligence opponent's artificial difficulty in proposing interesting solutions and strategies, most of the time limiting himself to following the closest unit in all its movements; precisely for this reason it is not difficult to fool enemy fighters by bringing them to the areas of the map where one's land forces are most concentrated, or perhaps by using a decoy while a second plane is behind them. For the reasons just mentioned, the most interesting mode is probably the multiplayer one, available both locally, with two friends who pass the device from time to time, and online with the same and identical asynchronous system of the first Ace Patrol.", "date": "2013-11-21", "grade": "8.0"}
