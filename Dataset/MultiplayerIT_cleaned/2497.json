{"name": "Formula One 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/formula-one-2003.html", "text": "I am also a member of the A.C.I As stated several times, the Psone version of Formula One 2001 was edited by a different development team, so the game doesn't have much in common with its cousin on dvd-rom, apart from the commentary, the famous FIA license and the possibility of change the starting grid. However, the Psone team is the one already tested in the last two editions, let's see in detail what they have done this time. Let's start from the beginning by saying that the introduction is nothing special and very short (classic computer graphics single-seater coming out of the pits, with dance music in the background). The menu interface is graphically pleasing and navigation is intuitive, also because the game is totally localized in Italian. You can choose to play the classic Grand Prix (with single races, free practice, qualifying, etc.) or the nice variant of the Arcade mode, with a ~career~ setting, in which you will have to manage your funds to buy a single-seater and winning races will increase your credit card bill, to invest in more powerful assets. Furthermore, during the uploads, you can answer questions of a sporting nature with a ~Trivial Pursuit~ style quiz (the idea is similar to those little games that entertain surfers while loading a Flash site). ~And go! Street! they left!~ Once the green light was triggered, I immediately noticed a more permissive gameplay with a less hostile handling of the vehicle, compared to the 128-bit counterpart, where the path of ~Real Driving Simulation~ was sought, however running into some flaws in the physical model , for example here going off the track will not affect the whole race (an aspect that I had already noticed in the Beta version). The audio is simply average (which is still better than bad) while graphically speaking the game is good but inevitably edgy , we all continue to regret the high resolution (512x240) times of Formula One '97. Where the limits of the PSone have been reached is in regards to the frame rate, the game is very fluid, giving an excellent sensation of speed, even in split-screen mode. In the race, above each opposing car you will see a symbol with the driver's identity card, an idea similar to the one adopted by Namco's Moto GP. Other innovations introduced are realistic damage such as punctures and loss of tire pressure (but the PS2 version doesn't beat itself on this playing field). Another round, another run Studio 33 tries again. The quality standard is as always high, after years of testing it would be absurd to take steps backwards, but the sense of deja-vu is strong, a ~defect~ also present in the real F1 world which, let's face it, is a little monotonous without the unexpected or the spectacular accident (politically incorrect but true statement) otherwise made up of chaotic laps of the track, in the same circuits as always. So, if you are passionate about the FIA world and you know the name of each corner in the courses by heart, or you are collecting all the CDs in the series, you won't resist buying it (also because it could be the final chapter) but if you are not crazy about the genre and you already have ~the episode~ past, a handful of new options and updated pilots will not be enough to satiate you. Pros: A good product High gameplay F1 is always F1! Cons: F1 is always F1.. The open-wheeled Pson Even if all eyes are focused on the PS2 version, which for better or for worse is at the top of the sales charts, we must not forget that the Formula One brand was created to be a workhorse of the Playstation, a console that is all 'now in the homes of very many. So crisis or no crisis of the gray box, this year too we will have a new 32-bit chapter.. will it be the final sprint or simply the umpteenth lap of the track?", "date": "2001-06-04", "grade": null}
