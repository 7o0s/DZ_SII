The aim of the game is to compete against three other players controlled by the computer and try to win the tournament, ~upgrading~ the snowmobile race after race, thanks to the ~wrenches~ that are acquired either by reaching the first three positions or by athletic evolutions ~in the air~ of our player while driving his vehicle. Every ten points you acquire a ~key~ and depending on the degree of difficulty of the stunt you can accumulate from one to three points at a time. As the tournament progresses, it is possible to unlock new tracks (twelve in all), initially ~forbidden~, only by winning the different categories (Sport, Semi-Pro, Pro and Special Event). On the snow ... flat out! Our vehicle, which you choose at the start of the tournament, has power and maneuverability based on its engine capacity (from the slower and more stable 440cc to the faster and more difficult 800cc), but as you progress through the levels it is also possible to increase the four fundamental parameters ( speed, acceleration, handling and stability) thanks to the accumulated keys or directly choosing a large engine snowmobile to modify. My advice is to gain experience on a 600cc motorcycle and to fully upgrade it until you pass the first two categories; afterwards it is mandatory to switch to a more powerful vehicle, given the skill of the three computer-controlled characters in the advanced levels. Make way ... runway! The first tracks are a bit boring, even if they will alternate with snow and night, and only from the intermediate ones onwards will you encounter bumps and ravines that will make the map structures more varied. Too bad that to unlock them you need to work hard to win the relative categories, but you are still spurred on by the curiosity of being able to see what is hidden in the hidden levels. Make way ... runway! A typical game starts with a careful choice of the bike, which, based on the characteristics of the map's route, can give its ~real~ contribution to victory. For example, if the map is full of curves, bumps and obstacles, our vehicle will be continually called upon to brake and accelerate continuously, waves for which parameters such as acceleration and handling will be highlighted with respect to speed; speed that will be exploited properly on the straights, which in combination with stability (which will act as a barrier to the opponents' ~shoulders~) will give a greater chance to be able to reach the finish line first on fast tracks. Make way ... runway! To increase the fun, the programmers have made part of the game clearly ~no limits~ or ~extreme~. in fact, once you have memorized the sequence of keys to press to perform the basic stunts (one of the first is the classic ~no hands~ jump) you will feel the need to learn even the more ~tough~ ones or to ring a series of ~ combo~, which obviously yield more points. And so, while you are grappling with opponents who are close behind you, and where ~clean~ driving can guarantee you victory, the sinful temptation to scissor and madly pirouette while jumping over the highest bumps takes over, and the vast majority of sometimes you will find yourself with your face sunk in the snow or colliding, in the middle of a jump, against another snowmobile with the consequence of making some sections of the game spectacular and exciting. Make way ... runway! Let's move on to the conclusions: the product, as it appears, is just enough, a little boring in the initial tracks and with an almost repetitive sound. But what leaves a bitter taste in the mouth is the total absence of multiplayer, which forbids competing against other human beings. It is paradoxical that a sports game has been created for a ~single~ player and in the long run rivaling only against the computer is boring. In fact, it is precisely the lack of healthy competition between ~humans~ that significantly undermines longevity and the only moments of pure fun are given by the ~extreme~ nature of the game, i.e.: sadistically run over opponents by throwing them upside down or more difficult evolutions while jumping over the gullies or the highest ramps ... that's it! It's a real shame, given that the game had the basis to be able to give its best just for a ~collective~ fun among several people. Recommended only for ~true~ snowmobile enthusiasts or for ~solitary~ nostalgics of extreme winter sports. On the snow ... flat out! With the Siberian frost these days, never a game could have happened in a better period than this. SnowCross is a sports arcade of snowmobiles, the ones we so often see in the European Nordic countries and where the rrelated championships, which most of us ignore here in Italy. Let's start immediately with the, so to speak, technical aspects: the game is light, runs smoothly and smoothly on 'dated' machines and takes up less than 150 megabytes on the hard disk. The accompanying music is quite spot on while the sound will be lowered almost immediately, considering that the ~noise~ caused by the snowmobile is similar to the buzzing of a bluebottle, moreover ~constant~ in its tediousness. The graphics, on the other hand, do their duty and give their best in the advanced maps to be ~unlocked~, giving one more motivation to be able to win the races.", "date": "2002-01-05", "grade": null}
