Jokes aside, Binary Domain, a third-person shooter made by the Yakuza team, the creators of the game makes us relive the atmospheres of films such as Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell or I, Robot in an extreme shooter key, staging the fight without quarter between an international team of robotic control, called Rust Crew and legions of tin heads, this time not made by Cyberdyne though. The basic assumption is hyper inflated and overused, but the development of the events is rather interesting with a couple of spot on and interesting twists. When half the world is invaded by the waters due to the melting of the polar caps, humanity tried by the catastrophe can do nothing but push on the production of cyborgs to create a tireless workforce, in order to speed up the reconstruction of the cities. Millions of robots have invaded the world, perfect metal slaves to be used at no cost. But suddenly, in the middle of the industrial espionage fight between the two big names in the sector, the American Bergen and the Japanese Amada, the forbidden robots with human features begin to appear, so perfect that they are not even aware of their artificial life. There are no dreams of unicorns and origami in this case, only international death squads with the aim of ending the threat to mankind. It all begins with the infiltration of the protagonist Dan Marshall and his companion Bo(ateng) in Tokyo Bay with the aim of reaching the Amada Corporation responsible for the new race. Between them and the final objective there will be armed scrap metal in industrial quantities, gigantic armored robots, double games and moral doubts. In short, it will not be Dick or Asimov, but the story set up by the Japanese boys keeps you glued to the screen up to the end credits and beyond. The world of robots What is Binary Domain? Science fiction declined in a ~classic~ third-person shooter sauce with covers. We are therefore in the parts of a Gears of War, but hybridized with some ideas, unfortunately not fully in-depth and ~exploded~ that refer directly to Mass Effect. During our adventures in the many locations of the game, from the slums of the ~old city~ to the ~ivory towers~ of the new hyper-technological Tokyo, passing through dens of the resistance, automated agricultural structures and fortified bases, we will have the opportunity to form a squad of three soldiers with the other members of the Rust Crew who infiltrated the Japanese capital. Each of them has a main weapon and unique ~tactical~ traits. For example, Bo is equipped with a heavy machine gun, the two English snobs, Charlie and Rachel respectively with a machine gun and rocket launcher, while the beautiful Chinese Faye with a sniper rifle. Instead, we have an assault rifle capable of firing not only bullets but also an extremely powerful ~bosonic~ loaded shot, very useful for killing weaker robots en masse and for incapacitating or destroying the armor of the heavier and more dangerous ones. Once on a mission we can give simple commands to the team, nothing articulated of course, orders of the caliber of attack, group, cover and charge and answer their questions, with repetitive and all too scurrilous answers, which will affect positively or negatively their degree of trust in our leadership is negative with tangible consequences (according to the developers...) on combat dynamics. There are two ways to interact with our Rust Crew, either via pad or through voice commands thanks to the microphone (Kinect in this case has not been implemented). Two aspects of the gameplay that are very interesting but have not been developed properly. In all the approximately eight abundant hours of play we have used very little the possibility of issuing orders, a sign of this or a good artificial intelligence of our companions or much more realistically of the little need to coordinate attacks with the team. In the same way, their affection or disesteem towards us did not seem very evident to us (beware of friendly fire!), even if to tell the truth in some situations, especially during the clashes with the numerous and beautiful bosses, they were slow to help us using medkits or bringing us ammunition. In short, this is the weakest part of Binary Domain and that could really make the game jump. There is no concrete response to the actions of the team which, despite everything, is only a supporting actor and little more than a spectator of the actions of the protagonist Dan, and it is a pity given the ~role~ aspect of the customization of the team. Robot Defenseself So everything revolves around killing the dozens of robots that Amada and the Japanese government will hurl against us, equipped with a design, or rather an exceptional mecha design and a refined artificial intelligence, capable of skilfully diversifying the attack routines in based on the types of units in the field. The game does not push you to shoot blindly at everything that moves but engages us in trying to aim at the limbs of the robots; in short, there is a sort of selective dismemberment of the enemies, given that the blows to the legs or arms, in addition to making the enemies ~defenseless~, reward the player with more points to spend on upgrades, both for the protagonist and for the members of the party. Without forgetting that blows to the head do not ~kill~ the scrap metal instantly, but can damage their sensory centers, confusing them and leading them to shoot at random. The firefights work great and also become a little more tactical than the average production of this genre, with the player who in the blink of an eye is forced, having recognized the type of threat that appears before him, to decide who to shoot down first and where to shoot, all in a riot of exploding armor pieces, stealthy cover-to-cover adversary movements, explosions and crippled robots crawling on the ground like the T-800 or worse limping unarmed trying to hit the player trying to jump on him. Once a battle is over, the time comes to move on to the collection. Through the numerous ATMs that are found throughout the levels it is possible to buy new weapons, projectiles, different types of grenades and passive upgrades for team members, such as increased health, damage resistance, reload speed or greater melee impact . These upgrades must be managed carefully given the limited space of the equipment grid. Very important, indeed vital, is the upgrade to the main weapons, thus increasing damage, range, magazine size and much more. All with a view to researching team specialization and one's style of play, but at the end of the day, thanks to the abundance of points and the ~active~ non-participation of teammates, the upgrade system is reduced to a level up mechanic of the protagonist's assault rifle (this is clearly tangible in its evolution) and in that of his companions, with little construct however. Xbox 360 goals Binary Domain rewards the player with 50 achievements for a total of 1000 points. The objectives of lesser value are obtained with the simple progression in the game, overcoming some bosses or using particular equipment. Still on the subject of small rewards, points are earned by using ATMs or by distributing upgrades. Going towards the most important prizes, for example, the game forces us to play the online component for a long time, finish the campaign with the highest difficulty level or acquire all the nanomachines. Flat and shiny Another aspect where the game goes one step forward and two steps back is in level design. If, as written at the beginning, the Yakuza team has done a good job of variety by staging a large number of locations that somewhat reflect all the canonical ones of the genre, from the shooter sections on vehicles to those in which we have to use the environment to come to boss of particularly tough bosses (stretching the fight a little too much to be honest), or those who see us darting through the sewers with water scooters, the same certainly cannot be said for the construction of the environments. In short, Binary Domain suffers from the syndrome of the infinitely repeated corridor, extremely flat, with the covers diligently placed as needed and more generally little possibility of movement of the team. Fortunately, it does not lead to tedious repetitiveness, but we are truly on the brink of the abyss anyway. However, there are variations on the theme, such as a ~stealth~ mini-level or one in which we have to destroy some emplacements to move forward, but more generally we always proceed in a straight line except in the rare cases in which the spaces widen, harbingers of bosses or important narrative moments. Here too it's a bit of a shame because the dynamics of the clashes work, everything is very fun but the broad breadth that characterizes the cornerstones of the genre is missing. Where the game excels is in the boss fights. In addition to being really huge and the best done part in terms of polygons and textures of the title, they are characterized by numerous attack patterns, with the sections of the armor that after well-placed hits expose joints and weak parts, going to effectively replicate the winning pattern of ordinary tin heads encountered in the game. From ~simple~, pristine and giantAmong Lancer robots that evoke the angels of Evangelion, for example, we will find ourselves fighting mechanized spiders equipped with homing missiles, robotic gorillas, mad machines, tentacled ~jellyfish~ and blind cyborgs to be led astray by exploiting ambient noise. There is plenty of it and very interestingly the various phases of these clashes this time actively involve teammates, giving us the opportunity to catch our breath, rearm and strike from a distance. Team Yakuza has also included a rather substantial online component, which, as with the campaign, ~pays homage~ to what can be found in similar Western products. We find a Horde mode and numerous types of free and objective competitive game, with or without return that draw with both hands from portions of levels faced in the single player. Between levels and upgrades there would be a lot to play, but alas the servers are practically empty, with zero population. On a technical level, Binary Domain cannot fail to show lights and shadows. The lights are the aforementioned mecha design of all the robotic elements on the screen, from the green simple soldiers to the armored blacks, passing through the blue and red guards, the very fast ~ninjas~ and above all the bosses. More generally, their construction and differentiation in terms of ~primary~ and ~secondary~ attack is truly exceptional, then embellished with beautiful textures and screaming animations. Where the game doesn't convince is in the quality of the environments, rather bare and certainly not very detailed. Not that they are ugly to look at but it is clear from the start that shaders, surfaces and effects are not exactly cutting edge. A good glance without a doubt that perfectly follows the aseptic nature of certain technological environments, but far from the wealth of more avant-garde graphics engines.", "date": "2012-03-07", "grade": "8.0"}
