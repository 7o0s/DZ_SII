Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent. In recent months there has been talk of how Temple Run has actually created a genre, that of running games with a three-quarter top view. Beyond the resounding success achieved, from a qualitative point of view, the product of Imangi Studios does not however place itself at the top of the trend it inaugurated; and so, after the excellent Subway Surfers (also free: if you don't know it, run and read our review), here comes The End to create some more healthy competition. As you can imagine, the game is free to download from the App Store and is compatible with all iOS devices (the Android edition will be out in the next few weeks, hopefully). Through an in-app purchase (1.59 euros) it is possible to switch to the ~Pro~ version to enable all the features, but even without dropping a penny the experience is complete and satisfying. The reason is obvious: the developers have managed to create a progressive system within a genre traditionally devoted to the survival approach, to the ~single match~ in which you try to reach the greatest possible distance without impacting an obstacle and therefore incur game over. As? Taking the traditional achievements and making them protagonists of the structure. The ~story~ of The End unfolds over fourteen days, and each of them sees the protagonist travel paths within different scenarios, gradually more complex and full of pitfalls. To move on to the next day, however, you have to complete five objectives of various kinds: run for a certain number of meters, collect a certain amount of duct tape (which replaces Temple Run coins, in this case), buy a certain upgrade, reach certain sections of the map, and so on. Using the virtual money earned with each game it is even possible to ~buy~ the unlocking of an objective, but in general it is a system that works very well, adding depth to an otherwise ethereal experience and too similar to that offered by the aforementioned title of Imangi Studios. It goes without saying that there is also a ~free run~ mode to have fun running freely, avoiding obstacles and trying to set new records along the way. Good end and good start In terms of gameplay, the differences between The End and the running game it is inspired by are subtle but important. The controls are practically the same: the accelerometer determines the movement of the character within the ~lane~, possibly allowing him to avoid obstacles, while a series of gestures activate the jump (drag upwards), the slide (drag downwards) and the change of direction when a ~curve~ occurs (lateral dragging). The latter in Temple Run could be programmed a few moments in advance, while here you have to execute it exactly when you want to change direction, which would be a big problem if the rhythms weren't bland and ~reasoned~. In Imangi Studios' blockbuster there is almost no time to think, acceleration is immediate and in the end not even the controls can keep up with it, while the guys from Goroid have seen fit to grant more freedom of maneuver, to let players discover what's in the scenario and allow them to progress through the structure without necessarily dying after a few hundred meters. This type of approach is accompanied by a not excellent technical sector (especially as regards the animation of the protagonist) but well made, with a fair level of detail and an engaging sound accompaniment, which manages to effectively underline the most get excited.", "date": "2012-07-21", "grade": "8.0"}
