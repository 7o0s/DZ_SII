It's strange, to have tangible proof of how insignificant the human race is in the universe should fill us with anxiety and dread, yet virtually all astronauts remember the view of Earth as it departs the exosphere as the most beautiful ever. There under all human existence and its conquests, which amount to nothing when that blue and luminescent globe is the only thing that separates one's gaze from the infinite void. It may be for this reason that cinema in recent years has decided to exploit astronauts and their incredible journeys so thoroughly: first Gravity, then Interstellar, two immensely different films but made granite by the imagination of their directors and by the wonderful space panoramas. Today, however, we are not talking about films with an Oscar-worthy photograph, but about a title that this imaginary tries to make its own with the power of narrative and virtual reality, Adr1ft. Many will know it mainly for having been conceived by Adam Orth, the well-known Creative Director of Microsoft ~let go~ by the company after some unfortunate statements, who with this project has attempted to transmit his vicissitudes to the players by roundabout ways - the main reason for his fall. Are we therefore facing a project full of emotions and creativity, a sensational revenge in the form of a video game or a half-failure? Find out with us in zero gravity. Adr1ft: admire the Earth from space, and understand how small humanity is... or game design In sidereal space Adr1ft doesn't get lost in long introductions, nor does it try the road of the sea of information at the beginning of the game: when we start the situation is already disastrous, the player's awareness very few and the final goal unknown. You are Alex Oshima, young commander of an important space mission, and you are also the only survivor of an unspecified accident that tore apart the gigantic and ultra-modern Han-IV orbiting station. Inside a highly advanced but damaged EVA suit, you will have to wander through the rubble of the colossal station to reconstruct the events and possibly find an escape route, if one still exists. The means at your disposal to make sense of the circumstances and not perish are simply two: the thrusters of the space suit and your hands. Not much, considering that the suit has to use the precious air to even allow Alex to move in zero gravity, and that there isn't a whole lot in the Han IV to interact with. And here the first problem arises, clearly visible when one observes the effective interactivity of ADr1ft. The game is in fact a sort of variant of the increasingly popular ~walking simulator~, only that you float instead of walking and you are forced to constantly chase tanks full of oxygen so as not to suffocate during the journey. The pace of the adventure is therefore very slow, the movement not particularly precise (which was desired, to better convey the idea of loss and helplessness of the protagonist), and all you have to do is go from place A to place B. The element survival just mentioned is not particularly irritating - and after a short first phase it becomes even less significant - yet it weighs further on an already terribly slow and simplistic title. Men in suits Of course, we are aware that walking simulators do not usually shine for the complexity of their mechanics, but they are still titles that are often raised by other elements, such as art direction or narrative. A game like Gone Home was notable for its environmental narrative, atmosphere, and ability to play with the player's senses and preconceptions; Journey punched heart and brain hard thanks to mind-blowing art direction and a wonderful soundtrack Adr1ft, on the other hand, tries to support its themes with an exciting story and an exceptional artistic sector, however it partially fails in both fields. The stumbling block of the plot is the most evident: Orth's work wants to tell the stories of the crew of the Han IV through testimonies, recordings and digitized documents, but the whole adventure focuses exclusively on the event that led to the destruction of the orbiting station and on the personal stories of the characters, so there is never a change of pace, a sudden event, a real increase in tension. Forget twists or unexpected accidents at the Gravity, in fact, here one floats, slowly and inexorably, from wreck to wreck; the only target are the mainframes of the base or of the computers that belonged to the travel companionsor Oshima, full of information. The stories told, to tell the truth, outline well-built personalities, but it is still difficult to become attached to unequivocally dead characters, or feel the urge to advance just to discover their backgrounds. If it weren't for the underlying story to hold up the barrack, with its less trivial themes than expected, the few hours that make up the campaign would be intolerable; so they are just boring. The nature of the void The art direction is different, which represents a less sharp misstep. The first hour of Adr1ft is a feast for the eyes: the level of detail of the Earth, of which mountain ranges and natural formations can be distinguished in the distance, is incredible, and in general Adr1ft boasts a remarkable graphic fidelity. The eyes of Oshima, and therefore of the player, constantly pass from the devastation of the accident to the magnificence of the project the astronauts were working on, and moments of pure jubilation can be found in the colors of a flowering tree or in the spherical drops that populate a deserted room. Here, everything is ruined only by the survival mechanics mentioned above - which limit exploration - and the exhausting repetitiveness of the structure, capable of making even the most poetic view an unwanted break. It must be said, at least, that the first defect has been eliminated with the inclusion of the Free EVA Mode, which ensures that you explore the levels without the need for oxygen once completed; but little has been done to fix the slowness, repetitiveness and oversimplification of the whole system. We were even lucky enough to try the game with Oculus Rift, thanks to a trip to the Milan office of Digital Bros. Threeonezero's work is clearly built around this experience, but don't expect upheavals capable of resolving the countryside. After all, using a VR viewer does not allow you to move the view freely, only to look around by moving your head inside the Eva suit; an expedient that makes the hud indicators less visible and increases immersion, but is minimally penalized by the inevitable drop in graphic detail (it can also cause a slight nausea in some players). It's one of the first games of the current generation to be built around VR, so we understand its limitations, but we still would have liked to see a more energetic application of Oculus.", "date": "2016-04-08", "grade": "6.5"}
