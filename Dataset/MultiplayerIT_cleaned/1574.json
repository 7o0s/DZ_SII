Well, take the physique of Laurence Fishburne (the Morfeus of the Matrix) and merge it with the genius and madness of a John Carmak and you have Smart. Derek the obscure Probably one of the most talked about characters of the video game scene, both for the arrogance often shown in the approach with his works, and for the ambition shown in wanting to build a ~total~ game at all costs, which could close once and for all. all the talk of a 360-degree space simulation. There are numerous web pages around the net in which Smart is adored as an absolute genius and others in which he is mocked by games or photomontages, just like the referee Moreno. All this can only indicate what level of notoriety this character has received all over the world. The revolutionary idea of Battlecruiser Think of an RPG-oriented game where your character, immersed in a more classic space setting, can experience an adventure without conditions, without limits other than those of his own imagination. The character in question should have the opportunity to choose every detail of his career in this world, starting from that of a simple space marine, passing through that of a fighter pilot up to the much more demanding role of commander of a spaceship from interplanetary cruise. And all this, we repeat, without constraints imposed by restrictive missions or space limitations. Well, since the first chapter of the saga (namely Battlecruiser 3000, for which the full game is now available for free download at the official BC site) Smart's goal has been to provide the player with this kind of opportunity . However, the first chapter of the saga did not include the direct exploration of the planets which always remained outside the player's range of action. With Millennium instead the game has become ~total~. We will not only have to take care of the duties of a normal spaceship pilot, but manage armies on the conquered planets, control mining robots and entire fleets of fighters and shuttle transporters. Despite this, Smart does not believe that it has fully achieved its objectives. But after about ten years the silhouette of the completed masterpiece finally appears on the horizon, entitled Battlecruiser Generations, which should put the last word in the book of Smart's epic. No limits to our wandering Let us now tackle the analysis of the game from the beginning, i.e. from the structure of the universe in question. We are at the gates of the fourth millennium, the spatial expansion of terrestrials has known no limits in recent centuries and has led our civilization to confront the others already present outside our solar system. Having overcome the difficulties linked to interstellar flight, man has achieved the ability to travel in hyperspace and together with the other races that populate the known universe has built an entire intergalactic infrastructure capable of supporting such movements at speeds higher than that of light. Furthermore, astrophysical knowledge has made it possible to discover innumerable stratagems to evade the rules of space-time, understanding the mechanisms of the so-called wormholes, real tears in space-time, capable of providing rapid passages from one point to another in the universe. That said, in respect of the most classic of science fiction settings, it is almost useless to underline how the galaxies and solar systems have experienced a rapid expansion of the domains of the various races, in contrast with each other in order to guarantee control of the available slices of the universe. And here comes the fun part, because we are not talking about simple conflicts of war, but about a real interplanetary political/economic dynamic. All of this, as you can easily guess, has allowed the formation of numerous castes involving more or less all fields of common activities. The universe is in fact populated by traders, colonizers of planets, interstellar police, battling armies, rioters and even space pirates. The complicated scenario of Battlecruiser is born from the synergy of all these forces brought into play. It's hard to describe a game like this in just a few words. BC as we have already said is ~the total game~ where the words ~freedom of action~ are the key to the adventure. Taking the very first steps in this world you will be asked to choose which career you want to pursue. Almost wanting to embrace all categories of game, BC offers you a wide range of approaches to the game, partstarting from the career of the marine who will have to defend his army firsthand passing through that of the simple interstellar fighter pilot up to the commander of an entire fleet. The task of those who choose to take on the role of soldier ~on the ground~ will be limited to actions very similar to those offered by the best-known FPS, while there are various opportunities for those who choose to pursue their career inside a spaceship such as ship's officer. Indeed, it must be recognized that what separates BC Millennium from the expected Generation is precisely the completeness in the attention to all the details. In fact, it is evident that at the time of completion of Millennium the first person career was still considered by the developers as an ~extra~ aspect of the game in its entirety, for this very reason the title does not particularly stand out in brilliance in the game phases in mode FP. A special infiltrator among Smart's men The editorial staff of M.it anxiously awaits the release of Generations mainly for two reasons. The first is obviously linked to the expectation that the title has recently created in the environment of Derek Smart's supporters, and obviously in the whole universe of video game enthusiasts who see a sort of epochal turning point in such a colossal project ( and I can personally assure you that if all goes as promised, BC Generations will be a real model to inspire). The second reason, mentioned last certainly not because it is of minor importance, is that, incredible but true, our editorial team can boast of having, among its collaborators, the ~sound engineer~ of Battlecruiser Generations. This is our Manuel Marino, known to most under the pseudonym of Vanethian, to whom the general applause of all of us goes and the wish to be able to take advantage of this great opportunity to be able to continue his career in the video game environment. Control the flying cities To test the entirety of this title it is not possible to avoid boarding a real space ship. Thanks to it we will be able to undertake any kind of interaction with the universe and all its inhabitants, making real space raids like new Ulysses, in search of fame and fortune. The Captain of a Cruiser employs a veritable army of technicians, engineers, designers, pilots and last but not least warriors, all equipped with personalized characteristics and numerous parameters capable of transforming them into a real crew, which lives not only of orders but also of emotions. When leaving for a mission, everything must be carefully organized to avoid surprises once you leave the docks of the orbiting station that hosted you. A journey into the unknown can contain numerous pitfalls, starting from unexpected mutinies to end up with attacks by pirates, perhaps hidden by some technology capable of giving invisibility to your radars (and even to your eyes). Everything inside the control bridge has the feel of a real simulation, which blends internal battalion resource management with combat flight simulation. The ability to then control an entire fleet will make you understand once and for all the complexity of the game. In fact, a self-respecting Battlecruiser cannot fail to count on several other secondary ships capable of performing minor but not of little importance tasks, such as the patrolling of planets that have just been reached, the recovery of cargo abandoned in space or the adequate military support in case of conflict with enemy spaceships (keep in mind that these are just some of the possible examples). By impersonating the commander you can also abandon the ship, leaving the command to some trusted officer, to undertake particularly insidious missions in the first person. Finally, it will be possible for you to wear a sophisticated space suit and undertake difficult extravehicular missions, during which you will be able to make repairs to the ship or attempt to approach other aircraft. Numerous parameters will inform you of the state of health of your ship, while your officers, if sufficiently qualified, will keep an eye out for any anomalies and report the damage suffered during the firefights. You will be given the opportunity to transport more or less illustrious characters and act as escorts for them, you will be able to guarantee (at your own risk) illegal transports or even imprison criminals and enemies who escaped the destruction of their ship. dat the ~medibay~ you will also be provided with adequate medical support whenever the need arises, provided you bring a medical officer with you. In fact, in many situations you may have to deal with the health problems of your subordinates, both for injuries sustained following a bloody battle, and for prolonged exposure to radiation perhaps produced by some damaged reactor. Staying on the subject of radiation leaks and breakdowns, always remember to check the health of your equipment to avoid being left stranded during a jump into hyperspace. The absence of limits to your exploration will allow you to travel both in space and within planets. From the latter you can obtain great wealth, exploiting the natural resources present in them. Drone teams will be able to help you with this, thus increasing your economic potential and allowing you to easily climb the climb to success. Concluding In fact, Battlecruiser Millennium represented the first real approach to the ~totally freeform~ game as it had been conceived from the beginning of its design, and, so to speak, can be considered a sort of prototype of the great project that should reach maturity with the release of Generation. Released in the Gold edition, Battlecruiser Millennium is a title still capable of giving strong and truly unique emotions in the videogame field, in terms of total freedom of action. All that can be contested in this title is the graphics, decidedly below the average of the other titles, less cared for only to give more space to the creation of a title without borders. From a technical point of view, as already mentioned, BC Millenium suffers from some gaps in terms of graphics, which actually leave a little to be desired in some phases of the game. Although this less happy aspect of the title has recently been the main foothold for the most pressing criticisms, I don't feel able to demolish a job like this and I must admit that Smart has not only achieved a good part of the purposes with this game, but has also tempted to do something that is rarely seen in the world of video games today: seek originality and immersion. As for the soundtrack, we certainly can't waste time on compliments, as it is indeed something very repetitive and extremely bland. As we know, the highly anticipated sequel (Generations to be clear) will be able to take advantage of the work of our Vanethian (Manuel Marino) who created an exceptional soundtrack for the forges of Smart, a true masterpiece  la John Williams to be clear. Pending the release of Generations, the Gold edition of Battlecruiser Millennium undoubtedly remains the best that can be expected in the field of spatial role playing and freedom of play, a title capable even of keeping up with a title like Freelancer. If Derek Smart's promises are then kept in the future with regard to this genre, only Battlecruiser will be talked about, guaranteed! Pros: Perhaps one of the few titles of its kind to be able to offer such freedom of action The galaxy is truly vast and varied It's The Space Simulation par excellence Cons: The total freeform setting can be disorienting due to the lack of specific missions Definitely not graphics exhilarating. Poor soundtrack Dealing with the Battlecruiser topic is extremely complicated, both due to the complexity of a title which is more of a saga than a game, and more than a saga it is an entire philosophy, and due to the painful history that lies behind its creation. We are talking about a project that has been going on for several years now (and with several years you should focus more or less on the period in which multitasking for PC users was science fiction and everything was governed by the obscure DOS shell) and which tends to achieve of an extremely ambitious goal: the creation of the space RPG par excellence where the player is completely free to roam in a universe as vast as it is varied. To better understand what the main problem related to BC is, we cannot fail to focus our attention on the image of the father of all this, not to get to know Derek Smart.", "date": "2003-07-25", "grade": null}
