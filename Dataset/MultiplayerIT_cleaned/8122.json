{"name": "Virus letale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/112191-nano-assault-neo-virus-letale.html", "text": "Sequel in HD to the episode released on Nintendo 3DS (only in the USA, however), Nano Assault Neo is the new twin analog shooter developed by Shin'en exclusively for Wii U and available on the eShop at the price of 9.99 euros. The game is quite similar to the recent Super Stardust Delta, in the sense that it puts us on board a ship that has to explore a series of ~three-dimensional~ scenarios in search of enemies to kill, with the aim of reaching 90% in each level of eliminated opponents in order to move on to the next challenge. However, there is a substantial difference between the two titles in terms of setting: if in the Housemarque shooter we found ourselves gravitating around meteorites, paying homage to the classic Asteroids, in Nano Assault Neo the locations are actually molecules victims of a dangerous form of virus that, aboard a miniaturized vehicle (in the style of ~Leap in the dark~, in short), we will have the task of eradicating. It goes without saying that the bestiary we will be faced with will include spores, tentacled organisms, large flying worms and even creatures capable of blending in with the environment so as to catch us off guard. GamePad in hand, we will be able to defend ourselves by acting on the two analog sticks to move the ship (left stick) and shoot (right stick), pressing the ZR backbone to resort to any special attacks to be conquered on the field or to be purchased in the virtual shop between a stage and the other. One of the strengths of the Shin'en product is in fact the balance, therefore during the sixteen missions (twenty, if we also take into account the bonus sections) that make up the single player campaign we will have no way of ~keeping~ extra weapons and upgrades , but rather we will have to get them every time, keeping in mind the consequences of a defeat (in which case we will have to start the ~zone~ all over again). That's how we are done It only takes a few seconds to enter the mechanisms that regulate the gameplay of Nano Assault Neo. The game boasts extremely solid gunplay, capable of effectively rendering impacts and explosions and, therefore, producing a great sense of satisfaction with each destroyed bacteria. Among the upgrades available, the satellites for our spacecraft stand out, up to four, which we can reposition by acting on the GamePad touch screen so as to accommodate a particular style or lend themselves to a certain eventuality, such as the attack of a more resistant than average enemy. Then there are temporary energy shields, extra lives (essential from a certain point on) and weapons of various kinds, from homing lasers to energy ~chains~, which allow us to damage anyone in the vicinity, passing through bombs ~ Sonics~ with a wide range. Sixteen levels (which include four boss fights) are not many and you may even be able to complete the game in a single session, if you are familiar with the genre and a little patience, even if the lack of ~continue~ poses at least a prevent this eventuality. An excellent job has certainly been done in terms of characterization of the scenarios, with each ~molecule~ which arises in a different way as regards the pitfalls present. If the first two ~zones~, Epsilon and Zeta, can in fact be completed without major problems, from the third (Omicron) things will get complicated not only due to a progressive strengthening of the bacteria, which therefore will resist a greater number of blows from our part, but for the appearance of ~plants~ that emit shards of energy once destroyed, or barriers that move on the surface of the stage and whose touch can be fatal. Double fun? Nano Assault Neo offers some interesting extra features, such as local cooperative multiplayer (the second player can use a Wii U Pro Controller or the Wii-mote / Nunchuk pair), the ability to switch between the TV screen and the GamePad in an instant (but the graphic definition of the touch screen reduces the yield) and finally an arcade mode that allows you to replay the missions already completed to obtain a high score to show off in the world leaderboard, perhaps comparing the results obtained with those of our friends. So everything is perfect? Not exactly. The biggest limitation of the Shin'en production, as mentioned, lies in the small number of levels available, which translates into an experience that basically has already given us everything after two or three hours. But there are also other issues that need to be explored, specifically a much less multifaceted gameplay than that of the aforementioned Super Stardust Delta, in which we experimented with the ~colors~ of weapons and with upgrades to obtain a certain thickness. Nothing to say instead on the technical sector: the graphics are a lotdefined, a great job has been done with colors and effects, and everything runs at 60 frames per second without ever a hitch. There may be some ~readability~ problems when it comes to intercepting certain enemy bullets, but with a little attention, accidental deaths can be avoided.", "date": "2012-12-11", "grade": "7.0"}
