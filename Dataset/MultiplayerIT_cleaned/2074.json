{"name": "Endgame", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/endgame.html", "text": "It's already over? The first flaw certainly to highlight is longevity. In the dining room this aspect is often not noticed since an hour spent playing with a couple of tokens can also be satisfying, but after a huge expense for the game and relative gun, a little bitterness remains in the mouth when you manage to finish the all in a couple of days. Here some stratagems come into play to increase the duration of the title as much as possible, such as subgames and multiplayer modes, but certainly two simple modes, even if well done, certainly cannot distort the duration of a game from 0 to 100. appreciate the attempt to improve what turns out to be the main flaw of this genre. Just run and shoot? And the plot? The whole game is divided into three modes: story, mighty joe jupiter (training) and related subgames. During the ~story~ mode the further you progress, the more you will unlock new options and scenarios for the remaining modes. Mighty joe jupiter, as you may have understood, is used to train with nice games that will put us in front of aliens who will become more and more fearsome over time. The subgames instead allow you to relive some sections of the ~story~ mode, but with some particular expedient that makes them vary from the latter. Let's take a closer look at the main mode: the story. From the initial video you will understand who will be the protagonist. Her name is Jade, a young, reckless and buxom girl ready to do anything to help her kidnapped friend. The game is set in 2020, technology has now taken over and some criminals want to take advantage of it by managing to control the mind through the use of holograms. Our task, or rather that of Jade, will be to free the friend and to thwart this crazy plan, all with the help of a simple pistol. Easy, right? The whole game is divided into numerous scenarios of various types: from the subway to the woods, from the classic running train to the ubiquitous skyscrapers and many others, all almost always interspersed with videos that will better clarify the unfolding of the plot or the situation you will have to face. Don't expect gorgeous Full Motion videos, these cutscenes are short and made with the same graphics as the game in real time. Hey watch out with that gun! One aspect not well taken care of is the sound. Although it is not of a bad level, it settles at a level of ordinary administration without ever excelling. The game is completely in English, albeit subtitled in Italian and that's a good thing because in this kind of game, where the plot takes a back seat, the translation is often left out to maybe take care of some other aspect. The same can be said of the graphics which are of a good standard but certainly do not fully exploit the potential of the machine. The scenarios are quite detailed and partly interactive, but some will be a bit sparse even if all this serves to positively favor the fluidity of the game. The appearance of the enemies is not very well cared for; often from the face they can look like mannequins, but the movements are still well done as well as the effects of the shots on the body. Although the movements are appreciable, they are a bit slow and it will happen more than once to see enemies perform somersaults and jumps with mobile capabilities worthy of an over eighty year old. The controls are quite reactive and precise and if you have any problems you can always calibrate your little gem by opening the practical game options. The title is very playable and only some sections and some bosses will be difficult, but just enough to increase the longevity a little without affecting the fun too much. Reload! Endgame is a decent game that knows how to be fun even if it doesn't excel in any particular element, but it still perfectly represents a very particular and loved genre. Unfortunately, the comparison with the Namco title is inevitable, with which he comes out defeated even if with his head held high. A greater variety of situations and a larger main mode would probably have helped to make the final result more exciting. For Endgame it is still a good start, the hope is now that the Empire gives us a sequel with all the trimmings.Pro Sufficient graphics and sound Many modes Good fluidity 20 game levels but Cons  not very long-lived The characters lack depth It does not excelGrab your gun! Action! Surely long-time enthusiasts will remember Time Crisis, just as cinema-goers will remember the many afternoons spent shooting and reloading overcoming scenarios after scenarios, perhaps even with the help of a trusted friend who improvised as a ~sniper~. Time Crisis has always had great success, perhaps thanks to the lack of rivals of a certain caliber. After the release of Time Crisis 2, a conversion of the hall title of the same name, here comes Endgame which proposes itself with a simple style to try to oust what seems to be the best up to now. This genre of games is very particular and must be analyzed with great care in order to express an impartial judgment that allows the buyer not to fall into a bad title. The most complex detail to analyze is certainly the passage itself from the halls to our homes. Many aspects in the room can be overlooked, but once you get home you realize many small defects which added up and added up again can make the interest in an apparently interesting title diminish; fortunately this is not the case. Endgame is a title that was born directly on consoles, but this does not mean that it is free from the usual defects that afflict other shooters.", "date": "2002-06-27", "grade": null}
