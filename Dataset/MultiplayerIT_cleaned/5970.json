The latter is a small, relatively young company, responsible for minor projects (the previous Motorcycle Club didn't shine): although the budget remains moderate, this is a good opportunity to stand out on the market. The timing is right too, especially on current-gen consoles that have so far lacked a rally exponent. We therefore tested WRC 5 on Xbox One for a long time and with curiosity, read on to find out our opinion. WRC 5 is fun and rewarding, but with a few glitches too many Excuse me, do you have a license? The first thing that strikes you about WRC 5 is the presentation: instead of wasting time on impactful movies or high-sounding titles, we are immediately taken to the main menu, essential and characterized by centered graphics. Even if it is a minor detail, it is already a clear improvement compared to the Milestone menus of the previous chapters, afflicted by an annoying delay in the commands. Considering that in a title of this kind a considerable part of time is spent in the settings of the car and in the other options, this is a more than appreciable detail. The title immediately shows itself to be very complete, with the presence of the inevitable career that contemplates test sessions, repairs and all those managerial aspects that one can expect, but also free racing, with all the routes and cars available, a single rally and online multiplayer modes. In this regard, the eSports integration should be highlighted, which offers dynamic events displayed in the appropriate hub; these are equipped with a deadline, complete with a countdown, a really interesting idea obviously accompanied by the constantly updated global rankings. Another valuable aspect is the rally school, accessible individually or through the career, functional for learning the new driving system. Basically it is a series of time trials, where it is necessary to satisfy certain and increasingly demanding requirements to move on to the next test, in the style of Polyphony's Gran Turismo. It is advisable to tackle these tests before anything else to practice the various maneuvers. As mentioned, the official WRC license guarantees the presence of original brands, which translate into three categories of cars: WRC, WRC-2 and J-WRC, for a total of twenty-one real teams. The part reserved for the circuits is no less, with thirteen countries and a total of sixty-five stages. All courses feature variable weather conditions including rain, snow, dusk and night racing. The numbers are therefore absolutely on the side of Bigben production. A whole new mud A perceptible change in WRC 5 is linked to the driving system, which differs significantly from that of the previous chapters, while not distorting them. This is actually a commendable move by Kylotonn to convey a nice feeling of continuity in the series. Even the proprietary engine of the French company tries to be stylistically consistent with the previous one, facilitating a natural transition from one to the other. In any case, the changes under the body are immediately felt and expressed through a different interpretation of the drift, which has never managed to fully convince us in the Milestone titles, perhaps due to the physics engine. Now a balance is needed between normal braking and the use of the handbrake, which proves to be a crucial tool for negotiating the most treacherous hairpin bends. The driving system offered by Kylotonn could be defined as ~simcade~, or a very permissive hybrid on the side of immediacy, able to satisfy even the less accustomed to simulation. That said, it should be specified that we are not dealing with an easy game: the curves must be tackled with criterion and precision, mistakes are paid dearly with frequent going off the road, bumps or loss of precious seconds. By then activating the damage and removing the driving aids, WRC 5 is able to satisfy even the most demanding public, obviously without the expectation of a rigorous simulation. The more daring can even activate the actual damages, which radically change the performance picture: tires and suspensions are subject to wear, while serious accidents can end the race prematurely or compromise it irreversibly. In general, the driving system is sufficiently satisfying and immediate to capture the attention of even the least experiencedyou. Xbox One goals WRC 5 features the canonical 1000 player points. The first 100 will be collected completely spontaneously by starting a career and trying out the various modes. The remainder will be more challenging, requiring completion of individual Rallies and online races. Good luck! Desire for fluidity Unfortunately, the real thorn in the side of WRC 5 concerns the technical realization, which demonstrates the limited budget made available to the studio. The cross-gen Kt HD graphics engine tries to get the best out of the Xbox One version, with rather detailed courses, well-crafted cars and the use of 1080p resolution, but the price to pay is really excessive, with a locked frame rate at 30 frames per second and quite choppy. The hardest moments are those on the hairpin bends, where we see the biggest crashes, but the action is rarely fluid, especially when using the external camera, which forces the engine to manage the car's polygonal load and particle effects. Aliasing is very aggressive, as is texture filtering, with the result of presenting an image plagued by ~stairs~ and poorly defined details in the distance. There's also sporadic item pop-in, thankfully not noticeable when you're focused on the action. The audio system is also poor, with the really irritating co-pilot's voice, unconvincing engine sounds and some annoying bugs that we hope will be fixed with some patches at launch. On the other hand, the engine also features appreciable and not obvious details, a step forward compared to the past, such as a realistic lighting system capable of giving truly pleasant moments. Also noteworthy is the good track design: the courses are not completely realistic, but designed not to bore the player, they are able to always keep the attention high, proposing ever new scenographic elements and facilitated by the considerable variety of settings. The servers at the time of our test were not yet functional, so we did not have the opportunity to test the timed modes online.", "date": "2015-10-15", "grade": "7.0"}
