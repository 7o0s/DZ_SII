Well, Matthias Linda is one of us, a JRPG enthusiast who lives in Germany and who has not only made this dream come true, but has made it concrete in Chained Echoes, an indie game that has programmed itself almost completely by itself in the span of the past seven years. Linda, who cut her teeth on the various RPG Makers, thought of everything, delegating the creation of backgrounds and music to some trusted freelancer, while he worked on the rest. One would think of a title too ambitious to be true, destined to come out with a flood of problems and to be branded with a cold but polite: ~Thanks for trying, Mathias~. Handshake and many greetings. But no. In this Chained Echoes review, we're going to tell you how it's one of the best RPGs we've played in recent years: a real gem that no fan of the genre should miss. A story that fascinates Chained Echoes, the game is all in English For Linda it would have been easy to fish with both hands in the nostalgia bucket: Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Suikoden, Final Fantasy VI, Terranigma and associates. Take this, take that, put it all together, hide behind the fanservice excuse and voil, the game is served and the enthusiast is more or less satisfied. But Linda didn't just love those games: she also understood them. For this there is nothing forced or superfluous in his Chained Echoes, and every reference is so witty and well embedded in the gameplay or narrative that it does not fall into simple fanboy quotation. Take the story, which begins with a tasty reference to the incipit of Chrono Trigger, only to take a completely different direction. We are on the continent of Valandis, where three nations have been warring for too long and mercenaries abound, like the protagonist we control in the first minutes of the game, Glenn. The introduction is a kind of tutorial: it teaches us to move and fight as we make our way towards a precious stone that could turn the conflict around. The actions of Glenn - who is a mechanic specializing in the maintenance of combat armor called Sky Armor - and his company, however, trigger the power of the stone, which is actually a kind of weapon: a catastrophe breaks out, thousands of innocent, and the story takes a sudden leap into the future. The catastrophe has led the nations to a truce, but in the shadows there are forces plotting to rekindle the fuse of the conflict. Linda's screenplay, quick and flowing but never rushed, puts us in the shoes of different characters who all converge in the same place in the first bars of the game: forming a first team of heroes who will find themselves fighting on the same side despite their differences. Although it may seem, the narrative of Chained Echoes is by no means obvious, also and above all because Linda had the ability to articulate it in an intelligent, sensible and, above all, unexpected way. The story breaks and reassembles the group several times; moreover, the cast is nothing short of picturesque, characterized not only in the individual backgrounds, but also in the gameplay through the combat system which gives even more depth to the individual characters. It is a pity, therefore, that the story continues so straight as to overshadow some protagonists who deserved more space or closure. Chained Echoes, the scenarios are very colorful and detailed Chained Echoes is a half-steampunk fantasy in which humans and anthropomorphic animals share the same world, in which each NPC has something interesting to say that helps to better define the narrative, but without getting lost in useless or verbose chatter. The dialogues - all in English: the game is not localized in Italian - are flowing, never verbose, and the characters slowly reveal themselves, surprising the player on several occasions. Net of a few moments in which the story slows down excessively - and perhaps because the pace is so fast that the braking is better noticeable - Chained Echoes is a RPG that lacks in presentation, and for completely different reasons than you might think. The pixel art it is in fact fantastic, well-kept both in the animations and in the detail of the sprites and scenarios, a very detailed triumph of colors and level design, intricate but never frustrating. However, it is in the best moments of history that something is missing. Not of the music, because Eddie Marianukroh's score is really splendida, but of an extra gear, so to speak, in visual spectacularity: perhaps it is precisely because Chained Echoes recalls the 90s RPGs that we would have expected a cinematic in the salient moments, which however never arrived. Overdrive and Overheat Chained Echoes, turn based combat is very strategic Chained Echoes is a title that strikes a rare balance between narrative and gameplay. To achieve this, Mathias Linda has chosen the Chrono Trigger formula, preferring to place the fights in specific points on the map: exploration is therefore calibrated to perfection, and gives players the freedom to explore the various maps in search of secondary objectives and collectibles more or less hidden. The author has not wasted a square centimeter, and if there is an alternative road to the main one, you can be sure that it will lead to some chests or optional battles. This does not mean that there is little fighting, on the contrary. The turn-based battles last longer than normal on average, but this really doesn't matter because they are well proportioned and rely on a truly intuitive and ingenious combat system. The player can field up to four characters at the same time, but in reality each of them can associate a partner who can be exchanged in the turn of the couple, and without any penalty, bringing the total number of characters on the battlefield to eight. Chained Echoes, characters can pilot mechs called Sky Armor There are neither experience points nor level up: the characters acquire SP to enhance their skills with each fight, and by defeating bosses or completing some secondary tasks you earn special points which are used to learn new spells, skills or passive bonuses which you can then we will have to equip in a limited number of individual spaces. Each character is defined by a very specific skill kit, which even includes a scenic super attack. Viktor, for example, is a bard, and therefore sings his spells that can buff the party or damage enemies. Rogue Sienna, on the other hand, is something of a samurai, with elegant sword attacks that deal damage over time or can chain in succession. Robb is the hunter of the party: he can shoot deadly arrows, place traps and inflict abnormal conditions on enemies.Each character represents a solid addition to the party, which goes various steps with the introduction of specific mechanics or conditions, and the ability to Exploiting enemy elemental weaknesses involves minimal thinking about which skills to use. Chained Echoes, the game is full of collectibles and secrets Fortunately, the party recovers all HP and TP at the end of each fight, so the player can indulge freely, but must always take into account the Overdrive, a mechanic that hovers over every fight and represents the main difficulty modifier. This indicator is divided into three areas colored yellow, green and red, and each skill or attack we use will move a marker in one direction or another: our goal is to stay in the green space, so as to keep the party in Overdrive and benefit from various advantages. Finishing in the red space, however, our heroes will go into Overheat and will have to deal with various problems, starting with the fact that the enemies will inflict much more damage. So you need to choose your actions wisely, especially during bosses that often require a minimum of strategy and planning. It's a really ingenious system that keeps the player on their toes, forces them to micromanage resources and causes them to diversify their choice of skills. The introduction of Sky Armor at a certain point in the game further changes this dynamic, directly affecting the variety of clashes that become even more challenging and interesting. Chained Echoes, Overdrive system makes some bosses really challenging Now one might wonder how it is possible that a single individual has managed not only to manufacture excellent gameplay, which expertly mixes action and exploration, but also an intriguing narrative, which rarely falls into clich and which surprises until the end credits. But perhaps the answer is simple: in trying to reinvent themselves, the industry giants have lost sight of what made this genre truly great in its golden age. Keep in mind that it takes about thirty hours to complete Chained Echoes, even more if you decide to comb through every area and complete every side assignment: there are special equipment to find, mini-games, secret bosses and everything you would expect from an RPG of this type. With the difference that Chained Echoes is sold at a demented price, for the content it offers, and is even includedin Game Pass. In short, if you love this genre, you absolutely must play it.", "date": "2022-12-18", "grade": "9.0"}
