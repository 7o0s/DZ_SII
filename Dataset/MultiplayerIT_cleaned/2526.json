{"name": "Rugby 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rugby-2001.html", "text": "An eye (pesto) to the graphics Once the game is installed (you can choose between two installations, the 600 Mb full and the 200 Mb compact - which I absolutely do not recommend especially if you have one of those Dvd-roms that look for the track almost continuously -), you to the classic Easport presentation. A movie that shows us clips of some Rugby matches in pure television style, really exciting, immediately helps to raise the hope that the title has been treated as much as possible. Those of you who are completely ignorant of the rules of this game, don't worry too much: a small, but quite exhaustive, manual inside the game box will accompany you in the first stages of setting up with a lot of new terms: melee , grouping, touche and so on. Furthermore, a short (perhaps too short) tutorial introduces us to the main actions of the match on the field and makes us become familiar with them: scrum, set pieces, free play (i.e. the one made up of passes, runs and kicks towards forward), and a training game: the advice is of course to spend at least a couple of hours in the maze of this tutorial, because the task that awaits us once we start a tournament or a friendly game is really difficult. The reproduction of the players on the screen renders the physicality of their action and their dynamism very well: although the resolution chosen by the programmers is the classic 640x480, and it is only possible to vary it in any way, some small details make the game really accurate: the shorts that get dirty over time and according to the weather conditions, the number of shirts, the shots and movements of the players in general, the spiked shoes worn by the gladiators on the field, the faithful reproduction of the national uniforms (you can play , being the game in general dedicated to the Rugby World Cup for Nations, only with national teams), the presence for some players of the head bandana to keep the hair above the forehead, the presence of the referee... As mentioned , these small details help to give a notable tone to the general graphics of the game, not to mention that the perfect reproduction of the world's major stadiums is accompanied by a precise characterization (even the build and height correspond) of all the players present; among other things, this careful physical diversification of the players has a precise response in the actual action of the game, as each member of the team will have a running, jumping, and physical strength unique and different from the others. Even the ~outline~ graphics, i.e. both the reproduction of the stadiums and the referees, certainly deserve a little applause; discourse which unfortunately cannot also be referred to the representation of the public in the stands, since a more careful (but not so much, the undesirable effect is quite visible) look you can see how it is ~spread~ on the stands, in the most classic Easport tradition . It is true that there are not many other sports titles where the public is represented in a more convincing way, but some examples such as Virtua Tennis and Nba2k on Dreamcast have remained unheard in this case. As for the sound aspect, it can be said without fear of contradiction that the effort made by the programmers was perhaps a little too insignificant: beyond the ~blonk~ effect of the oval ball bouncing on the field and numerous ~ ouch!~ by some player making stunt plays, the rest of the pot is really a bit sleazy. The same choruses of the public are repetitive and absolutely monotonous, and in most of the times they appear quite uncoordinated with respect to the action: in this case for the comparison we don't even have to bother the Sega console, just go back to about ten years ago to the conversion of Goal by Dino Dini... Where the Rugby 2001 graphics really shine, and this is certainly the most important thing, is in the management of the game, which with its speed and its sudden changes in ball possession forces the camera (one of the four available - in this case, more unique than rare, all four cameras are functional to gameplay -) to perform amazing and rapid 180 turns, Zoom-in during scrums and Zoom-out in cases of the ball kicked with feet. An eye (pesto) to the graphics After a few minutes, necessary in this case to adapt to such a ~dynamic~ game engine, one cannot fail to feel at ease, and for this reason we tend to no longer give importance to the rest, but only to the overwhelming game action . Of course, if the programmers had inserted some efmore sound effect or some more aggressive and involved chorus... but that's it: let's not look a gift horse in the mouth. As for the possibility of reviewing one's actions through the Replay, the work that has been done by the programmers in this sense equals, or even exceeds, that done for the most famous series dedicated to football. In fact, the replay, which can be recalled at any moment of the game, offers us the possibility to zoom in, rotate the camera indiscriminately as we please and observe the game action from any position: it is truly spectacular to review one's runs and goals scored, also because in the early days they will occur quite rarely. Stretch me that ball a little... Some legends tell that rugby was born in this way, during a football tournament in the police station. Leaving aside this joke at the risk of a lawsuit, it cannot be denied that Rugby is a rather unknown sport, and that most gamers will probably feel a certain awe when approaching it for the first time. Abstruse rules to deal with? Strange dispositions of the players in the middle of the field? Need to study a 300-page manual to understand something? No, none of this. Once you have mastered the main rules of Rugby (the ball can only be passed forward with your feet, there are different types of set-piece, the lineout is carried out by choosing from different positions of men on the field, to score points you need to arrive in end zone with the ball in your hands and make it touch the ground holding it with at least one of them...), the game becomes fun and absolutely frenetic. Rugby 2001 certainly manages to reproduce the spirit of the sport in a rather faithful way, and a couple of hours of adaptation to this discipline is enough to refine one's game actions in search of increasingly complex and rewarding actions. Unfortunately, if on the one hand it should be emphasized that most of the actions are represented in a brilliant and decidedly playable way, the game lacks in the reproduction of scrums, which are generated spontaneously (every time the two teams compete for a ball ~dead~) every... 30 seconds of gameplay. When a player is tackled and the ball falls to the ground, the players of the two teams gather around it as quickly as possible and start a scrum to try to contain the opposing action, i.e. that of the team that first reached the ball; we don't know why, but in 95% of cases our action is cut short by the inability of our players to be able to counter the ~push~ of the opponent's pack. There is a gamepad button, or keyboard key, to force this push, but in a strange twist, it seems to have little bearing on the actual gameplay. So much so that the only scrums that can be won are those in which one is able, with another key, to attract the highest number of team mates to the ball in the shortest possible time, immediately removing the opponent's pack and conquering the ball; forget about winning scrums any other way. I honestly don't know if it's a bug recognized by the programmers or even if they are already working on a corrective patch, but the complaints circulating on the net about this little detail (small but absolutely capable of undermining what could be an extremely valid and fun) are very numerous, and this will probably lead to a correction in the short term. As for the Artificial Intelligence of the opposing teams, we will immediately discover that the movements of the teams we will play against will punctually block all the corridors during the defensive phase, while they will constantly vary during the construction of the offensive action, forcing us to chase the opponents at any point of the field, with sudden changes of direction. If one small note, or rather two, could be made to the opponents' skills in creating the game, one could attribute to them the scarce use of the ~turbo~, i.e. fast running in short spaces, during the offensive phases, and the repeated tendency to looking for the goal even when a running kick would bring some sure points: from this point their action aimed at the forced search for the goal makes the attack quite predictable at least in the last ten meters of the game. The ability of the players on the field to get injured also makes the game interesting from a strategic point of view, because in the long run we will try, in a kind of sporting contradiction, to carefully dose the runs of the strongest players, since in doing so we reduceand the possibility of some defensive tackle capable of injuring and therefore forcing the player to leave the field. Precisely in this regard, you shouldn't worry if you don't know perfectly the roles and characteristics of each player, since the game will not automatically allow you to insert a forward instead of a defender in the event of an injury, or vice versa. The frenetic runs, decidedly very exciting, but not very productive and profitable (our player is tackled almost instantly if it is not a counter-attack in which the opposing team is unbalanced on one side of the playing field), give way in the long run to more careful planning of the game also through the use of short, long or high kicks, capable of giving your team time to organize itself in the best possible way. It's not worth worrying about not being able to learn game tactics (and by this I am referring above all to those who don't know Rugbu), also because by observing the movements and game actions of the opposing team, you will soon learn how to move the team in a certain way, or to plan various and more effective offensive actions than running alone. In this regard, we can only advise the less experienced to spend some time, especially in the early stages where it may be difficult to learn the spirit of the game, to observe a game played on the computer. Ball in goal? The game is very playable, fun, frantic... but the frustration of not being able to win practically any melee slowly makes the frustration rise well beyond bearable levels; the tenth time you will lose the simplest of scrums, perhaps playing with the All Blacks team (the strongest in the world), or even just with the Italian national team (fairly strong in the game), against the fragile Korean players ... well , I let you imagine how the feeling of realism and fun soon leaves your gaming pleasure. By this I don't mean that the title isn't playable or fun, just that the regret for this strange detail is enormous, even thinking that the rest of the game, from the precise reproduction of the players, the stadiums, the very feeling of a Rugby match , it's almost perfect. Surely, however, only the most patient players will be able to resist after yet another melee defeat; even choosing to try to set up your game in a less centered way on scrums is not really possible, also because, as mentioned before, we will find ourselves dealing with them at least three times in a minute of play. Ultimately Rugby 2001 is a title that certainly deserves a chance, at least for its uniqueness and for the ability to recreate the spirit of sport with an almost-perfect (and by that I mean almost perfect apart from the sin-scrum), making it at the same time playable and very fun even for those who are new to this sport. My advice is therefore to approach this game, and this discipline, without reverential fears, since Rugby 2001 knows how to give, in front of a small initial investment in terms of learning time, fun and playability. But beware of the sin: it is capable of making you lose interest in the game in a short time (especially in the initial stages, when you are too preoccupied with understanding the mechanisms of the game). Esports, are you there? Rugby, this stranger A little appreciated and widespread sporting discipline in the Belpaese, Rugby has English origins dating back to the first half of the 1800s, when a certain William Webb Ellis picked up the ball with which he was playing with friends and, holding it in his hands, ran away until he was chased and resumed. A little less than two hundred years from that day, today Rugby has followers all over the world, as well as minor and major leagues scattered around the globe, especially in the European and Australian continents. As analyzed in last month's preview, however this sport has never received videogame treatment equal to that of the others that we usually see broadcast on television (the so-called National Sports, even if Rugby has had quite a following here in Italy for some years) , and in the past years we have only been able to see a couple of mediocre titles. This year, however, Easport has taken over the official license of the Rugby Federation and has produced this title, Rugby 2001, which joins the ~usual~ winter lineup of Canadian programmers (Fifa, Nba Live, Nhl... ). Being able to reproduce the violent but correct clashes, the adrenaline rushes towards the opponent's goal and the repeated scrums, but at the same time trying to capture the attention of those", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
