However, it should be noted that the porting team (Robomodo) dared much more, proposing the best of the two episodes released on Playstation, reconstructing them with the help of the Unreal Engine. For those unfamiliar with this historic saga, know that we go back a good dozen years, a period in which the original Neversoft managed to hit a truly unique blend. Taking advantage of the image of the famous skater, the titles offered challenges based on time and the mastery of the most sophisticated techniques, or tricks, represented by spectacular acrobatic performances capable of skyrocketing the score. The same formula has been replicated in this new episode for digital delivery, along with a number of interesting online modes. The old school The career is therefore substantially unchanged, accusing the conceptual simplicity of the period. We have to face seven scenarios to be progressively unlocked, the only way to move on to the next is to satisfy a pre-established number of objectives in the maximum time of two minutes, after which the session will end. These range from recovering special items, posters, breaking boxes or conquering dizzying scores. That's all, no cut scenes, dialogues or improbable narrative pretexts. The problem is that there is no tutorial capable of introducing gameplay dynamics and control mapping, forcing those who have not played the previous episodes to improvise by repeating the same session several times. Once the ice has been broken with the commands, things improve, but at the same time the antediluvian mechanics of the control system and physics are revealed. Unfortunately for Robomodo over the years the genre has undergone a radical change with the Skate saga of Electronic Arts, which introduced control through the right analog stick and opening up a universe of new possibilities. This isn't necessarily Tony Hawk's fault, representing a now obsolete generation where tricks are assigned to pad buttons, thus conveying a feeling of awkwardness and little freedom. Just to give an example, grinding, a slang term to define sliding on railings and edges, is performed by pressing the Y key with a highly unreal alignment of the skater with the goal, where in Skate countless factors are taken into consideration, starting by the slope of the table. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD also dispenses with the foot push, since the character moves continuously as if he were on a motorized board. Not exactly the height of realism. The maps are large but always limited, where by now one would expect a freely explorable world. The game offers a roundup of famous athletes, as well as the possibility of using our avatar with lots of items acquired in the marketplace. As the scenarios are unlocked, we can accumulate a certain amount of money to spend in shops to buy new tricks. Unfortunately, there is no further personalization of your character. Xbox 360 goals Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD aligns with the new scoring standards set by Microsoft. We therefore have a total of 16 objectives for 400 overall player points. We immediately anticipate that unlocking them proves to be a rather onerous task, like getting 500,000 points on the Venice Beach map. Good luck! Technical and online Technically Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD presents the typical joys and sorrows of the Unreal Engine, with high-impact textures and good attention to detail. On the other hand, the typical woodiness of this engine returns, not very accustomed to dynamic situations, the texture loading delay, the lack of animations and the framerate that barely reaches thirty frames, with frequent drops. Basically, the graphic aspect is pleasant and its defects do not affect its playability, and this is what matters. In addition to the career, there are free sessions where you can increase your score, plus three rather fun online modes. It starts from the one called graffiti, where it is necessary to customize the scenario, passing through a sort of conquest of the territory, where the area with the best trick acquires the player's color, to end up in the hilarious big heads mode, where we have to prevent the explosion of the our head by making breathtaking plays, essentially a time bomb capable of creating hilarious situations. Too bad the netcode wasn't exactly optimal, porleading to seemingly impossible falls and very dubious collisions. The soundtrack features a selection of the best songs featured in the first two Tony Hawks, however illustrious exponents are still missing, a defection that fans can't help but notice.
