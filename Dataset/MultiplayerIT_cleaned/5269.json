To repel the extraterrestrials, he will have to cross five different environments and complete almost fifty missions in which timing is everything, gradually acquiring new components for his super-technological armor and new skills related to them. This is the concept behind the game, which constantly introduces new maneuvers to our repertoire to make an experience more multifaceted which in some ways resembles the various horizontal scrolling endless runners, but which is precisely characterized by a precise progression system, punctuated both from internships and from upgrades. Reaching the end of each path is a test of cunning that gradually becomes more complex, so don't let yourself be fooled by the banality of the early stages: the title developed by Pixel Blast becomes challenging starting from the second area, forcing us more and more often to retry a mission after game over. Super Powerboy is a beautiful title to look at and pleasant to play, with an excellent progression system The War of Armor As mentioned above, the protagonist's armor is enriched with new elements as the campaign progresses, which means that during the first stages we will only be able to use some of its parts. Gloves are progressively introduced, which allow you to hit certain enemies along the way, but also boots, which allow the protagonist to ~grind~ on the railings and to double jump to overcome obstacles of a certain size, and then again other devices. Super Powerboy's control system is based exclusively on the touch screen: by swiping on the left side of the screen, you perform the movements, whether it's jumping, sprinting or sliding, while by acting on the right side, you use the attacks. Understanding in a few moments which maneuver to perform is the key to being able to arrive unscathed at the end of each level, collecting energy capsules along the way that our avatar can use to obtain the upgrades necessary to continue the story. In terms of design, the project developed by Pixel Blast is very simple, even trivial in its linearity, but the excellent technical realization makes you turn a blind eye to this aspect: the animations of the protagonist are fluid, the drawing style is reminiscent of that of Disney feature films (such as the aforementioned Big Hero 6) and the settings are discretely differentiated, even if they don't shine for detail and personality. The end result is therefore a pleasant product, which knows exactly where to go and which is offered on the App Store at an affordable price (1.99 euros), without any in-app purchase.", "date": "2016-09-29", "grade": "7.7"}
