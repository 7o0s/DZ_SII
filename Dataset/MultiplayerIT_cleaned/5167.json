It won't be a problem, the bullets to get it grow in a vase in the corridor and if he needs advice he can always turn to the speaking abyss that is in his wall. Disoriented? Well, these are just the premises of the new video game developed by the Italians of Yonder in collaboration with Strelka Games. Hell is Others' recipe starts from a solid foundation of multiplayer survival horror to which looter shooter elements have been added, a pinch of rogue-lite and a sprinkling of RPG. Mixing so many genres is a gamble but this amalgam works well and has an incredible ability to adapt to the needs of each player. The noir atmospheres of 1920s America mixed with the hostility of a post-apocalyptic world create an experience that disorients in the best possible way: making you want more. In this review of Hell is Others we tell you how this new Italian title could be the unexpected surprise of this 2022 so full of local excellence. A businessman and a bottle of whiskey Even diners are full of dangers in Hell is Others Adam Smithson has a pair of black trousers, a black tie, a white shirt, a pair of suspenders and a gun, he is not a man of many words and above all he shouldn't waste his time. A day like many others someone leaves a bonsai in front of his door, above it is a note that says ~Water it. I'll be back in 10 days with a reward~. This seemingly ordinary event is the first domino in a domino destined to disrupt the lives of Adam, and many others like him. Hell is Others is set in Century City, a ruined city in a world on the verge of extinction. Here, in addition to dollars, the most precious resource is blood because it is with this that the plants are watered; even those of bullets. Adam is a businessman, an individual who specializes in recovering items and resources from the evil-infested alleys of Century City. After the arrival of the bonsai he meets Octave, a merchant who offers him a series of deals. The city, as well as dangers, is full of opportunities because houses, dumpsters, chests and luxury villas are full of resources that Octave is willing to buy by paying in cash. Here begins the adventure of Hell is Others, a journey which, through a daily routine of death and corruption, wants to tell the story of a world that has let itself be poisoned by its own fears. The elevator is salvation The elevator bell is one of his most feared in Hell is Others Adam lives in a 1920s building complete with red wallpaper on the walls, has a modest house and a listless doorman who, like the lift attendant, is a rabbit. This doesn't seem to upset the protagonist because, actually, it's among the most plausible in his world. To get the blood needed to water the bonsai, Adam will have to take to the streets of Century City and face its many dangers. In addition to the monstrous creatures that attack on sight, you will discover that the city is populated by other beings, much meaner and more bloodthirsty: the other players. Hell is Others, in fact, is a PvPvE game in which, on the same game map, there is not only your Adam but a series of other businessmen who can't wait to eliminate you and steal everything you have collected. Indeed, when Adam takes the lift, we see his true nature for a moment: an all-black monster, with a large fuchsia eye, armed and thirsty for blood. On the streets of Century City you'll have to be careful because everything you meet will try to kill you and the mystical and corrupt charm of this game is enclosed in this fight for survival. Going down to the city the house elevator will drop you at a random point: you will have to survive and collect resources until you hear the classic old-fashioned elevator bell again. Opening the map you will find your extraction point highlighted in green but be careful, you will not be the only ones who want to leave the city. More elevators will arrive during the abundant 10 minutes that each game session lasts, missing it means dying and, like when another player kills you, losing all the resources you have on you. Levels, currencies, resources and refrigerators Leveling up and earning credit unlocks many customizations for your home in Hell is Others The management system of Hell is Others' many game indicators is slowly introduced in the first minutes of the game: it is complex but well explained and in a short time it already begins to become intuitive. In addition to the classic barof life (in red), there is one of stamina (green) and one of satiety (yellow). Additionally, Adam has a number of RPG-style stats that can be affected by consumables: these are smell, vision, vitality, movement speed, and stamina. With a fairly honest bonus and malus system, you can enhance your ability to sense nearby enemies at the cost of some running speed, or increase your resistance to damage by sacrificing your sense of smell. In the beginning the game encourages experimentation, but over time you can farm the consumables that best suit your exploration and fighting style by giving them blood. Hell is Others also has a system of levels and Credits, the former indicates your progress general, the according to your reputation in Century City. Both are earned by completing extractions in an elevator, and are lost by dying on the streets of the city. The credit system mainly serves to influence the merchant's evaluations of the objects you bring, but pay attention to his requests: depending on the day, he may need electronics or office tools. Each object has tags associated with it and it is essential to check which ones interest the merchant to decide what has value and what not. Finally, you can store some items in your chest of drawers at home but some, with the ~Perishable~ tag, will rot after overnight. To avoid this, just buy a refrigerator at the furniture store. Twin Stick Looter The first thing to do in Hell is others is to go to the park and collect some fresh bullets from the plants Under all the layers described above, at the foundation of Hell is Others, there is a twin stick shooter with loot mechanics. This means that, after getting used to the starting gun, you can start buying more powerful weapons to more easily eliminate your opponents and the evil creatures that populate Century City. The most effective way to pool the resources needed to buy better equipment is to complete the businessman missions that are assigned to Adam every day. You'll have to take sweets to a drunk, bullets to a gunsmith or beetles to a bug collector to unlock new weapons, new features (such as the bank account that allows you to deposit the collected money without losing it in case of death) and many other goodies. Talking to the infernal abyss in your wall, then, you can also accept missions to increase the space in your inventory. If the combat is slightly cumbersome, the same cannot be said of the exploration which, environment after environment, keeps players on the razor's edge. All sounds are displayed, so don't run and crouch if you suspect enemies are nearby. Get ready to die a lot in the first hours of the game because the level disparity with the other players is felt, especially at the beginning. Once the initial barrier has been overcome, however, Adam will make you experience a pleasantly disturbing story full of moments that seem to make no sense but which perfectly embody the bloody logic of Century City: nothing is done for nothing.", "date": "2022-10-30", "grade": "8.0"}
