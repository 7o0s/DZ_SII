The entire EA sports line has the now famous slogan mentioned in the title, but is it really like that? Well in my opinion this is just a clever marketing choice, since none of EA's titles are real simulators. On the other hand, the market choice of EA is correct given the excellent sales results, and is based on a small and friendly joke. In fact, if you label a title as a simulator, this makes the game more ~important~ and therefore acquires greater dignity. But obviously the title will not be a real simulator, since it would be too difficult for most buyers (simulation enthusiasts aside). On the other hand, Grand Prix Legend is there to teach us this important lesson, given that the Papyrus title is THE simulator par excellence, the one to which more web pages have been dedicated than any other competing product and also the longest-lived, but which in the pockets of its creators brought little money given the low sales profile. We welcome, therefore, titles that on paper are simulators, but which in the end are not, on the other hand the true enthusiast will be able to recognize it immediately. Come on Mike The EA title looks very good in the elegant package in which we find the manual, some coupons and obviously the only CD. The version, as per EA tradition, is entirely in Italian. As the title suggests, the game makes use of the full license from the FIA, and therefore we will find all the protagonists of the season without any exclusion. Or rather, the only ones excluded are the tobacco multinationals of which there is no trace in the liveries of the teams, but not bad for the most inveterate smokers, given that the modified liveries are already available on the net. The cars are very well made, with a wealth of details, even if I must point out the static nature of the suspension arms and the driver's arms which do not follow the evolution of the steering wheel. What, on the other hand, leaves me perplexed are the circuits. They're all there, even the one from Indianapolis, but they don't seem very faithful to me. For example, Monaco and Monza have parts that are not exactly correct, nothing traumatic, but for a simulation expert this could be a problem. The only lack in the regulations is the Peace Car and some flags, but otherwise everything is present and very convincing, like the manual limiter for entering the pits. The driving model The cream of a driving simulator is the driving model, and here we need to highlight lights and shadows. In general, the car behaves quite well, especially when cornering, where reactions are sincere and predictable. The same cannot be said for the braking which is excessively distributed on the front and which has too sensitive pedal control. In fact, even the cars driven by the CPU constantly arrive with locked wheels at the most decisive braking (and this unfortunately creates an unpleasant slowdown in the game caused by the clouds of smoke). It is easier to make a judgment on the damage pattern. Just ridiculous. Without a front wheel you normally turn at high speed and the loss of an aerodynamic appendage does not compromise the set-up that much. Furthermore, high speed impacts do not always produce breakage. Bah! The situation gets worse if we want to dedicate ourselves to the set-up of our car, given the total absence of telemetry. Incredible, since it would have taken only a little effort to implement it. And therefore almost all the numerous parameters must be set according only to personal sensitivity. Bad, very bad indeed. Another annoying shortcoming concerns the impossibility of modifying the suspension values together, and therefore we are forced to click numerous times before setting the chosen value on both sides. In any case, even when working on the settings, one realizes that the set-up does not change as one would have expected. Sir! Start your engine Now let's try to participate in a race and we realize that things are not going well, unfortunately, not even here. Meanwhile the frame-rate is very low, especially during the starts, then the AI is very poor, since accidents also occur during the sighting lap!!! Luckily they don't hit us at every corner!!! The graphics, in motion, are not as good as one would have expected to see, and some details are decidedly coarse. However during the race the communication that takes place between us and our team is one of the really good things about the game. The same cannot be said of the sound produced by the cars which borders on mediocrity. Force Feedback this unknown Another disheartening chapter concerns the Force-Feedback support. I own a Microsoftand the result turned out to be very bad, in practice only the curbs are felt. But the most shocking thing is that to have this poor effect the frame-rate drops outrageously and therefore I was forced to disable it. Too bad because the car doesn't have bad control, apart from the problem with the brake pedal, given that the accelerator pedal must be dosed in a very realistic way, on pain of the inevitable power oversteer. Conclusions The game is not a simulator, but a decent arcade. That's all. In any case, this is the best modern Formula 1 title available, but in this case it can't be a boast. Of course if some substantial patch came out (especially for the force feedback support), then the judgment could also change in some of its parts, but I no longer believe in miracles. However, the title has an interesting Multiplayer mode in which it is possible to compete with up to 21 players, but on which I cannot express an opinion. However there are too many flaws and bugs, but above all there is a humiliating comparison at EA's house between this game and SBK 2000 which annihilates F1 2000 in every respect. If it's in the game, it's in the game. Is this the Irvine wheel? This year will be remembered as the year of driving simulators, given that titles such as GP3 or Colin Mc Rae Rally 2 are planned, including the first Formula 1 driving simulator from EA, whose title F1 2000 introduces us to yet another saga of the American firm. However, according to the trade press, this title shouldn't look bad in the face of its worthy opponents, but we are by now adept at certain proclamations and proceed with this review with the same caution that St. Thomas would have shown. But before going into specifics, I would like to give a quick introduction to the world of driving simulators.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
