{"name": "Crash Car Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-car-mania.html", "text": "It must be admitted that the genre of ~acrobatic~ games is enjoying great success on mobile phones, after all these are titles that combine simplicity and spectacularity in an exciting mix. Crash Car Mania, developed by the mobile division of Electronic Arts, sees us in this case driving a vehicle launched at full speed on very high ramps, in search of the most sensational evolution. The game structure is the classic one for the genre, with the stages that are unlocked as the challenges are successfully completed, and can be replayed at will to reach the maximum score or simply to become familiar with the various maneuvers available . In this case, we will have to deal with a truly complex control system, which allows us to accelerate and brake, perform rapid sprints, jump, load the front or rear axle and then produce rotations of various kinds. To these basic actions we must add the possibility of using the jetpack, when available, as well as of launching the pilot of the vehicle himself over the windshield, so that at least he reaches the place designated for the final landing. More dead than alive, in all likelihood. The action always takes place in the same way, with a three-quarter view that takes our off-road vehicle from behind after having panned the track we will face. You have to accelerate and gain the greatest possible speed before any ramp, then load the rotation and finally shoot the pilot out, with some variations on the theme only when you need to make ~stationary~ jumps, in the presence of obstacles or whatever. The game provides us with numerous indications on what to do and how to do it, even if unfortunately this sort of ~tutorial~ function has been implemented as it could not be worse: the screens pause the race and require pressing the 5 key because the action resume, but it breaks the rhythm terribly and only confuses our ideas in the face of a truly exorbitant number of commands for mobile gaming in general. Keep in mind that you usually use the d-pad to move and the 5 key to perform the main action, with little variation. Well, in Crash Car Mania we will have to act on the 6 and 4 keys to accelerate and brake, repeatedly press the 6 key to gain speed, hold down and release the 8 key to jump, while the 7 and 9 keys are used to load the vehicle forward or backward near the ramps and finally the 5 key is used to activate the jetpack or to shoot the pilot. Which in turn can be controlled in its evolution by repeatedly pressing key 5 or directing its fall with keys 4 and 6. It would be difficult to imagine a more complicated and cumbersome approach. And think that the annoying ~advice~ are not limited to the first stages, but become a constant and very annoying. The game boasts moderate quality polygonal graphics, which however lack in terms of numbers: there is only one vehicle available, the background of the tracks is always the same and the tracks are too similar to each other. On the other hand, the frame rate remains quite fluid and the shot change intervenes in the right way, to underline certain spectacular moments. The explosion effects are mediocre, as is the car deformation system, which is rather approximate. Finally, the sound appears really essential, with a series of short and insignificant pieces of music.
