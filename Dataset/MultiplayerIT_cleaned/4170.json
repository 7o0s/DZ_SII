Put like this it seems like a really important world event, and of course it isn't, but let's think about it for a moment: ten years have passed since De Blob's first arrival on the Nintendo Wii, where he debuted to great interest from the public and critics. It wasn't the game of the year, but certainly a fun pastime between one Super Mario Galaxy and another; also linked to an important civil initiative, to make students and citizens of the city of Utrecht aware of the cleaning and restoration of the main underground station. The game was developed by Blue Tongue Entertainment more as an educational project than anything else; then THQ Nordic arrived, they understood that the idea would be successful, that that colored slime had its own charisma, and they created the video game. Ten years later, De Blob also lands on Nintendo Switch, costs a little more than it should and is a little less refined than we would have expected. Is it worth going back to coloring half the world? We're about to find out. Plot, colors and a bit of pain Chroma City is the home of color: its funny round creatures live happily wallowing here and there among the tempera paints, until the bad guy arrives. It's the INKT Corporation and, guess what, they steal all the color in the world, whiten all the characters, fill the surroundings with pools of black oil and set up a dictatorial regime. This thing just doesn't go well with the small resistance group, which led by the unlikely hero (De Blob, in fact) decides to save the day. We play Bob, a chubby slime with a really interesting power: he can absorb the color of enemies and reuse it to bring life back to the world. It's all so beautiful and colorful that we could actually be moved, but we won't. De Blob is a puzzle platform divided into various levels that follow the calm and peaceful game plot up to the final confrontation with the boss: each level is divided into various smaller areas connected to each other by some gates. To continue and pass from one area to another, and therefore from one level of play to another, the watchword is: colouring. Blob steals color from enemies, embellishes buildings, lampposts, benches and trees all very white, unlocks the door by accumulating the right amount of color points, and continues. An extremely linear and at times even a little soporific basic formula, but it works very well for a title that never really wants to offer an upward level of challenge, and which is clearly aimed primarily at a younger audience . To enrich the offer of contained levels, where everything is good or bad always within sight, there are secondary challenges, bonuses, little secrets and collectibles for a rich gallery of extra content. The game philosophy is fresh and immediate, today as it was ten years ago, and of course we have a full-fledged remaster in our hands, brought to high definition and revised in many of its aspects. Unfortunately, in addition to having found likeable characters capable of always eliciting a smile, the defects of the original version have also returned with them. Apparently ten years weren't enough to review a really annoying camera, controllable yes with the right analog but still inclined most of the time to act on its own; nor has anything been done for the slow and awkward movements of the Blob, which in many situations really seem trapped in a quagmire of color, and therefore unresponsive. Try to jump from one building to another without falling down into a black pool, and then we'll talk about it. Nintendo Switch effect: Team gameplay The magic formula of Nintendo Switch means that every title arriving on the small hybrid of the Kyoto House is perceived as ~more beautiful~: it is not yet understood why, the portability of the console probably plays a fundamental role. De Blob also becomes portable on Nintendo Switch, and its secondary game modes certainly represent a point in favor of the THQ re-release: once the main story is completed, which doesn't last too many hours anyway, there is always room for a few games at the flight, even in the company of friends. One of the game modes devoted entirely to multiplayer allows four local players to enter a game and challenge each other with ink strokes: whoever manages to color the most objects before time runs out wins. Hot summer evenings in the company of friends thus certainly become a little cooler, and De Blob is really played by everyone regardless of age and playing ability. The longevity of the title is also helped by the presence of many collectibles and extra modes that encourage you to replay the same level with more freedomty: maybe just to color it all at will, or to devote yourself to some secondary challenge that we were unable to complete on the first lap. A cornerstone of the entire production is the attention paid by the developers to the soundtrack: De Blob's now funky now rocking audio tracks accompany the progression in the levels in an extremely pleasant way, it is even possible to select them before starting a new game, for adapt them to our tastes or to the mood of the moment. The conversion work itself, unfortunately, leaves something to be desired: the high definition in TV Mode convinces up to a certain point, the facelift of the characters has only affected the main ones, the movies are considerably less well-finished than the game phases, and in portable mode De Blob's glance struggles even more. With a little more love in the restoration operation, the Blue Tongue Entertainment title would certainly have been more interesting: especially in a context in which the platformers competing for the square are few but very good.", "date": "2018-07-06", "grade": "6.5"}
