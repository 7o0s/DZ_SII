{"name": "NHL 2K7 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-2k7-recensione.html", "text": "Like in a movie Emphasized by a persistent icy mantle, the game's menus don't avoid leaving a rather annoying deja vu feeling, also due to the lack of intuitiveness of navigation, but a new choice is made to the player, and it turns out to be rather destabilizing. In practice, you have the right to opt for the classic mode or the one called Cinemotion, the latter presents itself as a completely new approach to the game, completely eliminating the commentary in favor of a filmic musical accompaniment, and a new dynamic visual in able to emphasize actions as much as possible. The options available are the classic ones we are used to: the possibility of playing a quick game, the career, a series of imaginative mini-games and the ever-present trophy room, a partially explorable 3D environment, provided among other things with a hilarious edition of the 'table hockey, a classic of the old arcades. There are many teams available, in addition to obviously the entire NHL championship, there are also some national teams, a not negligible addition for all those who are not interested in emulating the exploits of the Red Wings. After a short loading we are already skates on our feet, with tense nerves in front of the coach, ready to launch ourselves onto the rink. The nature of Cinemotion can already be understood from this intimate introduction. Under the lights of the stadium, accompanied by a dramatic string arrangement, the teams confront each other with menacing looks. Until the puck starts spinning, and the blades scratch the ice. The camera makes more daring moves and lingers in zooms near the opponent's goal, where the absence of the commentators leaves everything to the music, the defiant looks and the actions the task of living the match as if it were the last of the life. As far as we are concerned, we found this choice misleading, a bit forced, especially the sound arrangement which seems more suitable for a George Lucas film, where the absence of the commentary suggests rather a journalists' strike. Fortunately, the mode can be deactivated, restoring more familiar and appropriate situations. Face Off Technically, the commitment made by the Kush Games programmers, supported by Visual Concepts (historical managers of NBA 2k7, coming soon), is undeniable, but the priority in representing the action at 60fps has imposed some compromises. The engine is extremely smooth and fast, while managing the wear of the ice in a credible way. Under the lights of the stadium, accompanied by a dramatic string arrangement, the teams confront each other with menacing looks. Until the puck starts spinning, and the blades scratch the ice. Face Off However, it is in the detail of the players that the absence of details present in other productions can be found. The colors are also slightly bright and devoid of accentuated shades, resulting overall not very realistic. Furthermore, some animations are more neglected than others, too accelerated and lacking the necessary interrcalations to make them believable. The latter is a relatively perceptible detail in the frenzy of the plays, while we instead appreciated the physicality with which the whole game is permeated, starting from the traumatic clashes on the bulkheads on the edge of the field, characteristic of real sport. All in all, however, we do not feel like blaming the choices of the coders too much, since the speed that NHL 2K7 manages to reach is sensational and far from ancillary considering the discipline covered. I want to play for the Red Wings! As for the gameplay, Kush Games has opted for tradition, further refining the shooting system already seen in the last edition. Understandable decision since it is an episode focused on technical refinement, but making uncomfortable comparisons, the counterpart EA Sports has introduced a new system entirely managed by analog stick in its hockey saga, decidedly effective and innovative for the genre. In comparison, that of 2K Sports does not introduce anything really new in this sector, a detail that could make those looking for new forms of gameplay turn up their noses. On the side of the depth of play, on the complexity of the offensive orchestrations, NHL 2K7 has practically no rivals, thanks above all to a system refined edition after edition, up to levels of absolute excellence. There remains the considerable difficulty in beating the extreme defenders, always extremely efficient in neutralizing most of the attacking maneuvers. The result is a difficult gameplay and particularly recommended for fans of simulations. Excellent improvements can be found in the direction system used, decidedly close to that of a trtelevision admission, with breaks of all kinds in conjunction with face-offs or expulsions. Live support is very well implemented, with ranked matches and player for up to 4 users per console and automatic updating of squads. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg, as the main feature is represented by the possibility of playing tournaments and entire leagues online with players from all over the world. A really interesting possibility that considerably extends the longevity of the product. Comment NHL 2K7 is proposed as the true next-gen hockey, heralding a very fluid and fast engine, consistent aesthetic improvements and solid online support. However, its main contender for the title is its NHL 07 counterpart from EA Sports, which boasts a renewed control system and a truly impressive appearance. In comparison, the latest Kush Games effort seems more like an enhanced edition of what has already been seen on 128 bit, improved appreciably, but not shocking in visual terms. However, its main strength lies in a playability that has been tested for a long time and has now reached the state of grace, which will delight the purists of this sport. While the new Cinemotion feature proves to be a useless, if not downright inappropriate addition. In any case, those looking for a challenging simulation with unparalleled fluidity have found the perfect specimen. Pros Improved graphics since last year Very fluid Tournaments and leagues via Live Cons Tested but traditional controls Cinemotion is a questionable novelty Sometimes difficult NHL 2K7 is available for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360. The version tested is the version for Xbox 360. Goals 360 NHL 2k7 distributes 1000 points thanks to 17 goals. Obviously, therefore, that each of them is rather generous, in terms of score. Obtaining them, however, will require commitment, since these are achievements related to the higher difficulty levels of the game. Despite the many vicissitudes that the US league has had to face, hockey is still an extremely popular sport, and so are the video games dedicated to it. And 2k Sports has been able to carve out, over time, a prestigious position as a valid alternative to the EA Sports franchises. First of all thanks to the strong simulation component of its games, especially the NHL under review, much more severe than the competition. After a timid appearance for the launch of Xbox 360, episode 2k7 returns this year in an incarnation that is certainly more suitable for Microsoft hardware.", "date": "2006-10-30", "grade": null}
