Experience in the field of science fiction is not lacking therefore, let's find out if it was enough to create a good video game too! The inclusion of the rpg component The story of this Alien Syndrome is set about 100 years after the original title of the 80s, which saw us engaged with Ricky and Mary to save our companions imprisoned by aliens, through isometric 2D levels and very respectable final bosses. What was missing at the time, and was instead included in the Nintendo Wii version, is a certain dose of role-playing component. We could therefore speak of an action game in rpg sauce: it is possible to completely customize our character by unlocking and equipping armor, dozens of weapons and dozens of special items that will be useful to us within the levels. The story of this Alien Syndrome is set about 100 years after the original title of the 80s The inclusion of the rpg component Alien Syndrome develops on a track of 15 levels, each guarded by a final mini-boss, and 5 final guardians, of a completely different rank and respect. Throughout the story we are followed by a trusty drone which has the function, among other things, of storing our equipment and making us choose the objects before the start of the mission. In the future thousands of years away, humanity, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, pushes itself into the farthest corners of the galaxy. Explorers, armed with the ability to transform entire planets and make them habitable, prepare these frontiers for human colonization. It has been a long time since the last interstellar communication received from SAT5, a suburban station. The Commander of Earth Command has decided to send the interstellar starship USS Logos to investigate. We are part of the mission, with Lieutenant Aileen Harding, a charming twenty-one year old with an athletic and lean physique, Tom Tobin, an expert atmospheric engineer, Captain Jones and Commander Iris Hayes. Starting the game you can create a new character, assigning him skills as you would in a classic RPG. There are four basic characteristics, Strength, Dexterity, Accuracy and Endurance: based on the skills chosen, points are given to add. These skills vary based on the military training we choose for our faithful soldier; the Demolitions Expert qualification makes him particularly good at using grenades and explosives, or he could be an Arsonist, an expert in all firearms, a Seal, or a veteran in military survival, a sharpshooter or a tough guy in body. In the distant future thousands of years, humanity, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, pushes itself into the farthest corners of the galaxy The latter are performed through the use of the remote controller: pushing it forward performs a lunge attack, while making it rotate 360 degrees the character from a stunning blow. Suddenly lowering the remote, on the other hand, serves to hammer the ground causing the knocking down of all enemies in the vicinity. The feeling with the controls is not bad, if it weren't for the extreme repetitiveness of the game action that undermines any assumption of long-term fun. The game pushes forward slow and tired, the opposite of what an action game should offer. The feeling of deja vu is there, the game mechanics have remained very similar to the original prequel of twenty years ago; for many it might seem like good news, but in reality nowadays the genre of science fiction has evolved to such an extent that it also seeks a certain depth, which is not there here. The port of the sequel, which is also a remake at heart The controls, as Nintendo Wii is gradually getting used to us, are simple and intuitive, also because in fact there are very few moves that can be performed. This is the biggest novelty of the new Alien Syndrome, a game transposed by weight from PSP, Sony's portable. The other elements have remained almost unchanged, unfortunately including the graphics sector. Artistically Alien Syndrome is very colorful, 80s, with daring combinations of green, purple, red and electric blue tones. Globally too dull and badly cared for on the purely technical side: the characters are composed of a limited numberoodles of polygons, and the enemy models are really simple and basic, as are the textures, faded and not very varied, even worthy of two generations ago. Alien Syndrome is very colorful, 80s, with daring combinations of green, purple, red and electric blue shades An extreme color palette The gameplay of Alien Syndrome is, as well as repetitive and very little varied, also decidedly simple. For almost all of the game it is a question of moving from point A to point B, flicking the remote left and right to get rid of the obstacles placed in our path. In some cases, once faced with an alien horde, simply by running in one direction, the enemies disappear behind us and we can advance freely without facing them. The artistic variety of enemies, aided by the ~extreme~ color palette, is quite varied. Too bad the AI is not very refined and the behavior of our opponents in battle always ends up being very stupid and monotonous, therefore predictable. For this, and for the many reasons listed above, this new Alien Syndrome fails in its main objective which was to revive the glories of the successful coin-op that was the original, not a masterpiece, but still a game that left the sign. Which this remake-sequel absolutely does not do. Comment Alien Syndrome is a nice return for all old-time SEGA fans, a pity that the overall quality is decidedly mediocre. Some touches are nice, such as the addition of an rpg component that gives a slight depth for such a title, and also the 4-player multiplayer possible throughout the story. Unfortunately this title suffers from some problems, first of all the extreme graphic poverty deriving from the fact of being a PSP port. Furthermore, the gameplay itself is very repetitive and not very varied, managing to get boring after a short time at the expense of the 20 hours of duration that Alien Syndrome offers. The excessive selling price, that of a full-price title, seems decidedly too high for such a video game. Pros: The return of an old classic Multiplayer in 4 players Cons: Graphically one of the worst Wii titles Basic and monotonous gameplay High price Alien Syndrome is available for PSP and Nintendo Wii. The tested version is the one for Nintendo Wii. Like many other games of this genre, the SEGA title also has a multiplayer option for up to 4 players, certainly appreciable but terribly unattractive from a playful point of view. The flatness in the gameplay does not spare any game mode. There would be a lot to learn from new titles such as Armed Assault on the Xbox Marketplace but also from old games such as Expendable which appeared centuries ago on the Dreamcast. The mini-games inserted do not save the situation: like any good self-respecting Wii title, some pastimes that exploit the very special controls of the Nintendo console could not be missing. The music is definitely on topic but uninspired and anonymous, as are the sound effects and voices heard in-game. After the return of his glorious Rally, a golden moment seems to have started again for the great SEGA classics. It is therefore the turn of an old arcade acquaintance released way back in 1987, a sci-fi shooter that helped create an entire genre that ranges from Alien Breed to Robotron, up to Smash TV: we are talking about Alien Syndrome, published practically on all the most important platforms of the time such as NES, Master System, Amiga, Commodore64, Spectrum, Famicom and even a portable version for Game Gear.", "date": "2007-10-05", "grade": null}
