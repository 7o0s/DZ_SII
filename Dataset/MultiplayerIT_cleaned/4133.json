Thanks to the work of an entirely local development team full of passion and commitment: Chris Darrill and Stormind Games have not given up, despite the troubled gestation of a project that has its roots in the first decade of the 2000s, and they are getting the first well-deserved awards for the opening chapter of an ideal trilogy, based on past classics such as Clock Tower and Hunting Ground. Immersed in a nightmarish atmosphere, where the tension is palpable and the quotations constant, we spent several hours of gameplay in Rosemary's company, and we are ready to tell you about the console conversion of the claustrophobic title. Claustrophobic gameplay: hideouts and chasers We have already had the opportunity to tell you in detail the salient points of the plot of Remothered: Tormented Fathers on the occasion of the review of the PC version, so we will limit ourselves to a few hints, with the aim of introducing you to the particular atmospheres of this valid survival horror without spoilers. The title of Chris Darrill comes from love and admiration for a specific film genre: that of Lynch, Hitchcock and especially the filmography of Polanski (Rosemary's Baby). It is no coincidence that the protagonist is called Rosemary, as well as recalling Jodie Foster from The Silence of the Lambs in her features. Rosemary is investigating the case of a missing child, Celeste, and her research leads her to the Victorian mansion of her father, the notary Felton, where the old man lives in the company of his wife and maid Gloria. Things are not going particularly well for the Feltons: the landlord is ill, the house is opulent but in evident decay, and nobody wants to hear more about Celeste in there. Rosemary decides to hide inside the house despite being invited unkindly to leave, and after dark the nightmare begins. Mr. Felton is a psychopathic madman and from then on he will welcome Rosemary with blows of a sickle: to complete her investigations the woman will have to exploit the hiding places offered by the Victorian furnishings of the house, the useful tools scattered around on furniture and desks, and collect the Feltons' private papers. Remothered: Tormented Fathers is a survival horror that is not impossible to complete, but decidedly more difficult than most of the products of the same genre published in recent years: the clash with the pursuers (or stalkers) must be carefully avoided, because they are faster, more resistant and lethal of the protagonist. It is difficult to survive from a hug from Mr. Felton, and the few hopes of salvation provided by the developers reside in the diversions: small consumable objects present in abundance within the settings, which we can throw at the aggressor to gain precious seconds or place in points strategic to attract him while we take another road. The villa is in fact quite large and its rooms quickly become a real labyrinth, especially considering doors and areas that are initially inaccessible or that require the procurement of particular tools. If the pursuer manages to grab Rosemary, it is possible to try to escape in extremis by inflicting damage on him with knives and sharp objects, but it is an action that is difficult to repeat and in any case the stalkers can never be killed: a detail that contributes to generating an perpetually tense and anxious. Playstation 4 trophies Despite the goodness of the production, the more than discreet longevity, and the considerable level of challenge, Remothered: Tormented Fathers presents just ten Trophies on PlayStation 4. These are two Gold Trophies, a Silver Trophy and seven Ready Trophies , without any Platinum Trophies; to unlock them all you will have to complete the adventure, taking about seven hours of time without a guide. All trophies are tied to completing the main story, save one that requires you to find all collectibles. The port of Remothered to PlayStation 4 At the time, the writer had the opportunity to face the 5-7 hours required for the completion of Remothered: Tormented Fathers on PC: short but intense, and above all with a decidedly solid gameplay, the title proved to be perfectly enjoyable also on PlayStation 4. It should be noted that the game sessions took place on PlayStation 4 Pro, but we are practically certain that the performance remains on almost identical levels on the smooth version of the Sony flagship. The controls have been intelligently adapted to the DualShock 4: with the pressure of the stick analog Rosemary can crouch down and turn on her torch, while the back keys are used to aim and throw the diversions-objects, finally the R1 command allows you to run, even if it is good not to overdo it both to not wear out the protagonist (whose level of health and physical condition is indicated by his attitude: there is no green bar) and to avoid noises capable of attracting pursuers. Vibration functionality aside, it is certainly not pleasing that nothing of the small defects of the PC production has been revised: the interior lighting is not always credible, and in the transition films, small smudges and excess use of the effect blurred make the interludes unpleasant and the faces of the characters excessively plasticky. Not to mention that it would have definitely made sense to increase the font size of the subtitles, or to avoid making them white on an equally white background: a solution that in many cases makes reading difficult, if not impossible. Then passing over the fact that a title produced in Italy would have been really pleasant to listen to in the Italian dubbing, even if not necessarily in an excellent one.", "date": "2018-07-23", "grade": "8.5"}
