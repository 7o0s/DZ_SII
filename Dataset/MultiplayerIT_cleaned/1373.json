Through it, in fact, we will be able to create new paths or modify the pre-existing ones. The tools to be used seem quite complicated in principle, especially for the less experienced map editors, but they turn out to be simple and linear after a few tens of minutes of practice. With just a few taps you can change the altitude of the terrain, paint it and place all the details you want. As in a real diorama, it can take hours or days to get the desired result, it just depends on patience, imagination and the goal you have in mind. The possibilities are therefore truly unlimited. Once we have finished our layout and the environment that surrounds it (it is still possible to select one that is already ready) we just have to try it for ourselves by getting on the locomotive. This is the big difference between a layout and TRS2004: the possibility of driving your own trains in the first person. By selecting the Driver option we will thus be catapulted into the cab of the engine with the task of driving the convoy and taking it to its destination. The view is in first person and adjustable, in order to better observe both the cabin and the panorama; however, if desired, it is also possible to follow the train from the outside and lead it using the keyboard commands. Becoming a train driver is not an immediate operation, and the section of the manual dedicated to it (which bears the disturbing name of the Engineer's Guide) is not of much help. Fortunately, most of the information reported is present only for completeness, and does not particularly affect the game, which for electric or diesel locomotives is reduced to accelerating, braking and changing wagons. On the other hand, the management of the steam counterparts is more complex, which need almost continuous monitoring of the various indicators of heat, pressure and torque distribution. Last note goes to the scenarios, which have been added since the first Trainz to help novice players and give them something to challenge themselves with. The only variation compared to normal maps is the presence of some tasks to complete. It's nothing in particular, and almost always comes down to a simple ~bring the required amount of material to the factories~ through some intermediate steps and with the occasional hiccup. Updates The upgrade system of the game deserves to be mentioned separately. TRS2004 wants to reproduce the charm of model railways, and the manufacturer, the Australian Auran, behaves exactly like the manufacturers of toy trains: it is constantly churning out new and expensive pieces. In the game there are over one hundred locomotives and wagons, and numerous buildings, but, as all model enthusiasts know, there is never the limit to the best. So right in the main menu of the game there is an option that allows you to connect to the Auran site and download, for a fee, all the new models you want. In a world of gamers accustomed to downloading patches for free and spending only on truly significant upgrades, bordering on expansion, we don't know how much this idea can work, also taking into account the large number of unofficial sites that offered a similar service. all free. Final comment First of all it is good to remember, as already done for Flight Simulator, that Trainz 2004 is and remains a simulation, no more, no less. It is not a mission game - the same scenarios present are few and serve only to fill a lack of its predecessor - but an empty and unlimited virtual plane on which to indulge oneself and recreate the routes and models which, for reasons of space and / or money, have always remained an unfulfilled dream. That said, there isn't much else to add: although it belongs to an extremely particular genre, Trainz 2004 does its duty very well. So, if you skipped school as a kid to go see trains in stations, or spent hours building huge dioramas for your little locomotives to run on, then Trainz Railroad Simulation 2004 is for you. Otherwise, if you like trains but want a video game in the traditional sense, you better turn your attention to something different like Railroad Tycoon. Pros: Virtually unlimited Virtually perfect simulation Continuous upgrades through the various dedicated sites Cons: Official upgrades are paid Manualdispersive Trains and models in 1 to 1 scale Remember those wonderful plastic models that could be found in the biggest toy stores? The grass, the mountains, the bridges, the tunnels, not to mention the trains: they were so full of detail that they seemed real. This is exactly what Trainz Railroad Simulation 2004 offers: the possibility of creating your own track, or rather a real mini-world, starting from scratch. The game itself is divided into four sections: Controller, Driver, Scenarios and Railway Depot. The Railway Depot is a paradise for all train and toy train lovers, it is like entering a shop and having all the models neatly displayed in the window, with the possibility of rotating them and admiring them in every detail. From this privileged position it will be possible to plan the convoys that we will create later.", "date": "2004-03-10", "grade": null}
