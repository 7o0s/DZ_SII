Even with mixed results, the publisher's titles always demonstrate particular care in the production of mobile games, capable of placing themselves on the same level as console games, at least from the point of view of concept and technical implementation. After Lost Within, Til Morning's Light is another demonstration of this commitment, a well-constructed and packaged game to excite any user with a spot-on atmosphere, great graphics and a control system that integrates perfectly with the use of the touch screen. What is particularly striking is the spirit of a light-hearted children's horror comedy that pervades the story and general characterization, a sort of cross between an 80s teen-movie and Scooby-Doo, which in videogame terms refers to various light-hearted productions of the 16- bit like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or in some ways the more recent Luigi's Mansion, making due proportions with the size of the latter in terms of gameplay. Perhaps this is the greatest value of Til Morning's Light, well supported by an intuitive and reactive control system and by a graphic system that makes the simple exploration of the scenario already a pleasant experience. Too bad that there is a lack of meat in such a well served and surrounded product, because the puzzles are not many and the combat system is not very stimulating. The premise immediately puts us in the atmosphere of a cartoon horror: Erica is a shy and awkward girl, who is forced by her classic ~mean girl~ friends, popular and decidedly perfidious, to explore an old and dilapidated Victorian-style mansion for a whole night. The house is only apparently uninhabited, however, as Erica will discover after a few minutes of stay. Ghosts and dark creatures are hidden within the creepy walls, born from the curse that hangs over the mansion and that will also affect Erica if she fails to escape from the house by dawn. Til Morning's Light is an old-time comic-horror experience with a new control system The ghost house We are facing a third-person action adventure, based above all on the exploration of the environments and the interaction with various objects, from which puzzles arise to be solved with the use of the inventory or through mini-games of some kind. All of this is interspersed with fights with ectoplasmic creatures of various types that infest the rooms and corridors of the house, complete with bosses and special encounters. The combat system is perhaps the weakest element of the package, even if it is certainly functional to the use of the touch screen. It is a question of touching the screen in certain precise points with the greatest possible timing to inflict damage on the opponent, or by performing the sequences of movements suggested in a sort of rhythm game mechanics. Ultimately, the clashes turn out to be almost annoying interludes within the exploration and solution of the puzzles, some of which are of excellent workmanship and it is a problem of no small importance, considering the frequency with which you find yourself fighting . The lack of challenge is a rather constant element in the game, except in rare cases, both in terms of combat and puzzles, where Til Morning's Light cannot (and does not want to) compete with other more orthodox exponents of the adventure sector present in mobile. However, its linearity and general simplicity also favors the pleasure of exploration, making the forced stay within the walls of the haunted house a light and stimulating journey to discover the various rooms and the strange inhabitants who find themselves inside. The setting is the real protagonist of the game, well supported by the excellent and particular characterization of the various NPCs with which we find ourselves interacting, which make the encounters and dialogues, although standardized on the horror cartoon genre for young people, always fresh and interesting , also thanks to the excellent dubbing in English (the texts are instead all localized in Italian).", "date": "2015-06-03", "grade": "7.8"}
