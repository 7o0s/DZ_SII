So here is debut on the App Store and Google Play, in the now traditional freemium format, Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 Mobile. A title strongly characterized by the introduction of an unprecedented control system, which effectively exploits gestures to allow the execution of the various movements in the most immediate and precise way possible. A brief tutorial illustrates the new mechanics in just a few minutes: except for the presence of a virtual, repositionable and invisible analog stick on the left side of the screen, a series of gestures must be made on the right side of the display to carry out passes, shots and anything else. In this case, when we are in the defensive phase we can hold down the right side of the screen for the player closest to the ball to approach the opponent to steal it, possibly with a slide, while in the offensive phase we can literally draw the passes on the touch screen (holding pressed for them to become through balls), make spectacular crosses (with a ~rebound~ gesture), activate the shot (by simply holding down that area of the screen while we move) and finally conclude with a low shot (two quick taps) or a calibrated shot (second touch held). Easier said than done: within a couple of games you will be perfectly familiar with the new control system, but if you don't really like it, you will always have the possibility to go back to the classic controls with large separate icons. Good premise, yet... The Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 Mobile system works very well, the sensation is effectively that of being faced with a ~regular~ episode of the Konami series and the new control system is immediate, effective and fairly precise, however the developers are not managed to create a suitable side dish for these interesting novelties. In the first place, the traditional modes are completely missing: the game is structured as a pure freemium, with a campaign more in the style of FIFA Ultimate Team than Master League, in which you have to face sequences of ten matches against teams managed by other users, in the 'scope of an asynchronous multiplayer, starting from a training made up of discrete crooks and obtaining quality players through the use of virtual or precious currency. In short, it is not possible to control real teams within real competitions, and this turns out to be a sensational own goal; also and above all because the impossibility of regulating the degree of initial difficulty will make the first impact with the experience absurdly boring, with sensational 15-0 wins to give to teammates who not only will never be able to take the ball away from us, but who will practically concede goals from every position, showing off the slowest goalkeepers in history. It is possible to try a simulation mode in which we will do nothing but make technical decisions, changing module and training if necessary but passively assisting the matches: an interesting option for those looking for a manager, but without the amount of adjustments that usually characterizes the genus. Then there are the challenges, with events consisting of two or more matches in sequence, and online multiplayer matches. Only the latter immediately guarantee a minimum of challenge and therefore go to exploit the qualities of the game in a dignified way, which from a technical point of view offers fluid, detailed and convincing graphics thanks to the use of the Havok engine, as well as a pleasant column signed soundtrack and the possibility of downloading the commentary in Italian for free with commentary by Fabio Carezza and Luca Marchegiani: the first good as usual, the second still not at ease in the role. Waiting for an update that can substantially enrich the experience and allow for a less boring start due to the very low difficulty, one could think of Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 Mobile as an excellent football for online challenges, but the bitterness remains in mouth for the structural paucity of the product and for a very slow recharge of the energy of the action, which however fortunately does not concern multiplayer.", "date": "2017-05-29", "grade": "7.0"}
