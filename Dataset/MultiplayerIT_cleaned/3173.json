Such optimism certainly cannot be shared for many other development teams, we assure you, yet here it is a particular case, as the Arc have honed their art to such levels in the genre as to be recognized almost unanimously among the best teams ever when it comes to virtual beatings. Of course, the certainty of having a finished title on your hands is not the same as having to do with a masterpiece, and Arc System Works themselves do not have infinite resources at their disposal, so much so that they are working on multiple projects with teams of the size different. Although financed and supported by an entertainment giant like Cygames, therefore, there was no certainty of seeing the protagonist of today's review alongside the kings of combat. To understand the truth, we analyzed the game in detail, trying to understand exactly what the software house's plan was when it created it and its distinctive features. And don't be misled by an apparently rather derivative gameplay: this is a significantly more unique fighting game than we would have expected, which undoubtedly deserves a nice sunny corner to stay in the landscape. Gacha fighting game? Not exactly Let's start from the basics: for the uninitiated, the original Granblue Fantasy is a Gacha Game, a sort of mobile RPG structured around the random drop of heroes and equipment, which boasts an inordinate number of available characters and is practically a custom phenomenon in Asia. In the West, the brand is significantly less known (although it boasts a good niche of enthusiasts), and it is plausibly also for this reason that Arc System Works did not rush particularly with regard to the European release. Whatever the launch strategy was, however, it matters little to us; it is only the belonging to this universe that is important, since it offers a potentially infinite roster of fighters and a narrative background consolidated enough to allow the single-player elements of its possible spin-offs to be worked with more care than usual. With these bases one could have expected a titanic work by the developers, but unfortunately it seems to have not been possible: as mentioned in the intro of the article, even with the support of Cygames, the Yokohama house did not have infinite resources at its disposal , and therefore has tried to stick to the original material as much as possible, setting up a rather atypical main campaign and focusing on the quality of the warriors rather than the quantity. The title, in fact, boasts an RPG Mode that sees the player grappling with an adventure directly linked to characters and events in the world of Granblue, structured around missions scattered across multiple islands and which can even be tackled in online cooperative mode (or with companions controlled by the 'artificial intelligence). In practice, it is a mode that is closer to a scrolling fighting game than to a classic single-fight campaign typical of the genre, where completing the various tasks offered allows you to randomly obtain weapons of varying rarity, exchange items and characters (although these are predefined according to the chapters and not at random). It's a rather brilliant idea, we don't deny it, capable of tying back to the mobile game and implemented with considerable care, so as to contain numerous non-player characters, bosses, extra support skills, and even an elemental weakness system. There's just one small problem... if the boss battles are undoubtedly enjoyable and interesting, the same cannot be said for the remaining 90% of the missions, which force you to face a shapeless mass of mindless henchmen equipped with negligible. Adjusting the variety of encounters and difficulty a bit would have been enough to make things more tantalizing, but apparently the Japanese team is as good at creating combat systems as they are poor when it comes to trying their hand at the balanced design of something different. A waste of the serious ones, because with a little more cunning the RPG mode could have been a fantastic pastime for those who don't care much about competitive online. Gameplay: beating and bishounen for everyone If nothing else, there is one element in which the Arcs practically never disappoint: the combat system, and this despite the fact that Granblue Fantasy Versus does not follow the trend of ~anime fighters~ in which the studio is specialized in some respects, but joins to the philosopher lineca of Dragon Ball FighterZ, or that of reworking pre-existing and particularly well-known combat systems in order to renew them and give the whole the typical imprint of the team. In the case of the game we are talking about, the inspiration clearly comes from some classics of SNK and from the latest Street Fighter, since Versus is a title with not excessive speed, strongly focused on the management of distances and footsies (to put it simply, the control of space through the various moves), which does not require high execution skills to be mastered. However, it is precisely this last aspect that has been increased beyond belief, because Granblue Fantasy Versus is an extraordinarily accessible video game even for newbies to fighting games, thanks to a series of mechanics that greatly simplify the approach to the system. First of all, the combos: in Granblue Fantasy performing complex series of blows is extraordinarily simple, since pressing the same attack key several times guarantees a series from short distance. In practice, each normal combination is an autocombo that takes into account only the starting position of the first attack in order to continue or not, and binding the special moves is a very simple operation for anyone with a minimum of practice. For all the others, however, there is another gem capable of further facilitating things, or a ~shortcut key~ which cancels the need to execute complex commands to start a special. For heaven's sake, in the game the special moves can be performed the old-fashioned way, with quarter moons, dragon punches and charges, but press the dedicated key with one of the rudders (and the desired attack button, in case you want to vary the intensity ) performs the same moves instantly, without the need for particular coordination. In short, fantastic for many players who are not used to using the directional cross, even if there is a penalty: all moves have a variable recharge time once used, and performing blows of various strengths in an easier way leads to the recovery being extended by a few precious seconds. It may seem trivial, yet this particular functioning of the special makes it very important at high levels to make a minimum of economy of resources in the game, and also pushes beginners to gradually learn to use everything in a classic way. Adding to this beautiful cake a respectable tutorial, with rather detailed explanations of the basics, tests to study the various characters, training to respond to the most infamous attacks, and a rather complete glossary, you get one of the best introductory video games to the genre are ever seen. Hats off. Infinite beauty, roster not really Let me be clear, this simplification of the systems does not automatically make Granblue Versus a title for pad blowjobs. There is still Arc at the reins, and this guarantees a considerable stratification of the combat system. Therefore, if the combinations are quite basic and the mastery of the system does not require years of practice, the same cannot be said of the management of the basic maneuvers, given that the characters are all quite safe when they move offensively, there are dodges beyond King of Fighters to stem the warriors too fond of bullets, and each fighter is equipped with a unique ability together with his special moves, which often profoundly change the approach to battle (similar to the last street fighter's v-skill or what seen in the Blazblues). In addition, the guard can be used with a dedicated key (which automatically cancels any mixup) or alternatively by holding down ~back~ as usual, but if you choose to parry normally with the right timing it is possible to limit the damage on guard, and it's a fundamental thing in a title where this damage can kill. Just think, even shortcuts have a usefulness with certain characters, as they allow you to instantly execute certain blows that would commonly require some execution time to start (such as Charlotta's charge attacks). Overall, we like it a lot as a system: we won't be faced with the complexity of a Third Strike or the fabulous offensive possibilities of a Guilty Gear, but we believe that Granblue will be a boon for all those who normally curse by making a mistake in combo after combo, or simply for those experts who have always cared more about the fundamentals than about the spectacularity of the moves. For heaven's sake... not that the game crashes badly in terms of visual impact: if it comes to cel shading, Arc System has clearly made a pact with the devil, and Versus often surpasses both Revelator and FighterZ in terms of beauty, thanks to its colorscolors and the exceptional quality of the models (again, we're talking about a 3D game that looks like a high-end anime in motion). The supers in battle are particularly exceptional, not to mention a general directorial improvement by the team, which seems to be mastering the Unreal Engine even better during the campaign cutscenes. On the other hand, the online sector is less striking, because Granblue Fantasy Versus unfortunately once again uses the delay-based netcode of all the latest Arc System games (and many fighting games made in Japan). Without wanting to go into too much technical detail, it is a technology that has largely been outdated by the developers who have now thoroughly studied the netcode rollback (much more stable and faithful when there are no connectivity problems, just look at Mortal Kombat 11) and limits partly the enjoyment of competition on the net. The software house has promised that the next Guilty Gear Strive will use rollback, however for now in Versus you have to stick with the old system, and we do not doubt that various users will have some unpleasant problems. our test for obvious reasons we didn't meet many European users, but the matches were mostly stable, and everything is balanced with a worthy ranking system; just a shame that netcode rollback hasn't been embraced sooner, with superior results. In any case, since we are discussing not very pleasant things, we might as well close with the last questionable aspect of the production, or the roster. As mentioned, Versus focuses more on quality than quantity, a pity that the quantity is really negligible, because we are talking about only 12 fighters at launch, plus four DLC fighters arriving with the first season of extra characters. That's very few for a brand new fighting game, and while it makes sense philosophically for a gacha-inspired game to speculate a little more characters, it would have been more honest in our opinion to release it all with the whole ~season 1~ already available, rather than with such a small warrior park. Well, at least Beelzebub can currently be unlocked by completing the RPG mode (it is unlocked immediately with the purchased season, but it is not mandatory), and it is worth reiterating that all the choices are very unique and well-finished, as well as more balanced than we would have expected.", "date": "2020-03-25", "grade": "8.2"}
