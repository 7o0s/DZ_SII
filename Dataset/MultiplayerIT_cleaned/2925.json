Like a cute little mushroom that popped up after a rainy night, Hello Games' little adventure showed up quietly, aiming to attract attention above all for its intrinsic qualities. The low profile is at this point an understandable choice on the part of the developers, after the storm of controversy derived from the launch of No Man's Sky due to the discrepancy between the promises and the initial state of the game. After the long odyssey of space simulation, which only with commendable willpower and dedication finally turned into a long and exciting journey to triumph, the development team has conveniently decided to bring out the new and small project silently on Apple Arcade, PC and console, letting its understated charm show it off. The Last Campfire represents a decisive change of atmosphere and style compared to the famous No Man's Sky, but it is also a return to the origins for some developers of the project: in fact, there are also the creators of Lostwinds, a small metroidvania-style adventure series that remains probably among the best games ever seen on the old WiiWare and this new title has a lot in common with those ethereal atmospheres and that atmosphere halfway between a graceful fairy tale and an epic adventure. To tell the truth, The Last Campfire digs deeper, staging a story that expertly mixes tender tones with dark and impactful elements. The journey of Ember, the little creature lost in a dimension similar to limbo, speaks above all of loss, mystery and fear in the face of the end of life and possible oblivion, but also contrasts hope, the warmth of contact between individuals and the solidarity that can illuminate even the most frightening darkness. After losing her way due to a trivial distraction, Ember finds herself wandering a strange world populated by bizarre figures, trying to recover the lost souls of various ~strangers~ lost in the depths of the mysterious dimension and guarding against various threats, the all to the sound of puzzles to solve. The narration remains hermetic, entrusted above all to the splendid narrative voice that accompanies the various moments of the adventure, also narrating the dialogues with the various characters, but manages to give a remarkable compactness to the whole gaming experience, which is perfectly constructed as a interactive fairy tale composed of concatenated puzzles. A puzzle made of many puzzles The Last Campfire is all about puzzles: there are puzzles to be solved to reach various areas of the map, which in turn opens the door to further puzzles related to retrieving souls or interacting with various characters. Basically, the entire game world is a sort of big puzzle made up of various puzzles, therefore the exercise of gray matter is required both for the simple exploration of the environments and for the more closed and detached challenges, linked to the recovery of the individual souls. The mechanics of the puzzles is based on the movement and interlocking of various objects, the activation of switches until the opening of the road that leads to the spirit to be freed, in a series of solutions that are not exactly original but juxtaposed in an intelligent and always enjoyable way . The interaction is based on the movement and direct action of Ember on the elements of the scenario or on the use of a particular magical horn capable of moving metal objects at a distance, with the combination of these possibilities which determines a certain variety of situations, even if these still tend to repeat themselves somewhat. While within the map the puzzles are integrated with the elements of the scenario and with the need to overcome obstacles and open new passages, the puzzles that are triggered for the recovery of the souls are presented within separate, more complex and detached levels from the context. The level of challenge is always quite accessible, perhaps even too much for puzzle enthusiasts: there is always a certain satisfaction in the logical solution of the puzzles but it is difficult to face problems that require great cognitive efforts, except for some of the latest puzzles in which the level of difficulty rises significantly. In any case, the construction is always very brilliant and, also thanks to the limited duration of the game, it stimulates you to go on until the end. Longevity can actually be considered as a weak point of The Last Campfire, settling between 5 and 8 hours at most, but it is in line with the size of the production and well calibrated to make the eexperience as compact and dense as possible. The aesthetics are very accurate, with the relative simplicity of the graphic scaffolding which is functional in bringing out the excellent dreamy style of an illustrated fairy tale, also supported by an atmospheric musical accompaniment and by the aforementioned narrative voice which envelops everything in a sort of continuous and fascinating story, with spoken in English and texts well translated into Italian. Tested through Apple Arcade on iPad and Mac, the game performs very well both using the point-and-click style interface (for which there is also an excellent pathfinding system) and the controller, making perhaps the first option preferable, at least in this particular context. Unfortunately, we have also detected the presence of a potentially destructive bug for the gaming experience, which has prevented us from continuing without resorting to a new save: we have not encountered many other cases of this type but Hello Games should proceed with a general review to check for similar problems, which can easily be fixed with patches.", "date": "2020-09-02", "grade": "8.2"}
