As we will see in the course of the review, the feat was only half successful, not so much for major flaws in the construction, as for the difficulty of bringing together two visions of the video game that are so different from each other. Yet the curiosity to try it was great precisely to understand what the developers had invented to overcome this immense obstacle. Gameplay Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle is a full-fledged Pac-Man. The player then finds himself having to empty labyrinths full of pills, without getting caught by ghosts, on pain of losing a life. The novelties in this case all concern the competitive dimension of the gameplay: our game map is not suspended in a vacuum, but is part of an immense network formed by the labyrinths of all the players. In addition to collecting pills and energy pills, and eating ghosts and fruit, here you can also invade your neighbors by taking control of their labyrinths. To do this, you have to wait for the opening of some passages located on the perimeter of the map, which remain free for a few seconds. The objectives to be achieved vary depending on the selected mode, but basically you must always try to stay alive as much as possible, avoiding being eaten by ghosts or by players under the effects of energy pills. Lost three lives, he is out. To help us, or even to hinder us (depending on the effects and who assumes them), we think of the bonuses that are injected from time to time into the labyrinths. For example, they can increase our movement speed, or that of ghosts; they can stun ghosts and opposing Pac-Mans; they can create an aura of ghost-repellent stench around our character; or make the ghosts fall in love with our avatar, who will start chasing him to the end of the world (handy if you want to eat them all with a single energy pill to raise your score). As we will explain, depending on the circumstances, bonuses can be more or less useful, if not actually harmful. Game mode There are two game modes, both for up to 64 players: Time Trials and Elimination. The first is the more relaxed one, in which you play to overcome a series of challenges of increasing difficulty that are proposed from game to game, such as reaching a certain score, eating a certain number of ghosts, invading a certain number of other players' mazes and still others. Time Trials have no fixed limit, meaning they only end when you run out of lives. They can therefore continue for hours, depending on the skill demonstrated by the player. The Elimination mode, on the other hand, is the real battle royale, where players challenge each other to the last survivor, hindering each other in the ways provided by the game. Although they take place in the same labyrinths, the two modalities are very different from each other and require a completely specific mental approach: if in the first one everything that is done is a function of the objectives to be achieved, in the second one hindering the others assumes capital importance if you want to get to the top positions. Thus bonuses, extras and energy pills undergo a sort of semantic shift from one modality to another, assuming different functions, while remaining identical in their effects. If desired, the Spectator Mode would also have to be added to the pile, in which to watch the games of others and vote for the bonuses to be brought into the game. Interesting to try once or twice, then honestly you almost forget it exists, except when you get busted towards the end of a match and want to watch to find out how it plays out. Problems The problem with Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle is that the interaction between the players doesn't work much, in the sense that you always have a strong impression of detachment, as if you were playing in single player even if you are online. Much probably depends on the nature of the gameplay, i.e. emptying labyrinths full of balls is difficult to reconcile with the concept of a contemporary challenge between multiple players, to the point that often to win, or to get to the top positions, you just need to disregard the mechanics designed to enter contact with others, playing better in their own labyrinth. In the Time Trial mode this feeling is even greater, so much so that it seems to be playing a Pac-Man with friends, rather than an online game with competitive features. The result is that everything soon becomes boring. We are therefore not facing another Super Bomberman R Online, supported by the very concept of the series, which already originally had ambitions withmpetitive. Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle tries with all its might to do something similar, but only partially succeeds, floundering a lot on the medium distance. Unfortunately, the cosmetic items for customizing the avatar and the mazes, which can be unlocked in the in-game shop by spending the coins earned during the games, prolong the player's interest by very little, for whom a few challenges are enough to completely lose interest in this strange experiment. Graphics From a technical point of view Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle is a good title, relatively to its genre. We're still talking about a variant of Pac-Man, so don't expect it to put Stadia under pressure. On the other hand, the different styles of the mazes are nice to see, above all because they alternate in real time during the game (depending on who dominates in a certain maze). Also nice is the ability to zoom while playing, so as to see what is happening in the labyrinths adjacent to ours. The only real flaws are a certain confusion of a couple of labyrinth styles, which make the position of the pills less readable and the fact that basically we are dealing with a fairly stereotypical reinterpretation of the original, without major creative efforts such as those seen in the two Pac-Man Championship Editions. The same goes for the soundtrack, which incorporates classic themes and sounds, both in the music and in the sound effects.", "date": "2020-11-17", "grade": "6.0"}
