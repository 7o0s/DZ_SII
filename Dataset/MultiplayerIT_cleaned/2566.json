{"name": "Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/icewind-dale-heart-of-winter.html", "text": "An expansion for IWD ~Role~ disquisitions aside, Heart of Winter aims to add ~new weapons, new monsters and new places to explore~. He can? Of course yes. Sometimes one wonders how it is possible that within the same Interplay in some games some features are implemented that disappear in subsequent games that use the same engine. It happened with the ability to run in Black Isle's Planescape Torment... but neither Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate 2 implemented this very useful feature in the Infinity Engine games, in fact anyone who has played them knows that a lot of time is lost in moving through places often already visited. Apart from this, some interesting additions had been made in Baldur's Gate 2 such as dual wielding, mysteriously disappeared in Heart of Winter (it was too complicated to have to redraw all the animations of the various characters to allow him to take advantage of both weapons. BG2 and IWD/HoW ultimately use the same sprites for characters...). Even the useful feature that casts all the remaining healing spells by pressing the rest button has disappeared... However, it is possible to enjoy the whole game in the splendor of 800*600, thanks to the beautiful rendered landscapes present, it always has a certain effect. Furthermore, thanks to a particular hotkey it will be possible to highlight on the screen all the various objects with which it will be possible to interact such as doors or objects abandoned on the ground... a very useful thing in all those cases in which some enemies dropped important objects in areas ~ obscured~ of the screen forcing us to make annoying ~pixel hunts~ to blindly search for the right point where the object was. An expansion for IWD You already know the story from the preview... (in short: a tribe of barbarians from the north has decided to take back what was theirs by waging war against the civilized cities nearby; a shaman of that tribe suspecting that there was something strange underneath, he tracks you down in Kuldahar proposing you to try to investigate the matter... Naturally you will discover that everything is much bigger than you and you will therefore have to save the world once again..), so let's talk about the actual game! Apart from the changes made to the engine in terms of gameplay HoW does not introduce anything new .. in fact the style of play remains completely unchanged: you will have to deal with new areas from the often obligatory path, areas that will therefore force you to kill all the various monsters you will meet until you reach the exit or the ~end of level monster~. The new monsters are very few, furthermore none of the clashes require a particular effort, as long as you play HoW with the characters you finished the game with the first time; the problems begin if you decide to tackle the expansion with a lvl 9 (+/- once you leave Dorn's Deep) party as recommended. But with a party to match the various encounters require nothing more complicated than sending your frontline fighters to attack (there will be the clashes between wizards typical of BG2). Among other things, it can be seen that the game uses a sort of strategy (in some situations) which generates other enemies behind you as soon as you come across a group of enemies, thus making you find yourself surrounded and exposing the weak part of the group (wizards and the like) to serious danger. The really new and ~never seen~ thing are some scenarios, how to say ... ~interactive~, i.e. animations that happen only once as soon as you are nearby, like an ice bridge that seems to crumble as you walk over it or the appearance of a person's face in the ice... An expansion for IWD The ~defect~ of Heart of Winter is that there is very little to talk about: expert players won't need more than ten hours to finish this expansion. After that you will only have the ~Heart of Fury~ option, a mode that upgrades enemies to make them even more powerful... even very few will be willing to replay the exact same fights a second time. That said, it's up to you Icewind Dale fans to decide if this Heart of Winter is worth buying. On the one hand you will have a few more hours of fun (not counting the possibility of reaching very high levels like the 30th...) and on the other hand the price of this expansion which is sold (at least the Italian version) at a similar price if not inferior to the American one: Lit 59,900 against $29.99 (typical price for all expansions anyway, n.d.Pucci). Icewind Dale was proposed to the general public as a possible competitor to Diablo 2, calling the apfor gamers who are passionate about massacre ~in style~. The result was a game with the same mechanics as Baldur's Gate but more focused on combat than anything else (although actually all this is a simple pun: Icewind Dale is nothing but Baldur's Gate with far fewer ~urban~ areas and NPCs) .", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
