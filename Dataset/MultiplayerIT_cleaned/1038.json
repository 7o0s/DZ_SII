{"name": "Robotech: Invasion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robotech-invasion.html", "text": "All that has changed If the protagonist of the first Robotech series was the fighter pilot Rick Hunter, and this role also covered in the tie-in Robotech: Battlecry, the same thing does not happen in Robotech: Invasion. The character we control in this new product, in fact, shares with the protagonists of Mospeada (i.e. the third series of Robotech) only belonging to the same conflict and the use of the same technologies. We will therefore follow a ~parallel~ plot to that of the cartoon, full of flashbacks similar to those seen in XIII... The vehicles at our disposal are no longer the famous Varitech fighters, planes capable of transforming themselves into heavily armed robots, but the Cyclone: these are motorcycles that in an instant can become an exoskeleton that protects the rider, transforming him into an agile war machine. The graphics are no longer in cel shading, a technique universally recognized as the most suitable for tie-ins based on cartoons, and have definitely lost their bite. Finally, the game view can change at will, transforming everything into a first person shooter or a third person action game, passing through a hybrid middle ground (behind the character). The War on the Invids Years after battling the Zentradi aliens, the Earthlings are faced with a new invasion: that of the Invid. Controlled by a kind of higher consciousness, these creatures have established various command posts on the planet, subjugating the local population. The center of their power lies within massive, beehive-like organic structures, capable of churning out assault units over and over again. You play as Locke, a member of the resistance who lost his memory after a fight with the Invid and finds himself supporting a small but well-organized team of soldiers who plan to launch major attacks on alien bases. You will leave armed only with a low-powered rifle, in order to familiarize yourself with the control system and the graphical interface. You can choose to play with a first person view (aesthetically very similar to what was seen in Metroid Prime), in the third person (transforming everything into a sort of action game, very useful when there is a need to jump on platforms) or use something in between (something similar to the system adopted in Ghost Recon 2). When you come into possession of a Cyclone, you will have new abilities available: a double jump (also usable to proceed quickly, but not as much as you would like) and the transformation from motorcycle to exoskeleton. It is evident that Vicious Cycle has taken inspiration from several important titles to ~put together~ Robotech: Invasion, and in the case of the Cyclones it has been thought of reproducing the dynamic possibilities present in the beautiful Transformers of Melbourne House, making the transformation a strategic element of the gameplay . Unfortunately, however, the attempt was unsuccessful: it is possible to use the motorcycle mode only outdoors, and in this form the Cyclone is equipped with limited offensive solutions: homing missiles that rarely hit the target. Missiles that would have been useful in exoskeleton mode, given the low effectiveness of most of the weapons: as in Halo, it is possible to collect new tools of destruction along the way, but the effective ones are only a couple. [C] Using the Cyclone in mode The bike does not offer any advantages, apart from speed. The aiming system sometimes throws tantrums, especially when using the zoom. Probably the best of the game is seen in the lower levels. advanced: big mistake. [/C] Americans have imaginations Robotech was born from the fusion of three Japanese animated series: Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada, which the Americans glued and modified in names and dialogues to become the three parts of a single saga. This is not the only such operation carried out in the USA, far from it: the first time it happened for Transformers, when Hasbro and Marvel Comics took a series of successful Japanese toys (Diaclone) and invented a plot and new names for them. Subsequently the souls of Golion, Arbegas and Dairugger IV were redubbed to become the three parts of the Voltron saga (in the USA, saying ~Voltron~ is like saying ~Goldrake~ in Italy, in practice). Finally, the fashion was also applied to TV series: the various Power Rangers series were obtained from the duplication (and reinterpretation of some scenes with American actors) of various Japanese serials with superheroes and rubber monsters. Game structure and technical judgement The missions present in Robotech: Invasion must be completed through the pursuit of different objectives, with the only constant being the fights withthe Invids. The alien units that you will find yourself facing will gradually become more numerous, giving at least a little frenzy to otherwise repetitive and not very engaging clashes. The biomechanical creatures to fight are basically divided into flying units, heavy land units and armored soldiers, with some minor variants. Each of them has a ~weak spot~ which, if hit, deprives them of half their energy. In the first levels, however, especially outnumbered, you will not pay much attention to this possibility: you will ~hook~ one target at a time with the automatic sight and fire until it is destroyed, moving continuously to avoid attacks. Otherwise, when you come into possession of a sniper weapon you will be able to score ~quick~ shots and take out the Invid from afar. The control system allows you to move agilely enough to avoid enemy shots, thanks to the two analog sticks and the use of double jump. You can use the automatic aiming system and fire using the back keys, change view or activate the viewer (night or thermal) using the directional cross, switch from one weapon to another with the Circle key and activate any switches by pressing the stick L3 on its axis. The graphics of Robotech: Invasion is perhaps richer in elements than that of Robotech: Battlecry, but generally it is also less ~clean~ and defined. The use of cel shading would certainly have helped, and we cannot explain why the developers have given up on it. The settings are quite large, but you often come across insurmountable spatial limits (which is always an unpleasant thing). The level of detail isn't the best, as is the overall design of the settings. Furthermore, it is particularly difficult to distinguish enemies when they are human beings: they blend in with the buildings, making their identification rather difficult. Luckily this is something that only happens in the first levels: later your opponents will be very visible, given their size! Finally, the graphics engine is not very solid and shows some uncertainty as soon as the elements on the screen become numerous, as well as some problems in managing the view in ~limit~ cases. A completely different matter for the sound commentary which, as in the previous episode of the series, creates a great atmosphere. The arrival of the Invid, for example, is underlined by a musical theme ~ la Akira~, which instills tension in the player and makes the action more engaging than it really is. Really great. Comment Certainly inferior to Robotech: Battlecry, this new tie-in of the Robotech series tries to imitate the best video games of the genre (Metroid Prime, Halo, Transformers, XIII) without, however, excelling from any point of view. The fights, in particular, reserve few surprises and turn out to be too repetitive, despite the presence of alternative sections in which the Invids are shot from fixed positions, above all due to the mediocrity of the weapons available and the limited dynamic possibilities of the Cyclone (despite the achievable upgrades). The developers should have made sense of the transformation of the vehicle, or invent less anonymous weapons with some peculiarities. The good thing is that the game is quite long, and in the second half it becomes decidedly more interesting, both for the implications of the plot and for the arrival of particularly powerful weapons, with which you will have to solve clashes in which even a strategic component. There is also a rather complete online mode, which takes advantage of the breadth of the settings while offering nothing new compared to other online games. If you are a fan of Robotech and you liked Robotech: Battlecry, you may also appreciate Robotech: Invasion, thanks to the interesting and ~unprecedented~ storyline, which unfolds little by little and makes you take on the role of different characters who then cross paths , the great soundtrack (really great atmosphere) and the possibility to use the Cyclones. For everyone else, however, there are too many better alternatives out there. Pros: Excellent soundtrack Frantic clashes ~Unpublished~ and interesting plot Cons: Graphically not exceptional Use of weapons not very varied Transformation badly exploited An integral part of a revival that in the USA has relaunched the Transformers and Voltron, thanks to new comic series of a certain quality, the videogame project linked to Robotech presented itself quite well in its first incarnation: the graphics in cel shading, the system quite precise control and the great atmospheric music made it a must for those nostalgic for the animated series, which in Italy has only been seen once (and not even in full, if I'm not mistaken).For Robotech: Invasion, set several years after the war with the gigantic Zentradi, the developers wanted to make some changes, also dictated by the different possibilities of the vehicles that the player can use.", "date": "2005-02-16", "grade": null}
