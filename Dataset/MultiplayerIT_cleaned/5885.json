On the one hand, the affordable price, on the other the richness of the campaign, together with an entertaining and fascinating script, have laid the foundations for a trilogy that only with the last chapter has somewhat disappointed expectations, giving the feeling that something had gone wrong in development and that the authors had wanted to close everything hastily. The release of this Final Cut, which includes all three episodes in a single edition, improved in various respects, therefore represents a sort of fine against the users who have trusted the series since its origins, and who case they will be repaid with the possibility of downloading the package for free if they already own the three chapters. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut is a long adventure that engages and excites The Legend of the Hunter In Neocore Games' vision, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut stands as a single, long adventure that includes precisely the three episodes published between 2013 and 2015. To implement this type of solution, the developers have introduced six different classes that can be selected immediately for our character, modified the upgrade system, inventory management and the multifaceted loot and crafting system to give him consistency, even at the expense of immediacy and practicality. In the story, Van Helsing is the son of the homonymous vampire hunter, determined to keep up the good family name and committed to facing the most diverse creatures of the night: from rat-men to spirits, from trolls to harpies, passing through a series of more or less imposing opponents, more or less dangerous and with a unique repertoire. Accompanied by the inseparable Lady Katarina, a ghostly lady with long claws, an excellent battle partner, Van Helsing finds himself dealing with a city besieged by monsters and decides to help its inhabitants, to then join a small army of rebels. united under the same cause: to extirpate evil from the kingdom of Borgovia. However, this is only a portion of the story, which proceeds by trying to involve users thanks to a sometimes brilliant script between quotes and jokes, convincingly acted by Alex Warner, Michelle Sparks and Tim Simmons. Class is not water As mentioned above, from the beginning of the game it is possible to create your own Van Helsing by choosing from six different classes, which are in fact those seen in the third chapter of the series. The Hunter, an agile and lethal figure, equipped with long-range weapons and with a system of projections that can distract enemies and make them fall into traps. The Builder, armed to the teeth and capable of commanding assault turrets that follow him into battle to unleash devastating barrages of fire for his enemies. The Elementalist, a mage who can harness the power of the elements to strike his targets from range, but has limited physical stamina. The Protector, an imposing knight in armor who with his sword and shield manages to tear apart dozens and dozens of monsters, representing a bit the tank of the situation. The Phlogistonist, who moves within an exoskeleton and specializes in the use of grenades and chemical weapons. And finally, the Umbralist, who can hide from enemies until it's too late, attacking them with a pair of ice blades and a variety of special abilities. We had some doubts about the balance and therefore the greater or lesser effectiveness of one class or the other, but the new level cap set at one hundred implies in all cases a slower progression and some extra difficulty when you get to the advanced stages of each chapter without having made the most of the equipment. The skill tree is easily accessible and allows you to assign a whole series of maneuvers to the various keys (even of the controller, perfectly supported), but even here it is not always easy to understand which path to take and which aspects can instead be neglected depending on the type of character we have. Fortunately, after a few missions, it becomes possible to reset the statistics and therefore make any adjustments. Variations on the theme In addition to the classes, the increased level cap and the changes made to the skill tree, The IncredibleAdventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut also introduces other new features, some of which are completely new. Someone will have already seen the tower defense mode, which returns in this case from the first chapter and allows us to face maps that are stormed by endless waves of enemies, to be eliminated by placing traps and turrets, but also by acting in first person against their advance. Then there are the multiplayer modes, in the first place the cooperative one for four participants, which allows you to enjoy the experience in a more engaging way and to coordinate your actions to defeat even the largest gatherings of monsters; but also the competitive ones for up to eight participants, perhaps not very successful but certainly able to offer a few extra hours of entertainment for those who want to experience its mechanics. Last but not least, a brand new section has been added to the many missions of the single player campaign with random quests, daily challenges and events, ideal for doing a little grinding and quickly raising the level of our character, so as to be able to better face the threats of the advanced stages, when the enemies are really many and damn tough, and at low experience levels it seems that our weapons tickle them. Long and challenging Depending on whether you proceed quickly or let yourself be fascinated by the secrets present in each location, exploring every nook and cranny in search of hidden chests and any threats to be eradicated, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut can last from thirty to forty-five hours. Among the strengths of this all-encompassing edition there is certainly the evolution, albeit marginal, which is observed in passing from one chapter to another, in particular with the introduction of new types of monsters to face. On the gameplay front, the presence of the six classes available immediately offers an interesting reinterpretation of the adventure, especially of the first two parts, and opens up a certain degree of replayability, also allowed by the possibility of creating and carrying out different classes simultaneously , since there are specific quests for each of them. It's a pity that in some situations the action ends up revealing the simplicity of its formula a little too clearly, but once again we appreciated the choice to limit the number of opponents per scenario: if you kill them all, you won't find them again then waiting for you on your next visit. In this regard, the inevitable backtracking is coupled with a noticeable recycling of internships from the point of view of the trilogy, but it is a factor to be taken into account when dealing with this type of production. The combat system and the yield of the impacts are different, which unfortunately have remained unchanged and tend to give little satisfaction, except in the most striking and spectacular manifestations of our powers. Technically the game feels the weight of the years, but some uncertainties have been resolved (the game always runs extremely fluid, at 1080p and with all effects at their maximum) and the developers have at least managed to use the assets intelligently, so as to avoid propose anonymous, bare or excessively repetitive scenarios. Too bad for the musical accompaniment, well done and atmospheric, but which becomes monotonous after a few hours.", "date": "2015-11-18", "grade": "7.8"}
