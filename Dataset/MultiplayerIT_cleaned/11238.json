{"name": "La Mummia: La Tomba dell'Imperatore Dragone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-mummia-la-tomba-dellimperatore-dragone.html", "text": "Almost ten years have passed since the first episode of ~The Mummy~, a film released in 1999 which was intended to be a remake of the film of the same name with Boris Karloff, made with a modest budget, and which instead turned out to be a surprise at the box office , grossing more than four hundred million dollars worldwide. Such a resounding success led to the birth of an immediate sequel (~The Mummy: The Return~) as well as an interesting prequel (~The Scorpion King~, played by that myth of Dwayne ~The Rock~ Johnson). Now it's the turn of ~The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor~, probably the final chapter, in which the O'Connell family returns to the scene but with some news: Rick has practically retired from his activity as an explorer, while his son Alex has grown up and has every intention of surpassing his father as an adventurer. It is no coincidence that he is the protagonist of this video game... Strengthened by a great experience with tie-ins, Gameloft has seen fit to use an ultra-tested structure for this new title, namely that of 2D action games a la Prince of Persia. Alex can walk, run, roll, climb in many different ways and do a truly incredible amount of actions, almost breaking records in mobile gaming. Everything is managed in the simplest possible way: the character moves using the joystick, ducks by pressing it down and jumps by pressing it up, while shooting the rifle and fighting hand to hand using the 5 key. The only other button used it is 0, which is used to activate manual aiming, by moving the crosshair clockwise or counterclockwise again using the joystick. In the nine stages that make up the game we will find ourselves facing numerous opponents, even within alternative sections: sometimes we will have to solve puzzles (two variants, which can also be accessed independently from the initial screen), while in a couple of Occasions we will have to eliminate dangerous snipers while we drive around or get behind the wheel of a truck, with a top view. The Gameloft developers have done an extraordinary job as far as the technical sector of this tie-in is concerned: the sound can count on a series of sampled effects, nice even if far from spectacular, while the graphics boast a quantity and quality exceptional. The sprites are all very well drawn, with the protagonist, in particular, having an incredible set of animations: Alex walks, runs, rolls, jumps, shoots, fights, jumps on opponents, grabs vines, climbs walls, descends into the hollows, swims... A very high number of movements, against the backdrop of locations that are always up to the situation, with stages full of details, well coloured, which make a fine display of interactable elements. In short, it was difficult to think of a better result than this. As regards the control system, which has already been mentioned, the response to commands is immediate and precise, with a really simple key configuration. The only problems occur during the alternate sections, which can result in episodes of frustration PRO Solid and thick gameplay Technically extraordinary Good balance of difficulty... AGAINST ...apart from a couple of situations Very disappointing alternate sections Essential sound", "date": "2008-08-27", "grade": "S.V."}
