This is the case of Star Wars, protagonist of the last three DLCs for the game: the introduction of the tables inspired by Episode V, The Clone War and the bounty hunter Boba Fett, which took place in February, has so excited the fans of the saga to push the developers to release a standalone edition of the pinball machine, now also available on Wii U via the eShop. The offer, as anticipated two lines ago, includes three tables but above all allows us to play with the TV or with the GamePad only by simply pressing a button on the touch screen: an immediate solution, which in our opinion should be adopted default by all. Being able to enjoy a few games of pinball comfortably lying on the bed, as if you owned a portable console, is undoubtedly one of the greatest strengths of this edition of Star Wars Pinball, but as we will see, not the only one. Use your balls, Luke! The three tables included are visible from the main menu, within a table that could host many more. Zen Studios will release DLC for Star Wars Pinball? It is very likely, but for the moment let's focus on what is available to us, in this case a pinball machine based on Star Wars: Episode V, one based on Star Wars: The Clone Wars and finally one on the character of Boba Fett. The first table is probably the best for the avid fans of the saga, the one richest in references and the attached nostalgia effect. Just take a look at the beautiful ~decorations~, which start with a group photo of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the two androids, and then develop into ramps and text markers as you progress towards the part superior, dominated by a splendid Darth Vader. There are four wands on the table, positioned in a more or less symmetrical way, and they allow us to send the sphere to the upper areas (to then see it ~projected~ back down through the projection of a lightsaber) or to stay there, trying to score as many points as possible. By hitting the word ~Vader~ the relative letters light up, until the appearance of the villain par excellence, who positions himself on the table and deflects our attacks thanks to the use of the Force. However, Darth Vader is not the only surprise of this table, which depending on the switches we activate will also confront us with a combative Storm Trooper armed with a rifle, a Tie Fighter or a huge AT-AT. The second table, based on Star Wars: The Clone War is probably the least fascinating, given that it was taken from an animated series not very well known here, as well as the easiest of the lot. Here too there are four paddles and in the lower part the various protagonists stand out, surmounted by their Sith adversary par excellence, while at the top there is a riot of ramps and passages that it is not always easy to get into the metal sphere. In the case of The Clone War, the effect of the ball that is launched through a crashing spaceship is very nice, but otherwise the excessive immediacy of the pinball machine (which allows you to score monstrous scores right from the first games) makes it ultimately uninteresting. If you want to try your hand at a nice pinball machine on Wii U, Star Wars Pinball is currently unrivaled My name is Boba Fett So we come to the third table, the one dedicated to Boba Fett, which apparently seems quite simple but hides a large number of surprises. The bounty hunter controls our moves standing on one of the ramps of the pinball machine, but activating the right switches will determine the arrival of several supporting characters, such as the monstrous Jabba the Hutt, another Storm Trooper and even the tentacled beast seen in one of the movies. The experience offered is probably the most demanding of the lot, therefore it is also the one that holds up best over the distance, allowing us to discover new things as we score high scores. And speaking of longevity, the single player mode, which as mentioned can be enjoyed both using the TV and the GamePad only, is joined by a series of multiplayer modes for up to four players, including the one with split-screen and the traditional ~hot seat~, where you take turns in the lead and try to get the highest score. Then there is also the question of alignment, purely sideline, which asks us to side with the light side or the dark side of the Force, updating the statistics on the site ufofficial depending on the results obtained by one faction and the other. Such a solid play system could only count on a technical sector that lived up to expectations, also and above all thanks to Zen Studios' now boundless experience with the genre. All three tables are in fact very beautiful to look at, with an infinite number of different selectable views and flawless ball physics, which gives a real pinball feeling. The presence of LCD-style scenes relating to Episode V, taken from the film, confirm the superiority of this board compared to the other two, for an excellent overall result which is further enhanced by the original music by John Williams and a series of audio samples to great effect.", "date": "2013-07-29", "grade": "8.0"}
