{"name": "Witch It", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/witch-it-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, Witch It is essentially the classic hide-and-seek reduced to a multiplayer video game, but without the slasher fetishism of Dead by Daylight. It doesn't have behind who knows what refined writing or which elaborate narrative background, but limits itself to staging the clash between hunters and witches in the most goliardic way possible, with the former wanting to restore peace in their villages and the latter wanting to spread some of chaos. This very simple premise also partly explains how the matches take place: there are those who seek and those who hide. But let's go step by step. Game mechanics Witch It is a very simple, almost immediate game, so much so that the excellent tutorial ends up being almost superfluous (it's probably excellent because there's little to explain). At the beginning of the games you have to choose whether to be a hunter or a witch. The former are plump men who go around the maps looking for the latter. Basically the games are divided into two phases: the first, shorter, in which the witches go in search of a hiding place using their powers; the second, longer, in which the hunters go into action and have to track down the kind ladies. Hunters win if they manage to eliminate all witches, while witches win if only one of them manages to stay alive for the duration of the match (usually matches last a few minutes). The three modes included in Witch It offer different variations on the basic formula: in ~Hide and Seek~ mode, the main one, witches and hunters are equivalent; in ~Reversal of roles~ instead, initially there are more witches than hunters, but during the game whoever is captured becomes a hunter in turn, so soon the balance changes radically; Finally, in ~Hunting the Crone~, the squads' abilities are deactivated, with the hunters who can only fight in hand-to-hand combat. Gameplay In all cases, gameplay remains similar. To better examine them, we need to take into account the differences between the two warring factions. Let's start with the witches: the nice hags don't know how to fight and can only hide and flee. To do this they have at their disposal an exceptional power that allows them to transform into any object present in the level, as well as to move without returning to human form (albeit in a limited way). In addition to this, they also have some skills that make them particularly elusive, such as the ability to fly on broomsticks, or to create bait objects to deceive pursuers. Hunters are the only ones with offensive abilities, which they use primarily to locate and eliminate witches. Basically they can attack by throwing potatoes, unleashing powerful punches or using skills, such as area attacks or grappling hooks, which give them some mobility. What are all these attacks for? Easy: mainly to hit the objects scattered throughout the levels (chairs, ladders, books, tables, carts and so on and so forth): if they turn purple it means they hide a witch, if they turn yellow instead it means they are normal ornaments . Once you have tracked down a witch, you must eliminate her as quickly as possible to prevent her from escaping and transforming into a new object. Conversely, if you take on the role of a witch and are spotted, you must try to escape. Basically the games are resolved on the one hand in shooting at everything that is around the levels, trying not to leave out the smallest objects, on the other hand in developing the best strategies to go unnoticed. Conclusions Witch It is all about it, and despite spending years in Early Access before version 1.0, it doesn't pretend to be much else. It is not a gigantic production, as can be seen from the well-made cartoon-style graphics but poor in details and from the all too mannerist artistic direction. It is generally well done and does not present major critical issues that can make players uncomfortable. In honor of its genre, it also offers a progression system based on the accumulation of experience points to level up and unlock either the classic cosmetic items (some extra skins are particularly tasty), or new skills to use in the game. For those wondering, the game servers are not crowded. However, it must be said that a small community of enthusiasts has formed around the title of Barrel Roll Games which makes it possible to play without problems, moreover without making large queues (there is also a server browser if desired). This is no small fact, considering that titles of the genre are essentially dead without online players. The same community, really helpful and jovial, is putting a lot of effort into using the game editor to create custom maps, starting from the nine included. So let's say that if the idea intrigues you, by purchasing Witch It you will also find a nice online environment, a rarity these days (probably because there are no big numbers and top streamers involved).", "date": "2020-10-26", "grade": "7.5"}
