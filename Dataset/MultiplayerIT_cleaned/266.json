{"name": "Medieval II: Total War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medieval-ii-total-war-recensione.html", "text": "Total War The saga is one that hasn't missed a beat and, in the three previous incarnations (Shogun, the first Medieval and Rome) it has earned a credit from the gamer community, introducing even the skeptics and the hesitant to the hardcore strategy genre. It will be for the spectacularity that characterizes the pitched battles, from the time of the first release, with thousands of troops deployed on vast and detailed battlefields, it will be for the strategic depth that characterizes each phase of the game, which in the last two incarnations can be played even just as a turn-based strategy, without even having to fight directly (at least in campaign mode... obviously if one wants to play historical battles he must directly engage). In short, there are many reasons for the success of Total War and this fourth incarnation does not betray the standards to which Creative Assembly has accustomed all fans. When class is not water And here is the voice of Sir Robert who explains to us how the ram works, illustrates its functions and... Did he by chance say ~Holy dog, this microphone again!~? Sir Robert, what's the matter with you? Is there any way to do this? And, above all, did microphones exist in the Middle Ages? But let's listen to the explanations of the Trabucco and Porco what? Sir Robert, that curse word is not said! And what the heck. There are no longer the Sirs of the past, the affected and cultured ones who spoke a refined and precise language. We haven't gone crazy. In the dubbing of the game there are two files (if you find others, report them) in which you can also hear those who should be off-air. The curse words are there, the curses too. Maybe next time it would be better to pay more attention even if we were blasphemous The management of the kingdom Leaving aside the multiplayer mode and the three types of battles that can be tackled (Custom, Historical and Fast), which are classic modes that do not require excessive insights, let's immediately go into the Campaign mode, which is also the fulcrum of the entire game. Choosing the faction (initially there will be only five available, then, by winning a campaign, another twelve will be added scattered throughout Europe), choosing the ~scope~ of the enterprise (i.e. whether to win you need to conquer fifteen or forty-five territories. .. calculate that already in the first case it will take a couple of game days to finish, especially if you select a medium / high difficulty), and having set the various difficulty levels, you find yourself on a map of medieval Europe that extends from the Pillars of Hercules to Russia. Depending on the chosen faction, you will have possession of some territories and you will have the aim of conquering all those you need to win within a certain number of rounds. The management of troops and the economy has remained largely unchanged from Rome: Total War. Here too you will have to balance expenses between the development of the cities and the growth of the army, as well as you will have to take care of diplomatic relations with the other factions, sending emissaries or planning weddings between the members of the houses and, in case we do not intend to talk with anyone but we wanted to go to conquer, we will be able to send spies in advance to discover the enemy forces (or to open the city gates in case of siege) or assassins to try to kill some personalities. The figure of the priest has been added to the ranks of agents, who has the aim of converting the infidels to the Catholic religion, in order to please the Pope, the central figure in the balance of power of the entire game, given that being in his good graces or having him as an enemy, it can seriously make a difference (many of the innovations introduced compared to the past concern the relationship between factions and religion... with the possibility of placing a Cardinal belonging to one's own faction in Rome and directly influencing the election of Popes ). The management of the kingdom The church of Rome has great powers in the economy of a campaign since it can ask the player to carry out tasks by entrusting him with missions, can call crusades and can ask not to go to war against other Catholic factions. To tighten relations with the church too much can cause big problems, with the inquisition being sent to one's own lands and with the risk of excommunication which practically gives the freedom to all the other factions to come and feast on our possessions (at the time the papal excommunications were real disasters). Obviously, if you are at the head of an Islamic faction, you will not be able to participate in the election of the Pope and mosques will be built instead of churches. There is also the management of the army and the cities (God forbid), with the possibility of acquIsting buildings to be able to hire ever more prepared and powerful troops, or other war tools useful on the battlefield (for example ballistae or catapults). Each troop has its own initial cost and another fixed cost that must be paid each turn. This makes it necessary to increase the war potential in proportion to the size of one's nation, otherwise there is the risk of running out of funds and, consequently, of not being able to finance all the other aspects. There are many ways to make money: the main one is to make citizens pay taxes, guaranteeing each territory its own income (and here we can mention another novelty with respect to the past, the two types of urban agglomerations: castles, more militarily strong but less profitable in terms of development and cities, which obviously develop more floridly, but are more difficult to defend). Another way is to conquer other territories by looting cities, in order to maximize the money obtained from the conquest. A third way is to enhance trade by constructing special buildings, improving roads, sending merchants to collect and sell the resources present on the ground and signing trade agreements with other factions. Then there are secondary but still important revenues, which allow you to catch your breath in times of difficulty such as gifts from other nations, occasional tributes, and prizes receivable with the various missions. you will have to balance the expenses between the development of the cities and the increase of the army The management of the kingdom Finally, the management of the seas should not be forgotten, teeming with rebels and enemy fleets. You too will have to build your fleet which will aim to transport troops and allow you to take control of the waters around your territories (fighting and blockading rival ports). Naval combat, as in the past, will be fully automatic. There are also buildings that allow you to upgrade the fleet, allowing larger gatherings or equipping it with more technologically powerful means. The battle And now we come to what is the highlight of any Total War that wants to define itself as such: the battles. Remaining within the campaign, you will have to fight in the following situations: facing an enemy army in an open field, suffering an attack, storming a city or a castle under siege and, finally, suffering a siege in a city or castle. Of novelty, from the point of view of the battle, there are few. In fact, some would say, it's quite difficult to improve what is already at the top, and the risk is to get worse where there are no obvious defects, just for the need to give something new to market on. Medieval II Total War, from this point of view, does not betray uncertainties and improves the cosmetic aspects, with the enhancement of the graphics sector which, if you have an adequate system, allows you to enjoy pitched battles fought between thousands of units built with a very high level of detail. More than this, however, counts the improvement that there has been in artificial intelligence, now able to place its troops in the field in a credible way, also sketching advanced tactics and capable, finally, of using heavy artillery properly . In short, finally the enemy troops will be seen trying to avoid an encirclement without crowding confusedly in the middle of the battlefield and, above all, they too will exploit the different forces adequately. Of course, some uncertainty remains, especially during sieges in which it is not difficult to distract enemy archers with elementary tricks, but this is not felt that much and the satisfaction of winning a balanced battle (or even one that sees us at a disadvantage ) is truly amazing. The battle The battles take place according to a fixed scheme: it is evaluated whether the weather conditions are valid for the fight (you can wait, generally three shifts, to see if they change for the better ... the risk obviously is that they get worse going to affect morale of the army), you place your troops on the battlefield within a predefined area and, finally, you fight. In the event that a besieged city (or castle) must be attacked, suitable means (rams, towers and ladders) must be built in advance to break through the defense walls, if any. The variables that must be considered in each battle are so many that it is impossible to list them all (types of troops, terrain, troop morale, equipment ... just to name a few), you just need to know that it does not exist, among real-time strategy , something so deep and satisfying, in terms of gi experience feedbackgoof. Seeing entire armies clashing with each other is an emotion that is renewed with each episode of the series, an emotion accentuated by some topical moments (such as the killing of an enemy commander) that are represented with small filmed sequences. By pulling some sums In short, Medieval II: Total War is undoubtedly a masterpiece capable of outclassing its direct competitors from all points of view, even if there are some flaws, if you want to be picky. In the first place, girls are buried alive ah, no, that's the game that angered that easygoing Mastella, who has probably only seen video games at the supermarket. Returning to us and to the meticulousness, if desired, the game could have been optimized better. Sure, on the system it was tested on (P4 3.4GHz, 2GB Ram, GeForce 7800 GT with 256MB), where Gothic III trudges and Neverwinter Nights 2 dances, fluidity was excellent and never faltered. , but the problem remains and defects have been reported on many forums in this sense. Another small problem concerns the lack of innovations. Apart from some strictly necessary scenario changes (the religious question), there have not been major implementations compared to the past. As already said this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view seeing entire armies clashing with each other is an emotion that is renewed with each episode of the series By pulling some sums Here, perhaps the only real flaw is the lack of a multiplayer campaign. In fact, playing online, it will only be possible to face individual battles... perhaps more care, from this point of view, could have been used. We hope that the developers will please us with an expansion or, directly, in the next Total War. Conclusions A real drug. There's nothing to say. We played for twelve hours straight (and don't come up with jokes like ~the editors of Multy don't have bats to do all day~; it's our dirty work) without noticing the time passing. Real day alternated with real night and we were still there staring at the monitor and then suddenly, a multitude of days alternated. We have now written the article and sorry, we want to go back to playing Pros It is the best of Total War Spectacular and tactically deep battles The management phase is now a game in itself Cons Few major innovations Poor multiplayer Heavy graphics engine Total War The siege has been going on for months now, our troops are exhausted but the situation inside the city is not rosy either. Approaching the walls you can smell the stench of corpses and the sorties of the inhabitants, in search of water and food, become more and more frequent. It won't be long before those doors open and the surrender is signed. Attempts to stop the siege by enemy troops were unsuccessful. They tried to attack us from all fronts, but we resisted and we're still here. Some lookouts have sighted smoke coming from behind the hill to the north; they suspect that it may be another enemy army ready to sacrifice themselves in a desperate attempt to break our lines they may come, our spears will welcome their bodies. Rubbini, why did you wake me up? Did I fall asleep in front of the monitor? I know but how do you detach yourself from so much splendour? I almost don't even write this article and I go back to playing... Oh well, no... getting excited is good but then you have to stay on the ground and be objective. Let me dress up with the institutional third person plural and let's go deeper into Medieval II: Total War.", "date": "2006-11-17", "grade": null}
