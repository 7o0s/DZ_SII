Simple, it's a sport. But it's not just any sport, it's the sport of wizards. Quidditch is a bit like football: there are balls, there are players, there is a field and there are goals to score. However, there is a very small detail: Quidditch is played on brooms, in flight, and the balls on the pitch are alive. Two teams face each other from time to time, each made up of seven players: the Goalkeeper, who must prevent the Quaffle - the ball, in short - from scoring points by crossing rings; three Chasers, who must grab the Quaffle and hurl it through one of the opponent's rings to score points; two Beaters, who take care of the Bludgers, deadly living balls that annoy players and can be beaten with a bat against opposing players; finally, a Seeker, who plays the most delicate role: a Quidditch match can last forever, unless a seeker finds and takes possession of the microscopic Golden Snitch, ending the game and giving his team a good one hundred and fifty points and, almost certainly, winning the match. Every year, at Hogwarts, the four Houses into which the students are divided (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) face off hard in a Quidditch tournament; but there is also a much more important competition, the World Cup, in which the most famous professional teams in the world of magic compete. In Quidditch World Cup, needless to say, the player can control one of the many Houses and Teams already mentioned in the novels and compete in the World Cup together with Harry Potter, the Weasley brothers, Oliver Wood and even the legendary Viktor Krum of the German school by Durmstrang. Broomsticks... Obviously a transposition in video game form of the complex (contrary to what it may seem, it really is) game of Quidditch, especially from a purely physical point of view, is not easy at all, but EA somehow managed to avoid all the pitfalls of the case that he could have offered such an operation by making a game that is not only faithful to the original idea but which is also very fun to play. If you come to terms with some minor flaw, of course. Quidditch World Cup allows, as already mentioned, to take control of a team and face the World Cup or simple training matches, and the management of the seven players is incredibly intuitive, since, without too many frills, it is the game that decrees which player to check at any given moment, based on the Quaffle's position on the pitch. Each player controls himself differently, obviously, depending on his role, and has various abilities that underline fidelity to paper and cinematic Quidditch: the Beater, for example, can repel an incoming Bludger, which passes by for a few moments under the control of the user who can attempt to direct it against an opponent; by pressing a few buttons, the Chasers can pass the ball, shoot it on goal at the desired launch power and even perform spectacular acrobatics in order to steal the Quaffle from the opponent; but the decisive role is assumed by controlling the Seeker, who at a certain point of the game will have to chase the Snitch (on pre-established tracks, fortunately) in a mad race between the players, the stands and the darting Bludgers, accelerating strategically in order to get close enough to the golden ball to catch and end the game. Other elements make Quidditch varied and never monotonous: the combos between players that allow you to pass the ball more and more frenetically to end the action with a spectacular shot on goal or the spells that you can cast on your opponents by moving a temporary crosshair deepen the mechanics of the game, without making it too confusing. So far, in short, the Quidditch World Cup works very well, it is an almost perfect revival of the sport created by Rowling, if it weren't for one small detail: it is not possible to control the movement of the players on the vertical axis. We soon realize that the decision taken by EA is definitely justifiable, given that the possibility of moving in total freedom as in the flight sections of the game Harry Potter and the Chamber of the Secrets would have made the title unplayable due to its complexity would have derived, but the bitter taste for these movements in a certain sense prefixed remains, and one has the feeling of having control over one's players based on the rules decreed by the game rather than by the user himself...Which one to choose? Quidditch World Cup is a multiplatform title and for this reason, although the review mainly refers to the PlayStation 2 version, some clarifications about the differences between one version and another seem necessary. Well, these differences are really minimal and are mainly limited to the visual aspect of the title which on GameCube and XBox appears slightly more defined than on PlayStation 2, without forgetting the fact that the game only supports progressive-scan in the XBox version. The sporadic drops in the frame-rate seem to affect the Sony and Microsoft consoles more, occurring much more rarely on the GameCube which, moreover, enjoys the possibility of connecting to the GameBoy Advance version to unlock extra features inaccessible to owners of the other versions. ... and brass knobs. This Quidditch World Cup is very beautiful from a technical point of view: using the same graphic engine that gave life to the beautiful Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, EA has created a very good polygonal modeling of the fields and players, especially from the point of view of view of the animations and the detail, albeit lacking in texturing, which is neither surprising nor shocking. EA's decision is pleasant not only to include some of the most famous characters of the series as selectable players (from Oliver Baston to Draco Malfoy, from Cho Chang to Angelina Johnson and so on) but also to space out the matches, especially in the case of a successful shot, with short FMV skits showing the most ~known~ spectators like Hermione or Ron cheering on the players and cheering them on. Excellent light effects that fill the screen in the most agitated situations without annoying or being too tacky. The frame-rate in such a game is important to remain very solid: unfortunately this is a defect that afflicts Quidditch World Cup, as moderate slowdowns occur sporadically which, however harmless, are clearly noticeable. The sound accompaniment is excellent, which incorporates the classic themes created for the cinematic versions and always proves to be spot on and engaging, together with a dubbing which in English is magnificent but which in Italian leaves something to be desired. Comment One of the most memorable sequences savored in these first five novels written by Rowling undoubtedly occurs at the beginning of the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when Harry and the Weasley family travel to the World Cup final, during the which the writer's ability to tell this spectacular sport is expressed in all its magnificent power. Based on the countless details disseminated by Rowling in her writings and on the faithful visual transposition made by director Chris Columbus, EA has pulled a game out of the hat that, unexpectedly, proves to be successful in many respects, albeit undermined by significant defects that affect its quality . With all its secrets to unlock and a pleasant two-player mode, Quidditch World Cup is a game dedicated above all to fans of the series but also to all those who want to get to know - and love - the world of Harry Potter from an angle decidedly different, as long as they manage to overlook the decidedly simplistic mechanics of the movements and the sometimes decidedly stupid Artificial Intelligence of the opposing teams. A possible sequel or upgrade could probably turn out to be a small masterpiece... Pros It's Quidditch in a videogame version More than good technical realization Varied and fun Cons: Inconsistent frame-rate Mediocre AI Movement control too simple Talking about Harry Potter is anything but easy. These days, in thousands of Italian homes, adults and children leaf through the exciting fifth novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, one of the most anticipated books of the century. It is unknown when J.K. Rowling, brilliant mother of Harry and his adventures, will print the sixth novel; what for now the reader has in hand is yet another brilliant adventure of a boy like many who lives in a very normal world ... in its abnormality. By now, everyone knows the story of Harry Potter: Harry was an eleven-year-old orphan of his parents and always lived with his hateful maternal uncles when he received a letter inviting him to present himself at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It turned out that Harry was a wizard, son of wizards killed by an evil sorcerer, Voldemort, destined to frequententer Hogwarts, the wizarding world, make new friends and battle fearsome enemies. Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge: Harry grew up, laughed, cried, loved, dozens of unforgettable characters have followed one another in Rowling's books and each of them has always left something of himself in those readers who they didn't stop at the media chatter about the Harry Potter series, foolishly presented as a simple sequel of novels for teenagers after the boom of the two films inspired by them, but who were able to find and savor in Rowling's stories a fantastic flavour, a genuineness of feelings and a bizarre unrepeatable everyday life. The same could be said for video games dedicated to Harry Potter, which have repeatedly proved to be more than decent titles, in some cases excellent, but always dedicated to an audience first of readers, rather than gamers, who have known how to appreciate them for their faithful recreation of the world of Harry. This new EA Games title, Quidditch World Cup, is the confirmation of what has been said so far, and elevates to the nth degree the craziest idea that Rowling has come up with in the last ten years...", "date": "2003-12-24", "grade": null}
