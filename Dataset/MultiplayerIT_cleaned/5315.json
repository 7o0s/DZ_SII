Among the launch titles was Lumines, a musical puzzle born from the mind of Tetsuya Mizuguchi - the same as Space Channel V and Rez, but also SEGA Rally - able to suck you into a playful vortex in which the game mechanics are perfectly synchronized with psychedelic visual and musical notes. We were trapped by it for many nights: Lumines represented a shot of life for the classic puzzles of the time, a sort of conceptual evolution of Tetris albeit less mass-oriented. In any case, its success has led to various transpositions, with the best from our point of view hosted by Sony laptops (the sequel on PSP, Electronic Symphony on PlayStation Vita) and some less successful appearances on home consoles, PCs, mobiles . Only in Korea, unfortunately, there is Lumines Online, which has introduced some new features such as 8x combos, team multiplayer and a constantly updated soundtrack with new songs. After the very dry experiment of Lumines Touch, uninspired in terms of soundtrack and with the aggravating circumstance of having a terrible control system, Tetsuya Mizuguchi tries again together with Mobcast with Lumines: Puzzle & Music, available for iOS and Android together with the presence of a song that will make the historical fans of the series jump for joy: Shinin' by Mondo Grosso, present only in the original title. Lumines is back on iOS and Android, finally with a version worthy of the name We live in a big world Let's take a step back, however, explaining how Lumines works and what the specific features of this version are. The game offers a series of fixed-pattern levels to be tackled in sequence, each of which is called a ~skin~ and is different from the previous one both in terms of graphics and musical accompaniment. The game grid recalls that of Tetris, some blocks made up of four squares of a maximum of two different colors descend from above; the aim is to place them on the basis of the grid and form a block of the same color, in order to eliminate it from the latter. This practice does not happen immediately as in other similar games, but at the timed passage of a timeline (metronome) which cancels the blocks after having intercepted them. In this regard, it is necessary to plan the multiple joints to increase the score, but also to be careful not to vertically saturate the grid and therefore end the game. By tapping on the screen you rotate the falling blocks (to the right or left, set in the options), which can be moved horizontally and immediately positioned by dragging them downwards. The game mechanics are quite simple to learn but prove to be profound and increasingly engaging at the same time, because each skin offers, as mentioned, a completely different graphic design, but also a different speed for falling blocks and for the timeline, bringing to combinations that can sometimes be ~annoying~ even when the movement of one of the two is very slow. Like any good Mizuguchi game, the music sector is the absolute protagonist, because the breaks and choruses react to what is done while playing, going into a loop in case of score stagnation, increasing in pace when there are particularly long combos. In Lumines: Puzzle & Music there are also several components from the PlayStation Vita chapter, such as special squares capable of inverting colors and the possibility of choosing an avatar with a special ability, such as interrupting blocks or the timeline to a few seconds. The cost of the title is very low, equal to 3 euros, inside there are two albums to be faced according to three levels of difficulty, linked to the number of skins to be faced. In fact, each one has a challenge index fixed in the design phase, linked as mentioned to the speed of the blocks and the timeline, but also to the graphic and musical appearance, which can affect the level of confusion and mental involvement (pass us the term) of the player. Once you have overcome the first obstacles, you can access the individual skins and the infinite mode: personally we have completed a continuous session of almost an hour and a half, then we threw ourselves under the cold shower to return to normal. There are 14 total skins, divided into two different albums: the classic one from the first Lumines, made up of six levels, and the one created specifically for this version. In the first case Shinin' is undoubtedly the absolute protagonist, together with Meguro whom we particularly appreciate; other cornerstones such as Sha are missingke Ya' Body, but the selection chosen is quite appreciable. As for the unreleased tracks we have some exponents of groove music, others of electronics, others of J-Pop; the initial ones are rather bland, the latter definitely better; the graphic style, on the other hand, is always excellent. Over time, new packages will certainly arrive - after all, the Classic album has the suffix Vol. 1 - and in reality two of them have already been announced by the end of September. One of these will be linked to Ultra Japan, an absolutely crazy music festival held in Japan in conjunction with the Tokyo Game Show. We don't know the prices yet, and for the sake of completeness we tell you that a free version of the title should arrive in the coming weeks, within which Lumines Classic will be purchased separately. In terms of the control system, fortunately we have a much better situation than Lumines Touch: the version under our test is played with pleasure using tactile commands, more precise and responsive than in the past (we advise you to select ~Turbo~ as speed of block rotation). Intrinsic limitations of this type of control system remain, which do not allow to obtain stratospheric scores and to play at the same high levels that could be reached with physical controls. There is currently no MFI support for external peripherals such as the pad, hopefully it will come in an upcoming update.", "date": "2016-09-05", "grade": "8.0"}
