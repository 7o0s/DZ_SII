If you are a true fan of the Naruto manga or anime, in short, more generally of the wonderful and enthralling story written and drawn by Masashi Kishimoto, this is a game that you mustn't miss. You can safely close the article page, go to the shop, buy the game and let yourself be carried away by what is probably the best videogame transposition of the worthy Dragon Ball heir. The writer guarantees that you will not regret it. If instead of Naruto you have only heard of, but what we have seen to date of the game between images and various videos has teased you, then the following will dispel your doubts since Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 is still a good fighting game with an interesting single system player halfway between an exploratory adventure and an action full of narrated stories, all seasoned with a minimal role-playing approach. Of course there are flaws and indeed sometimes they manage to be rather annoying, but the fun is always present and the charm of the manga on which the video game is based oozes from every single screen, resulting in a well-synthesized and quite understandable even by those who have never Bed. But it's time to see in detail what Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 is. An inevitable pain The plot of the game develops through six chapters, a prologue and an epilogue and fits exactly at the beginning of the Shippuden series, the so-called second season of Naruto which sees the young Chunin and Jonin now grown up and the homonymous protagonist of the series return to leaf village after training with master Jiraya. The story then develops through the discovery of the Alba organization, their goal of capturing the carrier forces up to Pain's devastating attack on the native village of the blond ninja. In parallel we will also witness the combative evolution of Sasuke, the formation of the Hebi team and his tragic and intense clash with his brother Itachi. One of the peculiarities of Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 is right here: in the approximately 18 hours that we spent completing it (without pushing excessively on the secondary objectives front) we found ourselves commanding a rather large number of ninjas. In fact, we will not only play the role of Naruto, but rather in addition to the chapters dedicated to Sasuke and Jiraya, we will find ourselves wandering around the game world controlling Sakura, Gai, Yamato, Gaara, Shikamaru and several others. In fact, if it hadn't been understood yet, the work produced by Namco Bandai is indeed a fighting game but inserted into a single player campaign which in all respects develops like an adventure. Over the course of the chapters, the world that can be visited will enlarge, making us cross not only the village of the leaf, but also that of sand and rain, Orochimaru's lair and that of the Uchiha clan. All through fixed screens and with an automatic camera in most cases (although there are some larger areas where the camera can be moved or positioned behind the protagonist) within which we can move the ninja and his team freely . These screens are well characterized and, especially inside the villages, populated by numerous characters with whom you can interact to chat, receive main and secondary missions. But not only since it will above all be possible to collect numerous materials by examining the various elements of the scenario. These will be used to unlock recipes in village shops, so as to make the products created available for purchase. A predominant part of Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 is in fact represented by the numerous objects that can be purchased by spending the Ryo, the currency of the world of Naruto that can be earned by winning matches and carrying out missions and which are basically divided into two types. On the one hand we have the ninja tools that can be used within the clashes by pressing the four directions of the digital cross (fully customizable before the battle); on the other we have the bento boxes that must be used before the fight to have access to a large number of bonuses for your team. Unfortunately, however, the adventure component of the game does not work perfectly. On the one hand, having to navigate through fixed screens can become a little boring in the long run, especially when we find ourselves going through the same scenarios for the umpteenth time. There is a map of the game world and, in our opinion, it would have been a good addition to offer the player oneability to move quickly through the most important locations. Added to this secondary problem are the very numerous and sometimes even rather long uploads that afflict the title and which excessively break the flow of exploration. Finally, the secondary missions (called requests) do show a minimum of variety but still tend to result in operations of mere collection of some resource or in clashes of increasing difficulty. Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! But let's get to the core of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, or the fighting game component. Along the lines of the prequel and more generally of all the beat-em'ups of manga extraction, the fights are extremely focused on making the action spectacular rather than balancing the fighters or on the technical aspect of moves and combos. The commands are in fact reduced to the bone: the triggers are used to parry or to carry out the substitution technique if pressed with perfect timing with respect to the opponent's attack; with the two backbones you can call, when available, the two different teammates; with the d-pad as already explained above, you can call up the ninja tools. Finally, the combinations of the front keys determine the actual attacks: with A you jump, with X you use throwing weapons, with Y you can recharge the chakra or activate it and finally with B you carry out the attacks and the various combos in association with analog. In particular where the depth of combat develops is in the combination between the activation of the chakra and the other blows: for example by pressing Y followed by X it will be possible to charge the throwing weapon with spiritual energy, while pressing A after activating the chakra the protagonist will approach the enemy at great speed, avoiding his attacks. But it is obviously from the combination of chakra and attack that the real blows of Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 come out, or the techniques. These will be of three types: simple, supreme and team and each time they will kick off splendid animated sequences that return all the feeling of the Naruto universe. Furthermore, during some crucial fights for the plot, the typical anime scenes that can be managed via quick time events will be activated. Here all the epic nature of the Namco Bandai production can only exalt the fans of the manga also thanks to some small prizes (called secret factors) which are activated by completing these sequences in the best possible way and which lead to the viewing of small excerpts from the original anime . However, it is right to spend a few additional words on team management. In practice, for most of the adventure you will be accompanied by other ninjas who will join your team. Until the end of the game you will never have a choice about them, they are imposed on you by the plot and the consequences materialize during the combat phase. In practice, each support ninja has an affinity (attack, defense, balance) which determines the type of technique used when called on the field with the pressure of the lats and will therefore force you to have a minimum of tactical management, given that he must pass some time before I can call him again. Furthermore, with this operation a special team bar will be loaded which, once maximized, will allow the activation of an unprecedented supreme technique, of devastating power and great choreography. Finally, to add another layer of variety to the beat-em'up phase, each ninja in certain low health situations can activate an awakening or a transformation: for a limited period of time he will therefore have access to faster and more powerful attacks and will be more resistant to the blows of the enemy with also modifications on the usable techniques. The multiplayer Outside of the adventure mode which is the backbone of the single player, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 offers two multiplayer options. There's the classic 1 vs 1 clash to be done locally against the computer or another player or access to multiplayer via Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. In this case it will be possible to create or participate in ranked or non-ranked matches so as to earn points and attempt the very long climb to the top. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your tastes in fighting games, the roster of characters will be directly linked to the single-player campaign: at the beginning you will be able to choose from a very small number of fighters and to unlock all 46 ninjas present, you will have to have completed the game first. Furthermore, some challengers will tend to evolve during the adventure thus allowing access to enhanced versions of the same character. The classic example is Naruto who will go from ninja who uses the simple rasengan until he has access to the most profound hermitic techniques. There is also a minimum of customization of one's profile: it will in fact be possible to assign oneself a title (there are many that can be unlocked by accumulating the so-called Storm Points during the adventure or by carrying out particular combos during the encounters) and choose a ninja-card that serves as from image. The latter can be purchased in a particular shop in the village of the leaf. Xbox 360 goals Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 offers 50 achievements for the usual 1000 total points. There are no secrets and by completing the entire single player adventure with a minimum of depth you can unlock just under half of them for around 400 points. The rest concerns the multiplayer component minimally and the majority of the high number of collectibles between side missions, purchasable items and unlockable titles. Better the manga, the anime or the video game? Technically Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 can leave you confused at first glance. In fact, the game combines models and elements of the scenario entirely in 3D that are well animated and discreetly cared for in terms of detail, with mostly two-dimensional backdrops also drawn by hand with a particularly pleasant stylistic choice. It is the union of the two elements, also thanks to a very evident cel shading, that clashes at first glance: seeing these small seedlings that can be examined or the mound of earth with which one can interact, so strongly detached from the rest of the scenario, may not please everyone. Furthermore, it is not possible not to notice a rather marked aliasing on the characters and a certain static nature and paucity of the scenes that make up the adventure part. A completely different matter for the combat arenas, always well designed and of interesting variety: here the fighters stand out for their quality and the choreography of the battle, the constant passage between more or less interactive sequences and more generally the whole atmosphere of the comic, help to restore a really pleasant and extremely dynamic feeling. Also noteworthy is the soundtrack which partially incorporates the style of the anime and is full of excellent orchestrated music capable of strongly emphasizing the moments of greater pathos, especially the tragic ones. The dubbing is in English or Japanese (absolutely recommended if you are a true comic book lover and also to get around the lack of lip synchrony that afflicts Anglo-Saxon speech), while the subtitles are made in a very good Italian that respects the translations of the manga .", "date": "2010-10-15", "grade": "8.5"}
