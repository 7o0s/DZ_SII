You don't sleep peacefully when the developers openly tell you that the game crashed due to the graphics engine update, and that the absence of any quality control system led to the release being postponed by a good four months. The benefit of the doubt, however, must be given to everyone, and Hello Neighbor deserved it after all, allowing players to make themselves known through alpha, beta, and other Greek letters. In short: the developers believed in the project, we are sure of this. And we are also certain that the basic idea of the title was truly original, even within a genre that is now aware of hundreds of variations. The problem is that the realization leaves so much to be desired that it leads to homicidal instincts towards the Neighbor, his home and the whole city. The psychopath next door It's a beautiful sunny morning, we've just moved to a charming suburban neighborhood, complete with terraced houses worthy of a best American film. But while we kick our ball in the center of the roadway, regardless of any vehicle that could run over us at any moment (how beautiful youth is), we notice something strange. Suspicious moans are coming from one of the houses, just as suspicious is that beefy guy who is obviously trying to silence his hostage in the living room. We are able to see all this because obviously the attacker thought of doing everything in plain sight in front of the room window, in broad daylight. And since both the door and the other windows are all wide open... what do you say? curiosity killed the cat. And this is the plot of Hello Neighbor: a madman has kidnapped someone and is hiding dark secrets inside his home, we, for no apparent reason, will take charge of finding out what it is. The title openly presents itself as a horror/stealth game, the problem is that anxiety, fear and tension disappear after about ten seconds, since the genre is hybridized with some completely incompatible elements. For example, a sunny and colorful context, and a caricature style that makes the characters openly disproportionate and exaggerated. Let me be clear: this is not exactly a defect. Indeed, the graphic and artistic style undertaken makes Hello Neighbor immediately recognizable in a context of titles that are too often all similar. The problem is another: if the tension disappears almost immediately, the stealth mechanics remain the master and motivate the theater. What happens if the rest of the production doesn't work either, and the gameplay is just sketchy? Because let's face it: Hello Neighbor's offer is elementary, it couldn't be more elementary. Equipped with a first-person view and no weapon, our little boy can crouch down, perform small sprints, collect the objects in the scenario (not all) and hide in wardrobes or under the beds if necessary. In short, a classic stealth game like Hide 'N Seek: if the Neighbor sees us, we simply run away and run to hide. If, on the other hand, the Neighbor catches us... What the heck is there to do? If the Neighbor catches us, nothing actually happens. And this is one of Hello Neighbor's first real problems: the lack of a sensible system of penalties, which leads the player to live the experience with that anguish that has been stolen from a world that is too colorful and bright. If every time I'm picked up by the Neighbor my progress isn't undone, if the box I placed in that spot is still there, and the key I picked up is still in my pocket, then why should I care? Indeed, it is almost better to throw yourself like crazy at home, see and collect everything as soon as possible, get caught by the Neighbor and then return to the place. Furthermore, our respawn always takes place in the same point, but that of our antagonist does not: therefore we could ~cheat~ by being seen by the enemy, luring him to a distant place, allowing him to lay his hands on us, and then being regenerated closer to the goal compared to him, who will still have to go back. Then, if you think about it, the same sequence that marks defeat is hardly credible: when the Neighbor catches us, he grabs us and... that's it. We are regenerated. There is never a real game over, but rather an eternal trial and error sequel. This last consideration brings us to the most serious defect of Hello Neighbor, the one on which unfortunately we cannot ignore in any way. The title has a progression left completely to chance: it is not clear what exactly needs to be done, nor how to do it,and lacks any kind of indication from the developers. In short, the player is completely abandoned, and especially in the initial stages (but also later) he will go his way gropingly, between being constantly caught by the Neighbor and not having the faintest idea of the use of those boxes in the garden. Let me be clear: that you have to reach a certain point in each house proposed by the three acts of the game is intuitive. The problem is: what the hell does one have to do to succeed, exactly? More than rewarding logic and intuition, Hello Neighbor pays to try a little bit of everything, everywhere. To move forward we must use every interesting object that we recover, at the first available opportunity, even when a logical connection seems less evident. The small environmental puzzles do not follow any progression system, and the puzzles are meaningless: without a guide available you will find yourself wandering around the rooms at random, not knowing what to do and how to do it, with that madman chasing you. The balance of difficulty is not good either: paradoxically, the more you go on with the ~story~ and the simpler the title becomes. This is because the size of the houses increases, giving us more tools to not be seen by our pursuer. However, we also try to value the good, because there is (almost) always something good. First of all, the basic idea: Hello Neighbor is based on an always valid concept (escape from pursuers) declining it with interesting ideas, characters as grotesque as able to elicit a laugh, and an original, easily recognizable game world. To be rewarded, were it not for the problem of its respawn mentioned above, is also the intelligence of our enemy. The Neighbor is able to learn our favorite routes, the places we usually hide, the doors we have opened or closed, the switches we have interacted with. This means that even the slightest detail out of place will immediately alarm him, prompting him to look for us like a madman (and here a little bit of anxiety arrives). He will also place traps in the most traveled paths, trying to slow us down. Once he threw a jam jar at us.", "date": "2017-12-24", "grade": "5.0"}
