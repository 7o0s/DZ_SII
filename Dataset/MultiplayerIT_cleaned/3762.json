{"name": "Stardew Valley", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stardew-valley-recensione.html", "text": "Stardew Valley has come a long way. The review of the PC version dates back to the now distant March 2016. In the meantime the title of Concerned Ape has grown, has been enriched with content and features, has been smoothed where necessary and has made its debut on numerous other systems. The Android version is the most recent and keeps the charm of the others intact, so much so that it is the best derivative of Harvest Moon on the mobile market, even superior to the official titles of the series in the store, namely Harvest Moon: Light of Hope and Harvest Moon : Seeds Of Memories, which are also technologically more advanced. After all, Stardew Valley is first of all the act of love of a single individual towards the classic Harvest Moons, the 16-bit ones (of which it largely takes up the graphic style) that had not yet had to undergo all those compromises necessary to make them usable by the general public. As such it offers itself as the purest and most radical expression of the original idea of Yasuhiro Wada, the author of Harvest Moon, who has also made public appreciation for Stardew Valley... After all, the act of love has succeeded to sell millions of copies, let's not forget that. Farm history Stardew Valley tells the story of a boy (or a girl, depending on the gender chosen when creating the character) who, having inherited a farm located in the charming Pelican Town from his grandfather, decides to abandon his city life made up of traffic, office and a lot of stress to devote himself to the land and its fruits. Arriving on site, he finds a disastrous situation: the farm is a shack and the surrounding land is full of stones and weeds. Not wanting to give up, he has nothing left to do but roll up his sleeves and start what will become a thriving agricultural business only after many hours of play. As we said, the Android version of Stardew Valley is essentially identical to the others, with the interface adapted to touch controls that really work perfectly (compatible controllers are however supported). Basically, some functions have been made contextual: for example, to remove weeds or rocks, just click on them and the system will automatically take care of selecting the right tools for the job, or, to give another example, to talk to an inhabitant of Pelican Town just touch it and the protagonist will reach it automatically, starting the dialogue. These apparent little things allow you to get into the game without drama, even if you are used to the traditional control system. The management of the fights is more problematic, which instead pays a lot for the transition to touch controls, so much so that we advise you to use the virtual controller that can be recalled from the game options to face them. The alternative is to go crazy with the manual controls trying not to make mistakes by clicking on the creatures of the mines and on the boxes that allow you to retreat, or set up the automatic combat which however only works halfway, in the sense that the character often stands still to fight without dodge the blows of the enemies, ending up regularly killed. It is true that fighting is not the fulcrum of Stardew Valley, but in the mines there are so many objects and materials that are essential to advance in the game, so it is not possible to ignore it. Gameplay and conversion Having clarified the specific merits and defects of the port of Stardew Valley for mobile systems, the rest can be defined as identical to what has already been seen on other platforms, apart from the absence of multiplayer. Our character has an energy bar, which can be recharged by sleeping and eating, which allows him to perform a certain number of actions during the day, choosing between dedicating himself to agriculture (hoeing, sowing, watering and so on) or breeding , go fishing, tackle the mines, go to the village to talk to the inhabitants, make purchases and carry out small missions, dedicate yourself to furnishing and customizing the farm and much more. Playing time is marked by the passing of days and seasons, which bring specific problems, but also events (festivals, fairs and company) and different products to grow or find. Stardew Valley does a truly exceptional job of slowly opening itself up to the player, i.e. revealing hour after hour that it's much more than it may initially seem. For example, by becoming familiar with the inhabitants, unexpected narrative lines are unlocked, closing others, such as those related to the twelve characters who can be courted to start a family. Furthermore, one soon realizes that it is better to specialize the farm, because it is not possible to dedicate it at the same timente to all the economic activities envisaged by the gaming system. The result is a very high replayability that greatly extends the life of Stardew Valley.", "date": "2019-03-18", "grade": "8.9"}
