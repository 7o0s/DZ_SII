{"name": "Boktai: The Sun in your Hand", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boktai-the-sun-in-your-hand.html", "text": "Tanning in stealth sauce Unlike the aforementioned Metal Gear series, in Boktai the plot has a much less substantial, if not even marginal, role. In fact, the player is called to impersonate Django, a young vampire hunter, in the mission of finding and eliminating the immortal creatures from the kingdom of Istrakan. The adventure, represented through a very pleasant isometric perspective, offers classic elements of the genre alongside other absolutely innovative ones; the exploration phases, the search for chests containing various objects, the fights with monsters and vampires are in fact seasoned by the factor relating to sunlight, and the influence it has on numerous aspects of the gameplay. First of all, it is the fundamental ingredient to be able to get the better of enemies; Django is in fact in possession of the legendary ~Gun del Sol~, a magical weapon that needs light to function. Hence the need to play in the open air, in the sun (that's right, cheating with light bulbs is not possible) to store the energy needed to use your weapon. As long as Django is in open environments, all is well; unfortunately for him however, most of the game takes place inside castles, caves, dungeons, or in any case in places that cannot be reached by light... or almost. Yes, because even in the narrowest manor house or in the dampest cave, there is always the  more or less rare  possibility of finding a terrace, a window, a crack from which some precious rays can filter. Nonetheless, the energy refills of the Gun del Sol, coincidentally, are always too limited, requiring very careful and careful management of the latter. This results in the need to face the game not head-on as in a cheeky action game, but on the contrary carefully trying to avoid direct clashes as much as possible. All this through the stealth elements introduced by Kojima, which in some ways bring the blond hero of Boktai closer to the legendary Metal Gear Snake. Crawling on walls, making noises to deceive enemies, sneaking up secretly are solutions on the agenda in Konami production, therefore intended to reward and encourage a reasoned approach. But the presence of the sun is not only linked to the Gun del Sol; playing during the day is certainly easier than playing at night, which has historically been favorable to nocturnal creatures. Precisely for this reason, the fights are much more accessible during the day, not to mention obligatory on the occasion of the encounter with the vampires to be eliminated. In fact, on such occasions, once the coffin that holds the immortal is reached, it must be dragged outside to the Pile Driver, a structure capable of investing the monster with light and annihilating it forever. The solar riddle However, Boktai's game mechanics are not only linked to the solar factor, although this undoubtedly represents the main cornerstone. In fact, Kojima also wanted to include puzzles, basically divisible into 3 genres: mathematical ones, those with switches and those with speakers. The latter are actually quite classic, requiring you to move various boxes and crates to open the way and continue, perhaps creating a bridge with your own hands or something like that. The puzzles with the switches are also certainly not new, requiring the pressure of special ~tiles~ to unlock doors or raise gates. The positive note lies in the need, more often than not, to use the enemies themselves to press these switches, deceiving them in various ways to their advantage. Finally, the mathematical puzzles require a moment of reflection, requiring some simple logical operation with numbers. Obviously the combination of these 3 kinds of puzzles will not be missing, thus giving all in all a discreet freshness even to an aspect that is not too original in itself. It should also be noted a rather fluctuating level design, capable of offering high-class sections followed by others that are certainly not irresistible. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, Boktai, despite carrying several months of delay in its European publication compared to the Japanese original, proves to be a title of great depth especially from an artistic point of view. In fact, the style is impeccable, both for the characterization of the characters and monsters and for the settings and the use of colors, evocative like few others. Playing Boktai is a real feast for the eyes, as you go from lush green meadows to dark caves, through gloomy manors and snow-white valleys, and so on. The sound is also excellent, especially as regards the perfectly themed musical accompanimentand never intrusive. Comment In the oppressive forest of conversions, remakes and sequels that have always afflicted the GBA soft library, Boktai is a real sigh of relief for every video game lover. Even with the inevitable limits of a structure that imposes the use of the game not on the basis of the player's times but of sunlight, and despite some elements that are perhaps a little too ~classic~, Boktai manages to capture the attention in a unique way, imposing a truly original and appreciable approach. Probably with more character development, an epic story and some gameplay fixes, we would now be talking about a masterpiece. But for anyone who ~settles~ for a great game, Boktai is here. Pros: a truly original approach to a classic formula excellent graphics and sound stimulating and fun Cons: very thin story and poor characterization of the characters puzzles in some cases too trivial Level design not always inspired need to play it at specific times of the day Talking about Hideo Kojima, inevitably, means immediately bringing to mind the Metal Gear series, a true masterpiece of the brilliant Japanese artist. However, although the Solid Snake saga represents the brightest and most evident peak of his career, Kojima has never wanted to limit his creativity only within the aforementioned series, going on the contrary to devise ~parallel~ projects of sure interest. One of these responds to the name of Boktai: The Sun is in your Hand, an atypical action / adventure for GBA characterized by a completely unique solution. Konami's production is in fact based on effective and concrete interaction with the sun, or rather with sunlight, thanks to the presence of a sensor integrated in the cartridge.", "date": "2004-08-29", "grade": null}
