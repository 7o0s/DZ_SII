From this point of view, Star Wars fans can consider themselves lucky, because in the ~Far, Far Galaxy~ they have gladly returned again and again: perhaps in the role of a fighter pilot in the X-Wing and Rogue Squadron series, or armed with blaster and lightsaber in the various Jedi Knights. And yet, if we were to ask an enthusiast what his favorite title is, it is not improbable that Knights of the Old Republic is at the top of his list, BioWare's RPG which from 2003 to today is still considered one of the best role-playing experiences of the last decade, for game mechanics, setting and a system of moral choices and ties with the characters that anticipated in all respects what years later would have been the basis of games such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age. With the half flop of The Old Republic, the online game, fans of the first two KotOR keep their fingers crossed for a possible third chapter, but in the meantime the Texans of Aspyr Media have brought a tablet version of the first and historic episode to the App Store . Heresy? Patience, young padawans. The Force runs strong on iPad One of BioWare's most apt choices was undoubtedly the placement of the game in the Starwarsian timeline: with Knights of the Old Republic, the authors did not limit themselves only to further enriching that enormous tangle of stories, plots and characters that is the Expanded Universe , but they wanted to get as far away as possible from filmic hexalogy in order to have as much decision-making freedom at the narrative level. This is why the story of KotOR takes place 4000 years before the birth of the Galactic Empire, with the player caught in the middle of a huge conflict between the Jedi and the Sith. In the iPad version everything is exactly as we remembered it, for better or for worse, starting from an editor where you can choose the gender, face, class and basic skills of your alter-ego. What follows is a long journey between unknown planets and familiar places (especially the desert of Tatooine), in an attempt to follow the ways of the Force and defeat Darth Malak and his mysterious master, Darth Revan. The moment when the player has to build his first lightsaber is still burned into the memories of all fans, but the variety of environments and the power of the twists and turns will captivate any sci-fi RPG enthusiast. Unless following the dark side and using strength to take advantage of the weakest, the player finds himself interacting with the other characters through long exchanges of jokes, trying to persuade others with words even before with the sword. The points earned by leveling up can then be spent on learning new skills or enhancing those already unlocked, and these range from special attacks or passive bonuses, although the real party begins when you can finally use Jedi powers in combat or to manipulate the mind of the other characters. If KotOR has remained virtually identical in content for ten years now, the only real novelty of this iPad version concerns the touchscreen control system. The interface has remained quite similar, with some buttons enlarged and moved to be more easily accessible, but fortunately Aspyr Media has preferred not to adopt the usual virtual stick, opting for a more intuitive solution: you can move forward or rotate the camera by dragging your finger respectively up or to the side anywhere on the screen, while just tapping objects and enemies to interact with them. Obviously this is a system not up to the pad or mouse and keyboard, and the walking animation now appears a little less natural, but the turn-based combat and the generally slow pace of the game make everything absolutely enjoyable even on a keyless platform. In fact, the interaction via touchscreen proves to be perfect when you need to navigate the menus or select the actions to be performed during the clashes, suffering just in a couple of screens that for some strange decision have very small icons. But how much has KotOR aged in the last ten years? Also in this case the charm of the various planets brings the final result upwards, but the BioWare game now shows many wrinkles in purely graphic terms. However, the soundtrack remains immense, the result of the union between the historical themes of John Williams and the interpretation of Jeremy Soule, an absolutely stellar pairing for a video game set in the Star Wars universe. In closing, a note ona localization of the game: in his journey from one planet to another, the player will come into contact with a whole series of different species, including Twi'lek, Rodian, Wookie and Tusken raiders; unless you know the individual alien dialects, we recommend brushing up on your English, as Italian seems to have fallen into disuse in the last ten years. Obi-Wan would say ~an elegant RPG, for more civilized times~", "date": "2013-06-07", "grade": "8.5"}
