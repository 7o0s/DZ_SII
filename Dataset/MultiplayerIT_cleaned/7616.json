Undoubtedly the release of a big shot, one of the most important aces up Nintendo's sleeve, would have allowed the new Kyoto home console to live these first months of life in a less breathless way, without that performance anxiety (of sales and games) which is questioning its future. It would have been nice, for sure; however, the most important things take time, and patience has never been a problem for Nintendo fans. To make the wait less difficult, however, a remake arrives, in that recycling work that is not always able to particularly excite users hungry for novelty. In this case, however, we are talking about The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and if the idea does not add even an extra beat to your heart rate, you probably have something wrong. Isolated More than ten years have now passed since the Gamecube debut of what is undoubtedly the most controversial episode of the Link saga, developed with the weight on the shoulders of having to deal with the previous Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. What is certain is that Nintendo put his own into it, because the graphic style of The Wind Waker was revealed when by now everyone had gotten used to it and prepared to be faced with the evolution of the by now infamous tech demo of Space World 2000, characterized by dark colors and a decidedly adult look. And instead a year later, at the next edition of the same event, Miyamoto showed up with a cel-shaded Zelda, very colorful, fresh, ~childish~, and created to ~extend the series to all ages~ (cit.). The reactions were polarized between those who appreciated the turning point and those who hated it, going so far as to propose petitions and boycotts to make Nintendo retrace its steps. It goes without saying that none of this happened until the release in shops and, despite the perfect score of Famitsu and the good response from critics, The Wind Waker ended up being a disappointment in terms of sales, with numbers very distant from those of the aforementioned Ocarina of Time and the subsequent Twilight Princess. But you know, time is a gentleman, and over the years the hatred of the most ardent fans has subsided to leave room at least for appreciation in the face of the charm of a courageous, imperfect, but also unique episode and precisely for this reason clearly distinguishable from the rest of the Link epic. That The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD on Wii U is a filler in anticipation (hopefully) of the fireworks coming soon, it is quite evident; nonetheless, the overall result of this remake is not only pleasant from the point of view of that bittersweet taste of the ~good old days~ that often distinguishes nostalgia operations, but on the contrary surprising precisely because of the extraordinary modernity of a product that carries on its back more than ten springs. Think about it: how many games of the same age could you pick up again today without feeling the weight of time? Which you could enjoy from start to finish, as if you were back in that time when Microsoft bought Rare, the Game Boy Advance SP came on the market, and Nokia attempted the N-Gage adventure? Because, let's be clear, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD is in terms of content the same game as then, with only a few more or less incisive welcome corrections. But there are no new dungeons, no new islands, no additional quests or plot overhauls. It's the same thrilling adventure, to be enjoyed in equal measure whether it's the first time or a return aboard King Drakar. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD is, quite simply, a show Splendid shining However, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD is not a listless and hasty, or worse affected, remake, and it only takes a few moments to understand it, the time necessary to take the first steps on the Primula Island of a Link who is still unaware of his epic destiny . There are four magic words: 16:9, texture, lighting, 1080p. This is the formula through which the team in charge of restoring luster to the original has managed to package a product which, without touching the polygonal complexity, appears aesthetically simply wonderful today, Anno Domini 2013. Of course, we start from a certain level base, and in many ways extremely inclined not to suffer too much from the passage of time; the use of cel shading, the stylized look, the cartoonish appearance and the bright colors imply a stylistic solution that is not subject to the logic of the technical exercisemuscular, but rather to those of artistic quality in the simplicity of the beautiful. Because The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD is just that: beautiful, from every angle you look at it. The widescreen format allows you to expand and give breathing space to the settings, whether these are inside a dungeon or - even better - in the colorful mini-world of the islets or even in the fabulous blue of the sea to be sailed aboard the small talking boat. The completely renewed textures and more vibrant colors add detail and cleanliness, eliminating any kind of technical brake to the original idea of Aonuma and its extraordinary artists. The lighting, the factor most talked about and feared by fans of the original, doesn't actually involve any kind of drama; on the contrary, it contributes to making the game world more alive, solid and realistic, with the setting and the objects that compose it which finally produce dynamic shadows based on the position of the sun or the light source. Even during boss battles you can enjoy the importance of this element, but any description in words would not be able to do justice to the work done by Nintendo: you have to face Gohma for the first time to understand what we are talking about. The bloom effect, much reviled in the forums, also didn't seem out of place at all; perhaps just a trifle excessive, but these are really details that don't even remotely deserve the rivers of virtual ink spent by detractors. And finally the 1080p, full HD at 30 frames per second which allow you to enjoy an impeccable and exhilarating cleanliness and definition of the image. Graphically, The Wind Waker HD is a game that never ceases to amaze: poetic, evocative, brilliant, exciting. Setting sail with the boat, hoisting the sail, leaving behind the island you have just visited and observing the sun setting at the bottom of the horizon is a scene that undoubtedly represents a point in favor of those who find elements of contact between art and the videogame. I'll fix you Although the contents of the original, as mentioned above, have not been affected, this does not mean that everything has remained unchanged. Aonuma has in fact taken the opportunity both to perfect some aspects, and to intelligently exploit the greater technical capabilities of Wii U. We can speak very well of The Wind Waker, but it certainly cannot be said that it was a Zelda without defects; for example the exploratory phase of the sea, more than necessary in large portions of the plot, became tedious to the point of exhaustion due to the slowness of the boat, but above all due to the need to continuously change the direction of the wind by playing the appropriate melody with the baton and enjoying its animation. To remedy this objective problem, the new fast sail has been added which can be purchased, after passing the first dungeon, in the auction house on the island of Taura. Unfortunately, the fact that its existence and availability is not clearly expressed makes its obtaining far from certain by less informed or ~curious~ players. A pity, because the ability to move twice as fast and with the wind always in your favor is a convenience that literally (positively) transforms the gaming experience. And the mission of collecting the pieces of the Triforce near the end of the game has also been rethought, requiring only 3 instead of 8 to be recovered. remake of a ten-year-old game uses the Wii U controller more convincingly than many other current titles. The fact is that the touch screen allows you to act quickly through the menus without ever having to pause the game or interrupt the action; in detail it is therefore possible to manage and modify the objects in Link's inventory by dragging them onto the association with the dedicated keys, consult the map of the dungeons or the sea and play the melodies directly by touching the display. Obviously there is the option to transfer the entire off screen action to the GamePad, simply by pressing the ~minus~ key. More generally, the interface has been optimized, making it more pleasant and functional, thus limiting the need to continuously move objects from the equipment; in this sense we appreciate the use of the digital cross to recall the wand and, at sea, the cannon and the recovery hook, thus making them always immediately available. In the first person mode, then, useful using the bow, boomerang or grappling hook, you can move freely, as introduced by Skyward Sword. News also on the Miiverse front, which in fact replaces the Tingle Tuner which in the original used the colligament with the GBA; in this case you can instead leave messages in bottles that other users will be able to retrieve randomly during their adventure. Images taken with the Picto Box, which now contains up to 12, can also be shared, and Link in front of the lens can also appear in four different expressions associated with the directions of the stick. The audio department, remastered at high quality, and the Heroic mode, which can be activated from the first game or at any time and which increases the overall difficulty of the game, conclude the list of substantial innovations.", "date": "2013-09-18", "grade": "9.4"}
