{"name": "Bravely Default 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bravely-default-2-recensione.html", "text": "Bravely Default II had a difficult task: to repeat the success of its predecessor, projecting the series produced by Tomoya Asano into the Nintendo Switch generation. The first Bravely Default, however, came out in a particularly congenial period and on the most appropriate console, when there was a hunger for old school JRPGs and the charm of nostalgia, which today seems even too much, was instead a courageous and experimental approach. The developer Claytechworks therefore found himself with a hot potato in his hands and what, at a rough guess, appears to be a reduced budget compared to the past. The business card was not the most promising and the first hours of the game had left us chilly, but we are happy to anticipate that, as we will tell you in the Bravely Default 2 review, it managed to successfully pass our test: it is not the JRPG brilliant that we would have liked, but it's a little gem that fans should definitely consider. Tale of four heroes We completed Bravely Default II in about 50 hours, facing the first two chapters of the game on Normal difficulty and the rest on Easy difficulty. We have completed almost every side quest we could find in the world map and in the cities, we have opened every chest in every dungeon and unlocked every class. And in these 50 hours, unfortunately, the plot of Bravely Default II has never really taken off: it has been followed, even with a certain interest, but has never reached memorable heights. It's not a bad story, mind you; on the contrary, it is clear and targeted, it does not get lost in subplots that smack of filler and focuses on the initial premise until the end, with the four protagonists intent on wandering around the world of Excillant in search of crystals that not only keep nature in balance, but they also wield the power necessary to prevent a catastrophic threat. Bravely Default II: The Four Heroes of the Light. The story of the main campaign is, more than anything, in the service of the gameplay, and is only partially committed to characterizing the protagonists and their enemies - Adam, we're thinking of you - who often respect the most established clichs of the genre. To get to know them better, understand their motivations and the backgrounds that move them, especially in the case of certain antagonists who seem almost extras in the story, you have to complete the optional side missions: many of them delve into barely hinted storylines through dialogues, small cinematics and real flashbacks that intertwine two generations of heroes and rivals, painting a more complete and interesting picture of Excillant. The direction does not shine for technicalities or inventiveness, therefore the merit of the narrative goes above all to the Italian localization - impeccable and well-kept, thanks to the use of a higher linguistic register than usual - and the beautiful soundtrack composed by Revo , which enhances the most touching moments of the tale with its extraordinary instrumental variety. Bravely Default II: Adelle as the Monk. Claytechworks has done what it could, but it is evident that Square Enix has not delivered a particularly high budget into the hands of Asano, and it is especially noticeable in the technical flaws such as the small slowdowns that occur when browsing the menu pages or during the visually combats more elaborate, especially if you keep the speed of the animations at maximum. The uploads are fast but frequent, and sometimes they detach the cinematics that should be in continuity, slowing down the pace of the narrative and gameplay. Despite these angularities, Bravely Default II has a nice glance, especially in close-up shots that highlight the beautiful textures on the 3D models: of course we can discuss the character design, a hybrid between chibi and realism that can arouse mixed feelings, but the meticulous details and particle effects embellish the fights and some scenarios, especially towards the end of the game, are simply breathtaking. Furthermore, the game performs very well both with the console in the Dock and in portability: there are practically no noteworthy differences. An old school facility Bravely Default II: A Story Scene. The problem lies in the fact that the aforementioned side missions are extremely trivial. You'll find them in cities and outdoors - and the day/night cycle affects their appearance, so you'll have to revisit the same locations - and more often than not they'll make you go back and forth to dungeons, cities or regions of the map you've already explored to collect collectibles, defeat enemies, or deliver key items to NPCs. It's a coming and going that can get repetitive and tiring, but it comes backpense in most cases are worth the effort, especially when it comes to very useful equipment or consumables such as Orbs that increase the experience of characters or classes. Aware that accumulating experience points may be necessary for progression - and experimentation - the Claytechworks guys have implemented these consumables that help players with less time available to collect points without fighting for hours and hours. Bravely Default II: The city of Halcionya. For this reason, the consumables in question are not only found in chests or by completing certain side missions, but also by sending a ship on a mission that we will unlock at the beginning of the adventure. The service is accessible in every city and continues, for up to twelve hours, not only while we play, but also when the console is in stand-by. Alternatively, you can simply fight every enemy that blocks your way in the dungeons, perhaps using baits to face more battles in sequence and earn more bonus experience points. Bravely Default II, in this sense, follows the formula of more traditional JRPGs: you arrive in the city, continue the story by interacting with key NPCs, discover the new goal to reach, which is usually a dungeon, and explore the labyrinth on turn, defeating or avoiding enemies until it's the boss' turn. Not all dungeons stand out for their level design: some are really dull, while others, which perhaps require you to solve some nice environmental puzzles, are much more intriguing. Bravely Default II: Bernard owns the Thief's Asterisk. Fortunately, Claytechworks has implemented a series of mechanisms, such as teleportation checkpoints, and collectibles, such as Telelites and Tents, which help to face these challenges more serenely. Let's say that the bulk of Bravely Default II is represented precisely by the dungeons and the combat system: it is a structure that does its duty without standing out for its inventiveness, but which reserves some nice surprises such as the B&D minigame... which also serves to unlock the Gambler class. Clearly inspired by the Triple Triad and the Tetra Master of Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy IX, B&D is a cross between a card game and Japanese Go: to win a game you need to conquer as many squares as possible on a chessboard, using a deck made up of a up to six cards featuring different characters or monsters. Each card has its own characteristics and some cards can literally change the rules of a game. Once you have unlocked B&D, you will be able to challenge some inhabitants and, with a little skill, take their cards to improve your deck and rank up. Bravely Default II: One fight. In terms of content, in short, Bravely Default II is what a fan would expect from a new episode of this series: between optional dungeons, side missions in abundance and secrets to discover, there is a lot of meat in the fire for those looking for a rich JRPG and long-lived that easily exceeds the 50 hours useful for seeing only the final screen. We don't want to give you anything away, but let's just say that... once the credits roll, that's it, the game doesn't end there. There is a narrative trick in full Bravely tradition: the adventure continues by reloading the last save, and some interesting challenges are unlocked in the world to face, which reward the player's efforts and strategic skills with new skills and excellent equipment that will allow to further maximize each individual class. The Job System strikes again Bravely Default II: Elvis casts a Black Magician spell. Not that Bravely Default II calls them Jobs: in the game they are simply ~classes~, kept in the mysterious artifacts known as Asterisks, but the inspiration is once again Final Fantasy and some of them are unmistakable. The Dragon, the White and Black Magician, but also the Red one, with skills and spells such as Salto, Curaga or Aeroga, are the legacy of the historic Square Enix brand, and classes that we have already seen in Bravely Default and Bravely Second. Bravely Default II, in this sense, takes a little more distance, with a roster that includes about twenty classes, some of which are completely new. The roles may appear redundant at first glance: the spiritual Master is nothing more than a White Magician specialized in regeneration spells, but in reality it is enough to scroll through the list of passive skills that are unlocked by growing each class with a little more attention to realize the incredible variety of combinations and synergies that grants the gameplay of the game signed Claytechworks. Bravely Default II: the city of Savalon. Yes, there are fewer classes than in Bravely Second, but in general the ones in Bravely Default II seemed more balanced and better designed, with a greater variety of passive skills to learn to customize each Hero of Light (up to five can be equipped passive skills learned, regardless of which class the character is using). Furthermore, each class is characterized by two specializations - one available from the beginning, the other which is unlocked at level 12 - which give the character further bonuses depending on the class set as primary, while the secondary grants access to an additional set of skills. The possible combinations are many. You can take Elvis and turn him into a Pittomancer, a new class that ~paints~ enemies to debuff them, giving him the Bard as a secondary class, for example, who instead boosts the party with his songs. Or viceversa. Bravely Default II: Adam vs. Sloan in a cinematic. The best thing to do is to grow all the classes a bit and combine the passive skills together, taking them from here and there. For example, the Red Wizard's magical Agony passive lets you critically hit spells, the Spectre's Critical Amplifier increases critical damage by 30%, and the Infernal Swordsman's Ultimate Power passive causes damage to exceed the cap of 9999 Put them together in the arsenal of a deadly Arcanist, target an enemy vulnerable to a certain element and the result will be crackling, to say the least. In short, Bravely Default II invites you to experiment and grow multiple classes, even completely different ones, with each character, but also to micro-manage the equipment, thanks to the introduction of a new parameter that could give you quite a few headaches: the weight. Bravely Default II: Anihal owns the Tamer's Asterisk. Each item has a certain weight that usually depends on its category: armor that increases physical defense is usually the heaviest, while clothing that increases magical defense is lightest, and so on. Each character can carry a certain weight which depends on the primary class and the equipment worn, so you will have to play with the equipment to find the perfect balance for your needs. A key will allow you to automatically equip the objects that the artificial intelligence deems best for the primary class used, but it goes without saying that your specific reasoning will make the difference. Nothing prevents you from overloading a character, armoring him from head to toe, but this will slow down the increase in his ATB gauge during fights. Borrowed from the old Final Fantasy, this indicator marks the turns and suggests the order in which your characters will be able to act in the immediate future. Bravely Default II: The Victory Screen. Theoretically, a less protected character moves faster and acts more often, but don't forget that you can influence ATB and slow enemies with the Oracle's time spells. In short, the combat system is a real joy. In our test a few weeks ago, we had complained about a certain initial rigidity, especially in the face of the first unlocked classes, completely similar to those already seen and revised in the previous Bravely and in the old Final Fantasy. The following hours proved us wrong and, above all, enjoyed it very much: in this sense, even the difficulty finds a greater balance, once the first bosses are overcome - which are decidedly unbalanced - and you learn more skills without even ~grinding~ too much. Bravely Default II is a challenging title even at Easy level, and from Normal up the clashes become even more strategic. Enemies tend to use the peculiar Brave/Default system in an ingenious and lethal way, especially the bosses who can exterminate the entire party in one turn if we get our calculations wrong. Bravely Default II: Heroes of the Light face a boss. However, the need to try some clashes and then having to close the software and load the save to be able to face them more prepared remains in question. The vulnerability system is very important: some enemies halve the damage inflicted by certain weapons or spells, perhaps counterattack some types of actions by surprise, forcing us to review our strategy and, in some cases, to grow the appropriate classes, especially at the levels of higher difficulties. In these cases, mastering the Brave/Default system is only useful up to a point. For the uninitiated, this particular mechanism allows you to accumulate turns by putting a character in defense", "date": "2021-02-25", "grade": "8.0"}
