In the game you controlled a cyborg, with the possibility of gradually unlocking new components and then installing them, changing the protagonist's arms and legs in order to use different weapons and attacks against enemies. The Fusion Heroes formula recalls that type of approach, although the mobile game developed by Boarding Party Games belongs to a very different genre, that of strategy. In a distant future, where humanity has died out under the blows of the machines, robots fight for supremacy using rifles, lasers, missiles and minions, in a sort of eternal arena where duels are the order of the day. Our mechanical alter ego wants to pave his way to power, and to do so he will have to face five missions of increasing difficulty, which change randomly after a certain number of minutes. Each presents opponents of different grades and abilities, which alternate in a deadly sequence, to be completed counting on a single health bar and on the equipment selected on the basis of the prizes obtained up to that point: new rifles, missiles of different type, but also three types of ~minions~ that we will be able to release on the battlefield to neutralize those sent by the enemy or to damage him directly. Robot Fury During the clashes of Fusion Heroes our character is located on the left side of the screen, the enemy on duty on the right side, while at the top the interface clearly shows the residual vital energy of both. The fire system is very particular: there is a reticle aimed constantly at the enemy and it is possible to open fire simply by touching it, but to inflict a decent amount of damage you need to make sure that the touch takes place when a floating indicator collides with the viewfinder. There are different types: the standard ones are yellow, the red ones temporarily stun the opponent, while the purple ones must be ~broken~ to destroy the shields. The ability of the enemy to do the same naturally depends on his degree of skill, and this is why before tackling high-profile missions it is good to select the best available equipment among the very numerous unlocked objects belonging to different categories. Each of them can be upgraded and replaced through a quick crafting procedure which, however, uses the game's precious currency, diamonds: fortunately, they can also be obtained without spending real money. By changing the armor and weapons, the appearance of our robot will change at the same time, which at regular intervals will also be able to unload a barrage of missiles towards the target or activate three different types of minions. By default these are medium speed units, a single more resistant and slower robot or a rowdy group of speedsters, to be released when the enemy does the same, so as to avoid taking damage; or to increase the emphasis of the attacks and score a powerful coup de grace. The result is frenetic and fun gameplay, even if rather limited in terms of depth and variety: the clashes are very similar to each other, difficulty aside, and the unlocking of new missions does not bring real fresh air into the game. experience. The beautiful pixel art graphics and the rock soundtrack are in any case a valid incentive to download Fusion Heroes, which can be played for free without any problems.", "date": "2018-05-15", "grade": "7.0"}
