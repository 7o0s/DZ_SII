Often at the least opportune moment, that is, when one has finally grown fond of all the protagonists. It is now time that even the events related to Reisalin Stout - for friends Ryza - have an end, answering a whole series of questions left open in the first two chapters, especially from the second. In this regard, it is advisable that you retrieve the review of Atelier Ryza 2, obviously already present on our pages, since it is certainly more exhaustive than the summary video prepared by the developers in the initial menu of the third chapter. We were a bit fearful about this latest adventure, as published shortly after the previous chapter. Since Ryza was now a highly appreciated character by both Eastern and Western audiences, there was inevitably a bit of a risk of a mere ~additional~ chapter, which carried on the plot left open without major additions to the gameplay, already very refined. of the series. However, these fears turned out to be completely unfounded. In the review of Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key, which we played on PlayStation 5, we will try to explain the importance of two words in the title: End and Key, or End and Key. If the first is self-explanatory, the second constitutes the heart of several news worthy of attention. Plot: The last adventure to save the world And here is the well-known protagonist of Atelier Ryza 3 Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key is to the Gust trilogy as Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a great, majestic adventure - quantitatively and qualitatively - the last piece of a series that has been growing from many points of view. Just think of the plot itself: from the origins of the clumsy and fearless protagonist who, despite dangers greater than her, managed to save her native village, to the more mature Ryza grappling with life in the capital of the kingdom; and now from the latter to the heroine who will even have to save the world before an imminent catastrophe. We also told you about the narrative premises in the trial stage: basically, on Kurken Island, additional islands never seen before begin to appear, no one knows why, which literally materialize out of nowhere. But it is only the tip of the iceberg, because upstream there is a greater danger, which involves the power of the alchemists and of course the parallel world which had been mentioned several times in the previous chapters (the abominable monsters known as Philuscha actually came from there). Ryza, it goes without saying, is the predestined. A mysterious voice suddenly appears in her mind, cryptically suggesting that it will be an Alchemist who will intervene to restore balance. The protagonist is therefore the ~key~ to everything, not only metaphorically, since this very voice dictates to her the recipe for giving life to a Magic Key, the matrix for the subsequent creation of many other keys that will play a fundamental role (in short, a ~key role~) also in gameplay. Let's not anticipate too many narrative implications, but rest assured that many well-known faces (practically all, via) from the previous chapters will also return to Atelier Ryza 3. This will in fact be Ryza's last adventure, ~the last summer~, an aspect on which the narration itself insists several times. And finally the relationships between many characters will consolidate (who said Tao and Patricia?), as well as many other characters (see the case of Bos) will develop clearly once and for all. Gameplay: ~play your Key, Ryza~ The real big news of Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key consists of the keys, usable in battle (and even outside) It was not an easy task to renew and at the same time consolidate an already effective gameplay like the one seen in Atelier Ryza 2. We were therefore honestly amazed at the level reached by the developers: after a couple of fights in Ryza 3, the previous chapter already looked very slower than we remembered. Indeed, the main innovations concern the battles, while the alchemical system (crafting, in short) has remained almost unchanged, apart from the use of the keys which we will talk about shortly. The fights, in Atelier Ryza 3, are even more immediate and immersive compared to the past, starting with the (not obvious) detail of the absence of any transition between exploration and struggle. You enter battle immediately and from there on the classic gameplay based on simple attacks, parries, special attacks linked to the progressive accumulation of AP (Attack Points). As in the past, three party members can fight at the same time (and the player can seamlessly switch between controlling one and the other); but it is also possible to continuously exchange the character in our possession with one of those ~on the bench~, after waiting for a certain recharge period. The bonuses offered by Atelier Ryza 3 keys in combat are multiple On these elements, all in all simple to understand, Atelier Ryza 3 then grafts a series of mechanics which, taken as a whole, make each battle much more tactical and frenetic than it might seem at a superficial glance. For example, the level of synergy between party members grows as they fight, along with the constant accumulation of AP; moreover, the companions intervene with special abilities if we are able to satisfy certain requirements (for example: to score with a physical or ranged blow); not counting the ~final moves~, of great spectacularity. The real novelty consists in the use of the keys in combat. Continuing in the story, Ryza will always be able to unlock new ones, some of which have truly devastating powers. Some keys can increase the damage of certain weapons for a certain number of seconds, so the player must carefully study which character must obtain that particular bonus at a given moment. Others simply can multiply AP dramatically, allowing you to perform very powerful combos against unsuspecting enemies. The keys are essential above all to defeat bosses and enemies of the more advanced areas: to get the better of these opponents it will be necessary not only to level up and create more powerful weapons (as in Ryza 2), but also to fully master the mechanics of the keys. The ultimate adventure Alchemy in Atelier Ryza 3 is pretty much as we remembered it (keys aside) Atelier Ryza 3 is truly the definitive adventure of the young Alchemist. The speech related to the fights, clearly improved and deepened compared to the past, could easily be linked to many other aspects of the production. The game world, for example, is simply immense. Not only would the first Ryza not compare, but also the map of Ryza 2 constitutes only a small part of what you will see in Ryza 3, in which among other things it is possible to ~fly~ with minimal loads from one part of the continent, even in regions that were barely mentioned in the previous chapters. To avoid the danger of getting lost, the indicators (on the screen and on the map) are much clearer than in the past; moreover, points of interest have been introduced (monuments, panoramic points and more) which guarantee rapid movement. Not that animals are missing to move quickly, but here we are talking about extensions of the map that are really excessive for those who proceed on foot; and yet it will be necessary to proceed, to collect the innumerable resources linked to alchemy. Maybe that's why Ryza can now pick them up even while running: everything is faster, leaner and more efficient than in the past. Compared to the first two chapters, the world of Atelier Ryza 3 is really huge The side quest system has also been revised: now timed events can suddenly appear on the map, based on the player's exploration. However, they are very often very monotonous tasks, such as eliminating a certain number of enemies or delivering resources to a specific inhabitant. Their function is to somehow make an otherwise very static game world come alive. Lastly, we could spend hours and hours talking to you about alchemy, but precisely: the latter has remained, even visually, linked to the highly efficient Atelier Ryza 2 system. The keys here are especially useful for increasing the quality of elements to be synthesized; the improvements are there, mind you, but paradoxically - compared to the enormity of everything else - they seem rather negligible. Your task is to become skilled alchemists.", "date": "2023-03-23", "grade": "8.5"}
