{"name": "Rayman Raving Rabbids - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids-recensione_a.html", "text": "Believe it or not, these are the premises of Rayman: Raving Rabbids, the first party game for Wii that now arrives on Xbox 360 with the necessary differences. The most marked is the obvious absence of the particular Nintendo controller, but on Xbox 360 as well as with the joypad we will be able to play with the Xbox 360 Live Vision, the Microsoft web cam. The declared objective of the developers was to try to create a good amount of irreverent mini-games (there are over 70 in total) that wink at a young audience. Of the previous Rayman titles, Raving Rabbids retains only the protagonist: no platform sections and the like, therefore, but only and exclusively minigames, which can be faced in a story mode intended for a single user or in multiplayer in the scoring mode. As it is easy to imagine, the single player section is little more than a gimmick to unlock the various stages and make them available for free use, but everything works very well: the narrow but still present plot keeps the progress of the action alive through some nice cutscenes, while the various mini-games follow one another with good rhythm and variety. The big news of the Xbox 360 version is the compatibility with Xbox Live Vision! The adventure is divided into blocks, each of which consists of four stages, but it is enough to complete three of them to be able to move on to the following fraction. As we said, there are about seventy minigames, a decidedly considerable amount especially in relation to the general good workmanship and variety of the same: despite some inevitable repetition of mechanics, the work of the Ubisoft developers is certainly commendable, as well as that of the designers for having given birth to such adorable and at the same time delusional creatures such as the Rabbids who populate every single scenario. Giving an idea of the various mini-games of the product is not easy, considering how they differ significantly from each other in gameplay and in the way in which they exploit the control system. It is therefore necessary to proceed by giving some examples: the player will therefore find himself running to deliver an explosive package; again, it may happen that you have to spray the Rabbids with carrot juice; the joypad is then used to trace the silhouette of a particular food to be fed to a rabbit, or used as a lasso in a variation of the hammer throw where the instrument consists of a cow tied to a chain; again, we'll be using the keys to the rhythm of the music in some stages loosely inspired by products like Dance Dance Revolution. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of a multitude of minigames that are amusing in their mechanics but absolutely hilarious due to the presence of the Rabbids, who with their vacant looks and their senseless screams manage to elicit more than a few healthy laughs. To crown it all, there are special stages placed at the end of each block, mainly of two types: authentic (and very fun) shooter-style sections with light guns a la Time Crisis, in which you shoot plungers at the Rabbids, or of the bizarre races on horseback of warthogs. The big news, as previously mentioned, is given by the possibility of managing some types of minigames, unfortunately not all, through movements recognized and encoded by the Xbox 360 Live Vision. Before starting an event we will be able to choose whether to take part with the joypad or using the camera, to choose we will not have to do anything but press the A button on the joypad or have the Live Vision recognize the movement of our right hand. A further and subsequent screen will see us appear on video with the reference points indicated in the foreground that will be taken into consideration by the ~camera~ of the Microsoft house, our hands and the body, suggesting the best position to the gamer. In practice, during the game sections we will find ourselves rotating one of the two hands, for example to throw one of the cows caught in the lasso, or shake them with timing during the dance sessions in which Rayman will go wild among the rabbits. Overall, the experiment is fun and fairly well done, the recognition of movements is not always perfect (even external light sources can influence the ~little room~, so watch out for the windows if you play during the day) but the ability to manage the mini-games in this way it is undoubtedly a pleasant and fun variation from the usual pressing of keys. Entertainment > Graphics Original and fun Rayman: Raving Rabbids, however, will certainly not be remembered for its graphic design. Although stylistically the Ubisoft work is worthy of praise (as already mentioned, the Rabbids are truly anthology), on a purely technical level the title pays a hugemultiplatform nature and the fact of being born with Nintendo hardware in mind, and from a technical point of view this is certainly not a help. Here we can see our ~eggplant with ears~ in high definition, but as even the most inexperienced will know, high definition guarantees better image quality but in the case of a mediocre product the defects catch the eye. Certainly the daughter of the multiplatform nature of the product, it is still difficult to forgive obvious limits to Rayman's cosmetics: Raving Rabbids such as the flatness of the light effects and just sufficient textures with even a little aliasing and flickering in some situations. Fortunately, the situation is resolved by the goodness of most of the animations and the never too praised humorous charge of the Rabbids. The psychotic rabbits are the real stars of the game, with their syncopated movements and delirious clothing: whole hordes of Rabbids run around the screen dressed as divers, cowboys, aliens, even Sam Fisher, throwing plungers at the player and screaming continuously and often for no reason. Precisely in this regard, another note of merit of the game is the sound sector, not only for the hilarious cries of the rabbits, but also for the spot-on musical selection (among the many, there are versions of ~La Bamba~, ~ Misirlou and Girls Just Wanna Have Fun), which serves as a great accompaniment to the fast-paced gameplay. Multi-rabbit Contrary to what might be expected, the multiplayer part of Rayman: Raving Rabbids is not particularly elaborate, and indeed would have definitely deserved some more attention given that it also lacks a section that takes advantage of online gaming on Xbox Live. First of all, it is not possible to engage in tournaments or similar activities, but only and exclusively to face the mini-games one by one, choosing them through menus which are not always very clear. Furthermore, not all stages are oriented towards the action of several players simultaneously: some are limited to two users, while others must be used in turns, causing a slight drop in the fun factor due to the absence of direct competition. That said, Rayman: Raving Rabbids still remains a good multiplayer title, perhaps a little incomplete but certainly capable of giving anyone moments of healthy fun, thanks to the great simplicity of almost all minigames. The novelty consisting of the possibility of playing via the Xbox 360 Live Vision could arouse a certain appeal in the most curious player but certainly not worth the purchase of the Ubisoft title on its own. Xbox 360 goals Like all Xbox 360 titles, even on Rayman Raving Rabbids we will be able to unlock objectives, up for grabs there are 1000 points, divided into 16 targets. Not being many, it will take some time to be able to fully satisfy the requests of the programmers. A part of the objectives is dedicated to the story mode, such as unlocking all the different types of Rayman or completing the adventure, while others are focused on the score challenges that require certain amounts in exchange for the points up for grabs. Comment Rayman: Raving Rabbids is paradoxically a party game that shows a few more limits in the multiplayer environment, while remaining on good levels and ensuring a high fun factor. The lack of the controller for which the game was born is felt, using the Xbox 360 joypad is not the same thing and the possibility of using the Xbox Live Vision is just a mere ~sweet~, fun, but certainly it doesn't tip the balance so much that it alone deserves the purchase of the Ubisoft title. Moreover, the considerable quantity and variety of mini-games, combined with the hilarious psychosis of the rabbits protagonists of the game, certainly makes this new title of the ~eggplant with ears~ deserve at least a few test sessions, if then you are surrounded by friends who love mini-games then don't let him get away. Pros Original and fun Compatible with Xbox Live Vision Absolutely hilarious rabbids Cons Technically questionable No Xbox Live support After years and years of honorable career spent saving the world, Rayman can finally enjoy some peace, and think well of organizing a nice picnic with his little Globox friends. Suddenly, however, the earth shakes under their feet and bizarre rabbits emerge from the subsoil, making Rayman's snack companions disappear one by one. Without even time to react, our hero is kidnapped and thrown into an arena, from which there is only one way to escape: by completing a series of minigames...", "date": "2007-04-19", "grade": null}
