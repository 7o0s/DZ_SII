{"name": "Yakuza Kiwami", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-kiwami-recensione-xbox-one.html", "text": "The review of Yakuza Kiwami for Xbox One arrives a few days after the release of the game on the Microsoft console, available at no additional cost for Xbox Game Pass subscribers as part of an agreement, the one between the Redmond house and SEGA, which is giving great satisfaction to fans of Japanese productions. Xbox users who were able to take on the role of Kazuma Kiryu for the first time just a few months ago, thanks to the launch of the splendid prequel Yakuza 0, therefore have the opportunity to relive the debut of the series, which took place on PlayStation 2 back in 2005, with an episode that seen today stands as the shortest and most concise of the entire franchise, but which in the form of this valuable remake can still guarantee a campaign lasting about twenty hours . Setting The story of Yakuza Kiwami takes place in Tokyo, in the fictitious district of Kamurocho: it is October 1, 1995 and Kazuma Kiryu, rising star of the Tojo Clan, is arrested for murder. In reality it is not he who pulled the trigger, but decides to take the blame for what happened to protect the other people involved in the accident, his close friend Akira ~Nishiki~ Nishikiyama and the girl he has feelings for, Yumi Sawamura Expelled from the organization, Kazuma serves ten years in prison but when he comes out many things have changed: Yumi has disappeared, Akira has changed profoundly and the clan ends up in the eye of the storm after the theft of 10 billion yen from its coffers and the 'killing of the third president, Masaru Sera. With a large target on his back, weakened after many years behind bars but determined to get answers, the former Dragon of the Dojima therefore moves in the district that saw him grow, grappling with missions related to the main story (interspersed with cutscenes of excellent quality as well as characterized by an effective and engaging cinematographic narration) but also various collateral assignments, which are used by the authors to ease the tension and allow us to virtually visit the red light districts of Tokyo, notoriously controlled by the Yakuza, also trying our hand at with many extra activities: from the SEGA Club game rooms, in this case poorer than usual, to the billiard or bowling rooms, passing through the fun competitions of the Pocket Circuit and the hostess clubs, where we can try to win over the girls by pronouncing the phrases right. The version of Kamurocho that can be visited in Yakuza Kiwami is obviously less sophisticated than the last chapters of the series, access to the shops still requires a very short load and is therefore not integrated into the open world, but all the aspects that make of this action game a tremendously fascinating experience. In fact, we will be able to go to any restaurant and order food to recover energy and gain experience points, stroll through the busiest streets of the city, entertain ourselves for hours with the numerous collateral activities available and activate even a first-person view to get an even clearer feeling of involvement. Gameplay There are many innovations that Yakuza Kiwami introduces compared to the original version of the game, both in terms of structure (see the addition of various secondary missions) and in terms of gameplay, substantially improved in terms of mechanics and facets, following the example of the last chapters for PlayStation 3. The combat system, in particular, inherits the styles seen in Yakuza 0 and therefore allows Kazuma to switch between different positions according to needs, going from Brawler (traditional combos, close to the character's classic style) to Beast (great resistance, automatic hooking to all blunt objects) and Rush (great speed, with instantaneous dodges and flurries of punches), to finally arrive at the traditional Dragon style. Each preset boasts a different skill tree, which can be scaled by unlocking various upgrades (from increased health to increased attack power, extra moves and spectacular finishers) based on the experience points earned. A system that it is exploited to the full by the open world context of Kamurocho, which sees gangs of thugs, annoying drunkards and members of the Yakuza always ready to lead hands, in the context of almost random clashes, in the sense that any threats are reported on the mini-map and, if desired, they can be avoided, even if in fact it is better to face the opponents on duty in order to earn points and money. However, since the only way to recover the health of the character is to resort to energy drinks or takeaway food, it is of fundamental importance to replenish the inventorybefore going around looking for trouble; especially when approaching the central hubs of the campaign, where the clashes become harsher and you have to contend with powerful bosses. a combat system that in any case provides the tools to get away with it, rendering the impacts of the blows with eloquent fullness and allowing us to use a large number of objects to get the better of our enemies; especially during the very painful contextual finishers, which can be activated when the fury bar is at its maximum. Xbox One goals Yakuza Kiwami unlocks 55 Achievements on Xbox One. In addition to those obtainable simply by completing the various chapters of the campaign, many achievements are linked to specific situations and actions: interacting with Goro Majima in various ways, completing the subquests, being able to get an appointment with a hostess, try all the minigames and so on Street. The Xbox One version The graphics of Yakuza Kiwami stand as a real revolution compared to the 2005 game, thanks to the replacement of all the assets with higher quality versions, based on the latest episodes of the series, with a view to a job in which practically nothing is left to chance and those few pixels that can still be seen are in fact a quote from the original work. The visual aspect is therefore that of a modern title, although the rendering of Kamurocho at night, with the lights of the clubs and all the rest , is much better than the sequences that take place during the day due to a not very sophisticated lighting system, which in this situation tends to flatten the scenarios. However, everything moves at a stable 60 frames per second, which become 30 during the cutscenes, both on Xbox One S and on Xbox One X: in the first case, a few frames are lost in the most confusing situations, but we are really talking about minimum, impossible percentages to be perceived. As for the resolution, Yakuza Kiwami runs natively at 900p on the base console and 1440p on the more powerful model: values that are more than adequate to do justice to the characters and settings of the game, imbued with an atmosphere that will not fail to conquer you right from the from the first lines. Little to say about the audio sector, characterized by a soundtrack perfectly suited to any occasion and by Japanese dialogues interpreted with great intensity. However, the subtitles are only in English, as is now well known.", "date": "2020-04-27", "grade": "8.2"}
