The first problem to mention is certainly the lack of stability. Tried on three different computers, two desktops and one laptop, with different configurations but all higher than the recommended one, the reverts to the desktop were frequent. Furthermore, the errors have always been sudden and random, occurring in different screens, including games. The most frequent moment in which the blockages have occurred is immediately after the planning of the workouts. This forced us to save continuously in order not to lose the progress made and, above all, not to punch the monitor. in the end the games can be won, but often it seems more the result of a clash between implicit numerical values than the ability to better prepare for the challenge An avalanche of flaws The second big problem is the effectiveness of the choices made in the preparatory phase. In short, long minutes are spent deciding how to train the players, how to position them on the pitch, choosing tactics and then, during the match, it is not possible to understand whether what has been done previously has made sense or not. The cause of this lack of feedback from the game is to be found above all in the poor representation of the games, be it in 3D or 2D. Not only is the graphics ugly (few badly done animations, poor three-dimensional models, unrealistic ball movement), but the game action is at least wooden and it is impossible to understand what is happening on the pitch. The players move in a reckless way and often have absurd behaviors that are beyond any possibility of intervention and any logic: very fast passes, rambling actions, surreal groupings and so on and so forth. Often there was a terrifying bug where all the players got stuck in the middle of the field doing nothing more, while time kept running. Whole quarters of the game thrown away trying to bring life to textured puppets motionless on the screen. Having said that, you will surely realize how difficult it can be to give commands to the team when you can't understand what the team is doing. But above all, what's the point of doing it if you can't see the influence of our decisions on the field? The 2D view improves the situation even if not by much and we were often forced to change tactics confident of the fact that we had to get some ~underground~ effect by giving orders in bulk, rather than being aware of what we were doing. In the end, games can be won, but it often seems more the result of a clash between implicit numerical values than the ability to better prepare for the challenge. The slaughter continues Another very annoying problem is the frequency with which we are called to intervene on the formation on the pitch: the players get tired and get hurt all the time forcing us to make continuous changes which, incredibly, can also be made in the course of an action. Imagine the scene: a player is shooting for a basket but disappears to be replaced by one of his teammates who... shoots without batting an eye! There must be Harry Potter hidden somewhere, there is no other possible explanation for such phenomena! Another big oddity concerns free throws. Is it possible that the players on the field are unable to insert one? Taken by great curiosity, we started counting how many free throws they managed to score during a game. In three quarters of a game there were an amazing forty-five free throws! Players, both my team and the opposing team, have only managed to score three total. Another defect of no small importance, given the general picture, is the bad translation into Italian of which we have already mentioned. Errors abound everywhere and incomprehensible sentences abound, especially in the text of the emails that are occasionally delivered to us. It looks like the work of an automatic translator rather than a shrewd work of adaptation. But, obviously, the inaccuracies are not lacking even in the menus, which is far more serious than an ungrammatical sentence, at least for a video game. System requirements Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium III 800 Mhz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: DirectX compatible and equipped with 128 mb of video memory DirectX 9.0c CD-Rom Player 3.0 GB of free HD space Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4Ghz RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment Leave it alone, even if you only breathe for thelove you have for basketball. The management section could also be considered passable, too bad that the core of the game, the match, was made in a disastrous and totally unsatisfying way. Even if we want to turn a blind eye to the technical implementation, which is certainly not central to the genre, the amount of defects that afflicts FIBA Basketball Manager 2008 is so great as to not allow any discount in the evaluation phase. Too bad, because after all it is a unique product of its kind. Pros The nice packshot Cons Unstable The 3D representation of the match is useless and of poor quality The tactical choices during the match seem irrelevant The matches have alien dynamics FIBA Basketball Manager 2008 is available for PC. FIBA Basketball Manager 2008 is, as the name suggests, a management video game dedicated to European basketball and American streetball. Before starting to play you need to set some options, including the way in which to represent the game (2D or 3D), the European championship (or the American Streetball championship) in which to participate, the type of game and other options that are often not understandable due to the bad translation into Italian (which we will talk about later). The most interesting mode is certainly the career one, which allows you to examine the various aspects of the game and evaluate its implementation. The first thing to do is to examine the condition of the team, or rather study the players and their physical and moral situation, decide their training sessions, rent a field to give them a structure in which to prepare and make purchases. In the same screens it is possible to read the statistics relating to the progress of the championship which, initially, leave you dumbfounded. That is, the items that make up the various tables are acronyms that are not explained. To know its meaning, consult the manual where there is a general summary table. Nothing wrong, too bad that the translations still make it difficult to understand some items. For example, the acronym ~Fgm~ is explained with ~Percentage of the field carried out~... what does it mean? Mystery. Unfortunately, this is not the only example of unclear data. In addition to the squad, on the home screens, you can examine the condition of your stadium, the staff and the match schedule. Having decided on the training for our men and spent some money to improve the comfort of the spectators, the time has come to take the field. Before doing so let's go to the tactic screen to decide how to deploy our men. Unfortunately, despite its functionality, this menu is not very versatile and the choices available are limited.", "date": "2007-10-08", "grade": null}
