Yet there is someone among the peaks of the App Store is now used to being there for quite some time ... Rogue Gravity Jetpack Joyride is the new effort of Halfbrick, ~those~ of Fruit Ninja; a game, the latter, as unexciting on paper as sensationally capable of literally driving a good portion of Apple (and Android and Symbian and Windows Phone) device owners crazy, all engaged in an attempt to improve their sliced fruit record with a finger. Finding some kind of continuity between Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride might seem risky, and indeed it is; yet it is clear how the Australian team has perfectly capitalized on a fundamental game design element necessary to create a successful game on smartphones. In fact, both products are based on an incredibly simple and immediate gameplay, understandable in a matter of seconds by anyone; the decisive turning point, however, lies in the way in which the player is stimulated to put one game after another, until it almost becomes addictive. Certainly not for the plot or for a sense of progression, which practically does not exist, but for the element of challenge with other users and at the same time the presence of objectives to be achieved one after the other. But what actually is Jetpack Joyride then? Well, the category it falls into is that of endless runs, brought to the fore by the beautiful Canabalt; the aim is to reach the greatest possible distance before the inevitable death. In the Halfbrick game the protagonist is Barry Steakfries, already a hero of other titles of the software house in question, and the vehicle at his disposal is a jetpack with a pair of machine guns instead of rockets; progression is automatic, and the only user interaction occurs through the control of the jetpack. Touching or holding down any part of the screen activates the tool in question, so as to make Barry twirl, allowing him to avoid obstacles and collect coins. Furthermore, it is also possible to control hilarious alternative means such as the Pennuto Gruzzolo, a reference to the very rich Angry Birds, a mini Mach, or a Terminator-type chopper, and things like that. The game is pretty much all here; yet, despite the simplicity of the concept, there is always, always a reason to play ~one more game~. The simplest one is to beat a friend's record; in this sense the support of Open Feint and, above all, of the Game Center is fundamental. But also to achieve one of the increasingly difficult and demanding objectives that are gradually proposed, so as to earn extra coins to spend in the shop. Here it is possible to buy both objects with a purely aesthetic value, such as new jetpacks or clothes, and more functional and incisive objects such as a very useful extra life. You can also buy coins with real money via in-app purchase, but it's nothing mandatory or necessary. Finally, the technical, amusing and colorful component contributes to giving further charm to a product that is already irresistible in itself.
