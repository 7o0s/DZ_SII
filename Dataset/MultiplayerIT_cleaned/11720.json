{"name": "Viva Piata: Party Animals - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viva-pinata-party-animals-recensione.html", "text": "The push online and looker Every aspect of the not too deep single player as mentioned can be repeated online, while taking advantage of the integrated voice chat: although the defects described above remain, the greatest interest that can be experienced when opposed to three friends is undoubtedly. Several matches have not shown any lag or cheating issues, so we all start with the same odds of winning. Technically Viva Pinata: Party Animals is very good, with the engine of the previous management title in great shape, grappling as it is with larger settings and a much higher number of details displayed on the screen. The sensation of playing with a cartoon is strong, between characters with a good number of animations and a bright and sunny color palette. To be punctual, this aesthetic beauty is favored by the lack of complex lighting management and by the presence of few effects. Even the sound does not disappoint, with crazy and easily catchy music, which you end up humming even when the console is turned off. Comment The vote accompanying the review takes into account the poverty of options made available to users, combined with an excessive ease of mini-games and not too deep speed races. However, it remains clear how Viva Pinata: Party Animals is a product designed for the younger audience, who cannot fail to appreciate the ease of approach and the colorful graphics, making it a Christmas catchphrase that could still end up involving the whole family. For everyone, a few games of the demos that have been available for some time now are an excellent choice to consider their purchase. Pros Colorful and entertaining Dozens of games and competitions Cons Shallow Very small number of modes Only the youngest will fully appreciate it Xbox 360  Achievements All those who pay particular attention to the score marked on their Live Tag can look at Viva Pinata Party Animals with some interest. Most of the objectives require you to finish this or that game subject to certain conditions, never really impossible, and by playing even just a few games you accumulate many points involuntarily. The last 110 are instead dedicated to completing all the challenges and winning a championship with each character.", "date": "2007-12-18", "grade": null}
