Version tested: Xbox 360 Direct sequel to Arkham Asylum, this Batman: Arkham City was one of the best titles of the year, and, even if it wasn't needed, a further demonstration of Rocksteady Studios' prowess. After the packages dedicated to Catwoman and Nightwing, this time it's the turn of the dlc of Robin, the historical helper of the dark knight. Little boy with a difficult childhood, great agility and knowledge of martial arts, the robin comes with his trusty stick and two unpublished maps all for him, to be played in extra modes to the actual campaign. Red passion Robin then abandons his sidekick role to become an all-out protagonist, and this Add-On represents an excellent opportunity to fully enjoy his renewed clothing, in line with the dark and almost futuristic style of the game. The designers have done a commendable job in maintaining the typical lively combinations of the character (which we remember is the third incarnation, Tim Drake), however making them much more modern and current. Almost a miracle if we can afford it, since the original style is a tad outdated. In any case, vintage lovers can use two alternative skins, one of which is even based on the style of the animated series. As we said before, our beloved former sidekick uses a stick with high offensive power, and the full ability to use it against the heads of unfortunate enemies. But the presence of a secondary shield is the element that can most refresh the gameplay. Not only does this weapon work defensively, but it's a great tool for knocking enemies to the ground, or even knocking them over with a push. For the rest, however, we have the same resources as Batman already seen in the main game, not exactly an advantage, since once the novelty of the two weapons is over, the sense of deja-vu becomes decidedly strong, aggravated by the fact that Robin is a very less charismatic than the bat man. But here obviously it is a matter of taste, even if a greater differentiation would certainly have given oxygen to the legitimacy of this download. Xbox 360 goals The Robin Pack adds two new achievements for a total of 50 player points. These ask for the conquest of 78 and 114 medals respectively in the original challenge maps and those specific to this expansion. Of course you need the original game, good luck! Like in the arcade The two unpublished maps proposed in this dlc are quite interesting, Black Mask Hideout is part of the classic style of the game, while Freight Train Escape is proposed with a visual that recalls two-dimensional scrolling fighting games. Among other things, the latter is characterized by a beating mode that will delight lovers of the old 80s cabinets, as well as being decidedly fun and well calibrated on Robin's specific moves. Unfortunately that's all, not much else left to do, except for the possibility of replaying all the extra modes with the new character, a sincerely unattractive prospect, and the two additional maps that are made available in the challenges for Batman, Nightwing and Catwoman. All in all, a slim and not really necessary package, hardly justifiable in light of the asking price. Unfortunately, unlike Selina Kyle, the expansion does not add new chapters to the main story, which is limited to the very brief cameo of Robin already seen in the standard edition, a real shame. The Robin Pack is available on the Live Marketplace for 560 Microsoft Points and PC / Sony PSN for 6.99. Live Marketplace purchase link", "date": "2011-12-16", "grade": "5.5"}
