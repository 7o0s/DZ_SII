{"name": "Condemned: Criminal Origins - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/condemned-criminal-origins-recensione-2.html", "text": "Violence and dark presences FBI agent Ethan Thomas is called to investigate a mysterious serial killer but soon things go wrong and suddenly he finds himself hunted and on the run, with only the help of an enigmatic friend of his father and a colleague from the scientific laboratory. The only weapons available to Thomas are a pistol, which will run out very soon, the scientific equipment, with which to reveal and collect clues and samples (in full C.S.I. style, but with futuristic features), a mobile phone with which to keep in touch with the laboratory and an electric stunner that can be considered a bit like our man's last resort in the most critical situations. Agent Thomas's investigation will soon turn into a real nightmare, a kind of descent into hell during which, progressively, the city population will transform into a dangerous army of murderers, deranged and crazy murderers. What is hidden behind this mysterious spread of violence? What is behind Thomas' uncanny ability to spot clues based only on his infallible instincts? And what about the birds? As you can see, the prerequisites for a good thriller are all there, maybe you can catch a glimpse of some now overused clich in the background, but we take it for granted all the same. What is expected at this point is a good mix of action, investigation and plot development elements. Down the spiral The game takes place in closed and dark environments, in which, more often than not, the only source of light will be Agent Thomas's flashlight. Dilapidated and abandoned buildings, subways after closing hours or spectral libraries at night, the disturbing path of the player winds through these stages who, along the way, will meet increasingly aggressive and dangerous enemies. The most innovative aspect of Condemned is undoubtedly the combat system. Let's set firearms aside for a moment and imagine that we are brandishing a large steel pipe or a hammer, or even the iron door of a locker, which does the same, and now we imagine using it to strike an equally armed opponent. Well, Condemned fights are like that. We will find around all kinds of blunt objects that we can imagine, we will be able to tear pipes from the walls, nailed boards from the floor, metal doors from the cabinets, drawers, shovels, crowbars, axes and so on. Everything, then, will be regularly used against the face of our opponents. Oh sure, a few shotguns or pistols pop up every now and then, but ammunition is always too low and pretty soon we'll have to throw the weapon away. The animations are immaculate and throwing them with a thrashing is spectacular, as well as fun, in practice you can almost feel the digital adrenaline flowing through Thomas's body. In some situations, then, it will be possible to deliver a coup de grace, choosing between four possibilities, each as violent as it is definitive. A game without a doubt massive and bad. Final comment Condemned is a game that starts well and gets lost along the way. The premises are excellent, mystery, tension, rampant madness, violence in spades, the dark past of the protagonist who slowly tries to emerge ... and then? Then nothing, you go on and on and on and on, until the level ends and the next one loads, and only then you can read what is actually happening around you. But the main problem with this game is that, with dint of dark and claustrophobic environments, it gets boring after a while. Yeah, that's right: boring. Imagine that the levels, although thematically different from each other, are all alike: there is pitch darkness that oppresses everything, except for some oases of light placed just to save the players' diopters, there are scraps and rubbish on the ground, vandalized objects, corridors and halls which, in their perennial cloak of darkness, are all the same. The clashes are fun but in the end they are very little to mitigate the monotony of the design, the gimmick of collecting evidence is just a tasteless attempt to lengthen the broth. Basically, the game runs out after a while. Whether it ends up in the third level or the ninth or the thirteenth, it doesn't matter, it's all the same. It's angry to see good ideas wasted like this, the potential is there but development has leveled its characteristics downwards. Good game, but penalized by bad choices. It could have been much better. Pros Excellent combat system, original and fun Atmosphere that more noir than that you die Good premises Cons Repetitive and monotonous level design Linear maps and little freedom for the player Story development carried out in a too marginal and approximate way Does not exist the multipleyer CSI style But we have said that Thomas will also be able to use scientific equipment for the detection and collection of evidence. In fact, they are tools through which to highlight traces of blood, footprints and even smells, to then photograph them, and collect them with a spectrum analyzer or a 3D scanner. Everything will then be instantly sent via mobile phone to the analysis laboratory, which will shortly provide its results. Unfortunately, however, we will not be able to extract our beautiful technological toys when we want, we will in fact be linked to certain situations and we will be able to make use of them only when we are advised by our ~instinct~ (in this case a tag that appears on the side of the screen and says ~ use the tool~). Sure, we understood that it's not CSI, but having a little more freedom available certainly wouldn't have hurt us. However, the presence of this equipment should be considered more as an extra, a sort of added value, than as a determining factor for the purposes of the game. It basically serves to give depth to the gameplay and a greater sense of identification. CSI style As already mentioned, the settings are dilapidated and gloomy and the sudden hallucinations that our heroic agent encounters lend a hand to the profound sense of unease and impending madness. But are we sure they are just hallucinations? The sense of cerebral derailment is always lurking and the atmosphere is thick and oozes thick drops of madness. The narrow corridors and dark passages do not improve the situation and sometimes the claustrophobia becomes so palpable that it takes the air. In fact, from a technical standpoint, the level design is done really well and never once does one think of where you are as a 'map'. What hurts, unfortunately, is the linearity imposed on the paths, as well as a general sense of monotony. Unfortunately, for poor Ethan Thomas it's all about moving forward, in the dark, among debris and dirt, following a single road with no alternatives. Ah, did I mention Officer Thomas can't jump? Well, I don't know why but an action game where you can't jump gives me the idea of a crippled game. Either way, it gets boring in the long run. And they don't make it any better in terms of how the story is told. Except for a few interlude sequences, the bulk of the events are explained in skimpy reports during the loading phases. A little bit, given the premises. The Monoliths are back And the latest incarnation of their historic graphics engine returns, once again cloaked in gloomy darkness and dusty environments. Just like F.E.A.R., Condemned also plays to save on the bill and turns off the lights, leaving the player in a mostly dark and oppressive environment. Having available hardware that allows it, the show that unfolds before our eyes is a majestic alternation of light and shadow with an almost photorealistic appearance, decidedly above almost any other PC production currently around. There is very little to add, which has not been said for F.E.A.R.: the textures, models, animations and effects reveal a meticulous work of chisel on the details and once again show off the amazing characteristics of the Litech Engine. This time, however, the game is based on a different framework from the classic first-person shooter scheme.", "date": "2006-05-29", "grade": null}
