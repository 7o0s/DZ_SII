More than twenty years have passed between Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Galaxy, yet the plumber is always there, in front of or beside the others, place him wherever you prefer, to follow unexplored paths. This, as anticipated before, is certainly true if we speak of the ~main series~, and based on the meaning given to this term, the quality of the saga also varies: inserting one game or another within this family is a more complex issue than it might seem, and it would probably be difficult to find a universally shared solution. Almost certainly Nintendo gave up Mario 2d - from a creative point of view, at least - in 1996, the year of Super Mario 64, the first three-dimensional episode, of which there is no need to remember the successes. This conception has persisted in the GameCube era - despite Sunshine having been a sort of misstep - and also (in part) in the Wii era, in which Mario Galaxy has done nothing but reiterate the great potential of the 3D platformer, a genre that, outside of Nintendo, few have known how to exploit it properly. Certainly Mario's three-dimensional adventures continued the pioneering and innovative spirit of the series, maintaining the exceptional quality standard of the previous games high: however something was lost along the way, something that neither Nintendo nor its fans had noticed. to have left. Until, in 2006, that something was found... just by chance. Dueddday Immediacy and replayability: these are the factors that were lost in the transition from 2d to 3d, and it took New Super Mario Bros for Nintendo to realize its mistake. An error resulting from company policy which, although aimed at satisfying all possible users, had its - informed, prepared and expert - core audience as its core. Nintendo realized - late - the path it had taken and backtracked with the DS, the Wii and, consequently, with the introduction of the New Mario series. The mistake was to consider Mario 3D as the natural and necessary continuation of its predecessors, while carrying forward some elements leaving out others: now we have gone on to conceive the two series as parallel, one more interesting from a creative point of view, the another simpler and more immediate, both worthy of being developed simultaneously on the same console. It is undeniable that Mario 2d has a charm and immediacy that are difficult to find in most of today's productions, it still has an incredible magnetism and is able to charm anyone - really anyone, in a way that is inconceivable for Brain Training and Nintendogs, but also for Mario Galaxy and Zelda - type of public thanks to the never equaled combination of the simplicity of the controls (directional cross plus two buttons) and quality/depth of the interaction. EAD 4 The father of New Super Mario Bros Wii is Shigeyuki Asuke, one of the young Nintendo promises who had previously worked on Pikmin, Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario Sunshine and, above all, as director on the first New Super Mario Bros for DS. The project was produced by the talented Takashi Tezuka (director of Super Mario Bros 3 and World) and by Hiroyuki Kimura, head of EAD 4, the team that dealt with the development of the game. That Mario 2d is now a parallel series and unrelated to the 3d one is demonstrated by the fact that it was developed by what is usually called the Pikmin Team (EAD 4, in fact) and not the Mario Team (EAD Tokyo), contrary to what happens for Zelda, whose episodes, both home and portable, are all made by EAD 3. Synthesis New Super Mario Bros Wii steals from all its predecessors here and there, refining the various extremes: the maps and costumes are in the Super Mario Bros 3 style, although the difficulty level is not the same; exploration of the Mario World-style stages is guaranteed by the three hidden coins, but is not extended to the map; the smoothness of the levels is inspired by Super Mario Bros, although it is less linear; the plumber's commands are taken from the 3D polygonal episodes, to then be applied to the two dimensions. In the DS chapter, the developers had been good at collecting these elements, but had had difficulty in giving the game a well-defined identity. One of the weak points has remained intact in this successor: the graphic style adopted - not the technical realization, however on discrete levels and nothing more - is too anonymous, more in keeping with a Mario Party than the most celebrated platform series in historyi. Fortunately this time EAD 4 - also thanks to the greater experience - managed to better mix the various ingredients, making more coherent and intelligent choices, more simply showing off better ideas, especially as regards power-ups and their practical application. The formal perfection of most of the levels is almost embarrassing: Asuke - project director - has become fully familiar with the mariesco language, showing that he has finally metabolized it, and has created stages that can be interpreted in many different ways based on experience of the player, free to set his own rhythm to the action. There are no bad or bad internships, the less successful episodes simply amount to a banal perfect mannerism which, alternating with situations of pure genius, makes one's nose turn up more than it should. The game starts brilliantly with the first two worlds, presenting new situations - the beautiful propeller helmet, the revolving platforms, the sudden changes of pace, the fast zoom in/out of the camera, the objects that move following the rhythm of the music, the elements that deform as it would not have been possible without polygons - it drops slightly in the central phase, the most traditional, to then go up again in the final one, in particular in the seventh world, which will certainly end up in the Marian Olympus for the quality and creativity that characterize each level. The game is not kissed by the typical perfection of Super Mario Bros 3, there are things that work but could have worked better (the collection of objects, for example: why associate it with the movement of the remote control when for years it was done better with the pressure of a single button?), some power-ups, even quite widespread, are almost useless (the mini mushroom, one above all), the increase in the challenge had to be modulated better (the gap between world six and seven is very strong); however, no game since Mario 3 has been - formally - as perfect as Mario 3 in both micro and macro structure, so New Mario Wii can't be blamed for that. The controls are as precise as a polygon-based interaction allows, and the movement of the wiimote, with one exception (the collection of objects, in fact) is used as intelligently as it could not be. Mushrooms and plumbers If in the single-player adventure New Super Mario Bros Wii brings the classic 2D platform back to heights never reached in the last ten years, the real novelty of this edition lies in the multiplayer mode, to tell the truth much less central than the presentation at the E3 had led to believe. It can be played in two or four players, both cooperating and in ~Four Swords~ style (therefore alternating cooperation and confrontation), however the aspect that immediately strikes you (positively), regardless of the mode chosen, is the type of interaction , extremely physical: characters grab, throw, push, jump on top of each other and bounce off each other. The developers have found intelligent compromises to satisfy both expert users and newbies (in the single-player with the introduction of the ~Super Guide~, which completes the stage for the player upon request), however in the multiplayer field it would have been nice to have the online. It's hilarious to jump here and there in twos, threes or fours, stealing coins and overcoming obstacles together setting ~live~ times, however online would have guaranteed the possibility of playing ~pro~ in cooperation also to all those people - not a few , probably - that they don't have friends handy with the triple jump.", "date": "2009-11-25", "grade": "9.1"}
