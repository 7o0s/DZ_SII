Among masterpieces of the caliber of Metal Gear Solid, ICO or God of War, a collection dedicated to one of the historical brands of the jRPG genre, namely Final Fantasy, could not be missing. Thanks to a special edition titled Final Fantasy X | X-2 HD Remaster, on a single Blu-ray we have Final Fantasy X, considered by many to be the last true exponent of the saga, together with its spin-off / natural sequel Final Fantasy X-2, originally published respectively in 2001 and in 2003 on the PlayStation 2. Both episodes are accompanied by various bonuses including trophies, and by extra content such as Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm, a movie that acts as a trait d'union between the tenth chapter and the spin-off. Then Final Fantasy X-2: Last Mission, which allows you to play a sort of roguelike inside a huge multi-story tower, and in the Credits & Extras area, the audio drama Will, written by Kazushige Nojima and set approximately one year after the events of Final Fantasy X-2. Focused on two new characters, Chuami and Kurgum, it is essentially an audio story in English, with Italian subtitles, to be followed while watching a sequence of artwork and various illustrations from the two games scroll across the screen. Then there is the cross-save function between PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, where the two games can be purchased separately, but unfortunately not the cross-buy function, so to continue a game on Sony's portable console users must buy both versions of the game. Final Fantasy X and X-2 are back in a rich remastered edition for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita Curiosity The versions of the two games in the collection are the ~international~ ones, and therefore include extras. In reality, as far as Final Fantasy X is concerned, European users will not find anything different from what they had already seen in the original edition for PlayStation 2. In fact, the title was initially released in Japan on July 19, 2001 without some features, such as for example the Dark Eons and Der Richer, which were then included in a second edition of the game released again in the Land of the Rising Sun on January 31, 2002. This version was released in May of that year on PAL territories, even if the title does not it bore the wording ~International~. Listen to my story However, going into detail on the PlayStation 3 edition that we used for our review, once the Bluray is loaded, everything you want can be accessed from the main menu, including the two games in the collection. Starting with Final Fantasy X, which represented and still represents in many respects a sort of milestone for genre productions, even if at the time it aroused some criticism, excessive in our opinion, due to the lack of the much loved World Map and for the characterization of Tidus, which some fans didn't like very much. In any case, once the game has started, the player is offered the possibility of choosing whether to use the Standard or the Master spherography. For those unfamiliar with it, it is a particular character growth system which, through the use of specific points to be spent on a sort of chessboard, affects the statistics or unlocks new technical characteristics of the party members. The basic one provides a more guided path for the evolution of a character, the other is freer, and allows an element of the group to deviate from the programmed path. Just to give a quick example, if a character is predisposed to become a powerful wizard, like Lulu, with the Master Spherography he can instead be made to specialize in attacks that cause status, theoretically more suitable for types like Wakka. Moving on to the plot, this tells of Spira, a world in danger threatened by an evil force called Sin, and of a group of characters led by Yuna, a summoner of Yevon, and by Tidus, a Blitzball player, who for a series of reasons he finds himself united in trying to stop the menace. Five other heroes will join the two during the adventure, namely Wakka, Lulu, Kimahri Lonzo, Rikku and Auron, each with its own personality, unique abilities and special techniques called Turbo, using which you have to press the right sequence of buttons that appear on the screen to activate different types of shots. Other skills can be acquired, as we said before, through Spherography. Unlike the previous chapters of the saga, which from the fourth chapter onwards based their battle system on the Active Time Battle bar, Final Fantasy X features fixed-turn battles managed through the CTB, a system which foresees, among other things, the attack order of each participant in the fight in relation to his specific attributes (there is a time line on the screen indicating the turns of the various characters and enemies). In other words, turns are not superimposable and a character can attack several times in a row if he has attributes of speed superior to slower opponents. Then there is the possibility of changing the fighting party members with those on the bench in real time, and that of resorting to the summons of the Aeons, which are very powerful creatures equivalent to the Summons of Final Fantasy VII or the Guardian Force of Final Fantasy VIII , albeit with different functions and roles. Once invoked, in fact, these beings remain on the ground to replace the other elements of the team, controllable by the user as normal characters and therefore subject, if hit, to losing HP and being defeated. When not engaged in battle, gamers can while away their time with some of the many mini-games scattered throughout the world of Spira. The Chocobo race, the Zoolab where you can challenge captured monsters or create new ones, butterfly hunting in the Macalania forest, are just some of the challenges available, although the most fun is certainly Blitzball, a strange underwater sport similar to handball in which, as mentioned at the beginning, Tidus is a champion. In this sense, you can participate in an entire championship to be played with lots of rewards for each victory. In short, there is everything to make the purists of the genre happy: turn-based combat, villages and areas to visit, dungeons full of secrets, dozens of monsters and bosses to face, in a title in which the weight of the years almost seems to feel mechanically. It is also true that in all likelihood the gameplay of the product, with its frequent random clashes and its style, will probably be unattractive for those accustomed to action games or shooters, or to certain modern RPGs, but it is also true that usually this type of user does not approach, if not just out of curiosity, a classic role-playing game. Playstation 3 trophies The collection offers 34 Trophies for Final Fantasy X, divided into 20 bronze, 8 silver, 5 gold and 1 platinum, and 35 for Final Fantasy X-2, divided into 22 bronze, 7 silver, 5 gold and 1 platinum. Winning a Blitzball tournament, learning Jecht's shot or doing at least 9999 damage with a single attack are just some of the requirements to be met in the tenth chapter to obtain the trophies, while in its spin-off the rewards can be unlocked after having acquired a special suit, caught a rare chocobo, got the Tonberry treasure or eliminated the bosses in the different floors of the tower of Iutycyr. Dancing with Yuna The other title that Square Enix brings back in the collection is Final Fantasy X-2, here in its International incarnation originally released only for Japan in 2004. This means that it includes functions never seen before for the European public, such as the Creature Creator, which allows capture and use within the party monsters or NPCs you meet around, a couple of new outfits and several additional missions. In any case, the game in terms of story and settings is a real sequel to the previous one, even if it differs from the latter in terms of gameplay, which is more action-based. The plot develops two years after the events told in Final Fantasy X and focuses on the figure of Yuna, intent on searching for a ~friend~ who she believed disappeared forever. The summoner seen at work in the tenth episode gives way to a new woman, who in the meantime has become a sort of pop-star and then a Sphere hunter together with her friends Paine and old acquaintance Rikku, with whom she forms the team of the Seagulls. Aboard the skyship Celsius, she travels the world searching for these globes, while trying to find new clues about the missing person. Not infrequently, during research, the user has the opportunity to meet characters already seen in the tenth episode of the series, and to perform actions capable of influencing some aspects of the story to arrive at one of the different endings of the adventure. From the point of view of playability, the product is conceptually more frivolous and less busy than its predecessor, and for this reason it is less interesting. Progress in the game takes place through five chapters and the successful achievement of certain missions available in each place that can be visited. Reaching a certain location within a time limit, clearing a particolar area infested with enemies, the discovery of new Spheres and so on, are just some of the concrete examples of what has been said. The way in which the gamer interacts with the world of Spira during exploration is also different, with Yuna who can run, jump and climb, and the battle system centered on the Job System and on a speeded up and dynamic version of the Active Time Battle. Each of the three girls can wear a different dress through the Looksphere system, or Spheres that allow them to change their appearance, but also their moves and skills. The latter must in turn be developed one by one through specific points. During the course of the adventure it is possible to acquire new clothes, to be used according to one's preferences or the monsters to be faced, and to enhance them through particular grids called Garment Grids, to obtain other benefits, such as for example attack bonuses or spells not yet learned through the acquisition of the canonical skill points. The battle system of Final Fantasy X-2, clearly inspired by that of Final Fantasy V, all in all it is not bad, and in general the title is pleasant to play because it also allows fans to return to explore among other things a world you end up growing attached to. Restoration operation Playing the two titles you don't immediately notice, but the aspect ratio of the images is also new: we have gone from 4:3, or the television standard of twelve years ago, to today's indispensable 16:9. And this detail allows us to introduce the technical topic: just take a few steps to Tidus, Auron or Yuna to appreciate the good realization of the respective models, which have been given the best treatment by the Square Enix graphics, the absence of aliasing and a certain stability in terms of fluidity. In this sense, the glance offered by the two games is really pleasant, thanks also to the usual inspired artistic direction, and the world of Spira has never been so beautiful and colorful to see. The implementation of some new textures that are slightly more refined than the originals has not only involved the restoration of the main characters, but also some elements of the scenarios, which is why these appear more detailed and alive than the PlayStation 2 versions. Nothing miracles, mind you, and it could not have been otherwise given the starting point, but certainly it is a nice sight. In this context, the sometimes long uploads and the non-player characters are out of tune, which have had a surface treatment that in fact made them maintain angular shapes and textures from PlayStation 2, like some secondary areas of Spira. The cinematic sequences received a similar treatment, which were only adapted for the new 16:9 format, maintaining the standard definition of the two original titles. Among other things, the films cannot be skipped, and in our opinion this can be annoying, especially when, due to a premature death, you have to start again from a point prior to a video scene, and therefore have to put up with the entire sequence again . As for the audio part, the soundtrack of Final Fantasy X-2 is discreet, which boasts the same music as the PlayStation 2 edition, while we believe that of Final Fantasy X is splendid. Here, however, a good part of the tracks that make up the accompaniment of the adventure, about sixty, have been rearranged by Masashi Hamauzu, one of the composers, together with Nobuo Uematsu, of the original ones, and therefore they are reproposed in different versions, while obviously maintaining the very valid starting melodies. Among the songs there is the beautiful Suteki sung by Rikki. Finally, the dubbing is discreet, available in English, while only the subtitles are present in our language.", "date": "2014-03-25", "grade": "8.7"}
