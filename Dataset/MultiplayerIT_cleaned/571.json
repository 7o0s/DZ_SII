But, more than Morrowind, Arena and Daggerfall immediately come to mind, since the escape will not be fast or easy. We will immediately find ourselves entangled in the incipit of the game: an emperor on the run, the threat of the opening of the gates of Oblivion (an infernal parallel dimension where the lethal Daedra live), and a war that is about to upset the whole region of Cyrodill (guess who gets to save everyone?). But let's immediately take a step back and go back to the physical appearance editor. Defining it ~complete~ is truly an understatement. It allows you to change every single trait of the character: starting age, size of the eyes, nose, face itself, size of the forehead, skin color, hair plus many other things which, if listed, would occupy the rest of the article. For the less patient there is an option to create a random character, but the possibility of shaping our perfect polygonal counterpart justifies the time spent in this section. Oblivion, unlike what happened in the previous chapters, tends to reward clear-cut classes Dear old prisons But let's go back to the cold and very humid prison in which we were thrown for no one knows why. The main character will not be defined from the beginning in all its characteristics. Before being able to select the class and the birth sign, it will be necessary to pass a long dungeon which will act as a tutorial. Based on the behavior held in this phase we will receive advice on our ideal class from one of the characters. Obviously these are non-binding recommendations. It should be noted that Oblivion, unlike what happened in the previous chapters, tends to reward the net classes (therefore, pure warriors, wizards and thieves) making the growth of the mixed classes slower. The skill and stats system has not changed compared to the past: each skill grows faster the more you use it and, to level up, you will need to grow the main skills of the class it belongs to. An attic full of moldy parchments Could a beautiful historical box on the saga of the scrolls preferred by gamers from all over the world be missing? Absolutely not! Here you are briefly illustrated the three previous episodes plus the two spin-offs. Main Saga1993  The Elder Scrolls: ArenaThe first historic episode of the saga sees the world of Tamriel on the brink of the abyss at the hands of Jagar Tharn, a warrior mage who has imprisoned Emperor Uriel Septim VII in an alternate universe. In the guise of a lone hero you have recovered the eight pieces of the Staff of Chaos scattered in eight different citadels, you have beaten Jagar Tharn bloody, restoring the rightful emperor to the throne and you have stopped the catastrophe. Bethesda, to celebrate 10 years of the saga, has made the download of this little gem free. 1996  The Elder Scrolls: DaggerfallThe story of Daggerfall is quite long and intricate. The largest episode of the series (as well as the freest) saw the usual hero, imprisoned in a dark, labyrinthine dungeon full of capricious monsters, face off with an ancient king of Tamriel (Lysandus) who wanted, guess what, subjugate Tamriel. Guess who won? The amount of news and features introduced in Daggerfall deserve a long separate box. Just know that neither Morrowind nor Oblivion have managed to reproduce the level of interaction present in this monumental second episode (but not even the billions of bugs, fortunately). In the opinion of the writer, this is the best episode of the saga, at least on a structural level. a dungeon but inside a ship. Always prisoners and always grappling with an ancient and powerful enemy (Dagoth-Ur) you have traveled far and wide across the continent of Morrowind becoming a local myth as well as one of Tamriel's most renowned athletes (given all the kilometers to go feet to reach the various locations). Legends still sing of the lone hero (you'll find echoes of your deeds within Oblivion) who saved Morrowind and made the cobblers of Vivec rich (of course they could give you a horse). Spin-off1997  The Elder Scrolls Legend: BattlespireBattlespire is nothing more than a prequel to Arena made with the Daggerfall graphics engine. The evil Jagar Tharn had the Battlespire warmage academy taken over by the Daedra, and you fixed the situation by sending them back to graze in Oblivion.The game consists of one giant dungeon. The worst Elder Scrolls game, as well as the most buggy (it was difficult to beat Daggerfall, but they worked hard and made it). Boring, repetitive, technically old-fashioned for its time. It was probably developed while intoxicated. 1998  The Elder Scrolls Adventure: RedguardIn honor of the success of Tomb Raider, the Elder Scrolls also enjoyed a dedicated action title. As a Hammerfell Redguard you have embroiled yourself in a rebellion against Governor Amiel Richton and forced the Emperor to come to terms with your faction. A certainly good game that suffered from some problems in the controls and a few too many graphic defects. Entertaining, especially by virtue of its intricate and exciting plot. The first time is never forgotten Right from the start you can try the main fighting styles, which are the classic ones of every modern and non-modern role-playing game: hand-to-hand, from a distance, magical and stealthy. We imagine that many of those who have played Morrowind and criticized it precisely for the combat system, are waiting to know if it has been improved or if it has remained similar to the previous one. The reality is that, despite some small improvements, it has remained essentially identical to that of Morrowind. Some edges have been fixed, in this case a little more dynamism, an eye for stealth, greater attention to the contact between weapons and enemies. But it's still the old method slightly tweaked (one button to attack, one to defend and one for magic). We wonder when and if the Daggerfall system will be resumed, in which each movement associated with the attack button corresponded to a different type of shot. So don't expect failures. If you enjoyed fighting in Morrowind you will surely like to do it in Oblivion too, if you didn't like it then, you won't like it today. Also present are the infamous special attacks seen in the previews: these are more powerful shots than the normal ones, but don't expect too many wonders since it is a simple addition to a system, as already mentioned, unchanged in its structure. The official guide of Multiplayer.it Cyrodiil is big. So big. There are many things to do, to find, to kill. In short, do you really want to miss all the dozens of subplots and the same number of secrets contained in the game? We know you well and we know that you would rather sell your Teletubbies-loving little brother on Ebay. This is why we have created an official guide of 360 pages overflowing with everything you need to not miss a thing of this masterpiece. Do you want to know where to find all the quests in the game? Want to know how to get rare and powerful items? Do you want to know how to pick up our Alessandra Tomasina? Buy this wonderful guide; the ideal complement for any self-respecting adventurer. Long live freedom Finally the time comes to get out of this damned dungeon to breathe the fresh air of Cyrodill. Once outside, the show that awaits you is truly breathtaking: water with magnificent reflections describes a coast dotted with luxuriant vegetation. Nothing like it had ever been seen. Obviously, to fully enjoy all this, you must have a high-end computer, while Xbox 360 owners will be able to enjoy everything to the fullest without too much paturnie (see the hardware box to find out more). All this graphic magnificence has its price: framerate drops in the presence of too complex scenarios or a large number of characters will not be uncommon. With the system on which the game was tested, unplayability was never reached, keeping the detail on a medium / high level. On the second system (the one with the 5900) we have reduced most of the effects obtaining a visual result paradoxically worse than Morrowind at maximum detail. The first steps into the game world are exhilarating, either for all the hype that preceded its release, or because the eyes can't stop filling with wonder, the first hour is spent admiring everything trying to grasp every detail present regardless of the quests. if you liked fighting in Morrowind you will surely like it in Oblivion too, if instead you didn't like it at the time, you won't like it today either Long live freedom Exploring has never been so pleasant, also thanks to the glimpses that the game engine is able to give, some truly moving. It should be noted that the overall dimensions of Cyrodill are large and that even here, as in Morrowind, some areas will not be touched by themain missions, thus remaining unexplored and available either for some secondary mission (of whatever type) or for the free enterprise of gamers. Oblivion features a power level system, meaning you will always encounter enemies of your own level on the main map, while certain quests and dungeons will have opponents of a predetermined level. It will therefore be necessary for the player to manage these resources and decide the right time to devote to exploration, as well as the main quest. Unfortunately Bethesda does not give precise references and parameters, the only possibility is to take the plunge and risk it, a bit like life beyond the monitor. Novelty? Before talking about the best side (besides the graphics) of Oblivion, let's see what's new compared to the previous episode. First, it should be noted that Bethesda has taken advantage of the criticisms made by some fans and have backtracked on Daggerfall on some points. Firstly, finally, it will be possible to make fast trips without having to look for a means of transport. Thus, after receiving precise information on a location, or having stocked one up during the exploration phases, this will be indicated on the map and can be reached immediately by clicking on it. So forget the endless walks of Morrowind: in a short time you can go from one part of Cyrodill to another without necessarily having to go back to already beaten terrain. Obviously, those who love exploration at all costs (or who want to quickly increase their athletic skill) can continue to run from one part of the map to another, perhaps using the second reintroduction from Daggerfall: the horse. Finally we will be able to travel around the world of Tamriel on the back of a fast steed, in order to be able to explore it faster and to be able to quickly reach inaccessible areas where it is not possible to travel with the map. Another new feature is the NPC persuasion system. Our character obtains different information from the inhabitants of Cyrodiil based on a large number of factors: race, fame, successful missions, stats and skill values. These determine their disposition towards us (represented by a simple numerical value). Obviously, the more well-disposed they are, the more talkative they are and the greater the possibility of obtaining better information and additional quests. To raise this disposition, it will be possible to participate in a rather simple subgame, with the possibility of bribing after paying out gold. The final result may be an increase in the availability of the interlocutor or the collapse of his trust (which can prove catastrophic for some missions). Another novelty is the restructuring of the inventory, rationalized compared to the previous episodes. With a key you access a summary screen in which it is very easy to navigate between the equipment, the spells, the diary with the relative indications and the maps. Forget the inventory squares of old episodes; here you will only have a rather schematic list of the objects owned with the various values that compose them alongside. The question of encumbrance remains unchanged compared to the past: the strength value determines the maximum weight of the transportable objects. The interface is overall very intuitive, denoting its console predisposition, especially in light of the strong success of Morrowind in the Xbox version. The increasingly intricate intrigues Oblivion has a very particular and fascinating narrative structure. As with Morrowind, in addition to the main plot, there are many subplots worthy of being played to the end to enjoy the meticulous work done in the script phase. All the guilds in the game offer, after registering in their ranks, chained missions to be carried out which make up real high-level sub-campaigns. Let's take for example the Mages Guild missions in which an old acquaintance of the saga will return (we don't tell you who it is because we don't want to spoil the surprise, of course) perfectly integrated with the intrigues of Cyrodill, or let's take the Dark Brotherhood missions which offer a final twist worthy of the best cinematic thrillers. But that's not all. Not only can we fearlessly state that the qualitative leap, at the level of the various campaigns, compared to Morrowind, has been remarkable, but also that the individual missions are the best that has been developed for a computer RPG. Some have been written so well that they are real separate stories within the larger stories (we even dedicated a box to one of these). Each quest line offers missions", "date": "2006-03-27", "grade": null}
