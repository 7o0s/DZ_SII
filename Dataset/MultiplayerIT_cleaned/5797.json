Despite its appearance, the creature seems to have a real mania for perfectionism as regards creations with snow, so much so that it has to follow perfectly logical criteria for the construction of the puppets, which the new Michelangelo even calls by name in his dreamy but super productive creative rush. We therefore find ourselves moving from one section of the garden to another trying to gradually compose the snowmen that crowd the protagonist's mind, within a puzzle game entirely focused on the sense of position and on the order of movement of the balls of snow. The rules to follow are few and simple, but as often happens when the whole structure is based on well-defined and strict guidelines, the enigma is particularly challenging. If a balanced learning curve is applied to this, a game pace that is easily adaptable to different usage needs and a control system perfectly placed on the touch screen, it is easy to obtain an excellent mobile title, which becomes a real pearl when there is added an inspired and coherent technical realization like that of A Good Snowman is Hard to Build. The goodness of the game mechanics is obviously the main engine of the experience but it is the graphic style and the characterization applied by the team that create a good part of the magic: a poetics based on small details, even marginal with respect to the puzzle itself but capable of opening an imaginary world endowed with a truly unique grace and atmosphere. Beyond the measured movements necessary to create the works, the ability to sit on a bench, touch the plants, interact with statues and fountains and even quickly hug the newly created snowmen brings life to the animated world of the game. Beyond even the great structure, there is something magical about A Good Snowman is Hard to Build The Snowman rules The basic mechanics of A Good Snowman is Hard to Build closely resembles some now well established puzzles such as Sokoban, or similar titles based on the correct positioning of boxes and objects, but in this case we are faced with some additional features perfectly inscribed in the dynamics of the game, which make it unique. To build a snowman it is necessary to place three spheres on top of each other, but strictly in descending order, from the largest as the base to the smallest as the head. This is one of the fundamental rules of the puzzle, which implies a careful calculation of the movements because by rolling a sphere for more than one movement on the snow it increases in size and could therefore no longer be positioned above the others. The positioning and movement of the snowballs must therefore take place in a strategic way for all three, also considering that the snow is removed as one sphere passes, freeing the others from the risk of increasing volume. Another rule is given by the fact that you can only push the spheres, which prevents you from moving those that end up adjacent to the walls, thus placing another parameter to take into consideration in solving the puzzles. As is clear, therefore, the guidelines that define the structure of A Good Snowman is Hard to Build are few and basic, but the game doesn't really need anything else to be challenging and stimulating. The scenario is represented by a huge labyrinthine garden made up of smaller sections, with a puppet waiting to be created inside each of these, which differs from the others in the arrangement of the spheres, the snow and the obstacles and elements of scenario. It is not possible to have an overview of the whole garden except by accessing the telescope located in the center of the map and this can make orientation in the scenario difficult, considering that there are some crossroads and sometimes it is necessary to carry out a backtracking to find the way, but in any case it is not a major problem.", "date": "2015-12-29", "grade": "8.8"}
