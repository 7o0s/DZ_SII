A lot of proverbial water has passed under the bridge and those who are passionate about the adventures written by ~Jo~ have seen Harry grow up, fall in love, suffer and triumph, even and above all in the cinema, where he broke the box office with each new novel promptly translated. for the big screen, albeit often in quite questionable ways. In the last year the final stages of the seven-volume Harry Potter saga have been squeezed out to the last drop with one last film, even split into two parts, and a ton of shoddy productions for each console that have tried to put an end fixed, in their own way, to the gaming career of Hogwarts students, without doing the least justice to the author's splendid and visionary fresco. We really needed Traveller's Tales to end Harry's adventures with a bang, in the best possible way: with LEGO! Magic is power! LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 is the obvious direct sequel to the previous, ahem, LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 churned out a couple of ago, just before the excellent LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean and LEGO Star Wars: The Clone Wars. This means that, as usual in the long history of the Traveller's Tales franchise, this new LEGO-adventure has also treasured the many small improvements made from game to game, in a continuous evolution of a series which, it is true, always offers the same structure and very few innovations, but it does it with great class, punctually giving hours and hours of fun. After all, TT Games' LEGO games are not designed to be a ~real challenge~ but rather a fun pastime in which it is even impossible to go into Game Over and in which players are encouraged to discover every secret, find every object and build or destroy anything you can interact with. This new adventure is obviously inspired by the last three years of the narrative cycle and therefore includes Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the latter divided into two parts as al cinema: each new chapter of Harry's story is once again accessible from a central hub, represented by the magical secret London borough of Diagon Alley, and is divided into a series of stages that retrace some salient moments of the story. Between the predictable level set in the Department of Mysteries of the Ministry of Magic which concludes the fifth chapter and the titanic final battle of Hogwarts which closes the entire story, there is also room for some original surprises, such as an internship inspired by the Story of the Three Brothers . Maybe for someone these names will mean nothing, but fans of Harry Potter, whether literary or cinematic, will undoubtedly find themselves at ease in a world reconstructed with skill and attention. As usual, each chapter can be replayed at any time with any character you want, the only way to unlock each secret by appropriately using the various unique abilities of the characters, such as those associated with the Weasley family or the Death Eaters. The structure of the game and of the progression have therefore not changed in the slightest, even if they offer a greater quantity and variety of content than in the past, but there are many small tricks that refresh the experience even for those who have already spent their time with the previous chapter : the introduction of new spells, this time not tied to a mandatory lock-on system, has allowed the development of even more interesting puzzles, while the magic duels, even if perhaps excessively frequent, make the battles considerably more epic main. Playstation 3 trophies Inevitable a greedy amount of Trophies: thirty-seven Bronze, ten Silver, two Gold and one Platinum. Collecting them will not be difficult: you will have to complete each chapter, each level, unlock all the characters in each variant and so on. Of course, it will take a lot of time! Magic bricks Once again the story that connects the various chapters that make up the heart of the game is narrated by sparkling silent parodies of the crucial moments on which each stage is based: everyone knows the story of Harry Potter by now, but TT Games tells it in its own way with a nice dose of nonsense that makes the ~acting~ of the LEGO men representing Harry, Hermione, Ron and company even more funny. It is a style, as usual, simple and essential, but attention tothe details of the developers allows you to immediately recognize even the lesser-known characters of the saga by catching small details such as Tonks' colored hair or Bill Weasley's scars. To counteract the ~LEGO style~ of the various characters there is an excellent technical realization as regards the settings, modeled in a realistic way and characterized by excellent textures, which faithfully reproduce the many locations through which the adventure, from the interiors of Hogwarts to the dungeons of Gringotts bank; the downside in this case is caused by the fragmentation of each stage into multiple separate areas that require a few seconds of loading, which in the long run can be a bit tiring, especially when wandering around trying to solve a certain puzzle . The total immersion in the magical and mysterious universe of Harry Potter is definitively underlined by the cinematic soundtrack edited, over the years, by John Williams and Nicholas Hooper, punctually reproposed here to accompany our raids in search of bricks and secrets, alone or in company. In this regard, it must unfortunately be emphasized that not even LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 allows you to play online, a highly requested feature absent from the now historic LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga; we must therefore settle for a local multiplayer mode that allows a second player to hold the joypad and join our game at any time, thanks to a very comfortable dynamic split-screen that comes into operation if our partner moves too far from our character , even more fluid and functional than in the already excellent LEGO Star Wars: The Clone Wars.", "date": "2011-12-12", "grade": "8.4"}
