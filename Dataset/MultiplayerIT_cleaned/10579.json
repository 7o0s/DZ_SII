They can be found in the mud of the rivers, inside some untreated fruit, in post offices, on the bus and in the disco; almost everywhere to be honest. Unfortunately, some cannot be crushed and cannot be used for fishing. The most dangerous are those who talk and who, failing to make sense of more complex concepts than ~I eat an apple~, after a while grunt and turn red, starting to hit left and right. Fortunately, the worm protagonist of the latest Popcap Games effort is one of the nice and bespectacled ones. His favorite pastime is spending his days reading books of different shapes and sizes, with very different themes, but all with naked women on the cover... ahem, no, we're talking about a serious creep who reads essays by Bauman and Le Goff, not any earthworm who only knows how to turn on the television! However, don't think that his life isn't adventurous, you'll go wrong! Sometimes even worms have bad days, as well as a soul and, why not, super powers. Our worm, for example, has to contend with strange space-time holes that are messing up the world of fairy tales. What shady figure will be behind the oddities that are happening? Why do all the fantastic creatures that have populated the dreams of adults and children for centuries turn against him and want to make a crush on him? Why don't we stop asking questions and start playing? Curiosity In Anglo-Saxon countries bookworm means the person who reads a lot. In Italy we would translate it into: ~bookworm~. The English often give a negative connotation to the word, which is used to indicate people who, spending their days reading, have no contact with the real world. Generally, bookworms are the ones who are made fun of by everyone during their adolescence, but who, once they grow up, become important characters, create successful operating systems and go to live in talking houses. The power of words The concept of Bookworm Adventures Volume 2 is as simple as it is brilliant (although identical to that of the first episode): given a series of letters positioned in chaotic order on a square grid, you have to try to compose words of three or more letters to launch attacks against the opponent in turn. The longer the word, the more powerful the attack. In addition to the basic letters, it is possible to obtain special letters which, depending on the color, can increase the damage, poison the enemy, make him bleed, freeze him and so on. Being particularly skilled in composing words it is possible to obtain a rainbow tile which can be used as the missing letter of any word. Obviously on the other side there are the enemies who certainly do not sit idly by and carry out attacks of different types against the protagonist vermazzo, stunning him, burning him, altering the properties of the letters and destroying the painstakingly collected potions. Whoever depletes his rival's health bar first wins. By eliminating the enemies and passing the levels, you get different objects that can then be selected at the beginning of each mission and are able to provide the most disparate bonuses, to be managed according to the opponent you will have to face as the number of those that can be carried with you is limited . Gradually you will come into possession of ducks capable of carrying extra potions and cats with healing properties, among others, while the hero himself will be able to grow himself by acquiring more hearts, better attack and defense statistics. Binary worms Technically we are in the average of PopCap productions, that is a good clean, colorful and immediate 2D, which allows you to read the elements of the game without disturbing the player. Some doubts are raised by the general style, a bit flat and unrefined. Given the type of product, something more could have been done. Enemies are of mixed quality. Some are well designed and very nice to look at, others are visually poor and completely anonymous. On the other hand, the animations of the fights are beautiful, with effects that seem taken from the whole plant by a two-dimensional fighting game. From the point of view of the soundtrack, the songs do their dirty work as well as the sound effects that are well suited to the setting.", "date": "2009-08-12", "grade": "8.0"}
