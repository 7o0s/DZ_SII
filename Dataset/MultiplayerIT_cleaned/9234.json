{"name": "Lone Echo 2: la recensione dell'avventura in realt virtuale a gravit zero firmata Ready at Dawn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lone-echo-2-recensione.html", "text": "The first Lone Echo, released in the now distant summer of 2017, marked the debut of Ready at Dawn in the virtual reality market after the developer had made a name for himself, willy-nilly, with The Order: 1886, the controversial exclusive for PlayStation 4. In the case of the VR game, however, critics and the public have found themselves united in judging the title very positively: a sci-fi adventure full of puzzles and exploration, which can be tackled through a first-person view with a mobility made famous by displacements in zero gravity. So famous that the software house built a sort of exclusively multiplayer spin-off around this type of movement: Echo Combat. Now, 4 years later, Ready at Dawn is finally ready to distribute an official sequel to its adventure on the market solo: Lone Echo 2, a successor that is configured in all respects as a familiar and reassuring more of the same; perfect for those who completed the original title at the time, but which could also be attractive to those who have only recently entered the VR market and want to focus on the news before recovering the best games of the past. We will therefore try to explain to you in the Lone Echo 2 review what are the strengths and weaknesses of this new chapter which, we remind you, is currently only available on PC and only for all owners of an Oculus viewer, being a 'exclusive produced by Oculus Studios of which Ready at Dawn has been part for more than a year now. The story of Lone Echo 2 In Lone Echo 2 there are some flashbacks where we will be accompanied by other robots As we said at the beginning of the review, Lone Echo 2 is a direct sequel to the original title: the adventure picks up exactly where we left off in the first chapter, with the robot Jack and the astronaut Liv catapulted 400 years into the future due to a space anomaly, and now they are busy finding a way back home, before discovering that the biomass that had haunted them centuries ago has taken over the solar system, evolved and now poses an even worse threat than in the past .Through a couple of narrative tricks, the developer has tried to meet those approaching the series for the first time with this episode, offering both a sort of synthesis of the events directly integrated into the narrative, and a particularly clever and well devised that allows the novice player to discover all the functions of Jack, the impersonated robot, but which can be easily circumvented in the event that the memories are still fresh, having perhaps recently faced the first Lone Echo. In any case, the events are narrated in an extremely similar way to what we saw in the original chapter: the backbone of the narrative is made up of the very long dialogues between our alter ego Jack and the astronaut to whom we are strongly linked Liv. During the adventure we will also interface with other characters, in particular another human survivor and a series of artificial intelligences, but the gist does not change: Lone Echo 2, in various situations, is more an interactive visual novel than an adventure of action since there will be long sequences in which we will have to limit ourselves to listening to the stories of our travel companions for minutes and minutes, or we will have to sip talkative explanations regarding the elements of the scenario with which we have to interact. Indeed, in the title of Ready at Dawn, the analysis of the environment and sometimes the interaction with the points of interest is subject to a dialogue with some co-protagonist who will have to be listened to before concrete action can be taken, generating ~interruptions~ to the normal exploratory flow. To be clear, on some occasions it will not be possible to open a hatch or explore a certain room if we have not first talked to those responsible, generating limiting situations, given that the interaction point will only unlock after completing that dialogue. Often forcing us to remain dazed for a very long time waiting for the conversation to end. In addition to the main plot, undoubtedly fascinating and full of emotions in some passages, Lone Echo 2 offers a handful of secondary activities that we could almost consider quests: basic exploratory activities and some very basic environmental puzzles. Consider that in our review session we spent just over 12 hours completing the story, dedicating ourselves to these ancillary phases for several hours. But what kind of game is Lone Echo 2? Selecting the gadget to ~mount~ on one of Jack's hands It may still not be perfectly clear so we will try, in this paragraph, to go into detailio of the gameplay of Lone Echo 2. The Ready at Dawn game is configured as an exploration adventure exclusively single player and with a first person view, full of puzzle elements and with some sporadic slightly more action sequences. Furthermore, the title can only be experienced in virtual reality. We played it with an Oculus Quest 2 viewer connected via Air Link to the PC, therefore wirelessly, but it can be played with any helmet produced by Meta's company, ex Facebook, being an exclusive produced by Oculus Studio. The peculiarity of this product, which is the element that made the original chapter famous and which we find further enhanced here, is the movement in zero gravity on which all interaction with the game world is based. In Jack's shoes we will have to continually and literally cling to surfaces, in order to be able to move using incredibly realistic physics which is based on the absence of a force of attraction and therefore on the interaction between bodies with different weights and resistances. Most of the displays and computers only serve to make the Lone Echo 2's environments more believable Opening a drawer or a hatch, as well as throwing an object or using certain gadgets that involve a recoil, will always have to be adequately studied and evaluated taking into account the absence of friction and this will oblige us to properly manage the various support surfaces. In reality we will immediately have 2 small wrist jetpacks available which will allow us to make small fine corrections and move very slowly in the environments, without having to constantly rely on the scenario; while later in the game our robot will also be equipped with more powerful thrusters capable of making us move with greater speed and also of making us slow down to a complete stop. However, the gameplay is not resolved around a loop made up of movements, explorations and very long dialogues, but the focus of Lone Echo 2, exactly like its predecessor, is the resolution of a whole series of elementary environmental puzzles, but still very satisfying thanks to the identification in the VR environment and to the great precision with which we will have to exploit the controllers, or rather our virtual hands. Jack will immediately have a plasma blowtorch at his disposal to open emergency ducts and electrical panels, but soon we will be able to equip scanners to analyze objects and drones, pulse beams to move small debris and objects from a distance, but also larger tools advanced with which to harness and inhibit energy sources and biomass that also returns in this sequel as the only threat to our free movement in the scenario. A puzzle that involves interacting with a special type of biomass: the spider's web In fact, in Lone Echo 2 we will have to deal with a single enemy: a substance that feeds on any source of artificial and organic energy and which will lead to our death in case of prolonged contact. Compared to the original title, the biomass now presents more threatening forms due to the evolution that took place in the 400 years that divide the 2 episodes: therefore it will not be limited only to covering the walls but will also be present in the form of sprawling spheres, the Ticks, in capable of moving through the environment and attaching itself to a nearby energy source. Later we will encounter other mutations of biomass that will force us to adequately manage the new gadgets or to interact in unprecedented ways with the environment but, basically, the enemy always involves a single gameplay loop: we analyze the environment and look for the of fundamental interaction to solve the puzzle in order to move forward, being careful not to touch or get too close to the biomass. There is never a real sense of progression in this challenge, let alone any enemies able to face us with intelligence or forcing us into escapes or more frenetic action: Lone Echo 2 is a thoughtful and ingenious adventure that presents a variety of puzzles quite reduced and tendentially repetitive. Although in some points the game conveys restlessness or you feel a great sense of loneliness during walks in the spatial vastness, there are no phases where aim and speed of execution count, if you exclude a couple of very short passages near the epilogue. Graphically flawless The vastness of the scenarios of Lone Echo 2 is phantasmagorical From a purely technical point of view, Lone Echo 2 is simply extraordinary, especially when compared to the other experiences that can be had in VR. Probably together with Half-Life Alyx is the best that virtual reality can offer today, especially if we take into account the quality of the characters ricreated on the screen, their animations and the vastness of the scenarios. The phases in which you will find yourself moving freely between the various structures that make up the orbiting station of Saturn, will leave you breathless in terms of credibility and sense of identification. Floating through the dust that makes up the planet's rings, floating in absolute vacuum in a pure inertia that would make us go on virtually indefinitely, is an experience that certainly deserves to be tried. All this is then adequately supported by an excellent audio compartment with very little ambient background music and an excellent acoustic rendering of voices and sounds that spread taking into account the conformation of the scenario even with the necessary artistic freedoms in function of a greater degree of identification. But be careful: Lone Echo 2 is exclusively in English, including subtitles, and this could represent a huge limitation if you don't know the Albion language given the game's enormous focus on storytelling. Liv precedes us during an exploratory phase full of dialogues However, there are various texture streaming management problems which are particularly conspicuous in the more airy sequences and, sometimes, even within restricted scenarios with annoying phenomena of incorrect management of the level of detail: it will very often happen to see very low resolution textures on many elements of the scenario that suddenly change in quality regardless of our distance. There is also a lot of aliasing and while moving in the open space it may also happen to come across very rapid loading probably linked to the need to position some sections in memory to try to keep the pop-up of the elements at bay, not always adequately on screen. Lone Echo 2 does not require much space around it to be played and can also be played in stationary mode, sitting down. In the latter case, however, it is preferable to have a swivel chair since the 360-degree movement is an integral part of the playful experience.", "date": "2022-01-07", "grade": "8.0"}
