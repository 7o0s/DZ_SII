{"name": "Postal Redux", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/postal-redux-recensione-ps4.html", "text": "We assume that Postal Redux's strong point is not the narrative component, in order not to distract from the gameplay, or so it has been declared. Basically you will impersonate the ~postal dude~ (POSTAL dude for the record) convinced that in his city a toxic gas has been released by the government that has driven all the people crazy, making them aggressive towards him. With this premise he will leave the house fully armed to eradicate the plague. The aim of the game is therefore to be able to kill a certain percentage of ~threats~ to unlock the next levels, for a total of 17 areas. We then proceed between one massacre and another until we reach the last area, the air base, in about an hour of play at a normal level. During your happy and carefree raids you will occasionally hear a male voice commenting on the various killings. Unlike what one might think, it is not the voice of the protagonist, but a sort of inner demon that incites him even more in his bloody death crusade. All very nice? Let's see how things went in the Postal Redux PS4 review. Gameplay Postal Redux: Home sweet home However we are always talking about a 1997 game, with some mechanics and a gameplay that was perhaps already dated at the time. So what is it that makes the title work in part? Let's analyze the situation. The control mode is that of twin stick shooters, so we'll use the left analog stick to move and the right one to aim in the desired direction. We will start playing armed with a machine gun with infinite shots that will soon become your best friend since the weapons that we will find scattered throughout the various levels have limited ammunition, which can be recharged by finding the bullets on the ground of the play areas. There isn't much variety in weapons either; we have 7 to be precise, including a magnum, a shotgun and a flamethrower. We will also have alternatives available, such as grenades and Molotov cocktails, which are very useful for creating even more panic in the crowd. Once an enemy has landed, we will also have the possibility of inflicting a mortal blow on him, if he is in agony. Postal Redux: How nice to stroll around with a machine gun Obviously all this massacre of people is not one way. Any armed agent or inhabitant will try with all his might to kill you. You will be able to check the health status from the indicator at the bottom, near which you will also have the bulletproof vest slot, also obtainable by searching in the various game levels. Even as regards the modalities we do not have much choice. We will only be able to decide between the History section and Rampage, fury to be precise, which will see us face the same levels of the campaign but with the aim of accumulating as many points as possible to arrive at a good evaluation. So what was it that didn't cause us to trash the game immediately after turning it on? All in all, no denying it, Postal Redux is fun. Short, not too well done, cumbersome, old, but fun. After finishing it we can put our hand on the fire that you will want to replay it to try to finish it in less time. As mentioned, the technical sector is what it is, we are simply given the exact same game from 1997 but with HD textures and effects recreated with the Unreal Engine. Unfortunately, a very good job has not been done with regard to the characters and the menus with the latter, perhaps deliberately but in this case guiltily, remaining anchored in the 90s. Unfortunately there is no multiplayer mode, neither local nor online, and not even a sort of high score leaderboard, effectively making it an old-fashioned offline single player. It is not possible to upgrade any type of weapon and not even the main character, as it is not allowed to change clothing in any way. The only ~personal~ touch we can give to everything is the selection of some visual filters, some very nice, which make the experience at least slightly different. Last note should be made on the sound. Also in this case unfortunately the homework was done, returning the effects of the old original game resampled or recreated.", "date": "2021-04-09", "grade": "6.0"}
