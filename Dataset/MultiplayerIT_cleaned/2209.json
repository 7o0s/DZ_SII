{"name": "NBA Live 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-2008.html", "text": "Game mode On the main screen we will have access to a series of game modes that are extremely different from each other but still all very entertaining and spectacular. The first mode is that of the single match, we just need to choose our team among all 82 of the official NBA championship, the opposing one and the game is done. Of course, this mode is all about immediacy and pure action that guarantees unlimited fun. The second mode is the most complex of the whole game, you can play the entire NBA season, going from the qualifying rounds to the final playoffs against the most fearsome teams in the United States. This tournament is very long and fascinating and really ensures a very high longevity for a sports game, it will surely keep you busy for a long time. But if you don't want to play the entire season, then you can use the third mode or directly access the playoffs. With this possibility you will be able to play clash and direct elimination matches with opposing teams controlled by the computer or by your friends. Finally, to make the Xbox LIVE 2002 version of NBA LIVE 2002 even more interesting, a special mode has been introduced that will surely thrill you a lot. This is a managerial aspect, in fact you will be entrusted with an NBA team for about ten years and your task will be to seek out and discover new stars from the collage leagues, personally take care of the player market and many other aspects. Gameplay Like any other version of this Electronic Arts masterpiece, the game is presented in a purely arcade style, which consequently leads to high-level playability and an immediate and simple learning scale. Being therefore pure arcade-style, we will be able to immediately perform spectacular acrobatic actions, deadly dribbles and a series of graphic goodies to scream. All this thanks to the skill of the programmers who have given their best to get the spirit and atmosphere of the most popular basketball league in the world into the game. Graphics The version for XBox, unlike the one developed for the PS2, presents an increase in fluidity and graphic effects due to the high computing power of the Microsoft console. This difference is immediately noticeable, the players are made up of a very high number of polygons and covered with detailed textures. In addition, the players are characterized by different physical aspects: different types of haircuts, the presence of tattoos on the shoulders and in other parts of the body, bandages, different types of shoes and many other details that certainly make the game even more marked and clear-cut. gaming experience. As for the animations, as always, the programmers made use of the motion capture technique, directly performed on prominent champions such as Steve Francis of the Houston Rockets. Finally, numerous ways of exultation have been introduced (about twenty) after the related baskets. Audio Being a sports game, the audio aspect doesn't particularly excel but it is appreciated on many occasions. In addition to some motifs suitable for the different situations of the match, there are excellent audio effects, such as the noise of the players moving along the field, the rebounds that are made under the basket and obviously the exultation of the public at the victory and the baskets of their team. Conclusions This version of NBA LIVE, developed for XBox, doesn't make any substantial differences compared to the one for PS2, except of course for the graphic aspect. I recommend this title to basketball fans and to those who want a high-quality, immediate and spectacular game centered on the most famous league in the world. Pros: Pure and spectacular action Lots of game modes Very realistic graphics Cons: Basically the same as the PS2 counterpart Could be repetitive in the long run EA Sports Like every year, Electronic Arts gives us a series of high quality games inspired by the most popular sports in the world (Fifa, Nba, Pga tour, F1, NHL, NFL etc.........) With the introduction of the XBox in the console market, EA is preparing to launch numerous titles including the one we will analyze in this review: NBA LIVE 2002. Obviously it is a basketball game, more precisely the most famous both in the PC market, both in the console one. This title, it should be said right away, has all it takes to be a real blockbuster for the new Microsoft console.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
