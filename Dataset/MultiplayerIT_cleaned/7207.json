Microsoft for a few years now. Rare's creativity has helped shape the ~Xbox experience~ of recent years with a distinctive trait that undoubtedly has the characteristics of the house of Twycross, although the contribution has been based less and less on those great titles that once churned out to the rhythm pretty smooth from the team. Rare's most recent mission has been the enhancement of Kinect: with the peripheral constantly looking for a precise identity and convincing applications, Microsoft has seen fit to deploy the English team to take advantage of the familiarity with the gameplay that has always characterized the team and push the motion sensing on the playful side. The results of this experiment were two Kinect Sports on Xbox 360 and now Rivals on Xbox One, the new chapter in a series that aims to bring the Wii Sports concept into the Microsoft sphere and which, while not reaching the stratospheric figures of the Nintendo title, it has however totaled some very interesting numbers on the market (about 9 million copies sold for titles on 360) giving a big hand in clearing Kinect in the living rooms of Xbox users. The choice to start the adventure on Xbox One with Kinect Sports Rivals (excluding Killer Instinct, this being essentially a Double Helix title) therefore seemed the most natural for Rare, starting from a position of strength and above all considering the pressing need, from part of Microsoft, to justify the presence of Kinect also on a playful level a few months after the launch of the console, with discussions still widely underway on the decision to place the peripheral in the Xbox One box. Perhaps the doubts about the absolute necessity of motion sensing in the Xbox experience will not be dispelled, but Rivals still manages to achieve some important results, showing an effective evolution in the technological capabilities of Kinect and ultimately managing to still provide several hours of carefree entertainment. ~physical~ and ~sweaty~ even to those who can not convince themselves of the effectiveness of this device. Digital samples The best method for demonstrating the gaming effectiveness of a motion sensing system is precisely a little movement, as Wii Sports demonstrated in a disruptive way at the time, therefore it is logical to think that the maximum expression of Kinect can be obtained with a game multi-event sports. Kinect Sports Rivals continues in the footsteps traced by the two Kinect Sports for Xbox 360, also in this case offering six sports and making everything controllable only through the Xbox One camera. It starts with the creation of your avatar, and this section already shows the research work carried out by Rare on the new potential of the Xbox One Kinect, combined with the experience gained by the team in characterizing the virtual alter egos of Xbox Live users . The console camera is able to perform a precise scan of the general conformation of the body and above all of the players' faces, building the characters based on the features then reworked on the basis of the particular graphic style adopted for the game. The result, also due to the slightly caricatured stroke chosen by the graphics, is hardly a precise copy of the user, but the resemblance is in any case clearly visible and that is enough, in any case, to create a considerable variety in the strokes of the Champions, as well as representing a intriguing solution to build a character without having to go through the usual editors. In any case, it is then possible to modify and perfect the avatars through the classic appearance modification options, as well as all the plethora of options related to aesthetic processing within the in-game shop. From here on, the game interface continues to be linked exclusively to the movement of the body, with the possibility of moving the hands to implement the selections in the menus (although the answer in this case is not always perfect), up to the actual action. The absolute precision of commands through controllers is certainly another thing, but the setting of the menus is designed here to accommodate gesture control, while Rare's likely access to more advanced APIs for the implementation of Kinect than in other cases (a random example: the disastrous Fighter Within) is evident in the general simplicity of management. The revenge of the new Xbox One Kinect and living room sports begins with Kinect Sports Rivals! The six ways of sport prFollowing the tradition, Kinect Sports Rivals offers six sports in which to try their hand, as well as its predecessors, but with different choices in each chapter. In this case we are dealing with Climbing, Jet Skiing, Bowling, Shooting, Football and Tennis. The assortment is good and provides a convincing alternation between rather different game situations, but the way in which sports are reproduced and offered via Kinect leads to qualitatively different results, both in response to commands and in the general structure of the disciplines. Climbing, Jet Skiing and Bowling are probably the most successful and enjoyable disciplines, both in terms of setting and use of Kinect, while the other three are characterized by a somewhat fluctuating trend, with Tennis showing excellent potential but requiring some adjustments in response times and Soccer and Shooting which turn out to be rather weak just as playful solutions, being also the most artificially built to fit into the context. The commands are generally simple and immediate: to control the jet skis we move our hands as if they were on handlebars and tilt the body to accommodate the curves (you accelerate by opening and closing your right hand, thanks to finger detection), in tennis we simply pretend to have a racket in hand, in bowling we pretend to have our fingers inserted into a bowl, in climbing we move our arms and tighten the grip of the hands as if we really had to grab the holds, in soccer we pass, shoot and hit butt and in target shooting we point our pistol fingers at the targets on the screen. The whole thing responds very well to commands, interpreting even more complex movements such as joint rotations and similar nuances that allow for different varieties of input and largely mitigate the ~guided~ control effect that motion sensing often inspires. In general, the response to commands has made significant progress with the new Kinect and the input lag is much lower than Xbox 360 levels, which is clearly visible in all six sports, although some uncertainty remains in some cases, with some signals that are not immediately interpreted correctly, but these are sporadic moments rather than structural problems. What remains, as a now conceptual rather than technical discrepancy, is the strange sensation of free-body movement in front of the screen given by the lack of physical feedback as a controller to be held in the hand, a characteristic inherent in the Kinect experience and for which it does not remain than get used to. The Rivals Hub A companion app called Kinect Sports Rivals Hub is also distributed with the game, which does exactly what the name says, providing a unified access point to all the news regarding this world, giving the possibility to quickly view rankings, results, videos uploads, user profiles and news. From here it is also possible to keep track of the challenges that will be periodically organized by Microsoft, such as the World Championship that will start in the next few days. In essence, it is a ~social~ compendium, linked to a separate app, probably to be able to keep track of progress without necessarily having to go from inside Kinect Sport Rivals. A vibrant world of Champions Although it is essentially a matter of trying your hand at the various sports offered alternately, the game does not give up a particular setting and also a certain narrative progression as regards the main mode, and in the classic Rare style it also presents itself with a certain characterization that projects the player into a fantastic island entirely dedicated to sport, where three teams vie for dominion over the various specialties present. In addition to the exhibition matches that focus on the various sports disciplines and give the possibility to face the game in two-player multiplayer with split screen, there is a real story to carry on, which leads us to better understand the three factions competing between special events and cutscenes, before deciding which side to take. So let's get to know the surly and traditionalist members of Team Wolf, the impeccable champions of the Eagle Team and the super-technological and ambiguous figures of the Viper Team within a story obviously a little rose water but still able to maintain interest in the game even in single player mode. The soul of the single-player game is also the character progression system which assigns experience points and ~fans~ after each performance, making him advance through different leagues and experience levels and also leading tothe accumulation of money to spend on customizing its appearance and abilities, improving its base stats and unlocking specific power-ups for each discipline. It should also be noted that the scores in terms of XP and fans also derive from the behavior held in the matches and not only from the results obtained, therefore the more spectacular and reckless our attitude is (performing maneuvers and special or ~forbidden~ shots), the more the loot of points at the end of the game will be rich. All this then affects the ubiquitous online rankings and builds the characteristics of your character for how this is presented within the game servers. With a system similar to the Drivatars of Forza 5, the Champions of Kinect Sports Rivals are in fact the characters created by the players who find themselves within the various game challenges even in single player, managed within the cloud on the basis of statistics, of the levels reached and of the specific characteristics of the various players such as virtual doubles able to always keep the level of challenge high and lively, in a sort of enlarged asynchronous multiplayer. Xbox One goals There are 54 objectives scattered across the various disciplines of the game, capable of guaranteeing the usual collection of 1000 points in total. There are therefore numerous achievements prepared along the way, almost all of 20 or 10 points in order to maximize their quantity. In principle, they are divided into objectives that are unlocked with the progress of your Champion, reaching certain levels of experience or amount of fans, and objectives that instead require particular performances in the game, therefore the complete collection requires both lasting commitment and particularly challenging in certain situations. I sing the digitized body The general aspect of the game has a lot to do with the Rare style, with the slightly caricatured look of the characters that fits perfectly into the imaginary sports world elaborated by the graphics and a truly remarkable clean line as regards the scenarios. This is certainly not the maximum graphic expression of the next-gen Microsoft console seen so far, but certain glimpses of the island settings and some effects, in particular the lighting and the water effect, are clearly the offspring of a graphics engine that exploits, at least in part, the new potential offered by Xbox One. Of course, considering that the game limits itself to putting a modest amount of elements on the screen, given that the matches take place within well-defined scenarios (apart from the jet ski races), there isn't much to cry out for a miracle , but the 1080p and 60 frames per second make their figure. The work done to link the animations of the characters to the movements imparted by the player through Kinect is also good, which, apart from a few snags, is always quite fluid. The ~vision~ problems by the camera are sporadic and have been detected in particular in some phases of the Wake Racing races, as here seated play is allowed which can lead to an incorrect scan of the player's body and in a few other situations, in general more for momentary inconveniences related to an incorrect calibration of the sensor than problems inherent in the game. Even the response to voice commands is always precise, which contributes to definitively leaving the controller aside once you enter the world of Kinect Sports Rivals. The musical accompaniment consists of a series of licensed tracks, all with a rather lively and cheerful character, which contribute to creating a general ~gym~ atmosphere, in any case appreciable given the nature of the game. Also noteworthy is the dubbing entirely in Italian, which despite some synchrony problems in the interlude scenes remains on an excellent level, typical of fully localized first party Microsoft productions. The uploads proved to be rather long and annoying, even repeating the same level several times, which is rather strange considering the relatively simple construction of the stages, in particular with regard to closed-field sports such as bowling, football or tennis.", "date": "2014-04-07", "grade": "7.5"}
