After months of absolutely nothing, the playground of the virtual reality viewer for PlayStation 4 has in fact been enriched in recent weeks with several interesting titles, more advertised such as the freshly released Farpoint or a little further from the spotlight, but still worthy of attention. Among the latter appears Statik, a game developed by the Tarsier Studios team that has recently been appreciated also for the very good Little Nightmares. After the multiplatform adventure of little Six, the Malm-based studio offers us the fruit of its experimentation with PlayStation VR, quite similar in setting to GNOG, another game we have dealt with recently. But let's not delay further, and let's find out together why we believe that Statik is particularly worthy of consideration by those who own the viewer. Statik's puzzles will keep your brain engaged in a great virtual reality experience Steady hands and an open mind If you have already played GNOG, you more or less already know what to expect from Statik. As well as the KO_OP branded title, that of Tarsier Studios in fact puts us in front of a series of puzzles to solve, divided between the various levels proposed by the game. What radically changes is the setting, which passes from the colorful monsters of GNOG to the aseptic environment of Statik, within which the sensation is that of being laboratory guinea pigs. Thus we find ourselves half asleep in a chair, in front of a certain Dr. Ingen who observes our movements and takes notes in a notebook. The most important thing, however, is that the model of our body is shown to us in the viewer with our hands locked inside a box full of strange contraptions, linked as you may have guessed to the puzzles to be solved. If for GNOG the solution of the puzzles followed a flow of experimentation on the objects present on the scene, doing the same within Statik is practically impossible: Tarsier Studios in fact asks the player to use all the senses involved in the viewer, stopping to reflect to elaborate the steps through which to move forward. Eyes wide open therefore, to notice any clues present in the environment, but also attentive ears to find the indications that are provided to us by our strange examiner. In terms of control, Statik takes advantage of all the buttons of the DualShock 4 that we have in hand, associating each of them with an action on the box in which our virtual alter ego has his hands stuck. Thus we find ourselves having to interact with levers, circuits and wheels, sometimes individually and sometimes with several elements involved; sometimes with no limit to the time available to us and sometimes with a constraint that pushes us to act quickly. The sense of involvement within this strange experiment is strong, also because the interaction doesn't stop at just the buttons: the controller itself in fact becomes the box we hold in our hands, thanks to the tracking of all the movements that are made by our hands. In addition to the psychological aspect that involves seeing oneself with one's hands inserted into the contraption, the sensation of actually having it in one's hands is therefore accentuated by the possibility of turning and rotating it as one pleases. Playstation 4 trophies Statik has a total of sixteen Trophies, all of which are Bronze-type except for a single Gold-type. Their obtaining is mainly linked to the completion of the various levels offered by the game, but those intending to complete the collection one hundred percent will also have to find some secrets scattered here and there. The solution is within us Without spoiling anyone the pleasure of solving Statik's puzzles, we limit ourselves to saying that the challenge proposed by the effort of Tarsier Studios knows how to be demanding at the right point, managing to reward the player in its own way for the mental effort put into the solution. Considering the genre to which Statik belongs, there is still the possibility of getting stuck in front of a certain puzzle on the calendar, a situation often determined by a drop in concentration on the part of the player. The surreal and claustrophobic atmosphere that reigns inside the laboratory voluntarily plays against us, starting with the examiner who is shown to us with a kind of facial blur effect that blurs his somatic features. Compared to GNOG, the Swedish team's game lacks the artistic vein of the levels a bit, but inevitably since we are moving from funny colored monsters to a serious laboratory environment. Some might find the latter a bit too monotonous, since you end up sitting at the same time all the timeor place, while few things change around us. In terms of duration, it is not to be expected to go particularly beyond three hours, even if the final bill obviously depends on the speed of the individual in finding the solutions. Wanting to distract a little from the sequence of puzzles present in Statik, the player can also watch the unfolding of a small plot, which, as far as we are concerned, however, immediately took second place to the main dynamics of the game. With this in mind, it is worth noting that the dialogues are entirely in English, as are the subtitles. However, it is advisable to activate the latter since, as already mentioned, some indications on the puzzles also come from Dr. Ingen.", "date": "2017-05-19", "grade": "8.5"}
