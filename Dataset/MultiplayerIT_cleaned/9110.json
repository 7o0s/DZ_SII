However, after having seen us at the head of a video game company, at the presidency of a spa and behind the school chairs, however, we began to believe that the Japanese developer was now running out of original ideas, continuing to recycle game mechanics and graphic material in its titles. It was therefore a pleasant surprise to find yourself reviewing this Mega Mall Story, a new game which, while maintaining a structure and graphic style consistent with Kairosoft's management past, offers them within a more varied and new system. Create a business empire As the title suggests, the new ~story~ of Kairosoft sees the player grappling with the management of a commercial structure, with the aim of transforming a small and poor supermarket into a mammoth shopping center capable of enriching the life of the entire city. In the space of 15 virtual years, you must thus complete various objectives and obtain a five-star rating for your work. The similarities with the recent Tiny Tower are different, starting from the front framing of the building which allows you to always have a clear view of each floor, but although it is a clear change compared to previous Kairosoft games, all strictly with an isometric view , that perspective is just one of the many innovations introduced. The player must populate the structure by opening new shops and hiring staff to involve and direct customers, but the number of businesses that can be opened is truly immense, starting from small bars, bakeries and greengrocers and reaching up to subway lines , cinemas and casinos. There would be many others worthy of being mentioned, but one of the strengths of Mega Mall Story is precisely its ability to amaze the player with one surprise after another and make him repeat to himself ~OK, I'll open this last cool store and then off, only to find moments later that another awesome item has been unlocked and just waiting to be purchased. Just give Mega Mall Story more than a few minutes to realize how deep it is, while remaining extremely accessible: for example, you can start sales in a given store, trying to attract customers' attention on that given floor, or you they can strategically place elevators and escalators to create an intelligent path that drives visitors past as many stores as possible. Or, again, sales can be started to increase customers, embellish a floor to make it more welcoming, manage advertisements or retain people, so that they become regular customers. There is so much iron on the fire that, like Kairosoft's previous games, Mega Mall Story proves unable to describe them all, and sometimes it happens that the player has to force himself to guess some unspoken gameplay elements. Obviously, as one's business expands, it will be necessary to increase the size of the structure in height and width, but one of the most interesting aspects is, however, represented by the possibility of investing money in the city district where the shopping center is located: it may happen that a newcomer to the city asks you for financing for his new business, and by accepting the offer he could become a trusted customer, recommend your establishment to his friends or introduce you to the managers of some chains. These moments turn out to be pleasantly strategic, with the player constantly having to choose whether to invest money in the inhabitants of the neighborhood, keep them aside to buy that expensive supermarket or keep them in case of gray economic times. The control system via touch screen is undoubtedly more precise and responsive than Game Dev Story, although once its structure has been expanded it is necessary to move the camera frequently and perform continuous zooms. Finally, what makes Mega Mall Story a much more enjoyable and successful game than Tiny Tower is above all the independence, in terms of design, from a marketing model such as that of free to play: if in the colorful casual game by NimbleBit the player often finds himself with his hands folded because he has not purchased virtual credits through DLC, in Kairosoft's management you are always studded with things to do and decisions to choose, so much so that it will be really difficult to tireburned before reaching the maximum level.
