All enclosed in a cartridge set in the most famous handheld in the world. Codemaster hasn't tweaked this GBA release, no filings to make TOCA more user-friendly on a handheld console. The original DNA of the series is imported and put at the service of the hardware of the case. The options make you regret nothing of the more ~muscular~ versions; inevitable Quick race and Free Race, Time Trial, the main Championship mode (including ~Career~, i.e. experiencing the escalation of your driver's career) and multiplayer for up to four players (via link cable). The tracks present are those that we have come to know well, from Nurburgring to Silverstone, from Brands Hatch to the inevitable Monza if you embark on the European adventure passing from Vancouver to Mexico City in the Pan-America Tour up to landing at Sugo nel Sol Levant. The backbone of the game undoubtedly lies in the Championship mode thanks to which it is possible to unlock new circuits and cars (present the touring models of Ford, Toyota, Volvo, Saab, Mitsubishi, Renault, FIAT, Alfa Romeo, Audi and TVR ). Thus begins a real personal march to become number one by going through a series of tests that will determine the offers from the different teams to which to bind to attempt the climb. The amount of variables regarding the preparation of the machine is at least important. Every parameter can be adjusted, from the simple choice of tyres, to the anti-roll bar up to the ratios between the gears and the appropriate suspensions; all of which clearly influence the course of the race. Engines in da Pocket From a technical point of view, this ~mini~ version of TOCA behaves more than discreetly, flaunting a beautiful reconstruction of the car models framed within solid layouts that allow you to see, even with a certain advance, dangerous curves in the distance (in case your eye escapes the classic, great map at the bottom of the screen). Of course, the pop-up exists but it ends up affecting only surrounding elements such as bleachers or trees, while the slopes offer a good overview often linked to well-chosen backdrops and on more than one occasion decidedly valuable. Closing the discussion on the graphics sector, it should be emphasized that the latter experiences ups and downs due to some situations such as the wet track effect created with much less care than the much happier ~Sunny Day~. Having ascertained that the Codemaster title can be watched and also appreciated on several occasions, we point out that its strength lies once again in the tastefully simulative gameplay. The interface proves to be extremely functional through three keys plus the directional cross (A=Accelerator, B=Brake, R=Handbrake) and after a handful of laps you begin to get familiar with drifting and countersteering with a disarmingly simple as well as pleasantly challenging. Yes, because that TOCA DNA we were talking about in the opening of the review has also remained intact on GBA. Victory must be hard-earned and earned corner after corner and what makes it even more rewarding is the artificial intelligence of the contenders (seven in total, excluding you, of course) who you will admire cutting corners, rear-ending, making their way through the wrong setting, thus performing in the lead continuous queue, in short, all the possible variables are also valid for the cars managed by the cpu. The sound does its job, quite convincing effects (skids, bumps and the roar of the opponents that approaches or moves away after an overtaking) seasoned with simple but tasteful grooves that accompany the various menus. Comment TOCA World Touring Cars is a good title. At first one is led to think that a console like the GBA lends itself more to hosting slightly more arcade driving games and that a ~brand~ like that of the Codemasters can hardly be contained in the 32bit Nintendo but after a few games it changes easily idea, given that the work on the simple gameplay has been very accurate up to making the races challenging but never frustrating. TOCA also offers its best features on GBA, accompanied by a pleasant cosmetic and with the taste of enclosing a good slice of the world of engines in a jeans pocket. PROS: Excellent Playability Pleasantly Challenging (like every TOCA) Lot of important options and maniacal settings. Very good car models. CONS: Graphic realization of the circuits with ups and downs Sound effects in the norm. Get out of my dreams... The TOCA series conquered, at the hands of the Codemasters, a large group of enthusiasts on consoles, also thanks to its first appearance on Sony's 32-bit, where technical realization and a damned simulative and captivating gameplay made the final experience the most realistic and satisfying one could find on the scene, at the time of the great PSOne boom. Toca has remained deeply tattooed in the soul of the fans who have eagerly awaited the transition to 128 bits without hiding a hint of disappointment for a title which, while showing the usual and priceless playability, also offered cosmetics that weren't too up to date with the times. Today, it's the turn of the GBA which, now known for not missing out on anything, adds this TOCA World Touring Cars to its immense soft library.", "date": "2003-07-17", "grade": null}
