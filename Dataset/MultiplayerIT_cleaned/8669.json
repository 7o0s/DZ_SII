Sequel to a title released in 2007 on PSP, the game re-proposes the stealth dynamics so dear to Acquire since the first Tenchu, therefore it encourages silent eliminations and completed missions without our character being identified. Those were the years of PSone and since then water has passed under the bridge, but unfortunately time has not brought with it any substantial changes; and so the adventure of Zen, the protagonist of this new production, immediately arises, in the eyes of the more elderly gamers, as the legacy of a certainly fascinating but, indeed, outdated past. There are many games that ~under the hood~ hide a structure that has remained unchanged over the decades, but in the specific case of Shinobido 2 the developers have unfortunately done very little to mask the limits of the experience; starting with the plot, which tells in a very superficial way of the betrayal of a ninja who, eager to appropriate a series of magical mirrors that could allow him to conquer the world, does not hesitate to kill members of his own clan. The latest victim is San, romantically linked to the protagonist, Zen, who doesn't have time to save her and therefore decides to dedicate the rest of his life to revenge. The undertaking is not easy, because the enemy has proven to be powerful and ruthless, and so the ninja is persuaded by an ally to study the situation well, to train by completing some missions for the daimyos who compete for the region and acquire the skill and determination necessary to quench his thirst for blood. Choose your destiny After some useful tutorials to familiarize yourself with the control system, Shinobido 2: Revenge of Zen offers us a series of missions that we can accept under the employ of three different lords: Ichijo, a wise leader who wishes to put an end to the conflicts that are tearing region; Kihan, opportunist and absolutist, a ruthless woman who knows no half measures; Kazama, leader of a rebel army obsessed with the struggle for power. Remaining faithful to a daimyo translates into the acquisition of some bonus items, but in reality it is possible to continue in the game by placing one's services at the disposal of all three commanders, which is clearly not justified in narrative terms. It's not so much moving from one faction to another that influences the progress of the story and leads us to witness one of the three possible endings, as much as the choices we will be called to make from a certain point on. It can be said that most of the time we will spend killing overly greedy merchants, stealing or transporting documents, freeing imprisoned maidens or eliminating warriors deemed dangerous by our instigator on duty, which will allow us to level up the character and prepare for the challenges more demanding, that is, those that actually produce a step forward from the point of view of the plot and which often lead to a boss fight. On paper, a structure of this type wouldn't even be bad, were it not for the incredible repetitiveness of the situations and scenarios: during the tests we found ourselves killing the exact same merchant at least three times, within the exact same scenario and with the guards stationed in the same way, which obviously resets both the degree of challenge and the general interest in completing these - albeit necessary - side quests. Stories of ninjas The impression is that the developers have thought of so many things to include in the game, to enrich it, to forget to take care of the basics. Zen can collect objects and ingredients around to then devote himself to crafting and create concoctions of various kinds or simply spend the money earned to buy the same equipment, but once in action all these details leave room for the paucity of a gameplay that is rarely exploits the many potentialities of the franchise. In the first place, the management of the view works really badly despite the presence of the second analog stick, it is particularly slow and it is not possible to adjust its sensitivity. In addition, when we press the backbone R to sneak the camera automatically centers itself, forcing us to move it again in case we were using it to keep an eye on a guard at close range. One of the most commonly used toolsthe grappling hook, requires a rather awkward combination of commands to be activated: you have to hold down the right backbone together with the Circle button, then move the left stick to aim and finally press down on the d-pad to launch: at least two keys too much for the maneuver to boast any effectiveness in excited situations, or when it could come in handy to get us out of trouble. Furthermore, by default, the grappling hook is launched by pressing your fingers on the rear touch pad, but it is an absolutely nefarious feature, to be deactivated immediately, because it conflicts with the physical keys and is activated by mistake all too often. On the other hand, the eye-shaped icons on the touch screen are good, which indicate the guards present in the vicinity and, once pressed, automatically move the view to indicate their position. Playstation 3 trophies Shinobido 2: Revenge of Zen contains fifty-one Trophies, most of which are quite simple to obtain as they are linked to the completion of natural actions: completing the various missions, carrying out an operation for the first time and so on. However, there are also ~specialist~ Trophies, which imply the finding of particular objects within the scenarios. With sword blows The satisfaction of completing a mission without being seen, silently killing some guards and perhaps using the unprecedented special maneuvers at a distance (which consume a special bar) is intact, and from this point of view the charm of the franchise is undeniable. Unfortunately, however, the system as a whole does not appear solid and it doesn't take much for the experience to become extremely cumbersome and frustrating: the eliminations from behind work well, but the ~frontal~ combat system really leaves something to be desired in its excessive simplicity and reveals a basic enemy artificial intelligence, given that when there are more than one opponents and tight spaces, they don't hesitate to hit each other in an awkward attempt to damage our character. As far as the technical sector is concerned, it is evident how the developers have recovered a lot of materials from the previous PSP episode, simply adapting them to the new platform for resolution and textures. The polygonal models are in fact very angular and the scenarios characterized by simple structures, while the textures that cover certain surfaces (rocks, the ground) appear excessively repetitive. Finally, the options do not allow you to replace the English speech with the original Japanese one.", "date": "2012-03-16", "grade": "7.0"}
