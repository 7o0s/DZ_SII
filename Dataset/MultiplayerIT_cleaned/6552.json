Over time, the franchise has certainly evolved from a technical point of view, and the debut on PlayStation 4 is in fact accompanied by a remastering work that brings the graphics to 1080p and granite sixty frames per second, seasoning everything with spectacular explosions and a plentiful amount of special effects as well as the option to view in 3D. However, it cannot be said that the gameplay has also undergone the same transformation, remaining instead anchored to mechanisms that are solid and engaging, but which inevitably feel the weight of the years. And so, if some interesting experiments had been made with Super Stardust Delta, introducing a bivalent arsenal that also influenced the use of smart bombs, thus opening up a whole series of new possibilities, the same does not happen in Super Stardust Ultra, which equal the experience seen on PlayStation 3 in 2007, precisely that of Super Stardust HD. Turn that turns you around The assumptions of Super Stardust Ultra are simple, and the nine different single player modes and multiplayer (competitive and cooperative, for up to four participants but unfortunately only locally) try to dissect them by playing the card of variations on the theme. The objective in the game is to shoot everything that moves, according to the traditional canons of twin analog shooters, therefore with the left analog stick to regulate the movement of the ship (customizable using an editor, albeit with few options) and that right to direct the fire, while the upper back keys alternate between the three available and upgradeable weapons: a shower of green bullets, ideal for destroying brown rocks; a concentrated blue beam, capable of shredding blocks of ice; and finally a fire ~whip~ of extraordinary power, capable of melting the golden formations. The layout of the controls is completed by the use of the triggers, which are used to activate the smart bomb, capable of quickly cleaning up the surrounding area from enemies, or an effective shot that transforms our vehicle into a disruptive space ram, especially useful when you need to get away quickly from a hot area. The context is that of a handful of spherical ~planets~, around which fragments of asteroids, enemy ships and even huge bosses soon end up orbiting. The main mode, Arcade, will see us face various stages within five planets, arriving at the confrontation with the boss on duty and then moving on to the next world. A demanding mission, which will require quick reflexes, precision and skillful management of weapons, both standard and special ones, in order to survive the many opponents and the dangers that will surround us at all times. Once the available spacecrafts (three, by default) have run out, it will in fact be game over and we will have to start the last planet all over again, possibly selecting a different degree of difficulty among those present. Super Stardust Ultra remains a solid and challenging analog twin shooter, but the competition is stiff Playstation 4 trophies The twenty-seven Trophies present in Super Stardust Ultra are divided into two parts. A first half is obtained simply by completing the various planets, thus progressing in Arcade mode or by selecting individual scenarios. As for the rest of the achievements, however, you have to conquer them by completing particular operations, for example obtaining a x10 multiplier, collecting ten bombs in a row, obtaining the maximum upgrade for all weapons simultaneously, completing a planet in less than five minutes in time attack, getting to the end of a mission without ever dying, surviving forty-five seconds without opening fire, and so on. The contour The Arcade mode undoubtedly represents the fulcrum of the Super Stardust Ultra experience and offers a fair duration if you want to complete it at all difficulty levels, although five planets in the end are a bit few to aim for astronomical longevity. As mentioned, however, the developers (in this case D3T and XDEV, who have reworked the original work of Housemarque) have tried to offer a side dish of extra modes to enrich the offer, focusing on potentially unprecedented situations. Modes such as Without End (the traditional survival with infinite enemies and dangers, in which the aim is for the high score) or Survival (in which the spacesor is soon filled with small indestructible satellites, to be avoided at all costs), as well as Bombardier (where you can fight using only the smart bomb, provided you have some available), Impact (another unarmed variation, with the only turbo to be used to ram the opponents) and Barricade (in which our ship is constantly ~chased~ by a tail of rocks), which are supported by traditional options such as time attack or the mode in which it is possible to face a single planet . Finally, the Interactive Streaming function is very interesting, which allows you to broadcast your own match (or watch another player's) with the public voting for your performance, thus influencing the worsening of the difficulty. It is a pity that all these variants in the end do not exercise the charm of the standard single player, quickly revealing their experimental nature and running out of cartridges in a short time.", "date": "2015-02-20", "grade": "7.0"}
