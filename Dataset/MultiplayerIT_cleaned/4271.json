An absolutely shareable choice, considering how the offer of Major Mayhem 2 is still today very valid and above all fresh, given the rather small presence of similar titles on the market. The workaholic of justice Major Mayhem 2 begins with the sinewy protagonist who is enjoying a well-deserved beach holiday after the heroic deeds of the previous episode: an idyllic situation which unfortunately is soon ruined by the thugs of the Evil Villains Corporation, who burst onto the scene with guns blazing, forcing the major to immediately put his hand to the gun to save the world and go back to his lounge chair. An incipit slimmer than ever that only serves to justify the presence of 50 levels divided into various settings, to be tackled through a linear path with the canonical presence of a three-star rating system that decrees the player's performance. Structure and narrative are certainly not the strengths of Major Mayhem 2, which in fact places the emphasis almost entirely on fun and well-constructed gameplay. As mentioned at the beginning, the title is essentially inspired by shooters with light guns such as the unforgettable Time Crisis: the character therefore moves alone on a pre-established path, and when he reaches a cover he takes cover independently from enemy fire, with the user who must perform taps on opponents peeping in the background to order the major to come out and shoot at their address. In the authentic forest of bullets that forms on the screen, you have to pay attention to the bullets marked by a red circle, the only ones that can injure the protagonist if they reach him: each shot immediately involves the loss of a piece of armour, and the third hits the game over. All very simple to explain and even more to play, with Major Mayhem 2 confirming itself as an extremely immediate and fun product, perhaps even more than its predecessor thanks to some tricks adopted by Rocket Jump. First of all, the dynamism of the action has been increased not only by the great variety of settings, but also and above all by the introduction of phases on board vehicles and by the more massive use of the jump function (to be activated by swiping the finger upwards or by pressing the virtual button at the bottom right) which opens the way to short platform sections and to moments in which it is necessary to dodge bullets in this way given the absence of covers. The costumes and power-ups of the prequel were then abandoned to favor a suitably revised and corrected system for purchasing and upgrading weapons: Major Mayhem 2 has as many as 20, adequately divided between pistols, machine guns, rifles and so on, each with its own specific stats and a different behavior on the battlefield. With the coins earned during the levels it is possible to unlock and upgrade the available specimens, for a model that certainly is not detached from the typical dynamics of free to play (by spending real money the progression is infinitely faster) but which behaves substantially balanced, without putting their hands in the user's pockets at all costs and allowing them as much as possible to reduce time or multiply the rewards by watching some commercials. Returning to the actual game, Rocket Jump's evident commitment to level design certainly deserves applause, with stages that always manage to offer something new to the user during the entire adventure. The five battles with the bosses are also spectacular, moreover able to highlight the excellent graphic design of the product.", "date": "2018-05-09", "grade": "8.7"}
