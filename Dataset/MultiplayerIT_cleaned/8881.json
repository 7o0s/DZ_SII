After the explosion in the mid-90s, the series seemed destined - in the GameCube / Game Boy Advance era - to lose its prominent place, sitting between emerging brands such as Mario Tennis, Golf and, above all, Super Smash Bros. of the last decade, no one could sensibly bet that Mario Kart, at the end of 2010, would have sold more than one saga like GTA. Yet that is what happened. Mario Kart DS has placed twenty-two million units, while the chapter for the Wii, bundled with a small steering wheel, is now about to cross the thirty million milestone. Astronomical figures, inaccessible for any other brand, excluding the recent Wii Sports and New Super Mario Bros. This is because, just like the titles listed above, Mario Kart is able to address a huge audience. The fact that between Double Dash and the DS episode there have not been huge changes in content - but there have been significant differences in sales - leaves us doubting its potential as a killer application, triggering the suspicion that much of the credit must be attributed to to the installed base of Wii and DS: from this point of view, this edition for 3DS will give many answers. At full throttle If a review were really limited, as some claim, to recommending or not the purchase of a product, this article could end here, because the answer can only be positive. Nintendo is often accused of being unoriginal, of rarely introducing new IPs, of making games that are too similar to themselves; anyone who has really experienced the various episodes of Mario and Zelda, the main targets of these criticisms, knows very well how these observations are (generally) baseless. Mario Kart, at least for some years, has been an exception: more than new chapters, the various releases represent a sort of update - with new tracks, obviously - of the previous edition. The one that worked remains, the one that didn't work is discarded. Were the two Double Dash characters not appreciated? Street. Has snapping - that is, repeated power slides - sown discord among users? Out. Was the Mario Kart Wii online game well received? Inside. It is a Darwinian process, which involves constant adjustments, but does not allow for revolutions, as happens for many other successful brands. Having found an almost perfect guide system already on the Wii, Nintendo has decided to re-propose it unchanged; on the contrary, he eliminated the motorcycles that upset him a bit. You can take advantage of the slipstream of your opponents to obtain a small acceleration, the power slide arrives after several seconds of charge - so as to prevent, as mentioned before, the phenomenon of snapping - and you get slight boosts by jumping at the right moment at the end of a ramp, big or small. There are three differences from the Wii version, two positive and one negative. The first is the re-introduction of coins, which, just like on the SNES, guarantee greater top speed, and therefore facilitate solitary escapes, rewarding merit. The second is represented by the flying sections and the aquatic ones, which work wonders: the aerial phases fit so spontaneously into the ride that we would not be surprised to see them again in the future, while the potentially harmful marine ones prove to be effective because they are used more for emergencies than to fill the track design (once dropped in the water, rather than being brought up, you keep driving). The negative note however is the forced absence of the steering wheel. It's not necessarily a question of preferring the motion controls to traditional controls, simply the trajectory of the kart appears more blocked, less sensitive: if even going straight with the steering wheel requires attention, with the analog stick you have far too much control over the modulation of the curves. The first person mode is an interesting introduction, which will probably flourish in the next home console episode, here it is penalized a bit by the combined analog / gyroscope controls. The 3D effect Nintendo confirms, without too many surprises, the software house capable of managing the three-dimensional effect of its laptop more effectively. In Mario Kart this option is less incisive than in the recent Super Mario 3D Land, but still capable of adding a pleasant depth that never bothers and which appears as an integral part, and not a simple tinsel, of the graphic component. One pound more Balancing the Mario Kart equation isn't easy at all. This time Nintendo has done a great job from the point of view of the karts, so it is possible to choose your favorite character without fearing certain defeat. Yesit is a clear improvement compared to the last chapters, which all had an ~elected~ kart; here too it seems that there is a more performing vehicle than the others, but it is unlocked only after several hours of play and, above all, the tires must still be chosen based on the circuit, not in absolute terms. Even the power-ups are dosed quite well: still far from the perfection of the progenitor for the SNES and the iteration for Nintendo 64, they never degenerate into the nuclear cataclysms dished up by Mario Kart Wii, also thanks to the reduction of the runners from twelve to eight. The flower and the leaf are excellent introductions, and even the potentially devastating ~7~ bonus should be used with care; probably it would have been enough to eliminate the rocket and give the tail a chance to counter the blue shell to make everything almost perfect, but we are satisfied with the progress. Progress that also concerns online play, also very similar to the Wii episode, with the novelty of communities: in addition to gathering in groups and easily tracking down friends, rules can be established to customize the race (no weapons, for example ). All pleasant news that will optimistically be explored in the future. On the other hand, the absence of names above the characters, an element present since the DS edition, is inexplicable. Multiplayer, both online and offline, is the real engine of the game. If find another 3DS owner is not - yet? - so easy, just any Wi-Fi line is enough to venture into the net. As usual, there are battles to accompany the standard races, and entering this mode it becomes obvious that certain karts, apparently useless in races, have been specifically designed for these sections. The only aspect that doesn't fully convince of Mario Kart 7, a solid game from any point of view - technically granite, also thanks to the fairy hands of Retro Studios - is the track design: it's not poor, but it doesn't even touch excellence . A wasted opportunity, because the work done with the restyling of the old runways (sixteen) is extraordinary: faithful in essence but adapted to new needs, with new flight (and aquatic) sections wisely arranged. The problem with the new circuits (sixteen too), in a nutshell, is that you don't drive much. Very little. The difficulties arise more from avoiding obstacles - ravines, boulders, hills, winds, lava - than from the complexity of the tracks, which are all too stingy with demanding curves. And that's a shame, because the idea of creating long tracks, divided into sections rather than laps, is to be rewarded. The direct comparison with the circuits inherited from SNES and GBA, however, remains merciless: among the new ones, none can compare with the old Mario Circuit (or Bowser's castles). The dirt tracks, the arenas full of jumps, the objects that annoy the ideal trajectory of the car: all elements introduced to vary the gaming experience, but which gradually, in particular from Mario Kart Wii, have taken over the circuits traditional, to the point of almost completely supplanting them. And that's not a good thing, because the game isn't called Mario Rally.", "date": "2011-12-07", "grade": "8.8"}
