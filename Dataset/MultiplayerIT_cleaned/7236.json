At this point we could say to look for it on the shelves of the best video game stores but in reality one of the main - and most exciting - features of the game is the fact that it is free to play. To download and play it you pay absolutely nothing and no content is blocked or hidden behind the mask of microtransactions: the latter are present, but totally optional and perfectly ignorable. This is certainly the strength of Hearthstone which has thus attracted a much wider audience than the niche one that plays Collectible Card Games (CCG) also embracing - and above all - Warcraft fans, the brand that inspires the game in its entirety. However, that of card games is certainly not a genre that is easy to manage and from the outset there was no lack of perplexity about the path taken by Blizzard and about the real capabilities of the development team, made up of just a handful of programmers but determined to bring the I play not only on PC and Mac but also on iOS and Android in the near future. Will they really have what it takes to make it? Blizzard wins Hearthstone's bet with an intuitive, addictive and completely free CCG Rock, paper and scissors In case you've never heard of Hearthstone - or CCGs in general, like Yu-gi-oh! and Magic the Gathering - it's worth a little refresher on game mechanics. To learn more, we suggest you read the mini guide for beginners that we published a few weeks ago, but in essence Hearthstone allows you to challenge a series of computer-controlled opponents and other human players in exciting card games. On the game table, duelists can deploy the cards drawn from turn to turn, as long as they meet certain conditions: the most important is the player's ~mana~, a resource that recharges and increases with each turn and that the cards played consume from time to time. at a time, thus limiting the number of actions that can be performed per turn. The aim of the game is to defeat the opponent by zeroing his life points in different ways, for example by attacking him directly or by making him hit by our minions, or the cards we have deployed: some in fact, can be played every turn until they are eliminated. time by the opponent or his minions. Considering that the game boasts almost four hundred cards with the most varied powers and that each player is represented by a ~hero~, or a character from the Warcraft saga who embodies the classes of the famous MMORPG set in the universe and therefore has abilities and mechanics different, it is clear that each game turns out to be a refined battle of cunning that leverages not only on the luck of the players and on the cards they draw but also, and above all, on their ability to predict the opponent's moves, on the construction of their personalized deck and on pure and simple tactics. In short, from this point of view, Hearthstone fascinated us right from the start precisely because of the very soft learning curve proposed, which makes it absolutely suitable even for those who have never touched a CCG, and also for the imagination and intelligence with which most of the cards have been designed: which allows you to build an infinite number of different decks and to dabble with the most disparate strategies. Each card is described, both textually and visually, in a clear and precise way, and a very quick glance is enough to understand how it will work once deployed. But is the competitive stage really characterized by all this fantasy and variety? One hand washes the other Let's immediately answer the question with which we closed the previous paragraph: no. Long live the synthesis. In a sense, Hearthstone inherits from the ~father~ World of Warcraft one of the dramas in which Blizzard has stumbled for years and with which it still racks its brains, namely the balance of the ~classes~. All in all, the idea of Hearthstone heroes works and is very intriguing: each of them corresponds to a basic deck, which once unlocked expands the player's card collection allowing further combinations, and their peculiar mechanics drastically alter the way in which decks are built and cards are played. The problem though, is that some heroes are quite simply stronger than others. And in a competitive game like Hearthstone, where ranked play and structured Arena are at its heart, most players just want to win. Hence the discouraging diffusion of photocopy decks, played above all by Warriors and Hunters that welllend themselves to combinations of deadly cards - developed by the best players in the world and spread over the internet - capable of wiping out virtually any opponent. Of course, victory or defeat ultimately depends on who plays, because even the best deck in the world is perfectly useless in the hands of the inept and with a little cunning and an ounce of luck it is perfectly possible to enjoy Hearthstone even when you meet yet another Garrosh. However, it is sad to see Blizzard once again in difficulty with one of the most controversial aspects of its management of World of Warcraft, which we suspect will be subjected over the months to a cycle of ~buffs~ and ~nerfs~ that will force the best players to study new strategies to get them cloned by pretty much everyone else. The situation suffers less in the Arena mode, where the player is forced to build a temporary deck with the cards proposed by the title and which therefore always proves to be very varied and exciting, moreover accessible only after having become fairly familiar with the mechanics of the game . Hearthstone isn't exactly rich in modes, but in the end it is the Arena that redeems them all: to play a game it is necessary to pay in gold coins (earned by completing the ~missions~ proposed daily) but in the end, even by winning the minimum match union, you get back to even and, above all, you earn new cards. Those who are in a hurry can get around this limitation by swiping their credit card: both the expansion packs and access to the Arena can be purchased with real money and these are the only microtransactions offered by Hearthstone. I have it, I have it, I miss it It is important to underline once again that spending in euros is completely optional: the cards in the sleeves are random and whether euros or gold coins have been spent, the notorious duplicates will end up showing up in any case. The impossibility of exchanging cards between players has been widely criticized, as it is a fundamental feature in real card games, but as much as we miss it, we could not help but share Blizzard's choice, which in this way has prevented this community from bending over to the sale of contents, legal or illegal as it is. To compensate, there is a truly ingenious feature that allows you to ~disenchant~ the cards, that is, to destroy them by obtaining materials with which it is possible to manufacture new ones. The quality of the desired card will require more or less materials and therefore a certain commitment on the part of the player/collector who wants to complete his collector, perhaps even with the very rare legendary cards. In the long run the process becomes a bit stressful because the rarer cards obviously require a disproportionate amount of materials which, in turn, forces the player to accumulate more cards and, therefore, to play more and more. On the other hand, with no monthly subscription biting our tails and thanks to a matchmaking routine that we felt was very well implemented, it's practically impossible to ~get stuck~ without the slightest chance of winning, and completing the binder is a process that luck or otherwise, it can take thousands of game rounds. Furthermore, the matches are not only fun to play, but also to watch and listen to: the care that the small Blizzard team has placed in the creation of Hearthstone is truly obsessive, thanks also to the perfect choice of visual effects, music and sound samples. If the guys from Irvine wanted to convey the idea of a game played in a World of Warcraft tavern, they succeeded perfectly, amidst the applause and cheers of the audience and the clinking of coins and cutlery. Games of Hearthstone invoke a sense of ~physicality~ in the placement of each card and in their interactions, with a heavy use not only of the language of Warcraft but also of its most characteristic visual and audio effects. In short, for fans of the blockbuster MMORPG, Hearthstone is a real novelty, and for those who have never played World of Warcraft it simply remains a splendid collectible card game to see in action.", "date": "2014-03-24", "grade": "8.5"}
