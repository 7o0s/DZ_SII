Before focusing on all the novelties, many if compared to those of Pes4, present in this fifth episode of the series, let's cut the bull's head, as they say, and immediately say that compared to its Japanese counterpart, Pes5 loses slightly in fact of ~total control over the player~, and a little bit on the ~physics that regulate the impacts~, but gains in the fun phase. Following these changes, which as usual KTYO wanted to make on the Pal version of its football title, to make it a little easier, the result is a slightly more frenetic playability in some ways (nothing exaggerated anyway), but at the same time at the same time less fragmented by the continuous referee whistles that are sometimes too severe or by the continuous clashes between the players, aspects that at times tormented the mental balance of the less experienced video gamers of the Japanese version. This, believe us, in some ways is beneficial to the gameplay, because if it is true that in WE9 the inherent difficulty in manually recalling your player who responded to the command only after pressing the appropriate key even if you set the ~automatic~ option to the maximum , or in avoiding full-on pressing with the X button, effectively forcing us to a more attentive approach to the defensive phase, could have pleased the purists of the genre, it is also true that many did not like it, because, in fact , all these ~parameters~ ended up raising the difficulty level of a title that was already very complicated to play, even if it was satisfying precisely because of its realism. Finally, the Road to World Cup 2006 with Japan is missing, while the usual game modes are present, well known by the players. Pes5 Vs Pes4 For the rest however, compared to its ~real~ predecessor for the Pal market, namely Pes4, this fifth chapter offers a whole series of sometimes marked innovations, from more detailed graphics to improved gameplay, passing through a whole series of goodies which we are going to analyze immediately. The first important change concerns the physics that manages the tackles and the ball. This parameter is now simply perfect, to the point that, for example, with each physical contact with an opponent the player will lose a little balance, exactly as it happens in reality, falling or struggling to stand depending on the physical size, but without however, witnessing situations in which Shevchenko-like attackers resist everything up to flying towards the goal as if it were made of steel, a questionable thing seen in Pes4. An Adriano, another example, will hardly fall to the ground from a simple hold, but will suffer a slowdown or loss of the ball if it is touched in such a way as to be unbalanced. Therefore, a strong change also follows in the way of operating the pressing: forget about abusing the X key, as we tended to do in the previous chapter. This time, holding down this button will cause your players closest to the ball on defense to run towards the advancing opponent, but unlike Pes4, this initiative won't always allow you to take the ball away from them, but seven out of ten will commit a foul, since an improvement in the physical impacts will cause the impetuous pressing to cause your man to commit an infringement. This doesn't mean at all that it shouldn't be used at all, of course, only that from now on, in order to effectively contrast the opponents, it will be advisable to use both the slides, choosing the right intervention time, and the directional cross, since depending on the movement of the latter, for example when you find yourself shoulder to shoulder with an opponent, your player will stretch his hands, use his shoulder, try to move the ball from the other's feet with his foot, etc. Control is everything The renewed physics of Pes5 also has a positive effect on the ~weight~ and on the trajectory of the ball. The latter is rendered perfectly, certainly more than a head above compared to past editions, with a coherent feeling of ~heaviness~ of the sphere in every situation. In relation to how it will be hit by the soccer player, the rebounds or the type of terrain, it will behave exactly like a real ball on a real soccer field, assuming non-predefined trajectories. As a result of these two aspects that we have analyzed up to now, i.e. physical impacts between players and with the ball, shots in porta and the steps take on greater complexity in their calibration and implementation. Kicking into goal with a full neck from outside the area with remarkable precision, or making a peremptory header in the small area, will be the result more of one's skill and ability to get the player who is controlled to coordinate well, freeing him in time from a tight marking, rather than by chance or by a frenzied tinkering with the Square key. In such situations it becomes essential to know how to anticipate the man to dominate the ball, especially on high balls. Here, if an opponent gets between you and the ball, you will never be able to blow it away without committing an aerial or behind foul. Taking advantage of the most sophisticated management system of the individual player on the field, in fact, you will have to make him unmark by taking control of him and perhaps directing him towards the crossed ball before pressing the button concerning the shot. The control of your virtual favorites, more complicated than in the past in the ball possession phase, is also essential when setting up the action, since it doesn't take much, a movement too much the moment before receiving the ball or a choice of incorrect tempo in dictating the pass to make a mistake and start the opponent's maneuver. A realistic physics Even in one-two with partner, of course, there is nothing predefined, no help from the CPU. We do everything ourselves, so don't expect to return the ball to the man who started the play by simply pressing the appropriate button without aiming the ball at him yourself. Otherwise the ball will go to the opponents. The latter have also undergone an evolution. The AI of the teams managed by the game appear more credible both in the way of being on the pitch, in the construction of the action, in the defensive phase and even in the substitutions. The CPU is very fierce and knows how to ~reason~: ~its~ teams manage the ball if they have the advantage in their own half as the most skilled and shrewd big teams would do in reality, often making you lose your temper in an attempt to recover the ball and the result, or they will be more daring by attacking you across the board if they have to come back, perhaps risking a little behind. Fundamental in these cases not to lose your head and reciprocate it with the same coin by turning the ball or attempting the action on the counterattack, perhaps jumping over the last defender with a precise throw to climb over the opponent's rear line towards our most advanced forward, or with a personal play with dribbling and aiming at the net to close the match. Speaking of feints, it should be noted the integration of the one executable with the R2 key of Pes4, the one that occurs with lateral movement, directly in the movement keys, those of the Directional Cross. At first this movement can be a little uncomfortable, but once you get the hang of it it becomes simple to manage and useful. The database The only ~real~ flaw of Pes5 therefore appears to be in principle constituted by the imprecise database of players. Once again, in fact, Konami presents us with absolutely not updated rosters. If it is true that compared to past years we find teams that also include players bought during the summer market in their rosters, at least as regards the big clubs, therefore Viera at Juve or Gilardino at Milan, just to give two concrete examples, it is it is also true that in them we also find players who have nothing or almost nothing to do with the various teams, such as Sculli and Max Vieri who inexplicably result in the formation of Juventus! Even if it is still possible to arm yourself with patience and update everything via the internal editor, this can be annoying. Just as annoying, is the tendency according to which to remedy the lack of certain licenses for the use of the real names of some teams or players, one has to resort to tricks such as renaming the various champions with fake names based on the real ones , even if very recognizable by assonance of pronunciation or physical appearance. In fact, if the thing does not weigh that much in the Japanese version of the game, given the incomprehensibility of Kabira and her particular way of pronouncing the call names of the various players, which makes even the fake names seem real after all, in the version Italian thing out of place a lot. Once again national teams of great prestige such as Germany or the Netherlands will have rosters that are not real, and unusually, also some club teams of championships of which KTYO holds the rights for the exploitation of the images and all that follows, such as the Cagliari, here they don't have the official shirts, so much so that for the occasion the Sardinian club was renamed ~Teste di Moro~... Graphsly speaking Graphically Pes5 appears almost flawless. Also from this point of view, we immediately notice the improvements made by the graphics regarding the stadiums, impressive and detailed, credible, and the players, each of whom becomes more and more aesthetically similar to their respective real counterparts year after year, almost as if the players were scaled down, digitized, and put into the game by Konami. With the addition of dozens of new faces (see Zebina's, for example), and other goodies such as the shirts of some players out of their shorts, new customized celebrations such as Kaka's chest-beating and then pointing to the sky , Gilardino's ~violinata~ or Roberto Carlos' ~kangurotto~, the close-ups on the cheering crowd after a goal complete with a scarf from the latter, the Pes5 engine leaves you positively astounded, and allows even more to totally lower the gamer in match event. In this context, the lion's share goes to the animations, cared for in every single frame, which give the action a hitherto unthinkable truthfulness, attributing to the digital players movements that are always different from each other and credible (among other things jog and way of kicking they can even be customized in the internal editor), in many cases specific for stars like Ronaldinho, or for clashes between two running players and pushes during corner kicks, which are now more likely. Finally, when the game is stopped, the principles of brawling after a particularly nasty foul and player injuries should be mentioned. The latter not only have a purely aesthetic function, even if they are highlighted with splendid interlude skits, but also a practical one. In fact, in addition to the ~damages~ caused by the usual entrances from behind, like Materazzi to be clear, you will also have to deal with those caused by excessive fatigue or hard tackles which after minutes undermine the performance of the player who suffered them. to the point of seeing him shortly after limping, for example touching his thigh and asking for the change. As far as the official licenses are concerned, there are the usual ones for some championships (Italian Serie A, Spanish Liga and Dutch Eredivisie), plus those, in no particular order, pertaining to two prestigious English teams, Chelsea and Arsenal, Glasgow Rangers, Galatasaray, Dinamo Kiev, Porto and exclusively for the West also those of Rosenborg and Djurgrdens IF, clubs that have replaced River Plate and Boca Jrs from the database of teams from the Rest of the World. Finally online for us too Different speech, unfortunately, as regards the audio sector. Once again, while witnessing a discreet improvement in the commentary compared to the previous version, this turns out to be too ~mechanical~, not very involving and at times soporific, perhaps also due to Konami's choice to rely once again on Marco Civoli for the commentary , mysteriously renamed Marco Meccio, and Mauro Sandreani, already boring in reality In short, nothing to do with the excellent Bruno Longhi, for example, seen at work in FIFA. The same goes for the choirs: we will never get tired of repeating that they don't go the way they are. It is not clear why in Winning Eleven 6 the songs of the fans were real, even sampled at the stadium with a lot of offensive chants put into the game probably by mistake by the audio technicians of the then KCET, but very atmospheric, and later, from that moment, they have been replaced by what appear to be mass chants As far as the options for online play and multiplayer are concerned, however, finally even Western users will be able to enjoy support almost worthy of the name on the Ps2 (we are obviously referring to this series) given that the methods for games up to 4 players via the web (two per machine) have been implemented, and other goodies such as being able to create, by the user, his own very personal ~clan~ with which meet in special ~virtual rooms~ complete with access via private password to try their hand at a championship on the web, or use their own personal team used in the Master League. It is only a pity that despite the presence of a less sensitive ~lag~ than the previous one, thanks to a reworked network code, the online section of Pes5 for Ps2 is slightly inferior to the service offered by Xbox Live. On the other hand, the connection capacity between Ps2 and Psp offered by the game is excellent. The two consoles can be connected through the USB port of the Sony monolith and data can be exchanged between the two versions of the game. So, in summary, data of teams created from scratch, or various information such as the number of games won, goals scored and other statistics over time.
