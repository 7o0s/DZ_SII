{"name": "Speed Racer - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/speed-racer-recensione.html", "text": "Comment Speed Racer is a very interesting, in some ways innovative and original racing game. The presence of the two indicators to look after significantly increases the strategy during the races, given that you can decide to bet everything on speed (therefore favoring the boosts) or sell your life dearly to the more combative and threatening opponents. Hitting other cars is fun (with all the limitations of the case) and offers a valid alternative to the system of power-ups to collect and shoot. A speech on competing alliances has even been drafted which, in its small way, can help us finish first without too many worries, since there will be someone watching our backs. Technically, then, we are faced with an exceptional result for a developer belonging to the so-called ~third parties~: so far it seemed that only Nintendo knew how to program on the Wii, and it is a pleasure to see that something is changing in this sense. Ultimately, a great tie-in, immediate and fun. Too bad for the reduced longevity, aggravated by the lack of online multiplayer. Pros Smooth and fast graphics, with original colors Fun fights Interesting car management Cons Few circuits Short length of time Multiplayer only locally and for two players only Speed Racer is available for Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii, and will be available for PlayStation 2. The tested version is the one for Nintendo Wii. Go! go! Go! The movie ~Speed Racer~ is based on a classic Japanese cartoon, namely ~Mach 5 Go! Go! Go!~. Created by Tatsunoko (the same creator of anime such as Judo Boy, Yattaman, Polymar, Tekkaman, etc.) and broadcast in Japan for the first time back in 1967, the series tells the adventures of Go Mifune (renamed ~Speed Racer~ in American version), a boy who on board his very fast Mach 5 challenges pilots from all over the world. The car is equipped not only with a very powerful engine, but also with a series of buttons located on the steering wheel that make it capable of making jumps, changing tires, using rotating blades, wrapping the driver in a bulletproof shell, etc. Precisely thanks to these ~extra functions~ Go manages to get the better of the most unfair opponents every time, overcoming very tough tests. The game Speed Racer is not just inspired by titles such as wipEout and F-Zero for the futuristic setting but also for the management of the cars, which in fact do not behave like normal cars: the T180s are equipped with four wheels that steer at 360, they can virtually rotate on themselves continuing to run in the same direction and, in the film, this happens more often than not. The developers of the Sidhe Interactive team have tried to reproduce the same dynamics, working with imagination where necessary and enriching the fleet as much as possible: we will be able to select our alter ego from a list of twenty different characters (most of which must be unlocked winning races), each one able to give their car different values relating to speed, acceleration, control and power. On the track these skills are quite marked, forcing us to radically change our approach to the race according to the chosen driver: Speed Racer is the more balanced one, while the mysterious Racer-X already has less precise control of the car, compensated by a higher speed . There are pilots like Trixie, too, who possess equal amounts of control and acceleration, but lacking in final speed and power. In short, we will often find ourselves changing characters to win a certain championship, precisely because we will need different skills depending on the situation. The start screen allows us to try our hand at a fast race, with the time attack or with the championship, divided into three different leagues: each one has an increasing number of races to be tackled in sequence, for a total of about twenty races. The problem, which immediately catches the eye, is that you always ride on the same four or five circuits: sometimes we will have to ride them clockwise, sometimes counterclockwise and at the beginning we will only see portions of them, but numerically the result is not changes and we are well below the average of the genre, even on Wii. On the track the skills are quite marked, forcing us to radically change our approach to the race depending on the driver chosen. Car-fu! The game focuses a lot on the so-called ~boost start~, or the classic rolling start that is obtained by keeping the lap indicator in a certain area just before starting off: if we manage to get it, we will find ourselves competing immediately for the first positions, and by managing the race in the best possible way we will have a good chance of crossing the finish line first. PurtToo often things change drastically if we start slow and have to come back, because depending on the aggressiveness of the opponents we may even have to slow down a lot. On the screen we will not find information about the position of the pilots on the track, but we will have to pay close attention to two bars: the boost one and the energy one. The first fills up while running, but grows faster if we manage to pass on the acceleration ramps or if we practice the so-called ~Car-Fu~, or rather if we manage to hit the opponents with our car, giving a lateral blow to the Wii-mote like if we were having counters with someone. The second decreases with each hit suffered and, once empty, it can lead to the explosion of the car, which is replaced not without a substantial loss of seconds. Balancing the two bars is essential: the boost bar can ~feed~ the energy bar by pressing the A button when we are cornered, but it is also true that running without taking advantage of the boost will get us nowhere. There are four levels of boost that can be ~kept~, then activating them (with trigger B) also all in sequence: in this situation, the car enters the so-called ~zone~, with the screen tinged with psychedelic colors and the other cars being thrown around as we arrive. The tracks may have tight curves, which may need to be skidded (actually this is a remote possibility), and a series of jumps before which one can perform acrobatics of various kinds, making the car jump with a rapid vertical movement of the controller and determining the direction of rotation using the d-pad. A somewhat inconvenient solution, given the position of the directional cross on the Wii-mote... Technical realization Let's also say that, on a technical level, Speed Racer proved to be a great surprise: the tracks run very smoothly, with a series of visual effects that draw from Japanese animation techniques to amplify our perception of speed. During the slow phases, such as the start, we realize that the developers have used a heavy ~blur~ effect to remedy the shortcomings of the frame rate, which in any case stands at thirty frames per second, without ever an uncertainty. The circuits are few, unfortunately, but their design is excellent: the colors are acid and manage to give the game a precise and recognizable identity, while the objects in the background, far from numerous, are overshadowed by the alternation of jumps, loops, tunnels and so on. Even the (ridiculous?) ~car-fu~ has been rendered at its best, with a sort of ~bullet time~ effect that starts when the impact occurs and even slows down the playback of the music: one of those classy touches which was really missed on the Wii. Moving on to the sound sector, we have a series of music that succeeds in accompanying the action effectively, remaining in the lead even after the game is over: these days it is no small thing. The effects are good, and the spoken exclamations of the various characters are convinced and well acted. Finally, the control system performs quite well: steering precision varies according to the driver, but the response to inputs is always immediate and perhaps the only problematic situation occurs when restarting following an accident, with the 'car that is a bit 'hard to take the desired direction.", "date": "2008-05-27", "grade": null}
