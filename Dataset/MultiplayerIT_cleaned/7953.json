The Japanese release was quite successful, qualifying as one of those few downloadable games that would look good on the shelves of a normal shop inside their beautiful colored box. and that make you think about what they could have become with a bigger budget and a little more courage. Understandable, therefore, that it was long awaited in the West as well; also because rhythm games are not really a very popular genre, although they are particularly appreciated above all by a more casual audience. So, in the end, the question is always the same: was it worth the wait? Who has time... Our adventure takes place in the magical land of Melodia: the plot that connects the eight worlds and the forty internships is certainly not among the most sensational that we have ever seen, but it draws more than a smile and is told internship after internship through a nice mix of cartoonish static and animated sequences, with a peculiar and irresistible design, which narrate the events almost as if we were dealing with a cartoon or a manga. The protagonist is Tempo, a boy who finds himself holding a Harmonic Wand against his will to defeat the aliens called Rumorozzi, led by the perfidious Gargan: the latter, in an incredible act of originality, kidnaps the princess of Melodia and imprisons her in a fortress. At that point Tempo is practically forced to save her, and sets off on a journey full of dangers together with his best friend, a talking bunny named Tappy. Tempo is then joined by the beautiful Lyra and the brigand Taiko, in what almost seems like an all-Japanese RPG story. After all, the style is decidedly Japanese: the features of Tempo and his friends are almost super deformed, and on several occasions the protagonist has reminded us of characters such as the legendary ninja Goemon from Konami. Despite its nature as a low-budget downloadable game, HarmoKnight is quite a sight: the engine is fully polygonal, although often the action is captured in fixed side or shoulder shots. In the latter case, the camera angle emphasizes the already excellent 3D effect of the game, working on the sensation of depth. The cosmetics, colorful and full of small details, give their best during boss fights, or long cinematic sequences similar to Quick Time Event. In these cases, the choreography of the fight and the quality of the image give truly spectacular levels which, as already mentioned, would have deserved a place on the shelf rather than in an arid SD card: a pity that there are very few reasons to replay them, except to try the proposed high-speed variant after completing them. In reality there is no incentive or bonus, other than the satisfaction of having broken the last record, and consequently the four or five hours it takes to complete the game without putting too much effort might seem a bit small. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect in HarmoKnight is surprisingly effective: the Game Freak guys have clearly used it to make the various stages spectacular, especially those in which the camera rotates, positioning itself behind Tempo during his runs, and the boss fights where you play with depth to make the action on the screen more exciting. In terms of gameplay, however, there is no repercussion. ... you don't wait for Time HarmoKnight is a sincere tribute to the rhythm game genre that winks at small masterpieces of the past such as the legendary Space Channel 5 by SEGA. To make a slightly more modern comparison, we can consider the recent and excellent Theatrhythm: Final Fantasy by Square Enix and Indies Zero. The concept is disarmingly simple: Time runs at breakneck speed and we will have to press A to hit the enemies or B to make him jump. That's all. In reality, things get complicated almost immediately and within a handful of levels we find ourselves having to manage the basic Tempo capabilities in various ways, but always to the rhythm of the music. The aim of each level is quite simple: Tempo must collect the musical notes (which, moreover, fit into the melody which, therefore, we will be able to hear in its entirety only by playing perfectly) by jumping on them, hitting the elements of the scenario or the enemies that they will block the way. At the end of the level, the amount of collected notes will determine a score and therefore a medal: if we have been good we will receive a Royal Note, essential for unlocking the next levels. What makes what may seem like a simple platformer on rails more intriguing is the fact that the levels often have various crossroads and alternative paths that you have to choose in a matter of moments: just a jump, for example, to drastically alter the number of notes that we will be able to collect. However, the automatic exchange with Lyra and Taiko is less convincing: the two secondary characters are played differently from Tempo and only for short sections within some levels; although their presence helps to give some variety to the gameplay, these interruptions break the rhythm and make us wish that, rather, Game Freak had dedicated entire levels to them. The boss fights, in the middle and at the end of each world, are the highlight of HarmoKnight: in these long cinematic sequences we will have to repeat the key combination shown in time to dodge the boss or attack him and his henchmen. Here the donkey falls a bit because these levels are certainly fun and spectacular, but they also require truly extreme precision which is often based more on memory than on hearing. This means that we will frequently find ourselves forced to try them and try them again until we learn each step by heart, and given that these stages are quite long, and particularly fragmented, there are moments of pure frustration in which we find ourselves starting over after having failed on the very last note of a particularly long game.", "date": "2013-03-15", "grade": "8.0"}
