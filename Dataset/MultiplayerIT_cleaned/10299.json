The structure is simple, Cooking Mama 3 is, like its predecessors, essentially a collection of mini-games to be tackled sequentially, all with a culinary theme. It is not a real cooking guide, like La Guida in Cucina: Che si Mangia Oggi?, but a real game, however inspired by the culinary art. Within the various modalities, it is always a question of completing the preparation of a dish taken from the vast choice present in the cartridge, consisting of about 80 different dishes. The preparation of the dish takes place through various and simple skill tests that simulate the classic actions to be performed in the kitchen, all involving the stylus and the touch screen of the console: with quick touches on the screen it will be necessary, for example, to cut the vegetables, mix the ingredients, switch on and make the best use of appliances, regulate cooking, move the pan and many other different situations. Various steps placed in succession make up the entire process of preparing the dish, each of which can be solved with variable results depending on the timing and correctness of the movements until reaching the conclusion and therefore serving the ready dish on the table, which depending on how we carried out the various tasks will be more or less good, making us earn a variable score. Obviously, the more difficult dishes will require more steps and more complicated actions than the basic ones. The central mechanics of the game is therefore the well-established one that has already characterized the first two chapters, while the new introductions are limited to marginal additions, which include new game modes and the possibility of buying ingredients, which in itself is represented by a another mini-game. Different possibilities The first screen after the presentation allows us to select 5 different modes, plus 4 additional options that allow us, among other things, to change the look of the game by changing clothes and accessories for Mama or choosing new decorations for the kitchen and objects usable. With ~Cooking with Mama~ we essentially find ourselves practicing with the various dishes present, tackling the culinary mini-games without particular pressure and with the guarantee of Mama who comes to our rescue in case of failure; with ~Let's cook!~ instead we start to get serious: Mama limits herself to observing, leaving us the field completely free for action, while we try to produce an appetizing dish for some guests. We therefore find ourselves having to learn the actions to be carried out in a few seconds and execute them in the best possible way, under penalty of premature closure of the game due to a real culinary disaster. ~Let's match!~ is one of the innovations introduced in Cooking Mama and allows you to create more elaborate dishes by adding different ingredients as you like and thus experimenting with new and refined combinations, always completing the various stages of preparation through the mini-games. Finally, ~Let's shop!~ is the real innovation of this third chapter: in this case it is a question of going shopping, within a mini-game that is somewhat reminiscent of the old classics in the Pac-Man style. In fact, going around the counters of the supermarket requires precision and timing, finding ourselves trying to collect a given number of ingredients within a pre-established time limit but at the same time having to deal with shop assistants, bellhops and customers who block our way forcing us, in the if you come into contact with them, to subject us to further mini-games of skill which, in addition to wasting time, can cost you the premature closure of the shopping if they are repeatedly failed. ~Cooking Contest~ allows us to challenge ourselves trying to complete the various mini-games in the shortest possible time or challenge friends in multiplayer via the Nintendo DS wireless connection. The score collected at the end of the preparation of the dishes in the various modes unlocks the elements that can be used to customize the characters and the kitchen in ~Change Style~ and ~Let's decorate~, while in the ~Diary~ it is possible to collect the results obtained and the ~photographs~ taken to the dishes. Presentation videos Colors and flavours Not much actually changes from the first two chapters to this Cooking Mama 3: ~the winning team doesn't change~, on the other hand, and this seems to be the philosophy adoptedto da Majesco for this third episode of the little cook. The graphic representation does not present particular upheavals except for a greater possibility of customizing and modifying the appearance of Mama, of the kitchen and of the usable objects, for the rest the appearance has remained unchanged, with all its bright colors and stylized but very precise designs , especially as regards the representation of ingredients and dishes. The controls respond very well and immediately, which is basic in a game that makes timing and the correct movement of the stylus on the touch screen its founding elements, making them intuitive and accessible also (and above all) to a very young audience. The addition of the ~shopping~ is also a novelty as regards its own representation, given that in this case we are witnessing an unprecedented view from above and a completely different structure from the normal one, which will not fail to please to the very passionate who have already thoroughly stripped the previous two chapters and will certainly want something new. Precisely on this front we note the greatest weakness of Cooking Mama 3, which in fact does not offer many variations compared to the rest of the series, beyond a repertoire of renewed dishes, relying for the rest on the well-established and in any case pleasant structure of mini-games born with the first chapter. As for the audio, the soundtrack features catchy and lively accompanying music, while we report a complete translation of the game into Italian also with regard to the sporadic spoken phrases of incitement or reproach.", "date": "2009-12-20", "grade": null}
