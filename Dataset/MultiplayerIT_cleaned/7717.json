{"name": "Platform in evoluzione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121303-megabyte-punch-platform-in-evoluzione.html", "text": "Megabyte Punch is an ambitious platformer that many, rightly so, define as a mix between Smash Bros. and Mega Man. But the title by Reptile Games, a Dutch studio made up of three developers, does not limit itself to exploiting mechanics already seen, adding to recipe a decidedly higher character customization than that of the Capcom platformer. On the other hand, the protagonist is an android and this allows us to replace all the parts of which he is composed, i.e. head, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, shoulders, torso and relative additional slot. Eight interchangeable components for a huge number of variants that include faster legs, heads capable of increasing damage, stronger shoulders and special weapons to steal from bosses. The result is a complex system that allows us to combine various bonuses with drills, cannons and vertical thrusters in a continuous search, loot after loot, for the perfect setup. Research that involves the elimination of tons of enemies, the opening of infinite trunks, the collection of bytes (which are equivalent to the classic platform coins) and the challenge with the fearsome bosses who, not surprisingly, have the best modifications, those endowed with unique abilities. The result is a growing whirlwind of special moves, kicks and punches, double jumps, sprints, sweeps and dive shots, with our robot and the enemies who, when defeated, are thrown against the walls highlighting the other peculiarity of the title, that is the partial destructibility of levels. This possibility is limited to specific contexts and situations but is undoubtedly functional to the spectacular nature of the game, with the opponents impacting the surfaces in a spectacular way, piercing the ground and projecting debris and loot in all directions. For Megabyte Punch's robots, evolution is not a matter of genetics but of beatings Megac to the rescue The story of the protagonist of Megabyte Punch, a robot of the Megac type, begins in a small village which acts as a hub between the various levels that make up the experience. Some of the houses are accessible: inside we find shops, tutorials, secrets and our lair, the refuge in which we can replace the components of our android and associate any available skills. This is a rather delicate operation given that in Megabyte Punch the gameplay is influenced both by the specific skills and by the key to which they are linked. The control system has changed compared to that of the beta and it is now possible to access all equipped skills much faster. The selection of the latter, in fact, is no longer linked to the numeric keys but to four slots that correspond to the directional keys. When we press one, the corresponding ability is selected but does not activate until the X key is pressed. This type of setting allows you to bypass the need for a pad, reducing the number of keys needed to play, and allows you to make Tight combos by chaining multiple skills. But it takes a lot of familiarity to be able to move freely while using the right skill. Especially since some skills require a movement, such as the super jump and the drill, and to be effective they must be used pointing in the right direction. Furthermore, all this is further complicated by the need to make precise movements, since the movement of the character significantly alters the combat. The combos can only be carried out when our character is stationary, while delivering a blow in motion incorporates a greater inerational thrust and pushes the affected enemy away. Not a bad choice of gameplay, rather simple and functional at the root but, given the method of selecting special skills, mastering the movement, in some situations, can become too complex. The secret of the pelvic move Despite the evolutionary component, Megabyte Punch manages to maintain an excellent degree of challenge which, in the case of the bosses, can become decidedly high. In fact, the enemies are quite intelligent: they jump like us, climb walls and hardly get stuck somewhere. They are also equipped with increasingly effective weapons and are extremely responsive. Luckily our character has a couple of tricks up his sleeve, the first of which is an inelegant pelvic move that provokes opponents into inviting them to attack head on. The second possibility to mess up the plans of the enemies, however, is represented by an energy shield whose duration is decidedly limited but which recharges quickly and can deflect ranged attacks. Using it is not easy,especially since it cannot interrupt opponents' combos, but it is an extremely valuable resource when numerous enemies attack us from a distance. Unfortunately the bosses can also use it, they are extremely reactive, have several lives available, can throw us in the air and tend to chase us mercilessly. And this is where the bytes that allow you to increase the number of lives available in a level come into play. If you find yourself in front of a too difficult boss you can explore the whole level, improving the equipment and, indeed, collecting bytes in profusion. In this way, frustration is limited in the event of defeat, allowing developers to keep the degree of challenge high and making sense of an exploratory component that is affected by the repetitiveness of some levels. Fortunately, this is one of the few problems in the artistic sector, which can count on a decidedly inspired cube-like style, enhanced by suggestive stylized backgrounds and androids with a Japanese aftertaste, modeled rather well and always changing thanks to the various components that are often aesthetically very different. ' from each other. Also peculiar are the explosions, the clouds of smoke and the special moves, which are not generated by algorithms but are composed of solid models, made with a decidedly comic look and pleasant to see. The soundtrack is less inspired which is often repetitive, but still manages to adequately mix classic and modern sounds. In essence, excluding a particular and not very easy to master control system, the problems of Megabyte Punch do not concern the elements included in the title, but those that are missing. The multiplayer, in fact, while including both versus and four-player split-screen cooperative mode, is accessible only locally. A real shame given the competitive potential of the title but, considering the good relationship between quality and price, there's little to complain about, especially since the developers have promised to come back to the matter with future updates.", "date": "2013-07-19", "grade": "8.5"}
