Out for several months on PC and only now landed on iOS devices, Unmechanical is one of them. Devoid of any dialogue and written plot, Teotl Studios' puzzle game literally drags the little robot protagonist on an adventure deep underground, giving the player a series of tests to face and greeting him with two endings all to be interpreted. However, even before being an excellent example of interactive storytelling, Unmechanical is a pot full of intriguing puzzles, never really complex but whose resolution is not always obvious. I, robot To tell the truth, the first few minutes of the game suggest the exact opposite. It starts with mundane puzzles, ranging from pulling a set of levers to flipping switches in a specific order. But then things get really interesting, and in a short time you find yourself tinkering with laser beams, conductors and current generators. It is appropriate to underline the ~short time~ given that, even on tablets, the excessive brevity of the game makes itself felt a lot: although the player can get lost or stall in the puzzles, which however rarely happens, within three hours or so you find yourself in front of the Acknowledgments screen with a sense of incompleteness, certainly fascinated by the two endings present, but convinced that a few more puzzles would certainly not have hurt. After all, the plot of Unmechanical closes just when you begin to gain confidence and interact with the few secondary characters who play in the background, which makes the end of the adventure even more abrupt. As we said at the beginning, however, it is in the design of the puzzles that Unmechanical he can actually show off. Other than floating across the landscape and bumping into walls and ceilings, the only real action the player is allowed is the ability to use a tractor beam to grab nearby objects. The interaction with the scenario thus revolves around the movement of boulders, bombs, mirrors and beams, but despite this 'limitation', the game offers a good variety of puzzles and situations. It does so especially in the last half hour, when one after another some of the most interesting puzzles follow one another. Unfortunately some environments prove to be very dispersive, in some cases you don't know where to go and in others, fortunately few, you risk getting stuck in an enigma without knowing that it will actually have to be solved at a later time. This feeling of bewilderment is felt in particular in a large central room which almost acts as a hub for the areas that are gradually unlocked: it is not immediately clear where the newly opened passage is, and therefore one wanders around for a while in the hope of not take a corridor already travelled. It's a huge shame, considering instead the excellent work done by Teotl Studios in the realization of the environments. Although the entire adventure takes place underground, the user finds himself passing through rocky corridors, underwater caves, volcanic halls and laboratories full of machinery. Thanks to the animated backgrounds we have already mentioned, the visual impact is decidedly pleasant, although the iOS version has been technically scaled down compared to the PC one for effects, aliasing and texture detail. The chosen style is not affected too much, which almost seems to mix together elements taken from Portal with characters and aesthetics taken from Machinarium. In closing, we have to mention the control system designed specifically to make interaction via touch screen more intuitive: touching a point on the screen moves you in that direction, while another touch on the robot protagonist allows him to activate his pulling ability. For those who prefer a more traditional approach, they can always take a tour of the options and choose the usual virtual stick associated with the action key.", "date": "2013-03-22", "grade": "7.0"}
