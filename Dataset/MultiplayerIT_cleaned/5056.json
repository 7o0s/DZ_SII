{"name": "Honey", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/honey-i-joined-a-cult-recensione.html", "text": "It's the 70s and the person you've decided to share your life with has just returned home with news: ~honey, I've joined a cult!~ In the United States of the time it was not such an unlikely scenario and that same atmosphere is the foundation of Honey, I Joined a Cult, a new management game that aims to give a fresh irony to the genre. Sole Survivor's debut game Games (a studio made up of only two people) is simple in graphics, but not in dynamics and, having overcome a rather high entry barrier, will be able to satisfy the needs of the cruellest, or the most magnanimous, of the leading scammers. From the music to the dcor, building your base will be an experience infused with 70s aesthetics, humor and general craziness and yes, there's the strobe to make any environment a little more Disco. In this review of Honey, I Joined a Cult we will tell you about its many parameters, the management of followers, missions and brainwashing that you can organize if you choose to found a cult of your own. Go over the wall To get to have such a well-developed base you will have to pay close attention to the Honey, I Joined a Cult tutorial Analyzing Honey, I Joined a Cult it is worth starting from the negative aspects for one simple reason - they are all at the very beginning of the game. For fans of basebuilding and management games all of the following is the norm, but the idea behind Honey, I Joined a Cult is so refreshingly innovative that even those who have avoided the genre in the past should give it a shot. All these new fans, however, have to put themselves in the perspective that the first two hours of the game are more like a technical drawing lesson rather than an actual gaming session. Indeed, after a narrative introduction that explains the origins of the leader of your new cult, a really intense tutorial phase begins. Before you can recruit your first adept you will have to learn how to lay the foundations of buildings, build walls and doors, assign a role to rooms, furnish them with the right objects, manage their prestige level, understand how to improve them and how to assign us the most suitable characters. Only then will the second phase of explanation begin to show you how the 5 resources of the game work and how they affect the gameplay. There is so much to absorb and the frustration is felt when you encounter counterintuitive design choices (like the possibility of not being able to select objects directly) but once the foundations are laid, the game is capable of generating a lot of fun. Matter of style The right idol in the right room will unlock many resources in Honey, I Joined a Cult If you love video games that wink at the rest of the gaming world, then Honey, I Joined a Cult won't disappoint. Starting from the theme of your sect (for which you can choose the Egyptian theme, the Lovecraftian one and many others) up to the small objects with which to decorate the rooms, the game is studded with quotes, one of all the ~Sword of Light~ that, during a mission, a hooded old man will give you if you answer his riddles. Then you will have to dress and customize your leader and his most loyal followers who will be assigned a uniform to distinguish them from the new recruits. The graphic style of Honey, I Joined a Cult recalls, in a certain sense, that of Among Us, simple but not for this uncommunicative. It will be very evident when your followers are in pain or when a mob of puritanical extremists wants to come and destroy your base. The only thing that really bothers you is the notification system because the selection menus for objects/rooms/characters/etc... are many and complex. A function that leads directly to the unlocked novelty would be useful rather than having to scroll pages and pages sharpening the view to locate the new object that has just become available. Praise to *insert divinity* Better keep the public wrath down in Honey, I Joined a Cult or have the police at the door Once your cult is established it is time to expand it and to do so you will need Adepts and Followers. The former are the members most devoted to your divinity and need beds, bathrooms, a cafeteria, recreation rooms and a temple where they can listen to the leader's sermons. The second are the future members of your cult, whom you will have to convince to integrate into the life of the community. Having a well-oiled organization is key to not having angry residents or fanatical cops at your door. As for progression, if you're a fan of basebuilding games (like Fallout Shelter), the script sounds pretty good.familiar za: there are missions in which to send your followers (to obtain resources or appease public opinion), research by the scientific team to unlock new upgrades (such as rooms dedicated to relaxation or ~persuasion~ of newcomers) and the leader's duties which are usually a combination of the above. Familiarizing yourself with this ecosystem is quite simple even if the biblical times of some fundamental research for the progression of the game will leave you stranded for whole minutes watching your little men move without having anything to do, even tripling the speed of the game time. The Sancta Sanctorum and the rest of the progression Those who choose to serve the demons will not be able to avoid sacrificing some adepts in Honey, I Joined a Cult After about 20 days of in-game time (about 4 hours for those who play) a new fundamental room will be available for the progression and deep customization of the game: the Sancta Sanctorum. Here you can choose the theme of your cult, for now there are three available: Demons, Robots and Hippies but already in the menu the developers say that there are more to come. Here the madness and fun of Honey, I Joined a Cult take off: in addition to many aesthetic customizations, you can start your conquest of the world by sacrificing, liquefying, mechanizing or completely transforming your followers. We chose the robotic theme and after that neither half an hour we started turning our followers into dolomite slabs and developing our own ballistic missiles. Honey, I Joined a Cult isn't a realistic game, it's a great way to test your skills as a demagogue and create memes that will stand the test of time. Once the Sancta Sanctorum is unlocked, all the gears of Sole Survivor's Games' debut title start moving in perfect harmony, the dead times are completely reset and the absurdity increases exponentially by the hour.", "date": "2022-11-04", "grade": "7.5"}
