{"name": "Arc the Lad: Il tramonto degli spiriti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/arc-the-lad-il-tramonto-degli-spiriti.html", "text": "Let the Spirits guide you Our story begins 300 years after the Cataclysm, the Great Catastrophe that shook the world, submerging most of the civilized lands, forever changing the geology of the planet. After the initial discouragement of those fatal days, the world embarked on the path of hope, slowly rebuilding itself on its own rubble. From generation to generation the story of the Seven Heroes is passed down who, led by the legendary Arc and with the help of the Spirits, defeated the Dark Lord, restoring peace to the earth and stopping the Cataclysm before it could wipe out every living thing. In reality, few know that Arc and the Seven Heroes, helped by a group of young adventurers, were the architects of the Great Catastrophe... Since then, all traces of the Seven Spirits, protective entities of the Creative Elements and of living beings, have been lost. the testimony of their existence is made only by the elemental energy still imprinted on particular minerals, the Spirit Stones, which still act as an energy resource for civilized peoples. But in these centuries, Humans have seen the rise of a new dominant species with mysterious origins, the race of Deimos, humanoid beings with monstrous features. The two races immediately began a long war, waged by hatred and contempt for the different, but above all by ambition and arrogance. In this gloomy and desolate scenario, in a post-holocaust world, our two protagonists live. The first is Kharg, a brave and stubborn Human prince of a small rural region; the second is Darc, a Deimos, a slave, marginalized by his own kind due to his all too human appearance and character. The Spirits will appear again to entrust them with a dangerous mission: to recover the very powerful Great Spirit Stones, before they fall into the clutches of the evil empire of Dilzweld, to save their race and the world. For different ends, opposite reasons and with different methods, the two will embark on a journey that will lead them to confront each other several times, until they understand the bond that unites them, all too clear to us from the very first lines: Kharg and Darc, so different in character , in the race of belonging and in the objectives... they are really brothers. Tactical Action The Arc the Lad saga has always been characterized by a particular playful structure, which combines the classic Japanese-type Role Playing Game with the strategic genre. Basically, within any setting, the player behaves as if he were playing any JRPG, controlling the polygonal model of the protagonist and interacting with objects or other characters. The discourse changes radically from the map of the region in which we are moving, divided into various fixed locations, connected to each other by predetermined routes. Sometimes it can happen that, moving from one location to another via a central third party, the party is attacked by a group of enemies, therefore forced into a random battle from which it can escape peacefully, unless it is an imposed clash from the main plot. At that point, Arc the Lad: ITdS reveals itself in its essence as a strategy game: the battles, in fact, take place in turns, in an order defined by the speed of the individual units. When the player has the opportunity to control one of his fighters, he can move him in real time, moving him at will within his action area. It is even easier to attack an opposing unit, when only pressing a button is needed to hit the enemy: in this regard, the targeting system orchestrated by Cattle Call is interesting, which occurs in a sort of circle surrounding the character in question, demonstrating the effective range of his shots, within which it is possible to move an arc that represents the direction in which the attack will be directed. The fights, however, are not limited to the mere pressing of an attack button, given that it is also possible to have two types of special shots: the Tech Skills and the Magics. The former can only be used by Humans while the latter are only available to Deimos (Kharg and Darc represent the exception that proves the rule, as they are able to master both Techniques and Magic), but in both cases their use will consume a certain amount of Spirit Stones, practically the equivalent of the traditional Magic Points seen and reviewed in dozens of RPGs: the difference between the latter and Arc the Lad: TheTdS is, however, that in this case the Spirit Points cannot be recharged through the use of regenerating items or healthy sleep, but must be bought from time to time, individually for each character or for the entire party, so as to distribute them at the right time to the members who need it most. Another addition to the battle system of Arc the Lad: ITdS, which up to now reproduces quite faithfully but in a modern key that of its prequels, is instead the Tension Bar: it is an indicator that will increase as each character receives damage ; once the maximum is reached, the fighter will be enveloped in a luminous aura which will disproportionately increase his war skills and which will allow him to carry out deadly combined attacks with a neighboring unit. The variety of the combat system, not at all complex, makes each fight pleasant to manage and not at all frustrating, even if in the long run the random battles can be rather monotonous. Spirits are shinin' at the dusk From a technical point of view Arc the Lad ITdS is a somewhat contradictory title, as it presents a large number of advantages interlaced with some minor defects that partially undermine its quality. For example, graphically the work done by Cattle Call on the environments is decidedly exceptional: each location is created with an inordinate amount of polygons and the attention to detail is wasted. The blades of the mills that rotate, the grass and the fronds of the trees that sway in the wind, the sunset that projects carnival-like plays of light on the floor through a stained glass window... It's touches of class like these that show the care and attention paid by the unknown developer in the making of this game. The liquid surfaces, in particular, leave you pleasantly amazed: starting with the small river in the town of Kharg, continuing with the puddles or rivers that cross the forests, to arrive at the splendid lake which forms the backdrop to the first encounter between Darc and Lilia, a truly jaw-dropping panorama with its multiple reflections of moving mountains and clouds. If from the point of view of the settings one could cry out for a miracle, on the other hand the same cannot be said of the modeling of the characters themselves, which leaves rather dumbfounded. Although built with a large amount of polygons, especially in the case of the faces, which rival in detail and expressiveness those of Tidus and his clique in the famous Final Fantasy X, the bodies sometimes appear quite angular, especially in the case of secondary characters. The problem reappears with the textures, very well done in the case of Darc, Kharg and other main characters (Camellia in particular), but decidedly milder as regards minor protagonists such as Delma, Maru or Paulette. And the same problem still arises in the field of animations: in combat it is possible to admire spectacular action sequences, assisted by the excellent animation of the vast majority of enemies and characters, but sometimes it happens to observe rather wooden and unnatural actions, which clash in a more than positive whole. Beyond these defects, which sin somewhat of fussiness, it must be said, we find ourselves with a decidedly more than good overall graphic picture and with an interesting, original and well-finished character design. On the sound side there is little to say: the sporadic dialogue cutscenes and the impressive amount of digitized speech audible in combat reveal a dubbing that is certainly above average, with very few low peaks; but on the other hand in the DVD of Arc the Lad: ITdS one of the best soundtracks ever made is compressed, a concentrate of epic themes, suitable for every situation in which it is possible to hear them and always pressing and never banal, starting with the remixed version of the traditional introductory fanfare, a true masterpiece. In short, technically the situation is not completely positive, but it certainly leans much more towards this side. Comment Arc the Lad: Sunset of the Spirits is an excellently made JRPG, worthy heir to the trilogy that laid its foundations, and is also a breath of fresh air in the PlayStation 2 toy library. The strong point of this new episode of the saga by Arc and partners is undoubtedly a plot full of twists and narrative inventions that are anything but trivial, based on current and not at all ~virtual~ themes such as racism, violence and war, characterized by the presence of unique characters and charismatic (particularly Camellia and Darc), decidedly unstereotypical in their psicology and their modus operandi. The progression in the storyline is associated with an intuitive and user-friendly combat system, which is its cross and delight: it is impossible not to admit the extreme linearity that distinguishes the development of the adventure, where the entire backbone of the story is characterized by a series of fights interspersed with short exploratory sequences. After all, however, Arc the Lad: ITdS is not exactly a classic JRPG, and at this juncture the strategic component has the upper hand over the structural complexity of the game. In short, the Arc the Lad saga (re) begins on PlayStation2 with great pomp, thanks also to an exceptional audio-visual creation, although undermined by defects that are all in all anything but serious: from this point of view, Sunset of the Spirits is a highly recommended purchase for all fans of the genre but also for those who, fed up with random fights and exhausting wanderings, are looking for a JRPG that is simple to complete and not too long but of the highest level. Final notes go to the pal adaptation of the game, which, although without 60hz, relegates the famous black bands to two small horizontal stripes that are absolutely not annoying, and to the translation, completely in Italian both as regards the subtitles and the dubbing. Pros Excellent, original and complex storyline Simple and intriguing combat system One of the best soundtracks ever made Cons Sometimes fluctuating polygonal modeling Linear and not too long From six years to three months. Not bad. Obviously we are referring to the translation of this new episode of the Arc the Lad saga, which began on PSOne in Japan in 1996, continued for three chapters and arrived in the West only in 2001, after a troubled adaptation of no less than six years, in fact, by the Working Designs, which packaged, for the occasion, one of the best luxury box sets ever produced for the gaming market (but on the other hand WD had already worked on the splendid Lunar Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2 Eternal Blue Complete, demonstrating its great professionalism) unfortunately released only for the American market. In short, this time, for the first episode of the series to land on PS2, Sony has decided to significantly speed up the adaptation times. The reasons for this choice are mainly two: first of all, Arc the Lad: Sunset of the Spirits (which for convenience we will call Arc the Lad: ITdS) shares with its three prequels only a few details of not too much importance for narrative purposes ; then, and above all, Arc the Lad: ITdS is the first chapter of the series to exploit an entirely three-dimensional graphic creation, thus approaching similar productions already released on new generation consoles, such as the acclaimed Final Fantasy X and Suikoden III. In short, a real revolution for a little-known but high-quality saga, which has been able to captivate thousands of fans, especially in the motherland, with its simple but engaging plots and its incredible characters. But will the emphasis placed on new-generation programming have affected the excellent game system at the base of the classic trilogy, expressed at its maximum power in the timeless Arc the Lad II? The answer is no, and we'll explain why.", "date": "2004-01-28", "grade": null}
