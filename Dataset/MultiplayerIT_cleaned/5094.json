The classic SEGA, which made its debut in a coin-op version in 1986 and was then the protagonist of several conversions for the gaming systems of the time, based its gameplay on this very concept: you had to shoot hard, avoid the traffic and reach each checkpoint within a time limit to be able to take a new fork and have some hope of reaching the end of the route. In the background, the bitmap graphics scrolled lightning-fast using the scaler device, shooting the giant pixels of roadside objects in our faces while creating a sensation of speed that was incredible at the time. Highway Runners, available for the moment only on the App Store (and only in the iPhone version) at a price of 1.99 euros, is clearly not the first tribute to Out Run that comes to mind. In fact, some years ago we were able to try Final Freeway 2R, which even now stands as a solid term of comparison for this kind of arcade racer: we are talking about a product equipped with almost perfect tilt controls and an extraordinary scrolling speed, actually comparable to that of the SEGA title but with a different connotation for the objects, designed in pixel art although using thinner and more pleasing to the eye lines. The graphics of Highway Runners are quite another matter, which focuses precisely on giant pixels and on absolute fidelity to Out Run, complete with scanlines and a ~cathode ray tube~ effect to bring this experience closer to that of a coin-op from the 1990s 80. Equally valid points of view, of course, to the full advantage of the variety on offer. Highway Runners stands as a passionate homage to the classic Out Run, fun and colorful Three lives, three moments of the day The release of the ~zen~ mode, easier and with less traffic, reveals the intentions of the authors of Highway Runners, eager to create a racer that is fun and faithful to the classics, but also relaxing, less fast and less demanding in its own way. From this point of view, the lack of a timer, the coins to be collected on the road (with which to unlock the extra modes and the different times of the day), the automatic accelerator (which, in combination with the touch on the screen, produces a drift useful for changing direction quickly) and the three lives available in each game. To pass the stages and visit all fifteen levels made available, therefore, just avoid taking unnecessary risks and avoid direct collisions, without the sweaty hands or wide-open eyes that characterize the challenge of the original Out Run or the already mentioned Final Freeway 2R. It is an interesting approach, although less significant in terms of difficulty and therefore potentially weak if we consider the replayability factor, determined in this case solely by the crossroads and the different locations to be discovered. In terms of technical implementation, however, the work done by Brownieless Games is commendable: the graphics will not be very fast and the giant pixels tend to confuse the view, but the screen is full of objects and there is almost never the feeling of a dull background and desolate. The very precise accelerometer controls can be replaced by a touch configuration that is also reactive and effective, if you prefer this variant. Instead, we were a bit disappointed by the musical accompaniment, which was less impactful than expected.", "date": "2017-01-11", "grade": "7.8"}
