However, the brand is still very popular and therefore, waiting to know something about the development of Dead Island 2, Deep Silver has seen fit to entrust the guys from Fishlabs with the creation of a mobile game with an intriguing concept that takes us back to the famous islands invaded by zombie, available for free on the App Store and Google Play after a long period in soft launch. In this case, the experience is a curious mix between a tower defense and an action RPG, in which we control a character who knows the threat of the undead well and knows how to counter it, using not only his hands but also and above all a set of different devices: from machine guns to cannons, from flamethrowers to incendiary bombs. With the aim of freeing the various areas of a large archipelago, rescuing the survivors trapped in situations that are not exactly idyllic, in the game we will find ourselves organizing defenses on the basis of a pre-established enemy path, which we will however be able to modify by placing our towers on the map or simple barricades. Should the zombies reach the entrance to our camp they will be electrocuted by an electric charge, but the trick will only work three times: where the opponents arrive at their destination in large numbers, it will be game over. Precisely for this we will have to ensure that the weapons scattered within the scenarios act to their maximum effectiveness, possibly supported not only by our direct action, but also by a series of ~traps~ that it will be possible to activate when necessary and which contribute to sow death (the definitive one, of course) and destruction. Gameplay and structure As mentioned, the Dead Island: Survivors formula takes up the traditional mechanisms of tower defense, presenting the same scenario on each island and highlighting the paths that the zombies will follow to reach the entrance to the base. Our task will be to use this information to place the towers, upgrade them where possible using virtual currency (which is obtained simply by proceeding in the stages), perhaps resort to some rubies (the hard currency) to speed up operations and finally kick off the mission . The difference compared to the classic strategic lies in the possibility of supporting the fire of the towers with the intervention of our character, according to canons very similar to those of action RPGs, although unfortunately the touch controls in this sense did not drive us crazy: instead of opting for a virtual stick and an attack button, the developers have preferred a ~tap and go~ style approach, which however does not go well with the close-up view and often forces frequent taps, at a very short distance, to be able to move quickly in the most tense situations. The settings don't allow you to change the layout at the moment, which is a real shame. Fortunately, this lack does not excessively undermine the goodness of a system that certainly does not boast an extraordinary variety but involves and entertains, even more so when the degree of challenge rises, i.e. from the third island onwards. There are secondary levels that you can complete to get money and resources, fairly challenging boss fights and freemium mechanisms that actually make you feel a little, but at the same time we didn't want to limit the enjoyment of the game in any way and you won't have to therefore wait for the action energy to be recharged in order to be able to make all the attempts you wish. In short, we are talking about an interesting and well-packaged product, especially from a technical point of view, thanks to excellent graphics that include various types of enemies, even if the choice to limit the scenarios to a single map per island translates into a visual impact a bit monotonous.", "date": "2018-07-07", "grade": "7.8"}
