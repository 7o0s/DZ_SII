Developed by WB Games San Francisco, DC Legends therefore starts from very well-tested elements: first of all the narrative system, which is the traditional one of the most famous sagas of the house of Batman and Superman, used to facing cosmic level opponents by joining forces even with their nemeses; secondly, a gameplay that incorporates the mechanics of the Marvel title, offering us a long single player campaign divided into increasingly complex missions, with the expedient of unlockable and upgradeable characters using the resources obtained after each victory. The freemium nature of the product is highlighted by the presence of an indicator that wears out with each new attempt and that takes a few minutes to recharge, but at first the issue is actually overshadowed by the continuous leveling up of our team. It must also be said that the developers did not block the most important characters to reserve them for paying users, but immediately launched the various Batman, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Wonder Woman and Flash into the fray, as well as some of their most famous nemeses. DC Legends is a decent turn-based strategy game, with many heroes but too many limits Beat you and then I'll beat As mentioned, the DC Legends gameplay rests on well-tested mechanisms, although the entire introductory phase of the game is a bit trivial and is used by the developers as a tutorial with respect to subsequent situations. Composed of a team made up of four characters, we will have to face hordes of enemies that are gradually more substantial and dangerous, following a turn-based system and sinking the blows after selecting the attack we deem appropriate and the objective, or by activating a maneuver that serves to recover health, activate an extra shield or improve our hero's attitude. Depending on the characterizing element of each character, his blows will be more or less effective against the enemy, following a scheme designed so that one does not always become stuck on the same team, but rather the components are changed based on the type of opponents they will have to face. In practice, unfortunately, this expedient fails to give the desired depth to the gameplay, which remains anchored to basic, uninspiring and quite a bit repetitive dynamics. To partially renew the interest we find a rich achievement system, the continuous unlocking of extra characters to try and the aforementioned upgrades, which can be made for heroes in general or specifically for some of their shots. However, when the increase in difficulty from a freemium perspective arrives, on time, things get complicated and the desire to continue is less, thanks to a discreet technical sector but not able to increase involvement, devoid of spectacular sequences and with a set of animations that inevitably tend to recur during the clashes.", "date": "2016-11-14", "grade": "7.0"}
