However, instead of doing the homework by staging a simple ~fairground~ shooter, i.e. a game experience all glitter and little substance to exploit the hype of virtual reality, Rebellion has created what is in all respects a sort of roguelike about futuristic tank in 3D version. Pad in hand the game is still very immediate, but as we will see it is not really a walk to bring home wave after wave. Battlezone VR is played on a hexagonal board, procedurally generated at the beginning of each game, consequently each game will be different from the other. Each hexagon can hide a pitfall, there is the possibility of launching probes to reveal what kind of action awaits us, otherwise we move blindly hoping not to come across a mission that is too difficult for our level. Or even worse to ~release~ a sort of boss who moves freely on the board. Luckily for us, however, we could also display reference stations, where to spend the points accumulated previously in battle for new weapons, or to make our tank more efficient. So why is Battlezone VR a kind of roguelike? An 80s arcade classic returns: here is the review of Battlezone VR Better with other friends Simple, once the available lives are finished, it's game over. And you start all over again, perhaps choosing a shorter and less difficult campaign and a more armored tank even if less agile. The missions are very similar, you have to destroy everything that populates the arenas, defending our base or destroying the opposing one step by step, defensive turret after defensive turret. The opponents are of various types, divided between land and air, and already at the second power level they do a fair amount of damage. In fact, they're really bad. Two weapons available, a cannon and a homing missile, both upgradeable. To make it more complex there is the active reloading of the weapons a la Gears of War and, to keep the great power of the missiles under control, Rebellion has implemented a long missile lock time. In short, you don't just shoot at everything that moves, the shots are not wasted, the ammunition is not infinite. Pad in hand - and Battlezone VR is played with the controller, not with PlayStation Move - all this translates into very simple and immediate game mechanics, where dodging plays a role of fundamental importance. Aiming is simple and thanks to the generous viewing angle given by the viewer, it is possible to aim at the opponents quite easily: the action is really frenetic, it is played like a classic first-person shooter, with the plus, however, of the extra depth given by PlayStation vr. However, the extreme speed has a not exactly pleasant consequence. To the writer Battlezone has unleashed the usual sense of seasickness that afflicts many virtual reality games. It must have been the constant overstays, it must have been the maps full of ups and downs, but after half an hour of play we felt the need to take a good break. On a technical level, although the Sony viewer does not return a particularly clean and detailed image, especially on the elements in the distance, we can say that Battlezone VR is undoubtedly a pleasant title, thanks above all to its full 80s style graphics. From the wireframe polygons of thirty-six years ago we have moved on to textures, certainly flat, but only for a mere stylistic question. In fact, you fight in arenas that seem to have taken weight from the world of Tron, much more colorful of course. But the real problem of Battlezone VR is that played alone it can be unstimulating after having done several missions, given their super repetitive structure, even net of the customization of the tanks and the procedural generation of the game world. The cooperative up to a maximum of four players is therefore the best way to spend time with the title, managing your opponents better and, which is not possible by playing alone, there is the possibility of healing yourself, avoiding the nefarious game over. Too bad that, in this sense, there is no competitive multiplayer mode.", "date": "2016-10-19", "grade": "6.5"}
