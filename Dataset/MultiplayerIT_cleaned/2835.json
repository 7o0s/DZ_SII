Ubisoft tries to make the coup by entrusting the role of producer of this third game to that crazy Clint Hocking, or the man behind the most extreme ideas of the controversial but beloved Far Cry 2. Let's find out how it went with our review of Watch Dogs Legion! In 2014, Ubisoft invented Watch Dogs, an action-drama set in the modern era that immediately attracted the attention of the public thanks to a very special trailer. Things change when the adventure finally debuts in stores and is inundated with criticism, beaten by the public because it does not respect what was shown in the previews, at least from a graphic point of view. Despite the technical slide, Watch Dogs is not that bad to play, and in the plot it focuses on all the fears, then nascent, of an omnipresent technology and increasingly devoted to the control of the masses. The charm of being grappling with that Assassin's Creed finally set in the present day that we have never had also remains intact: after all Aiden Pearce is a bit like that Desmond kidnapped by Abstergo from which, in the storyline that sees opposing assassins and templars, he never managed to escape. Watch Dogs is ultimately, and despite everything, a good starting point which however Ubisoft decides to raze with Watch Dogs 2. All the colors of a stealth The sequel no longer has that melancholic tone that gave life to the progenitor, on the contrary it is crazy, very colorful, and seems written by Skrillex and another handful of too young to die and too cool for this shit Djs. The cast is unbearable, for the younger ones who understand its lack of spontaneity and for the older players, orphans of that emotional depth that had brought them closer to the first Watch Dogs. And it's a huge shame, because from a gameplay point of view, the steps forward are enormous. Watch Dogs 2 is once again a hacking-based stealth, where much more freedom is allowed in tackling the main missions, built here to offer a more complex experience than in the first game. In short, Watch Dogs 2 takes a clear step backwards from the point of view of characterization, and a clear step forward in game design which, considering everything, however, is not enough to transform it into a clear success, both with critics and with the public. With Watch Dogs Legion, Ubisoft changes the cards on the table again, this time by rebuilding the good things done in the second chapter around an idea that we can consider extraordinary: the possibility of interpreting around nine million different characters. Has the moment of consecration arrived for the series? Not entirely, but the step is undoubtedly in the right direction. Which character to start with? Watch Dogs Legion is a fun product, on this it is right to be clear right away. In the 40 hours of gameplay spent between main activities and most, but not all, side activities, there was not a single time we felt the weight of repetition. The problem is not in the general vision, actually successful, but in an execution that very soon turns out to be rather wavering, insecure. Here, every beginning is different: after the introduction, the game will give us the opportunity to choose who to start with among fifteen different characters at each new game. Depending on the edition of the game purchased, we will also be provided with predetermined agents with above-average characteristics, for a nice extra but which you can still do without (indeed it is better to start almost from scratch, if you want a personal opinion) . After a couple more introductory missions, we'll be able to start recruiting new agents to flesh out the ranks of our group of computer revolutionaries. Convince and enlist In Watch Dogs Legion there are about nine million potential playable characters: they are the inhabitants of London, and many of these are men and women with rather common or even zero characteristics, but among the citizens who populate the English metropolis you will also find very more interesting if not out of the ordinary. Recruitment is more or less easy depending on the opinion that the target will have of the DedSec collective of which we will be part. Before agreeing to join our group, a villager with a neutral opinion will usually ask you to carry out a mission for him; a well-disposed one could agree to join the revolution without further demands; those who don't love us, on the other hand, will have to be spurred on by intervening in their daily routine, which can only be accessed after having unlocked a particular skill. You will also find those who hate DedSec to the point of refusing any attempt at arrolling. Memories and relatives The system is truly surprising, done very well, above all because the procedural formula that creates the inhabitants gives life to always very credible existences which include jobs, hobbies and in many cases even family members who can be found around the city. A character might hate us because we ran over a sibling or parent during our raids, or love us because we previously helped him while the Albion militias were bothering him. There is therefore a system on a motorbike that will change the feedback from the city also on the basis of how we behave, deliberately or without initially realizing it. And as we go forward these different connections between characters will become increasingly visible thanks to indicators designed to show us, for example, that the woman we have before us is the wife of one of the inhabitants that we have already included in the list of possible candidates. The different characters can count on certain special abilities, passive and active, and on a shape and physical preparation that will make them more or less agile, and that will give them different sets of moves. Of course there is a good deal of repetitiveness in circulation, a limit that is also useful since it will give us the opportunity to find, if necessary, an archetype that we particularly liked. Permadeath Watch Dogs Legion also allows you to play with permadeath, a mode that provides for the permanent death of a character. We know that for many this particular option may sound unacceptable, but rest assured that playing this way makes for a much more exciting experience. Knowing that things can go extremely wrong pushes the player to think about every action, planning escape routes in advance and choosing the best member to send into jeopardy. Of course, if and when you lose a loved character you will feel angry and sad like never before, but an action game must be able to convey different emotions from the usual and obvious excessive power of the protagonist. Even without active permadeath, some characters also have maluses along with bonuses which include an irreversible death, perhaps because they are ill, or dedicated to a dissolute life; among these negative sides there are also effects that lengthen the hospitalization in the event of serious injuries, or chronic forms of hiccups that will make the stealth approach more difficult, if not impossible. And then there are the elderly, who make you laugh with their indecisive movements, creaking attempts to escape, sterility in hand-to-hand combat: a category that is practically useless if not for a laugh. Funny in the same way, but much more interesting characters like the living statue, who in his silver suit can immobilize himself to escape from the enemies who are looking for him, and attract other people who in some cases will even offer him some money. In the course of our game we also got hold of an assassin capable of killing instantly with a melee blow while holding a firearm: in combat the result is similar to the style of John Wick, with grapples that make harmless enemies and two final shots of Parabellum to put them out of action forever. Development aftermath The variants of the characters, although not infinite, are still more than enough: there are boxers, drone experts, spies with watches capable of disabling the firearms of nearby enemies who drive cars equipped with missile launchers, drivers who reduce the level researches faster, lawyers who instantly free imprisoned fellow soldiers, mahios who hypnotize enemies, mimes who naturally blend in, and so on. If ever there will be a new chapter in the series, and we have no reason to believe the opposite, it is precisely this feature of Watch Dogs Legion that we must still focus on, further refining it. At the moment, however, there is a big, very big balancing problem: by collecting the technology points that we will find scattered in the most dangerous areas of the map, it will be possible to unlock various things, including skills that in many cases will overlap with those of our characters. It's nice initially to use someone good with drones in missions where this type of threat is a constant, but if the same or almost the same skills can be unlocked for all the characters in our possession, that particular DedSec agent that we have tracked down, convinced and a that we have also grown fond of, it will end up being much less useful and interesting. In the first interviews, there was also talk of the possibility of increasing the level of the agents along the way, a feature that does not seem to be present in the full game. The feeling is thatthe game has changed over and over again during development, and some of the most traumatic mutations have left aftermaths that have made certain parts of the gameplay redundant or inconclusive. Plots and conspiracies A great pity, especially in the light of a very interesting screenplay, although it is a waste to have cornered the issue of privacy to make room for a strong conspiracy imprint: there are also chips under the skin that cook you from a distance like those which for some would activate Bill Gates through 5G. But it's not a bad story, on the contrary, furthermore this post-Brexit futuristic London is a perfect backdrop for the plot that the Ubisoft writers have set up. The Watch Dogs Legion scenario foresees the presence of several groups in addition to DedSec: there are the Zero Days who detonated several bombs in the metropolis causing the blame to fall right on us, there is the Kelley Clan managed by the criminal Mary Kelley of whose role is not initially known well, a circle of assassins called 404 led by the enigmatic hacker Nowt and many other factions and characters, together with their plots, which we leave you with the pleasure of discovering for yourself. However, the good work done in drawing up the narrative plot collides with a decidedly poor writing, where each line of text seems to close with a ridiculous and very unrealistic swear word. This aspect becomes even less fun when the different members of the DedSec group interact, dramatically unable to avoid a ~fuck~ every three by two. Furthermore, having to give voice to thousands of possible characters, the general quality of the same is really very low, both in the Italian version and in the original one. Compact and creative gameplay Built on the more than good foundation laid with Watch Dogs 2, the gameplay of Watch Dogs Legion gets along quite well, but even in this case there is a bit of a flattening in favor of three practically ubiquitous solutions: the use of drones cargo to fly over the chosen place, the abuse of the so-called spider-bot to hack all those workstations that will not be possible to use remotely and the search for cameras that allow us to interact with the scenario in order to smooth out our next and effective intrusion . From this point of view, although Legion hides more than one surprise in the main missions, Watch Dogs 2 offered much more varied solutions and more interesting challenges. In secondary activities, Watch Dogs Legion instead has a rather schematic approach: each district of London offers three different missions which, once completed, will give access to one last decisive demonstration action. Each freed district gives access to various bonuses and to a particularly distinctive new operator. As anticipated, despite its limitations, Watch Dogs Legion is always a lot of fun, after all, how can a game that always leaves you so much freedom in choosing the best approach not be? Furthermore, for once Ubisoft has renounced the usual gigantism of its latest titles to offer a more compact and much better organized area and gaming experience. Yes, there are dozens of documents, masks and other goodies to find and collect, but nothing over the top and daunting the player just by looking at the map, as has often happened in the past. Spiders, drones, cars and motorbikes In action you shoot quite well, while stealth is set up by those who know the genre thoroughly, and it shows. Those who care particularly will be happy to know that although it is not possible to move the body of landed enemies, to prevent their sighting we will be able to use a particular cloaking technology that will make them disappear from the sight of their companions and other security systems. The spider-bot, this particular electronic and remote-controlled spider, is particularly fun to use and will be the protagonist of some really successful platform phases. The parkour system is good but a few more animations would definitely have made it more satisfying. As for driving vehicles, the system closely resembles that of the second Watch Dogs, slightly modified to better adapt it to the narrow streets of the English capital. But how the bikes bend remains unbearable, today as yesterday. The use of drones is instead a joy, and the maneuverability will depend on their type; drones can be used to take pictures remotely, to explore particular areas and in the case of the transporter ones, bigger than the others, also to load and unload loads in order to open paths for us, bomb enemies and even make us fly around by climbing on them for the city. dri", "date": "2020-10-28", "grade": "7.8"}
