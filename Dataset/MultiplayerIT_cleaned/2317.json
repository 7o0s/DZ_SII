{"name": "Rayman M", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-m.html", "text": "Made in Italy? As many of you will remember, the very nice Rayman made his debut in a video game released for PC which in 1995 achieved good success despite the genre not being widespread on computers. A lot of time has passed since then and in the meantime our friend has taken the opportunity to get acquainted with practically all the platforms on the market. Completely detached from tradition, this Rayman M tries to transfer all the elements, all the characters and the adventures experienced by the most famous aubergine man (very similar to us) in the world into a party game. To begin I tell you that we are not in the presence of a kart game but a completely different game consisting of 2 main modes: race and battle. The peculiarity of what I have just revealed lies in the fact that the two sections of the game were developed separately by 2 Ubi Soft development teams: the first French, based in Paris, the second Italian, based in Milan. You got it right! It is certainly not an everyday occurrence that an important title like this is produced, even if partially, in Italy. Obstacle course As I have already pointed out, all the characters who have made the fortune of the platform are present in Rayman M. It is in fact possible to select Rayam, Globox, Razorbeard, Henchman and the very funny Teensies, in addition to the secret characters unlockable through the game. Although Rayman M is a game devoted to multiplayer, at least initially you will have to devote the right amount of time to single-player to be able to unlock the largest number of tracks and arenas. Leaving aside however any consideration on the single player, boring and repetitive as in any title of this type, I think it is right to talk to you above all about the two ways in which I was able to dabble with three of my friends. The race is certainly the one I appreciated the most, above all thanks to its originality and the variety of tracks available. In practice, these are real platform courses, to be repeated a certain number of times, which you will have to complete by reaching the finish line before your opponents. The number of actions at your disposal is truly remarkable and will help you overcome all kinds of obstacles. You can jump from platform to platform, hang from lianas, slide on water, climb nets but above all try to obstruct the path of the other competitors. With the shot button it is in fact possible to hit mysterious buttons that will activate pitfalls, block the way for those who follow you or even allow you to access very advantageous shortcuts. The races, although short-lived, are most often very ~stretched~, a factor that makes a gaming experience that deserves to be tried even more exciting. Ultimately I found the Race mode very funny, made even more amusing by the exuberant sympathy of all the characters in the game. Deathmatches As for the Battle mode, the story changes completely. Much of the originality that characterizes the game is in fact lost. In practice we will have to participate in the usual deathmatch in more or less large arenas with the usual arsenal of weapons available. The latter, to tell the truth, represent the only news worthy of note above all thanks to some found absolutely out of this world. For the rest the game develops with a certain confusion and it's a shame because I think that much more could have been done. This does not mean that you will still have fun because, despite the defects, it is always satisfying to beat each other up. More slowdowns? Graphically, Rayman M's improvements are immediately apparent. Although we are not faced with the best expression of the power of the PS2 hardware, the textures are decidedly more varied and detailed than in Rayman Revolution and the greater number of polygons on the screen certainly do not represent a detail to be underestimated. The only flaw, which can be found from time to time especially in Race mode, are the annoying slowdowns of the graphics engine which unfortunately also gripped the first game. This is nothing particularly unsustainable but it is still legitimate to turn up one's nose in the face of a defect that has not been corrected. The audio sector is instead of a good level as usual. promoted? Overall, Ubi Soft's new effort proves to be a good game, worthy of attention from all PlayStation 2 owners who have a multitap and especially 3 friends ready to do battle. Due to his nature, Rayman M should only be taken into consideration if the conditions listed above exist. Some doubts remain about the Battle mode which, although fun, I don't think can hold a candle to the still unsurpassed deathmatch of Time Splitters. Despite this, our Rayman once again deserves the promotion with full marks. Pros: Improved graphics Fun and addictive Amazing in 4 ... Cons: ... boring alone battle not without flaws Rayman goes multiplayer! The first platformer to arrive on PlayStation 2 was the beautiful Rayman Revolution by Ubi Soft, a non-revolutionary title that kept me pleasantly busy for several evenings. Almost a year later, the man-ray makes his return to the Sony console with a new game that has very little in common with its predecessor. Rayman M (the ~M~ stands for ~Multiplayer~) is not in fact the new chapter of the popular platform but a party game that bears witness to Ubi Soft's desire to make its mascot follow the same path followed in the past by illustrious colleagues such as Mario and Crash Bandicoot. The transition from platform to multiplayer game has therefore been repeated with this game that aspires to a leadership position in this genre. Will Rayman be able to conquer us once again?", "date": "2001-12-12", "grade": null}
