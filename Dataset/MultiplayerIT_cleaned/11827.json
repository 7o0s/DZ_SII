{"name": "NHL 2K8 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-2k8-recensione.html", "text": "The winter period is always very prosperous for ice hockey lovers. In fact, both EA Sports and 2K have been offering their respective skate franchises for years, each with its own strengths. As regards the new 2K Sports product, examined in this review, Visual Concepts and Kush Games reproduce the characteristics that have built the fame of the series over time, a powerful simulation component combined with a high level of difficulty. A game not for everyone therefore, but mainly aimed at the purists of this sport. Unfortunately, as we will see later, several shadows are not absent. Face off! As we know, hockey is a very tough discipline, where the brutality of tackles is not only tolerated, but favored by the rules themselves. Relentless tackles, very violent clashes on the sideline walls (elastic not by chance), demonic turmoil around the extreme defenders, to get to the real fistfights between players. They are all elements perfectly reproduced and glorified in this playful transposition, elements that the neophyte will have to accept without conditions, the frozen field of the NHL does not include pacifists. This newfound toughness is also expressed in the representation of the home fans, indifferent to the performance of the away team, but ready to blow up the stadium after a goal scored by their favorites. And the climate of tension leaves very little to envy to a real match. Also this year the choice offered by the options proves to be substantial, with the possibility of playing friendlies, excellent for breaking the ice (staying on the subject), up to the central body represented by the season, perhaps one of the most complex and best made in a title of this kind. In between, however, we also find many fun gimmicks, such as games played on special fantasy mini-fields, placed in improbable scenarios, or multiplayer mini-games, very similar to those offered by Sega's Virtua Tennis. For the squads available, we undoubtedly appreciate the possibility of choosing national teams (unfortunately Italy is missing), or the peremptory US league. Nonetheless, the picture is very satisfactory. Who wants the Pro Stick? Favored by a more functional interface than in the past, we are finally transported to the field. It's an opportunity to get acquainted with the graphics engine, an enhanced version of last year, which finally demonstrates a certain maturity with the means provided by the nextgen. The aesthetic impact is guaranteed by an excellent polygonal construction of the stadiums, including the spectators (even if a little approximate), and the enchanting rendering of the ice. We are pleased to discover that compared to a beta of the Playstation 3 version that reached us some time ago, the reflections of the players on the field have been added, and everything moves in the splendor of 60fps, with slight and negligible uncertainties. The replays, on the other hand, don't prove to be as fluid, and the graphics in general are inferior to Electronic Arts' little brother NHL 08, but the 2K title knows how to take a powerful revenge on the presentation, which is absolutely exceptional. Even the endless opening ceremony alone is worth a look. But the interludes, the post-goal celebrations, the close-ups on the benches are no less, all bombarded by statistics of all kinds. Everything is meticulously cared for and it really seems to be watching a television broadcast. Unfortunately it is on the playful side that NHL 2k8 is struggling to convince, largely due to the new control system called Pro Stick, the purpose of which is to carry shots and passes on the right analog stick, usually little used in sports titles. The intent is commendable, but there is a long way to go before obtaining an intuitive system that does not make you regret the old one. And unfortunately the Pro Stick soon proves to be an all too cumbersome implementation, which makes game maneuvers difficult. Almost as a proof of lack of conviction on the part of the coders themselves, among the options we find the possibility of returning to the good and old buttons. And you will do it very soon, thus rediscovering an old, tested game system, which differs little or nothing from last year's one. I'll split you in two The fearsome opposing AI is another problem that afflicts the single player. His continuous and unstoppable attacks are capable of putting anyone in difficulty. Asphyxiating choral actions, superstar moves that are difficult to parry and shutter goalkeepers are his pass, even at the lowest difficulty level. This choice could be a good incentive to carefully learn the dynamics of the game, but one cannot overlook some gaps inherited from the old chapters, which affect the resources offered to the playerbull. Above all the poor effectiveness of one timer attacks and shots on goal, which often have to be loaded for an excessive time, with the result of having the puck stolen from the cpu in most cases. The challenge is guaranteed, but also a substantial dose of frustration, given that the first matches will prove to be real bloodsuckers with tennis results. The online section is very complete, as well as the previous chapters, we will be able to play player matches, ranked or entire seasons and personalized tournaments. Unfortunately, however, the servers are plagued by problems, lag, disconnections and games with half framerates. We hope 2K fixes all issues soon. Comment The NHL 2K Sports saga, after the past victories over the EA counterpart, unfortunately has to give way. Great presentation, a satisfactory graphic aspect that does justice to the nextgen platforms, but also too many problems represented by the controls, still linked to the old chapters, dated and inefficient to face an excessively competitive CPU. The Pro Stick system is quickly forgotten, and without the possibility of returning to the standard controls, it would have seriously compromised the value of this 2008 edition. But fortunately this was not the case, and it is possible to enjoy an excellent hockey simulation, even with the awareness, at least for this year, of not being the best. For Playstation 3 owners, this is the only version on the market that guarantees 60 frames per second, a not irrelevant selection criterion. Pros Beautiful presentation Graphically improved since last year Still very simulative Cons A bit too difficult Pro Stick Online system iffy", "date": "2007-11-15", "grade": null}
