{"name": "4-4-2 - World Football 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/4-4-2-world-football-2003.html", "text": "Teams immediately on the attack As soon as the game starts we have a pleasant surprise before our eyes, the game modes appear to us in fact numerous and quite varied. We will be able to decide to throw ourselves into the classic Career mode, to take the reins of a company in the Championship already advanced or to lead a team during a ~historic~ competition: we will thus be able to decide, for example, to go back in time and impersonate the National trap with a Juventus on the eve of the '82 world championships. Names like Rossi, Scirea, Bergomi, Maradona, Van Basten, Platini and company will thus be on the agenda. As a first approach we have chosen the innovative and pleasant Scenario mode, that is the one in which, instead of finding ourselves having to achieve the usual objectives of fame, glory and wealth, we will have to achieve different objectives from time to time. Therefore, 15 days from the end of the championship, you may have to try to save a run-down Parma team from a very probable relegation or be hired at the beginning of the season by a rampant Serie B team to reach the top category within eight months. In short, those who don't have the time - or desire - to embark on a long and exhausting game lasting dozens of seasons or those who need to be motivated to always reach new and unimaginable goals have found what's right for them. Counterattack There is no doubt that fanatics of the genre will start immediately by embarking on the usual Career mode which has always been the fulcrum of this genre of games since the times of the now legendary and prehistoric ~The Manager~ of the German Software 2000. From the moment of choosing our jacket we will discover well how soon we can forget about the completeness and thoroughness of the Campionship Manager Database. We will only be able to choose between Serie A and Serie B and the selectable championships, although they are about twenty in total, are far from the majestic infinity of the aforementioned SI Games title. But you know, the completeness of the players DB is certainly not everything and then we certainly cannot say that the one used by 4-4-2 turns out to be scarce: just don't make ungrateful comparisons. Once our team has been chosen, we are asked whether to take over the purely technical aspect or whether to venture into commercial management as well. Also in this case we can only praise the possibility given by the developers to carve out the game in our image and likeness as much as possible. The options given by the financial section are definitely many and promise to make the purest management enthusiast spend a lot of time. If, on the other hand, you are a purist and appreciate the fact of being relegated to the role of ~simple~ coach, and remain anchored to the economic resources imposed by the skill of the team manager, 4-4-2 still promises you full control over every single aspect of the technical/tactical growth of your team. Tactical substitution? The graphical interface of the title, while always trying to offer a nice and pleasant aspect, sometimes reveals itself not fully capable of guaranteeing fast and immediate access to information, fortunately after a few hours of play things get decidedly rosier and we will be able to easily juggle all the numerous selectable options. The different alternatives to better optimize the performance of your players are decidedly varied and numerous, unlike other titles of the genre, then, we will be able to more easily identify the key role for a given player. If on the one hand this takes away the difficulty and bite of the game, on the other it avoids making us lose useless game sessions for details which, in the end, should only prove to be marginal. The section dedicated to training follows the direction taken by most of the latest titles released on the market. For each player or team department we will be able to specify the composition, duration and intensity of the different training sections. We assure you that even this part of the game alone will keep you busy for a long time. But, as you know, the real fulcrum of this type of game, just like in reality, lies on the playing field during those 90 fateful minutes which will sanction, often ungenerously, the success or failure of your work during the preparation. 4-4-2 like many other titles has chosen to give the player various choices: it will be possible to experience the match directly - and literally - from the sidelines, to follow the match from a more aseptic overviewbut certainly also more useful and revealing, or to jump directly to conclusions. A pleasant novelty compared to what is offered by the football managerial panorama is the fact that, using the ~bench mode~, it will be possible to give orders to our players: the Trap makes us a mustache! Unfortunately, it pains us to say, the evolution of matches often appears quite unrelated to our decisions made on the bench and, above all, from the week of preparation preceding the match. Everything often appears rather random and chaotic, depriving us of that feeling of ~total control~ which instead is more papil in other direct competing titles. It's a shame, because also in this case the SCi games wanted to offer us some nice news compared to what we have seen so far, starting from the already mentioned possibility of experiencing the match from the baseline up to being able to literally enter the locker room and personally motivate our boys and give the latest tactical corrections: practically useless but really atmospheric. Final whistle So what about this new football manager? Some nice features will not fail to pleasantly surprise more than one player but unfortunately, on balance (at least for those looking for complexity and completeness of data), 4-4-2 will risk appearing too superficial and sometimes even chaotic and random. An attempt to introduce something innovative in the genre unfortunately only half successful, by virtue of some serious shortcomings that affect precisely what, however, should be the strong point in this genre of games. Ultimately we can say without a doubt that 4-4-2 is an honest title that will be appreciated mostly by newbies or by all those who have always considered the Scudetto series too wordy and verbose in the management of the modules and, instead, too sacrificed in the purely economic aspect of managing a team. All the others would do well to hang on for a few more months. Kick off Almost like a bolt from the blue, when everyone is waiting for Championship Manager 4, this interesting 4-4-2 developed by the British SCi Games arrives on our shelves which, after the car carnage in Carmaggedon, decided to devote themselves to the most loved sport in the old continent. In fact, after the defection of the PC Calcio evenings (Dynamic, in fact, went bankrupt) in recent times the fans began to feel a little too much the lack of a new Football Manager ready to satisfy all our most hidden football passions which emerge more and more forcefully thanks to the technical commissioner who is hidden in each of us, or almost. Let's say right away, however, that 4-4-2 does not seem to want to undermine the dominance of the genre in the now ten-year masterpiece by the Coeller brothers, let's say rather that it wants to act as a pleasant diversion or, at least, as a less rigorous alternative to recommend to beginners or all those who simply want to unplug from the unattainable Championship Manager (also known by us as Scudetto).", "date": "2002-12-27", "grade": null}
