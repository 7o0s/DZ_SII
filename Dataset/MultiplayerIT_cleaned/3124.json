{"name": "Gears Tactics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gears-tactics-recensione.html", "text": "As we began to reflect on the Gears Tactics review, it quickly became clear to us that revisiting XCOM has not only brought luck to Firaxis, but has given the opportunity for many developers to try to build something similar, and often with a good response from the public. After decades without a strategy worthy of the famous series, between indies and renowned software houses, the alternatives to XCOM are certainly not lacking today; let's not forget that there is also a version in Nintendo sauce, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, created by the Milanese studios Ubisoft which, to date, remains one of the best-selling third-party titles on Switch. For us fans it's always good news when a new one is announced, because there are never enough games like XCOM, and also good news was discovering that Splash Damage and The Coalition would team up to make Gears transform of War, the most captivating third-person shooter of recent years, in a high-sounding Gears Tactics. The operation is as clever as it is intelligent, made with love and rich in production, but presents some problems which partially limit its undisputed qualities. The balance undoubtedly remains positive, but it is impossible to hide that bitter aftertaste when the credits roll on the screen. A little XCOM, all Gears Clarification: Gears Tactics does not want to replace XCOM, it does not have the qualities but neither does it have the intentions given that starting from the campaign, up to the most substantial differences in the gameplay, in the Microsoft game there is a very clear intention to simplify and speed up. In Gears Tactics there is no shadow of more managerial mechanics, and you are not involved in strategic choices but only in tactical ones, i.e. that closely involve the soldiers on the battlefield. The game is structurally more similar to its action counterpart, with an already engraved and therefore extremely linear plot, tied to a sequence of missions that will force an alternation between main and secondary ones that works quite well in the first act, slowly transforming into a sort of ballast. The problem with Gears Tactics is that the further you go, the more secondary ones to complete to unlock the next big main mission will increase, an artifice that considering the proposed tasks seems more a way to lengthen the adventure, rather than to tell a better story, or offer increasingly hot situations to the player. But the linearity offered by Gears Tactics shouldn't necessarily be seen as a limitation, which is only true once the game is over, but a way to offer a more concentrated and less dispersive experience than XCOM, which we are sure will be appreciated by some players who find the Firaxis masterpiece too cerebral and somewhat intimidating. What could generate problems is not so much having preferred a pre-established plot to a more open structure, but the fact that this immediately reveals the classic Gears story, with all its classic limitations and less and less popular points of Force. The characters are better than the plot, especially those who will enter the scene in the more advanced stages. Of course if this type of story, if this stereotypical drama and its excessive characters still stimulates some interest in you, no problem: you are in an iron barrel. All the others, however, do not hold back: once you have your handful of soldiers at the controls, the fun is such that the context will inevitably lose its importance, in short, you can easily ignore every word to concentrate on the gameplay. Free movement While it's not the first strategist to try, Gears Tactics' attempt to do away with the classic grids of the genre is probably the best and most accurate yet. As you probably already know, in strategy games units can usually only be moved to predefined squares which sometimes have the shape of a square and others of hexagons, and it is the system that XCOM also uses. Gears Tactics eliminates this chess legacy from the equation by allowing the user to move his soldiers freely or almost freely on the battlefield. Movement points are still present, three per character net of any bonuses, which can be used to walk more or less far, to shoot weapons and use any special powers. The absence of the grids inevitably leads to a slight approximation, which becomes clearly visible when, for example, we are granted those extra meters to reach the selected coverage, but which does not generate any imbalance in the gameplay. Indeed, to be honest, Splash Damage could not have made a better choice: despite a class settingica would have saved him a lot of headaches, we wouldn't have had the right amount of ~Gears~ because it's clearly a ~Gears~ we've been playing. The greatest result achieved by this strategy is to have kept the pillars of the Epic game and subsequently The Coalition standing. The ability to move freely, having taken boxes and diagonals out of the way, is just one of the things that have allowed us to recreate that rhythm, that type of close quarter combat for which Gears of War has become famous. Justice and do not stop Gears Tactics locusts tend to attack in large waves, making extensive use of a particular overwatch / surveillance system that we will soon have to learn to use too. Unlike other games, where this function allows a unit to open fire if a moving enemy enters its field of vision, in Gears Tactics to activate overwatch it is necessary to draw a colored cone on the ground which will determine the direction from keep an eye on, and at what distance from the enemy to start shooting. This is perhaps the best element of Gears Tactics battles, because it makes classic overwatch part of a larger strategy. Another non-exclusive feature of this game but still well interpreted by the developers is the possibility of receiving an extra movement point for each unit on the field. To do this, you will first need to land an enemy, and then finish him off with a coup de grace exactly as happens in the classic Gears; note that the possibility of receiving an extra movement point is valid as long as you have enemies to execute, and consequently it can extend a single turn quite a bit, sometimes even until you have completely eliminated the alien menace. In reality this is a bit the secret of all Gears Tactics: here the opposing waves must be swept away in a continuous flow, or rather by giving them as few spaces as possible by shooting, sawing and pulping before they have the opportunity to set up even the most timid answer. Talent issue To do this we will logically have to make the most of the abilities of each character, between heroes (i.e. the protagonists who will never, ever die) and soldiers of fortune who will join our cause along the way (which in some cases we will be able to afford to sacrifice battle). The characters who survive the battles will collect experience points that we can spend on many skills, both active and passive and different for each role. The depth of the offering is such that it is possible to turn two soldiers of the same role into suitable combatants in very different situations. During the missions, with a minimum of effort towards exploration, we will be able to get our hands on different crates containing numerous modifications for each of the weapons present, (divided into sights, stocks, shoulder pads, bolts and magazines), in order to increase further the degree of specialization of the individual unit, but also to give each fire-breathing a unique character. As tradition is not always respected, even in Gears Tactics it is possible to customize the appearance of each soldier, choosing the most suitable armor among those unlocked, and applying and coloring patterns to be used also on weapons; it is also possible to change the name, surname and nickname of each soldier, except of course the heroes. Destroyed beauty Gears Tactics starts off with a bang, so much so that you never want to stop playing. It's too good to position our soldiers to have each other's backs, launch them in pursuit of enemies with the Lancer's saw ready for action, work with logic and strategy so that combat does not interrupt our journey towards the shift goal. But above all it is moving and fighting in environments that once again recall the destroyed beauty of the very first episodes, extraordinarily gothic but still able to let the shining wonder of a past shine through that is never shown to us, and that we can only imagine. In fact, it's impossible not to all agree on one thing: graphically Gears Tactics is one of the best strategies out there, if not the best. The Unreal Engine 4 has been used so flawlessly that the difference with the imposing Gears 5 is above all a question of style, rather than strictly technical. It is a pity that from the second act graphic elements will begin to recur with a certain insistence, which is acceptable if the maps were created procedurally but which is quite annoying in such a guided game, which has the possibility of surprising in each mission in its hands. It is a problem that, as anticipated, also involves the proposed missions, all very similar to each othernot only in the objectives, a relative problem, but precisely in the implementation. The boss of the remix From mid-game onwards, the surprise effect decreases consistently and that great desire to devour the game will decrease accordingly. Luckily some main missions do everything to raise the player's attention, especially those that will put you in front of bigger enemies who will be fought and defeated like classic end-of-level bosses: learning their strategies, adapting to the different attack phases and responding accordingly by making the most of any (inevitable!) weaknesses. The pacing problem that occurs in the more advanced stages of the game is also a difficulty balancing problem, with some peaks that could annoy even the most patient of strategists. It took us about thirty hours to get to the end of Gears Tactics and after the credits we were honored with a new veteran mode. By choosing it, we will be able to continue playing and improve our soldiers by testing ourselves with ~remixed~ versions of the missions already completed; this is a pretty sincere way to grant Gears Tactics that perpetuity typical of the genre, and we appreciated it, but it quickly becomes clear that the limits to the game structure do not provide enough motivation to keep fighting. At this point, much better to start over by testing yourself with a higher level of difficulty.", "date": "2020-04-27", "grade": "8.0"}
