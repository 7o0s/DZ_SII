Our virtual alter-ego, in addition to the single and double jump, will be able, for example, to use the nearby walls as a bank, bounce off a wall to surprise an enemy from behind, or via a combination of keys, he will be able to perform a lethal jump attack without any cover or defence. Carrying out combos and movements of this type would be practically impossible through the first person view, hence the possibility, simply by pressing a button, to switch the camera. Performing combos and movements of this type would be practically impossible from the first person view Matrix has made school As for the single player, UC2 offers 16 usable characters, of which only half are available from the start and offers three main game options. The story mode, complete with a simple outline of the plot, is just a gimmick to keep the evolution of the fights linked. The second mode derives from the classic single player fighting game, it will, in fact, be possible to select a character and face the remaining fighters in a series of 15 matches. The third available mode is a sort of challenge with different variables, which change according to the clashes and is at the same time the most challenging to finish. Worthy of praise, the significant improvement of the AI in the individual Bots: before starting a match, it will be necessary to pay attention to which skill level is selected, among the five available, the last two are even too exaggerated. The same goes for the characterization of our opponents, thanks to different personalities and types of combat. It should also be remembered the opportunity to insert the various bots, practically in any game mode, even online ones. Another change, compared to the past, is the inclusion of an adrenaline indicator, which is charged through the bonuses scattered throughout the levels or through our performances during the match. This adrenaline allows you to use particular abilities and special powers, from energy regeneration, to invisibility, to enhanced damage and so on. The balance between the various types of long-range weapons and melee weapons is well calibrated, and a player who learns to use all the new features inserted will become extremely lethal and even for the ~old school~ experts will be a real problem. The management of the camera is well done, without particular uncertainties, the lock function on a particular opponent is definitely useful, without intervening on the aim, it always follows our target by centering the screen. Last, but not least, is the possibility of blocking enemy bullets and consequently limiting damage, by pressing the two triggers, while using a melee weapon. With the passage of the Unreal brand to Midway, the UC2 team, taking advantage of the greater time available to finish the game, was able not only to further optimize the graphics engine, but also to insert several bonuses deriving from another well-known brand, that of Mortal Kombat. In UC2 we will be able to use some sound effects deriving from MK, unlock Raiden as a secret character, or we will be able to create similar ~fatalities~ in certain circumstances. Multiplayer, what a passion... As far as multiplayer modes are concerned, UC2 really offers its best. Present the classic deathmatch or team deathmach, capture the flag and the like, a new and particular type of game has been added: Overdose. The main objective is to maintain a radioactive sphere as much as possible, avoiding or killing other opponents and the peculiarity lies in the fact that this sphere gives the player more and more additional powers and abilities, constantly increasing its power, so much so that the clashes one against many will no longer be a problem. The graphics engine does not present new techniques such as normal mapping, to Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, but the result is still at the top of the category. Liandri Conflict supports up to eight players in multiplayer or two in split screen mode. The arenas available to the multiplayer section are over 40, all with different settings and dimensions. Supported as of course, downloading additional content via Xbox Live. The UC2 code does its job very well in all the games I've played on Live. The choice to limit the players to eight, although it will cause discussions for some users, undoubtedly pays off in these situations. The match customization options are numerous, among the tthe possibility of forcing the game only with melee weapons and the ~old style~ one stand out, which eliminates the adrenaline, the third person view, and the hand-to-hand combat, bringing everything back to its origins. Multiplayer, what a passion... Glimpses of Liandri As far as the graphic aspect is concerned, there are absolutely no recriminations to make to the development team. The graphics engine does not present new techniques such as normal mapping, to Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, but the result is still at the top of the category. Leaving aside the interludes made in CG, one can only be satisfied with both the animations and the graphic quality. Number of polygons tripled for both models and settings, high-resolution textures, bump mapping, well-maintained particle effects and excellent visual cleanliness, even the frame rate has been made more stable than in the first chapter, the improvements can be seen all and this unreal engine modified and developed specifically for Xbox, does not feel the weight of the years at all. From the audio department we can see, or rather hear, a good implementation for background music, and good support for environmental effects and character voices, obviously supported by Dolby Digital 5.1. Comment Unreal Championship 2 is another high-level title, released in this period on the Microsoft console. Unreal Tournament purists will turn up their noses at all the changes brought by Liandri Conflict to the Epic fps structure, but this decision is simply called the evolution of the species. Unreal has never been so fun and suitable for a console, as in this title published by Midway. The only downsides are due to the limited player support for online matches, or the choice not to further develop the main single player campaign. Unreal Championship 2 is promoted without reservations, representing a practically obligatory stop for all game lovers via Xbox Live. Pros: Well-implemented AI multiplayer VFX Cons: Only eight players online No vehicles In November 2002, Unreal Championship was released, one of the launch titles of Xbox Live. Today the online service created by Microsoft, continuing to expand and improve, has reached its third revision, in practice it is the right time for the release of a sequel. Unreal Championship 2: Liandri Conflict is much more than a trivial graphical upgrade, indeed, it is probably the most significant evolution in the entire Epic Games series. The new Unreal is now a hybrid between a first person shooter and a third person fighting game, the novelties are many, the most evident is the possibility of alternating the view between first and third person. This choice is not simply an aesthetic addition, but rather a fundamental part of managing the renewed game mechanics. This chapter is also strongly oriented towards multiplayer action, but unlike its predecessor, it offers a good offline section, which proves to be essential in order to better learn the new features added. In practice, a real workout to be able to compete on Xbox Live. With regard to all the new features included, there is a tutorial section that will allow you to become familiar with all types of commands, in a completely painless way. In UC2 there are differences between long range and melee weapons, in particular the latter are linked to the control of the character with a third person view, in fact by selecting them, the camera changes automatically to better manage melee combat. Melee combat is implemented through two types of attack, the normal one and the strong one, which differ in execution time and damage caused. Weapon handling, as well as seeing some excellent returns from previous Unreals, has also been completely overhauled. Now each character has its own melee weapon and a long-range weapon by default, at the same time you can insert, at your choice, two other different weapons.", "date": "2005-04-22", "grade": null}
