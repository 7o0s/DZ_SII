Not that he lacks irony, but in the face of the overabundance of joke video games in recent months, what we once would have considered a manifestation of anarchist creativity today risks passing as a joke out of time. Stripping it down to the bone, we could describe it as a pixel art Goat Simulator with a dog instead of a goat. The objective is to control a quadrupedal friend hatched from an egg and make him run around a virtual environment where he can interact with different objects, with no specific purpose other than to see some skits or unlock achievements on Steam. The dog also has physiological needs that must be considered, such as, for example, eating, drinking and sleeping. He also has to play, perhaps frisbee like a good dog, or some video game dedicated to his species. In general, they are all activities that lose their appeal in a matter of seconds. Some are forced to repeat them if you want to keep the dog's values positive and unlock the goals, but the conceptual limits of the whole play system show themselves to be inexorable after a very short time. The feeling that Domestic Dog Simulator conveys is that of being a big joke. But who or what he wants to make fun of is not very clear. As we said, our dog can interact in various ways with the scenario. For example, he can turn the television on or off, he can produce explosive poop to break some objects, he can accumulate money to buy things, and he can urinate profusely, coloring the whole world yellow, including other living creatures. For a few seconds it's also fun to spray squirrels and other stray dogs to see their reaction and accumulate experience points, but the effect wears off in the blink of an eye, i.e. as soon as you realize that basically it's completely superfluous to do so . Pixel barks Domestic Dog Simulator is presented in pixel art graphics, which basically doesn't mean much. In this case, for example, it results in bad 2D with poorly drawn and animated sprites, including those of dogs. When it comes to independent titles it is always difficult to understand whether the graphic carelessness is the result of a precise choice or inability. Maybe the roughness of the technical side is just meant to underline the roughness of the theme of the game itself, but everything is hazy. Not that Squirreltopia, the developer's previous title, was who knows what a stylistic masterpiece, but at least there was gameplay to speak of here, while here there are only situations to unlock. Of course, focusing a game on skits should have advised at least to make them well, but at this point it's really a matter of quibbling about a project that is deficient as a whole, certainly not just in the details. It's not as disastrous as a Grass Simulator or a Rock Simulator, because at least something is done and there are secrets to discover, but otherwise a word hovers around it that it's not too hard to focus on: useless. It takes less than an hour to realize this, which is also the time Domestic Dog Simulator runs out of all its cards (it took us longer to write this article than to discover most of the secrets of the game, so to speak).
