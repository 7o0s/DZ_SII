Heir to the Stealth Inc. one released a year ago on various platforms, the new Curve Digital title is a surprising Wii U exclusive that does not drastically revolutionize the original formula, building on it a series of very solid foundations on which to build what could be a very interesting franchise. The only problem is that it is aimed at a precise niche of players, so if you don't like gratuitous violence, if you have little patience and if you hate swearing like weasels, you better move on immediately: this is tough stuff. Didn't you notice the subtitle? It's spot on, trust me. Stealth Inc. 2 is a bloody and brainy puzzle/platformer - just what Wii U needed! The clones of the night Once again trapped in a security systems factory, your job will be to lead a small clone - and all those who follow him - to safety through a series of increasingly diabolical levels that mix puzzles, platforming sequences and stealthy approaches: the rooms of the factory are greyish and dark cubicles in which stylized sprites move, but the protagonists are neither the clones nor the details, but rather the play of light produced by the sources of dynamic lighting set against obstacles and other elements of the scenario. In this sense, very little has changed since last year's Stealth Inc., so much so that the control system has remained the same, with a GamePad button dedicated to jumping, one to duck and one to interact with the appropriate elements of the scenario . The touch screen of the controller itself, in fact, is used very little, except when you want to change the appearance of our clone with the various collectible accessories or you play in ~cooperative~, one with traditional commands and the other who intervenes on the small screen to help him solve the puzzles. For the rest, Stealth Inc. 2 slavishly follows the formula of the prequel, with its strengths and weaknesses: the puzzles in the various stages are becoming more and more complex and choral, forcing us to jump, to hide in the shadows or to use the various gadgets to themed to avoid the drones that hover around the screen and dodge the gruesome deadly traps along the way. The differences with the predecessor, in fact, are not so much in the structure of the levels and the puzzles themselves, but in the solution of continuity represented by an unprecedented freely explorable map that leads to the various sets of levels. In some ways the progression resembles that of a ~metroidvania~, with the various areas inaccessible until a certain gadget is recovered: just complete the corresponding set of levels and the gadget becomes usable also on the external map, thus allowing us to reach new areas, new levels and hidden objects otherwise untraceable. The idea is very nice, but Curve Digital has not implemented it perfectly: Stealth Inc. 2 is already very difficult and vague in itself, and the progression in the map tends to be a bit too slow and fragmented, especially until you guess exactly the solution of a particular puzzle. Of course, the philosophy of the game is exactly that, but just like in the prequel, this time too we will often be left to ourselves, with no suggestions apart from a few sibylline phrases, especially mocking ones: the vast majority of the puzzles are solved by ~trial and error ~, but the main map is much more extensive and lacks the immediacy and focus of the individual levels, thus also being a bit dispersive. Luckily, the puzzles in the thematic levels are much smarter, and although they require quite a few attempts and a pinch of luck, the combination of gadgets and actions required to reach certain exits would deserve a prize for the imagination, despite the fact that in some cases they go too far, requiring reflexes and truly nerves of steel. So it's not surprising that the level editor is back in Stealth Inc. 2 and that this time it allows us to share our sadistic creations with other players via Miiverse; it's a shame, however, that the interface is quite confusing and complex, especially in the logic menus that made us miss those of games like LittleBigPlanet, and therefore lose its appeal very quickly.", "date": "2014-11-10", "grade": "8.0"}
