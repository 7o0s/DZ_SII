{"name": "NHL Hitz 20-02", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-hitz-20-3.html", "text": "A sport to be played in the fresh air! I confess that I have always been a fan of the arcade genre of sports games. Alongside the acclaimed simulations that we all know (Winning Eleven, NBA 2K...), even less realistic titles often manage to stand out for their high fun factor. I am referring to old glories of the past such as the legendary NBA Jam or more recent productions such as ISS by KCEO, NBA Street and Virtua Tennis, which I still dust off with pleasure. Since my collection lacks an ice hockey game of the same mold as the aforementioned ones, I awaited the arrival of this NHL Hitz 20-02 with a certain curiosity and I must admit that the wait was not in vain. The first impression is immediately favorable, thanks above all to the notes of the legendary Limp Bizkit, protagonists of an introductory film full of spectacular actions of a sport that certainly does not spare physical clashes. As I have already pointed out several times, we are dealing with an arcade game and the differences with ~real~ sport are such that some of you could probably feel disoriented. To begin with, only three players per team (plus the goalkeeper) take to the ice, a choice that allows the development of a more immediate and frenetic game. If we add to this that any type of violent intervention is allowed and that the players ~set themselves on fire~ after scoring 3 goals, I think the presentation picture is clearer. You got it right, the players catch fire! The memory goes back to the times of NBA Jam and that ~He is on fire!~ pronounced by the commentator, who set the ball and player on fire, giving them paranormal powers. More or less the same thing happens in NHL Hitz 20-02, so you shouldn't be surprised to see lightning strike your players and flames engulf them from head to toe. But is it hockey or wrestling? The surprises are certainly not over. Much of the gameplay is based on the physical clashes and defensive effectiveness of the 3 movement men on the field and the goalkeeper himself who often and willingly will make an attempt on the life of anyone who gets too close to his goal. Any means is lawful to stop the opponents and it doesn't matter whether they are in possession of the ball or not. And so the matches will most often become saloon brawls with shoves, punches, club blows, tripping and it will not rarely happen to see some unfortunate person break the balustrade and end up in the audience. Fortunately, the technical factor is still important and it won't be enough to hit harder than your opponents. Qualities such as speed, passing/shooting accuracy and shooting power differ from player to player and team to team. So don't expect striker Forsberg to be as strong as the bottom of the worst team's bench seats. Speaking of teams, all 30 National Hockey League teams could not be missing, with their respective players, as well as 14 fantasy formations that it will be possible to unlock by winning games. Among these teams, the formations of clowns, game programmers and various animals stand out. It will also be possible to unlock new stadiums (arenas on an extraterrestrial planet, in crowded squares, in a coliseum...) and many little extras such as new t-shirts and fantasy characters. As for the game modes, we have the inevitable exhibition (single game), season and championship with the addition of seven more or less absurd but not too fun mini-games. Draw your weapons: speed and precision! Moving on to the actual game, I must admit that this NHL Hitz 20-02 is really fun or at least it is most of the time. Fast and spectacular, it doesn't really allow breaks, so much so that during the three periods of play foreseen for each game you will hardly be able to distract yourself and take your eyes off the screen. Unfortunately, everything could be repetitive, as the simulation aspect is present in small doses and just beating up your opponents may not be enough as a stimulus. Much better goes with the multiplayer mode, absolutely amazing when shared with three friends ready to spit blood on the ice. In this case, in addition to the offensive phase, it will be easier to build effective offensive actions, passing plots, until you find an unmarked partner for a comfortable shot. The more adventurous will not be able to resist the temptation to inflate the net with a powerful long-range shot, perhaps taking advantage of the fiery shots of your ~on fire~ players, who in most cases will reach speeds close to that of light. On the technical side , NHL Hitz 20-02 defends ratheralright, although the kinship of the game with the PS2 version released some time ago is more than evident. However, some improvements have been made compared to the latter, such as the textures that appear slightly more defined or the cleaning of the image that appears globally superior. Even the graphics engine always carries out its work with greater ease than in the original, although there are still some slowdowns that appear from time to time, especially in some arenas. The sound, on the other hand, is one of the best aspects of the game, above all thanks to the appropriate affections, a not very varied but entertaining commentary and absolutely top quality music. Many of you will recognize pieces from well-known bands such as Limp Bizkit or the equally popular Korn. In conclusion NHL Hitz 20-02 offers us everything we could ask for in an arcade hockey game: simplicity, spectacularity and a multiplayer mode of considerable depth. The variety and completeness of other more simulative productions (the first that comes to mind is NHL 2002) is light years away, but what NHL Hitz 20-02 loses from this point of view, it regains thanks to the fun factor that reaches unthinkable especially in 4 players. If you love sport, and hockey made in the usa, then you have found bread for your teeth. If, on the other hand, you do not digest everything that is not simulative, I advise you to give this game a chance anyway, for some of you it could reserve some surprises. Pros: Hilarious! Simple, fast, spectacular... Excellent music Numerous modes Amazing in multiplayer Arcade to the nth degree... Cons: Arcade to the nth degree Little variation at distance Some slowdown Materials: Tips Hockey like you've never seen it before...if you've seen it! ~A right, a left, an uppercut, a blow to the teeth...~. Don't worry, you haven't landed in the middle of a fight or in the deciding round of the world heavyweight boxing championship! Your life is not in danger or maybe it is, but only virtually! A presentation of this type would seem out of place if we weren't faced with yet another sporting effort by those crazy people from Midway. The latter, not happy with having overturned the rules of basketball, baseball and football in the past, try this time with another of the US national sports, ice hockey. The ingredients are the same that have distinguished Midway's productions: speed, frenzy, spectacularity and many, never too many, beatings! In short, we must expect the usual arcade festival, brought to the highest levels thanks to the particular characteristics of the sport in question.", "date": "2002-05-02", "grade": null}
