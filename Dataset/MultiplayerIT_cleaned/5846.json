For fans of the manga written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada in the 80s, and of the immortal animated transposition that we have seen over and over again on our small screens, Soldiers' Soul is certainly a concentrate of fanservice; it is a pity that, as already discussed in our review for PlayStation 4, the nostalgia factor has been leveraged a little too much, neglecting the fulcrum of fighting games, and that is the gameplay. Despite this, Soldiers' Soul is the first video game inspired by the Knights of the Zodiac to officially come out for PC: in the next paragraphs we will briefly describe its strengths and weaknesses, but for a more in-depth analysis we refer you to the aforementioned review of the console version. Console-less Knights of the Zodiac fans can finally play Soldiers' Soul: cheers? Asgard is not enough Thanks to the introduction of the Asgard saga - absent in Brave Soldiers, as it is not very appreciated at home - the roster has gained the eight original God Warriors and the priestess Hilda of Polaris, but strangely the other God Warriors who appeared in the animated miniseries Souls of Gold which inspired the subtitle of this Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul. Although the golden knights are also present in their divine armor, there is no real campaign dedicated to the series in which they wear them, but a sort of extra mode called Golden Battle in which you have to face ~What If~ by purchasing and spending Torches with the currency earned by playing the other modes. All of the additional content in Soldiers' Soul revolves around this currency, from the combat arenas to the illustrations, obviously passing through the alternative costumes. Soldiers' Soul, in fact, inherits from the previous Brave Soldiers a widely recycled roster, in which several characters wear different armor while not offering new fighting styles or special moves, apart from - and not always - the very powerful Big Bang Attacks. If there is one thing in which Soldiers' Soul is blatantly lacking, in fact, it is precisely the game dynamics that often transform the fights into tag matches in which the knights chase each other in the hope of a misstep that allows you to score a particularly effective special shot. The balancing of the roster, moreover, is leaking from all sides, and it was useless to make changes to the Cosmo indicator to make dodging less frequent and to encourage melee combat. Apart from the fact that each character has only two special moves and a series of combos that are completely identical in execution, the animations of the attacks are often too long and elaborate and, when they fail, they force us to unintentionally show our side while we wait for the sequence to end and the enemy prepares to hit us with his Big Bang Attack. The latter is a definitive blow that triggers a spectacular non-interactive sequence with devastating results, but unfortunately the locking animation of the Big Bang Attacks of many characters is absolutely useless, making those fighters decidedly less attractive. The player can get around the deficits of the characters by unlocking and equipping the battle cries, i.e. customizable bonuses, but the problem remains of a decidedly uncared-for underlying gameplay in which even the different dimensions of the characters affect the randomness of the collisions, such as for example in the case of the gigantic Thor and Aldebaran. The maximum power of the Cosmos? Once again Dimps was unable to use the historic soundtrack of the animated series, and thus had to resort to fairly anonymous songs or some discreet remixes, with all due respect to the fans who perhaps hoped to play on the notes of Soldier Dream or Pegasus Fantasy. As for the graphics, Brave Soldiers and Soldiers' Soul have never been masterpieces, but Dimps has at least effectively reproduced the features of the various knights, replicating quite faithfully the heroes and villains admired in the cartoon series thanks to a good use of cel shading. In particular, the developer has taken care of the appearance of the various armor as much as possible, employing a texturing work that has made the surfacesthere extremely shiny and metallic, perhaps even a little too much. In general, however, at first glance Soldiers' Soul looks quite good, even if you just need to sharpen your eyes to notice the most striking defects such as the bare and repetitive scenarios, the aforementioned collision problems and the lack of expressiveness of the characters during the cutscenes that tell the most important passages of the story. The PC version is almost indistinguishable from the PlayStation 4 we previously tested, which in turn was a rosewater conversion of the PlayStation 3, to which an anti-aliasing filter and a minimum of extra effects had simply been applied . In short, it is a visually modest product that our test configuration still ran excellently without detecting drops in frame rates or performance in general. In short, nothing transcendental and the few graphic options allow for a marginal improvement which translates into the choice of shadow resolution, the application of a modest FXAA anti-aliasing and the activation or deactivation of luminous and particle effects. The level of customization of the graphics settings is therefore quite limited, but the rest of the options seem to focus more on the quality of life than on that of the graphics.", "date": "2015-12-05", "grade": "6.0"}
