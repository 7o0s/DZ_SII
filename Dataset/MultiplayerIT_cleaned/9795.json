Doctor by profession, vampire hunter in his spare time, Van Helsing has seen his figure reinterpreted several times over the decades, to satisfy the needs of films and novels. In the video game Helsing's Fire, for example, we see him imitating Sherlock Holmes, engaged together with his faithful assistant Raffton in a truly demanding mission: to free London from the supernatural fog that has invaded its streets, and which has allowed hordes of creepy creatures to threaten the lives of its citizens. The instigator of the invasion is Count Dracula, who Helsing therefore finds himself facing again, hoping it will be the last time. The monsters that respond to the wishes of the Nosferatu fear the light, capable of paralyzing them, and can only be eliminated using particular tonics of different colors depending on the case. So how will the couple of men of science be able to get the better of this threat? The answer is simple: using fire and chemistry. The Vampire Slayer Helsing's Fire undoubtedly boasts respectable numbers, with its ninety stages of increasing difficulty and the survival mode as a welcome extra. However, its strengths lie in particular in the gameplay, which offers us an original mix of puzzle and action using only the touch screen of the Apple device. From the starting screen that characterizes each scenario we see the supernatural fog that gradually thins out, revealing ~boxes~ with the little monsters inside that we have the task of eliminating. We can therefore freely choose one of these areas and face their threats: the creatures are located in different points of the map and there are obstacles that prevent the light of our torch from reaching them. The key to solving each stage, then, is to flick the torch with your fingers to illuminate all enemies, then use a tonic to scatter it through the beams of light and incinerate them. Some creatures are blue, some are red, some are green, and so on: each color has a tonic, and using the wrong blend means buffing rather than eliminating the opponent. In fact, as we proceed, the monsters become more cunning and resistant, using barriers that must be destroyed beforehand. Furthermore, elements that we cannot hit enter the scene, such as sacrificial virgins or people transformed into werewolves. The number of tonics increases accordingly, giving us the opportunity to complete each puzzle (because that's what it is) in a predetermined number of moves or even save shots thanks to a particularly advantageous position. There is quite a bit of depth in the title developed by Ratloop, therefore, but there are also some gray areas (to stay on topic...): firstly, the replayability of the levels is extremely limited, given that once you have guessed the right position on the first lap there is no problem doing it again, and in seconds; secondly, the boss fights (yes, there are those too!) suffer from the oversimplification of such a loose control system. A small example: Count Dracula's first Acolyte usually throws daggers at our torch to turn it off, but just place it behind a cover on the fly for this maneuver to be completely harmless. The technical sector is full of style and nice solutions, ergo you shouldn't expect spectacular graphics as much as an excellent design and a really, really spot on musical accompaniment.
