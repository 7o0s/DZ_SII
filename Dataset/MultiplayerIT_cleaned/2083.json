{"name": "New Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-legends-2.html", "text": "Remote future New Legends is set in China in the distant future where ancient traditions are combined with incredible technological discoveries. The Chinese territory is threatened by dark and terrible forces led by the evil warlord Xao Gon who, with his army and his half-demon sons, is determined to conquer absolute power over all of China. The last bulwark against evil is the Kingdom of Soo, of which our character is none other than the prince. He will have to fight hard against Xao Gon and his evil power, through a series of catastrophic events and battles to the death between the forces of good and evil. The plot isn't very original and isn't developed in the best way, leaving the player with a feeling of disinterest in everything regarding the narrative and background aspect of the title. Gameplay New Legends is a pure action game that offers the player a very simple and intuitive control system. This could perhaps be the only advantage of the title in question: it is possible to move the character using the left analog stick while the B and X keys activate the attack moves. In fact, our alter ego will have a weapon for each arm ranging from the classic sword to the rifle (in the game there are a large number of weapons that our hero is able to use perfectly, such as a cannon) and the The user, by means of the keys mentioned above, will have the possibility of managing the attack both with the weapon located on the left arm and with the one present on the right arm. Using the A key instead, our character will be able to perform the classic jump to overcome any obstacles in his path, while with Y you have the possibility of parrying a blow from an opponent. The game allows the protagonist to carry a total of four weapons, two to be used at the moment and another two as a possible reserve, however some could be of such a size as to force our alter ego to use both arms for their correct use. The use of two swords at the same time to generate a sequence of blows that is really effective against enemy soldiers is very choreographic. From the point of view of the control system, New Legends proved to be very playable and immediate and also has a small innovation concerning the method of combat based, precisely on the use of the two arms each equipped with a particular weapon. As for the setting, New Legends offers a fair number of levels ranging from a palace besieged by evil forces to a prison located in Mongolia on an inaccessible mountain. The levels as a whole are made in a somewhat approximate way without a detail that characterizes them for spectacularity. In some points the game will allow us to try our hand at small purely arcade sessions such as avoiding an avalanche by running down a mountain. The peculiarity of New Legends is the large number of battles in the game, where both fierce enemies and our allies will take part, generating clashes with a large number of soldiers. This is certainly a positive aspect as well as having allied support during the various missions that will guide us towards the set objective. The missions are set in very extensive levels that could easily make you lose your bearings; to avoid this, the programmers have inserted a kind of compass indicating the direction to take to reach the key point. As for our hero's health, there is a light indicator that will show us the protagonist's vital energy. However, the energy can be recharged in special altars usually located in temples. Throughout the game we will have to face a large number of enemies ranging from the classic soldiers armed with swords, rifles and pistols to tanks and aerial vehicles equipped with machine guns, up to facing the terrible demons in the service of Xao Gon. In conclusion, the gameplay of New Legends is acceptable but let's remember that I'm talking about a purely arcade title and therefore devoid of any puzzle or reflective situation. Graphics and Sound Graphically, THQ's game turned out to be a real disappointment from whichever side you look at it. The graphics do not live up to the potential of the Microsoft console, the detail of the levels and fighters is rather low with little variety and poor quality textures. The special effects generated by the arMis, like flashes and explosions, are poorly done, and features like lens flare and anti-aliasing aren't used at all in the game. The graphics engine in some cases slows down even if the number of moving polygons is rather low. This is a negative aspect seen and considered then, that we are talking about a title made exclusively for XBox. As for the sound aspect, the game features well-made English speech with average sound effects, but certainly nothing exceptional. Conclusions In conclusion, New Legends turned out to be a disappointing game overall, a pity because the basic idea was very promising (setting, fighting style and levels), but a decidedly bad technical realization did nothing but undermine the overall quality of the game. title. To aggravate all this is also the absence of any multiplayer mode that could somehow raise the general opinion of the game. Personally, I think New Legends is a decent arcade capable of keeping the player busy for a relatively short period of time, but with a poor quality technical implementation, so I recommend trying the relative demo or, otherwise, renting it before jumping into a purchase that could reveal unpleasant surprises. Pros: Intuitive control system Pure action Cons: Bad technical realization No multiplayer option No localization Simple and underdeveloped plot Materials: Trailer Preview Screenshots & Wallpaper New Legends The New Legends project developed and distributed by the THQ label, was one of the very first titles to be announced and released as an exclusive for the Microsoft home console. After arriving on the American market in conjunction with the launch of the XBox, New Legends is finally also available in Europe. Let's find out together the positive and negative sides of this title, which in many respects has proved controversial and disappointing.", "date": "2002-06-20", "grade": null}
