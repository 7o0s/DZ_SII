While waiting for the Broken Sword saga to become a trilogy with the third episode scheduled for Playstation 2 and PC (Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragons), we can take a leap into the past with this faithful conversion (technical limits permitting, of course) of the progenitor of the saga Revolution Software's point and click on the eclectic Game Boy Advance that will once again amaze us. Pleasure trip? George Stobbart is an American on vacation in Paris: monuments, beautiful women, there aren't many places where an American, after a busy year of work, can combine business with pleasure during a vacation. Pleasure trip? Unfortunately for our virtual alter ego from California, the unexpected will not be long in coming: while you are on a table ready to drink something cool, you notice a man with a suitcase, his expression at least strange, then an annoying clown with a accordion, before being involved in a terrible explosion, caused by the accordion, deposited shortly before by the clown which will cause the death of the old man with the suitcase (named Plantard). Why did all this happen? Who was the killer clown? What was the motive? What did the old gentleman do wrong to die? These must be the questions that our George asked himself, before starting his hunt for the assassin who almost sent himself to the other world. So get ready for a long journey through the most disparate European nations. Point and..click!! As you may know, a point and click adventure to be played properly needs a mouse, essential for clicking on objects, people and so on, giving life to pre-established actions. Not being able to use the mouse, as on PC or Psone and not being able to count on a controller equipped with many keys, Bam Entertainment had to review the gameplay, simplifying its interface and difficulty in general. Now you will move George with the joypad, when you get close to some interactable element or npg with which to talk or location to visit, a special icon will appear which will allow you to perform the corresponding action; as regards the dialogues, these are also managed with very intuitive icons, so if you have 2 or 3 questions to ask a non-player character, just select the corresponding icon to start the desired conversation (example: if you want to ask a clown about policeman, just select the face of the clown, easy man!!). Point and..click!! The game, previously very difficult in some sections, is now fairly simpler and even those who don't know Broken Sword will have plenty of it for about twenty hours, in which the exciting story will unfold in absolutely unexpected directions and which, obviously, we omit here so as not to take away the taste of surprise from our budding adventurers. Graphics Broken Sword amazed at the time, in addition to the beautiful storyline and the perfect user friendly interface, for the wonderful graphics that gave the impression of being in front of a wonderful cartoon. Obviously transporting full motion video sequences in a small cartridge is not humanly possible, so Bam Entertainment, the software house that converted the Revolution Software masterpiece, had to replace them with static images taken from the CD-ROM versions. Graphics Incredibly, the quality of these screens (we repeat, fixed there) is almost comparable to those on compact discs, as well as the backdrops, decidedly well defined, complete with birds taking off, people working, cars squeezing and so on. saying. The aspect of the sprites is slightly more blocky, the lesser definition of which is decidedly visible the closer they get towards the player. The hundreds of different animations have obviously been lost, but despite this the fluidity is excellent and the intercalation frames between a movement and the other do not make the various actions jerky (moving, picking up, pulling manhole covers, climbing, etc). Overall, taking into account the hardware hosting thisconversion, thumbs up for the graphic design, of a good standard. Sound Having lost the many digitized phrases (dubbed in a more than good Italian, with a spot-on French accent), the focus on the sound side therefore shifts to music and sound effects. The first ones (by Barrington Pherloung) are definitely spot on and atmospheric, although they don't always peep out; the same goes for the sound effects, although of a slightly lower quality than the music tracks. Conclusions Broken Sword could not, in our opinion, be converted much better than Bam Entertainment has done: graphically commendable (although the sprites denounce a definition not comparable to that of the seventy locations proposed therein), acoustically passable, very entertaining and fairly long-lived, although quite simpler than the PC and Psone versions. It is interesting to note that for once there is also the localization in our language, fortunately for us with the same adaptation of the CD-ROM versions, therefore very good. A must for lovers of the point and click genre who want to spend hours on the train (and soon also at sea) racking their brains, solving a mystery that has made the history of the videogame genre to which it belongs, everyone else at least gives it one look, you might find yourself addicted! Pros: Backgrounds and still images of excellent quality extremely playable and immersive Cons: Sprites of lower definition than the backgrounds Sound almost non-existent Once finished, you will hardly play it again George Stobbart in your pocket It was the year 1996 when a point and click adventure of absolute value made its debut on PC and Psone; Broken Sword: The Secret Of The Templars, programmed by Revolution Software, was equipped with very cartoonish graphics, a rich sample of perfectly timed dialogues, an unforgettable soundtrack in some ways, a lot of full motion video sequences that gave the impression to watch a cartoon and, above all, an intriguing and never boring story that ensnares the player's alter ego (such as George Stobbart) up to the resolution of an adventure that is to say the least intricate.", "date": "2002-04-25", "grade": null}
