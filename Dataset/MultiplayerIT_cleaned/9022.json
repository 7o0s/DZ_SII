We are referring to our review of Outer Wilds which, arriving with guilty delay, gives us the opportunity to talk about it as we could not have done before today. The Mobius Digital game debuted in 2019, but, despite the three years behind it, Outer Wilds it remains an extremely important work, one of those fundamental experiences for understanding what a video game can be when it is free from certain creative cages. One of the first to replace the old game over with more modern time loops, Outer Wilds offers bold gameplay choices and a type of progression perhaps never seen before, at least until Deathloop arrived. Space loop Outer Wilds: the inside of our spaceship We don't know if Arkane took its inspiration from Outer Wilds, nor does this possible link detract from its extraordinary game. We actually want to prove the exact opposite, that whoever ~designs~ his project around loops gains access to new tools that enable new types of gameplay, new types of challenges, and new forms of hypertext storytelling. Benefits that we can find in Outer Wilds, in Deathloop and probably in all the other titles that will make the same choice. The existence of both games also demonstrates that loops can be adopted on a large scale, that they have no problem adapting to every genre and every setting. Outer Wilds loops last twenty-two minutes, or until the protagonist dies. The game begins twenty-two minutes before the solar system we inhabit collapses upon itself, wiping out spacetime in a total and irreversible reset. Our home, our village, our friends are all on a small wooded planet well positioned in space and from there, on that very day, as new recruits of the ramshackle Outer Wilds space program, we will take off to the stars in a spaceship brand new, at least by local standards. As soon as we leave the planet's atmosphere, we witness a small and unexpected miracle that until then the player can only have guessed: the system in which we find ourselves and from which we cannot escape is in constant motion, and each planet affects the another in an extraordinary sidereal symphony which, however, will soon reach the end of its existence. Great little space Outer Wilds: No one knows what's really happening among the stars In Outer Wilds you can land on any planet, get off and back on the spaceship at any time. The progression is linked to the clues that we will find during each of our expeditions, which will remain stored in the on-board computer even after the loop has ended. The different clues will slowly form a web of events that at the end of the game will allow us to save the universe, or at least try to, within a single time loop. Amazon offer Outer Wilds - Xbox One - Download Code 24.99 See Offer In this interlocking of cause and effect, what we do on a planet could radically change the situation from above the sun, open up new areas and new mysteries on a distant moon, even if distances are relative in the Outer Wilds system. Space is small here, the planets don't have realistic proportions, but in its fantastic reconstruction Outer Wilds is absolutely believable. In its corner of the universe, there is enough space for captivating legends, handed down stories and heroes to chase among the stars. Interstellar moments Outer Wilds: clues, links, solved puzzles... you'll find everything on the ship's on-board computer In Outer Wilds, for the first time, you will find yourself faced with natural events so extreme as to leave you amazed, if not even frightened by their colossal scope. With due stylistic, technical, and budget differences, Outer Wilds is the only space game out there that offers multiple Interstellar moments. What you won't find in Outer Wilds are the fights, but it would be a mistake to think that without weapons and shootings there is no challenge, there are no dangers. Exploration is always precarious in this game, even driving the spaceship is not an easy exercise and not even experience can reduce the risk factor of each expedition to zero. Puzzles, exploration, mishaps: there's so much to keep up with, but very little we can tell you about without spoiling the surprise. Outer Wilds: Despite the modest budget, the artists at Mobius Digital have managed to create extraordinary sets Even without millions of planets, or walkable hectares, the adventure proposed by Mobius Digital can last more than twenty hours and all of gameplay, gameplayed, active exploration. His scale doesn't allow for large downtimes, and even closing a loop tragically never steals too much time. Unbearable and at the same time beautiful that a project like this should come up with a group of very young people, including students and former students, instead of the giant on duty. Who knows how many professionals in the sector have equally strong ideas but none of them are allowed to create something even remotely similar to Outer Wilds, a game that with its very existence puts in the sedan an increasingly standardized way of making video games, and less and less fun both for those who develop these products and for those who play them. Made in Mobius Outer Wilds: The campfire theme runs throughout this game Outer Wilds is an adventure that is not forgotten, that leaves its mark even if you immediately notice that behind it is not Elon Musk's wallet but the much more contained one of the Japanese Masi Oka, already an actor nominated for a Golden Globe thanks to series like Heroes, special effects expert on behalf of Industrial Light & Magic and since 2013 also known for being the founder of Mobius Digital, and who on this occasion was helped by the ever perspicacious Annapurna Interactive who played the role of publisher. Outer Wilds is available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC, the latter being the platform where it runs best even if in all cases the optimization leaves something to be desired. On consoles, the charm of Outer Wilds remains unchanged even if the image is less vibrant, and the frame rate somewhat unstable. The same idea undoubtedly deserves a better realization.", "date": "2022-01-28", "grade": "8.8"}
