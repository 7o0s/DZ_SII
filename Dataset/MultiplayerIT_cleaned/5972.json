However, Danganronpa has allowed an opening operation towards our territories, which proved to be positive despite the numbers being very distant from the more well-known products. The first two chapters of the series were able to overcome the wall of two hundred thousand units sold, although these are data that consider both the copies of the American market and those placed in Europe cumulatively. Figures that continue to persuade the publisher NIS America to invest in the franchise and to guarantee at least the localization in English. In the meantime, the developers of Spike Chunsoft have decided to propose a change of clothes, putting on the market Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls, a spin-off that chronologically is placed between the first and second episode and offers, for the first time, action-style mechanics with obvious shooter drifts. As explained by the game director Kazutaka Kodaka, the turnaround was also suggested by the presence of a new story that has different points of reference: while in the first two Danganronpa we witnessed the vicissitudes of a handful of teenagers, in the terrifying condition of having to kill each other in order to save themselves, in Another Episode the focus has instead recalibrated on the desperate escape of two girls from a city located on an island. The best way to tell these events would have involved precisely the move towards the action genre, as a guarantee of greater dynamism that would have gone well with the type of adventure experienced by the two protagonists. And it is also for these reasons that the title can be experienced without particular problems even by those who, until now, have not yet had the opportunity to approach the series. Danganronpa Another Episode goes off the rails and shifts the focus to action Forbidden to grow up in Towa City The protagonist of Another Episode is Komaru Naegi, a young high school student who has been imprisoned in an apartment in Towa City for a year and a half, without having the slightest idea of who is keeping her segregated and for what reasons. The surname of the girl will not sound new to fans of the series, it is in fact the younger sister of Makoto Naegi, protagonist of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. The only contact with the outside takes place at mealtimes, but even in those few moments from the armored door no one utters a word. Komaru alternates moments of lively resignation with other moments in which the desire to return to freedom becomes very pressing, and it is while he is sharing his thoughts with the player that something unexpected happens. Someone is trying to force the front door, but instead of a hypothetical savior at the door, a menacing Monokuma materializes - an enemy who will be familiar to those who are not familiar with the series - intending to kill her. Not even the time to rush down the corridor and the unfortunate woman will come across Byanuya Togami, agent of the Future Foundation agency, who has received information about a prisoner to be released in the structure. Thanks to the help of intelligence it turns out that a crowd of self-defined Warriors of Hope kids have decided to eliminate any adult and want to create an ideal world run by teenagers. The cheerful Japanese Peter Pans claim to have saved the world from demons and want to establish a paradise made up only of children, by children and for children. After all, the island exists, only Captain Hook and the trusty Sponge would be missing, were it not that the escape plans begin to become urgent right away. Thus will begin a succession of singular events, sometimes nice and other times absurd, which Komaru will share in close contact with Toko Fukawa, the second protagonist of the game and a key figure both for the balance of the plot and for the functionality of the gameplay. Playstation 4 trophies Danganronpa Another Episode offers 38 Trophies, many of which are secret and to be revealed step by step with the continuation of the story. The majority are related to the completion of the plot, but there are also more demanding tasks, such as obtaining a minimum rating of B in each chapter or collecting all the documents. Wait do you shoot from the megaphone? Since this is a title devoted to action, some interesting shooter mechanics have been introduced, based on the use of a single weapon which is defined as the Hacking Gun with electromagnetic waves. The improbable megaphone-shaped pistol offers particularly wide-ranging functions that can be upgraded over time and these abilities are delegated to the so-called Truth Bullets, unconventional projectileswith variable uses. For example the Break shots, which allow you to knock out enemies through a powerful energy beam, or the Move shot, useful for activating some devices by bypassing the security systems, while Dance allows you to distract your opponents and force them to dance like desperate before sending them to sleep forever. In many cases it is also possible to chain attacks, using multiple Truth Bullets in sequence, although most of these forms of incursion must be unlocked during the completion of the adventure. We didn't mind the general idea, but we found a certain cumbersomeness in the pointing system entrusted to the PlayStation Vita backbones. In these cases, in fact, Komaru's movements remain rather limited, resembling in some ways the typical pointing systems of old-fashioned survival horror, with all the complications of the case, especially when you have to face boss fights. A second form of interaction is then offered by Toko Fukawa, or rather by her nemesis Genocide Jack. In fact, the girl suffers from a bizarre split personality, capable of transforming her and making her a lethal hand-to-hand combatant. By pressing the triangle button these sequences can therefore be activated, during which Toko arms herself with scissors and launches very powerful attacks without the danger of being damaged in any way by the opponents, regardless of the category of Monokuma to be eliminated or the presence of a boss. How to counter the opportunity to invoke it is subject to a limited period of time, indicated by a special bar located at the top of the screen. From the game menu it is then possible to have access to a large list of skills, each of which allows you to obtain a boost, such as for example the activation of the function for automatic targeting of enemies, combined with the presence of skill points that can be increased every time Komaru levels up. The so-called Despair Time is also interesting, which is a quick time event that precedes the game over and, if completed correctly, involves Toko's intervention with a stun gun. By doing so, you can easily get back on track, without being forced to reload the last useful save. The level design only partially convinced us, the maps are in fact very linear, not branched at all and with some backtracking phases that weigh down the flow of experience. The presence of special arcade cabinets from which it is possible to set a path to the next room and thus avoid being identified by the Monokuma is a decidedly unsuccessful attempt to introduce a sketch of stealth mechanics, while the few puzzles that have been distributed in some segments of the maps proved too simple to solve. On the contrary, the decision to use a dual function for camera management seemed like a good move. At the beginning of the game it is in fact possible to decide to set the automatic shot that follows the movements of the character, or to lean towards the manual camera, which allows you to control the shots at will through the right analog stick. Moreover, this second criterion seemed to us to marry better with the general mechanics, providing the player with better freedom. Exactly as for the predecessors, also in this case the game is entirely in English, both as regards the speech and for the subtitles of the dialogues and menus. This factor could still represent an obstacle for many, even if it must be said that a particularly in-depth knowledge of the language is not necessary to follow the story smoothly; even more so in consideration of the fact that the dialogue screens can be skipped manually and allow you to calmly read what the various characters are saying.", "date": "2015-10-15", "grade": "7.0"}
