Multiplayer.it video articles are our way of inaugurating a new season of Multiplayer.it editorial production, dedicated to Premium Gold subscribers, which will complement and enrich (not replace) the classic one, made up of text and static images. Now the family of video articles has achieved its recognized status and the new milestone is before your eyes: live video from the game and the editor's voice (and face) commenting on the moving images. From today on we will try to increasingly guarantee this new form of communication that we believe is more modern, suitable for the medium in which we move and now within everyone's reach thanks to the enormous diffusion that ADSL has had in the last twelve months. Here is the list of video articles published so far: Far Cry video review (free) Captain's video (Live from Los Angeles) #1 (free) Xbox, Allegro andante (Live from Los Angeles) #2 (free) It's time for the DS ( Live from LA) #3 (Free) Me Gabe & Doug (Live from LA) #4 (Free) Last Stop (Live from LA) #5 (Free) Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault Video Preview (Premium Gold Exclusive ) And now the video review of Driv3r for PS2 and Xbox [VIDEO=320.300.c]https://www.multiplayer.it/streaming/driv3r_streaming.wmv[/VIDEO] The high resolution version (76mb) is also available at this address.
