Talking about ex-boyfriends with your girlfriend, for example, could be counterproductive, as beautifully exemplified in the movie ~Clerks~. The problem is that Scott Pilgrim, a young unemployed Canadian with fire in his veins, just can't help but know who the seven exes of the girl he fell madly in love with, Ramona Flowers. The reason is obvious: they are all very, very dangerous people and they have no intention of leaving them alone. The first name on the list is Matthew Patel, an expert in dark magic, even capable of summoning flying demons; the second is Lucas Lee, a famous skateboarder who also uses the board to violently beat up those who don't like him; the third is called Todd Ingram, a guitarist who controls electricity and can electrocute his enemies; the fourth (yes, it's her) ex-girlfriend is Roxy Richter, a ninja particularly skilled with a sword; positions five and six are occupied by the twins Kyle and Ken Katayanagi, who can put themselves in command of a giant robot if necessary; the seventh and final ex-boyfriend is Gideon Graves, endowed with powers as fearsome as they are mysterious. In the role of Scott, his friends Stills and Kim or Ramona herself, we will therefore have to face seven stages (each divided into two zones) overloaded with opponents and characterized by a very demanding degree of challenge even at the lowest difficulty level. The game mechanics are typical of scrolling fighting games, and in fact Scott Pilgrim vs. The World does not in any way hide its obvious references to classics such as Double Dragon, Final Fight and Streets of Rage, but also to Super Mario Land, Street Fighter II, Golden Ax and, in general, to some of the most representative video games released in the late 80s and early 90s. Hit hard! However, it is not the game structure of the new Ubisoft product that immediately gets noticed, but its peculiar technical realization. Every single aspect of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, in fact, takes up the colorful and lively atmospheres of videogaming twenty years ago: from the two-dimensional graphics made up of characters drawn and animated in the ~old way~, with scenarios with a limited degree of interaction and pixels as big as a house; to the sound, enriched by terribly catchy tunes that take up the melodies of the Ocean theme songs reproduced during the loading of the Commodore 64 cassettes. We must therefore not be surprised by the features of the game (taken from a successful comic book miniseries, which this year also led to the making of a film) nor by its obvious limitations: we are dealing with a ~hard and pure~ homage , certainly passionate about a way of making video games that, unfortunately or fortunately, no longer exists. From this point of view, the lack of checkpoints within the scenarios and the possibility of continuing the game only from the beginning of the level should be seen: a somewhat frustrating solution, but which in the end represents one of the few ways that the developers had in order not to make the experience short and insignificant as happens in arcades where it is possible to continue indefinitely and from the exact point where the game over occurred. Scott Pilgrim's destiny isn't to defeat Ramona's seven ex-boyfriends and the hundreds of henchmen in their defense in a matter of minutes, in short. The snowy Toronto (represented by a map that recalls that of Super Mario Land) will be the witness to our (many!) attempts to clean up the stages, attempts that above all initially will fail because of us but just as often because of the enemies, who have often quick shots that allow them to ~hook~ us and hit us without us being able to do anything to avoid it. The control system of our character provides for a fast blow, a slow one, the jump and the parry, but the latter proves to be useless in the vast majority of situations, because it is precisely not possible to resort to it when it would be most needed (the ~bad guys~, however , they know how to use it all too well!). Furthermore, the amount of damage that the opponents can cause us in some situations is really exaggerated and almost requires us not to suffer any blows, as if the perfect match was always around the corner. Playstation 3 trophies Scott Pilgrim vs. The World contains twelve trophies. Bronze can be earned by defeating end-of-level bosses, eating all available food types, and purchasing all items. The four silver trophies are more difficult, as they involve eliminating a thousand enemies but also passing a stage without being hit and completing thegame on the highest level of difficulty. Finally, the only gold trophy is obtained simply by finishing the game with Scott. Level up! Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a splendid homage to the 90s (and 80s, albeit to a lesser extent), there's no doubt about that; and it is a difficult game, which must be approached in a certain way and with a lot of patience before things start to mesh. Let's take the first level, for example: the view is on the road, as per tradition for scrolling fighting games, while the various buildings in front of which Scott is passing appear at the top of the screen. It is not always a mere seabed, however: some of them are accessible, these are shops from which it is possible to buy (spending the money left on the ground by each defeated opponent) food to recover life points, discs capable of increasing our experience points, special preparations able to give us an extra life or to enhance our attacks, such as for example the ~bionic arms~. The latter, together with other attacks, prove to be a fundamental element for surviving the attacks of increasingly stronger and more numerous enemies, and it is good practice to continue enhancing Scott's various characteristics in order to be able to complete the levels, perhaps facing them several times in order to accumulate more money to spend, especially if we face it alone. Although the characters are ~levelable~ as in RPGs and each new level corresponds to new and powerful attack maneuvers, this is not enough to even the accounts with the forces in the field, which defining overwhelming at a certain point is an understatement, and therefore from good old fighting game the Ubisoft title must be tackled with a minimum of strategy and repeating the various stages several times. In theory, playing with friends (up to four at the same time) should make things much easier, but unfortunately we have to point out the lack of online multiplayer, which would certainly have increased the fun and longevity of the game, which in any case relies on some characters and moves unlockable after accumulating a certain amount of money rather than completing the title with all the characters. Title which, we repeat, in its quotations is sometimes truly brilliant (even in the stage with the twins the first boss fight of the unforgettable Mazin Saga for Mega Drive resumes!) and boasts a gameplay which, despite all its limits and edges, is reveals immediate, then also profound and capable of creating addiction. Not to mention the music, which enters your head and never wants to leave it again...", "date": "2010-08-16", "grade": "8.2"}
