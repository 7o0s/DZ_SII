The DS is undoubtedly increasingly conquering these new generation of gamers and consequently the market follows this trend by increasing, and not just, the offer. So here's a rhythm game explicitly dedicated to girls! Dancing, dancing and shopping! What distinguishes a rosy game from a game for boys? First of all it takes, at least according to today's clichs, a good dose of cuteness, sweetness, salaams and then dresses, accessories, kittens, rivals as sweet as honey, teachers who trust you and a pastel-colored city to explore and discover. It is precisely in all of this that a protagonist moves who enters the world of dance through the ~Angela~ club led by the legendary ~Anna~ who immediately sets off on a journey. All that remains is to manage the club in the best possible way and to do this you must learn to dance in the various styles of the Rainbow city. In fact, each neighborhood represents various musical cultures such as parapara - nothing but our Dance -, rock, hip hop, but also nice digressions such as music inspired by video games or Japanese culture. Obviously the girls who frequent these neighborhoods are representatives of their respective cultures and more or less willingly teach their dance secrets. In addition to the various clubs, or gangs, or hangouts - if you prefer - where to dance, in every area of the city there is also a shop, where you can buy and sell themed clothes and accessories, a machine that distributes capsules containing particular objects and a ~photographic set~ where you can take pictures. These photos of our avatar with his fashionable clothes can then be exchanged via wi-fi with friends. Take pictures and try on a bunch of clothes! The actual game therefore consists in going to visit the bizarre girls of the various districts, watch very nice animated dialogues, and start dancing. Finally! To dance you are catapulted into the action of a more than good rhythm game. While not as complex or extravagant as many of his little brothers, he still manages to be dignified and fun. By placing the DS in a vertical position we find ourselves with the screen on the left occupied by our heroine  obviously dressed up as best we could  and one of her rivals. On the opposite screen, however, we find a kind of musical score where the ~moves~ to be carried out and three distinct sections appear. Each of these sections is assigned a color. In rhythm, in each of them, either a ~button~ of the respective color can appear, simply to be touched in time, or an arrow, always coloured, to be rubbed right or left according to the request. More rare is the appearance of double arrows, which force you to rub the nib in both directions repeatedly, or a large arrow up or down that fills all three quadrants. The combination of swipes touches etc. together with the continuous change between the three parts of the screen it is decidedly pleasant, even if there are no more varied solutions such as energy bars to fill, drawings to follow or other, present in the direct and more recent competitors. The ability to perform moves at will when the music ~stops~ is certainly not enough to make the action more varied... As already indicated, there is an opponent for each competition. To beat it you obviously need to dance well, or it would be better to say play since for each of our actions the departure of a small piece of melody corresponds, and to do this you need to go in perfect tempo. A touch can be evaluated as ~missed~, ~good~, ~kira~ or ~Rainbow~ depending on the timing with which it was performed. Based on our performance we will be evaluated with the classic system of letters from F to A. The nice thing is that our rival is not a machine and therefore can make mistakes or perform an unusual skill test. This can lead to winning a game with a very bad grade or losing it with a very good one! This little trick, even if it leaves you a little displaced at the beginning, instead gives a little more pepper to an otherwise medium difficulty game. And why not that purse in the shape of a cat??? And here comes the point of quibbling about style and technique. Starting from the first: deliciously Japanese! Big eyes, cartoons, exaggerated animations, pastel shades, everything recalls the land of the rising sun including clothes and accessories how can we not mention the plush cat-shaped handbags?!-. Moving on to the second: pleasantly well made and cared for. The animations and graphics are really well cared for, with excellent and huge cell shading characters who move equally well in the various skits both duringthe dialogues both during the dance sections. Perhaps a little more variety during the dance would have helped, but one certainly cannot criticize this aspect too much, especially in light of the countless clothes, accessories, haircuts etc. which were perfectly made. The characterization of the characters, the color combinations and in general everything you can lay your eyes on is also beautiful. The music somewhat marks the technical limits of the DS, from which much more cannot be asked. They are all very catchy, on the average complex and have the great advantage of not being copies or clumsy remakes of more famous pieces  at least for the ears of us Italians. The satisfaction, or the disappointment, of feeling again in the replays while sequences are looped together with perfect rhythm and tempo, or not, is decidedly satisfying, or frustrating! They all represent a good challenge and are almost always very consistent with what we are asked to do on the screen even if there are some, rare, moments in which this does not happen. Finally, the fastest and most complex ones make that nib literally fly across the screen, also requiring discrete ~virtuosity~, without, fortunately, falling into the impossible. Comment Kira Kira pop princess was definitely a surprise. You don't expect such a well-maintained and well-crafted title when you already know in advance that it is intended for a non-hardcore audience. Instead you are pleasantly surprised by the graphics, music and nice stories. These, while stereotyped and suitable for an audience of teenagers or a little less, are still nice and well made. The musical game itself does not shine for complexity or variety, but it is pleasant to play and is well calibrated and very fun. In short, it is perfect for the audience to which it is addressed, but still very pleasant for everyone else too. The final judgment can therefore only be positive. Excellent for its target audience, but, leaving aside the female excesses, undoubtedly interesting for others as well. Pros More than 35 different music Immediate and entertaining Very well done Cons Perhaps too simplistic -but not simple- Oriented only to female audience", "date": "2008-04-29", "grade": null}
