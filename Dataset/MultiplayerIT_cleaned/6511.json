{"name": "Lost in Play", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-in-play-recensione.html", "text": "Growing up you unlearn the art of playing and the magic of certain childhood pastimes is inexorably lost, without even realizing it. This creative process has been recovered and used as a starting point for a great adventure by Happy Juice Games, which has managed to represent all the evocative power of children's games on the screen, staging an incredible journey of a brother and a sister . Let's find out in this review of Lost in Play. Starting from the living room of the house, Toto and Gal find themselves immersed in a hallucinatory adventure, which forces them to collaborate and face numerous challenges to try to find their way home, leading them to cross wonderful settings and meet somewhat bizarre creatures and characters. It is clearly a representation driven to paroxysm, but the dynamics and atmospheres that emerge from this strange adventure are not that far from the incredible stories that were built in the afternoons spent together with one's brothers, inventing epic stories about improbable challenges. This sense of magic is perfectly rendered in Lost in Play and is the main characterizing element of the whole game, supported by a masterful graphic style reminiscent of cartoons such as Gravity Falls and Adventure Time, sharing with them the taste for the strange and the humor as a founding basis in the representation of the world. Underneath all this wonder there is also a point and click graphic adventure with rather traditional elements, less complex than many others but still able to offer interesting moments of challenge, which underpin a very pleasant experience. A story without words Lost in Play, it all starts from the bedroom of two brothers It is not easy to understand precisely what happens in Lost in Play, but the title already provides a rather accurate description of the situation in which Toto and Gal find themselves: playing from the living room to the garden outside the house, the two children with vivid imaginations suddenly find themselves projected into a strange world, which seems to follow some rules of the typical games with which they spend their afternoons, but which at the same time confronts them with epic and exciting challenges, going in search of treasures and finally the way back home. With the protagonists catapulted from one situation to another, the settings change abruptly, going from fantasy to fairy tale, from pseudo horror to post apocalyptic, all filtered through the particular humorous vision of the authors, who have managed perfectly to stage a real interactive cartoon. The narration does not use words, yet it is perfectly understandable: the characters and creatures communicate through strange verses and various noises, in a completely unknown language, but the situations are easy to read, albeit crazy, and the sequence of events represents a sort of picaresque tale in which Toto and Gal go from having to challenge monsters in dark forests to surviving a seafaring adventure complete with a Pinocchio-style whale, to escaping a wasteland building a mechanical dragon to penetrating a disturbing fairy-tale castle evading the guards, just to name a few. All this is shown with an irreverent humor that focuses on absurd creatures and caricatured characters, as well as totally out of line situations, but everything remains suspended between this at times demented comedy and the dreamlike and dreamy climate of children's stories, in a truly remarkable. Riddles and puzzles Lost in Play features a remarkable variety of scenarios Like any self-respecting graphic adventure, Lost in Play consists of a succession of explorable areas, each containing various puzzles to be solved in order to continue, which generally point to a main objective to be achieved in order to move on to the next area. As often happens in more modern titles of this genre, the console control system allows you to move the character directly, highlighting interactive objects and elements of the scenario as you get close to their range. The interface is very simplified, allowing only a pre-established action to interact with NPCs and background objects, with which it is also possible to make simple combinations with inventory items. The puzzles present a good progression in terms of difficulty, starting from elementary situations to arrive at more complex puzzles in the more advanced and large areas, although particularly complex and layered puzzles on various stages are almost never found: usually each puzzle is rather ~ self-contained~, leading to the conquest of an object that unlocksca a particular situation and allowing you to continue towards other puzzles. In general, the challenge level is never too high and, in any case, an excellent aid system can help you extricate yourself in moments of greater difficulty. On the other hand, the choice not to contain any type of standard verbal communication makes the puzzles necessarily simple to understand, limiting them to an easily understandable logical plan: this does not necessarily mean that the solution must be equally trivial, but obviously a sort of explicit and complex narrative fabric that links objects, NPCs and game situations together. Lost in Play is filled with downright bizarre creatures On the contrary, Lost in Play does a great job of making the objectives and functioning of the puzzles immediately clear, often presenting them as separate moments of the game but still well immersed in the strange world staged. The most demanding challenges are probably linked to real logic mini-games that are often proposed throughout the story: in these cases you find yourself having to take part in games within the game that break up the action and introduce new and different. It may seem like a bit of an easy way out in terms of puzzle design, given that their complete isolation from the context allows you to propose different types of puzzles that can raise the level of challenge regardless of their links with the levels, but are still very engaging and well researched. A cartoon fairy tale Lost in Play often puts us in front of real mini-games The most evident feature of Lost in Play is clearly the graphic style adopted, which becomes an identity element of great strength for this Happy Juice Games production. The character design, the stroke with which the scenarios are drawn, the animations, the colors and the audio accompaniment contribute to a truly first-rate aesthetic, deriving from a truly high-profile artistic direction, despite the small size of the team . The feeling is that of actually being inside an interactive cartoon, but which has been designed on the basis of a real game, in which all the aesthetic elements are not a mere outfit but are part of the overall narration and of the construction of the world. Playing Lost in Play we immerse ourselves in a wonderful alternative reality that is both welcoming and surprising, of which we can't wait to gradually discover the new levels. The interface also falls within the general cartoony style, trying to remain as hidden and unobtrusive as possible, thus contributing to the intuitiveness that characterizes the gaming experience. In fact, after the initial introductory sequence, it is almost difficult to understand when the real adventure begins, given that the passage between narrative and interactive phases is completely fluid and without cuts, thanks to the splendid animations, but also to the great work done on the interface front, which integrates commands and elements purely related to gameplay and puzzle solving into an organic whole with the scene represented on the screen. In light of all this, Lost in Play is a true audiovisual show capable of truly captivating everyone.", "date": "2022-08-16", "grade": "8.0"}
