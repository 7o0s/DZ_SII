{"name": "Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tao-feng-fist-of-the-lotus-3.html", "text": "The damage inflicted on the opponent and on you will remain visible (scratches, bruises, blood) and will remain until the end of each match. Particularly interesting is the part of the sound that simulates the noise of bones crunching when you perform a grip that breaks an arm or a leg, it will seem to feel bad seriously, it is so believable. The only drawback of this novelty is that you will use the broken arm or leg anyway, they will only produce less damage and limit some moves, unfortunately the simulation component is missing (but perhaps it would have been too realistic for a video game ..) which would directly require the arm dangling or the leg completely blocked. Character models and animations have been treated in an exemplary manner; the animations are very convincing, especially those of the girls who perform a ballet like true striptease professionals before fighting; convincing but not perfect, in particular during the execution of some ~cinematic~ moves (such as punching and kicking at the speed of light!) all the wrestlers seem to suffer from artificial and unnatural movements. The character design of the male characters is less cared for, ranging from the already seen to the banal (just look at the inevitable Dragonball Roshi old master style). The control system, intuitive, precise and easy to use, has a slight lack of response when you perform moves that require the use of the scenario. Yes, because in TaoFeng every light pole, every box, every wall can be used as a support to execute combos capable of knocking down the opponent as violently as possible. Apart from grabbing onto a pole, which simply requires pressing the right trigger of the pad, pushing yourself against a wall to perform a flying kick, for example, is particularly difficult. Graphically speaking. Together with the now very famous benchmark for fighting games on Xbox, Dead Or Alive 3, Tao Feng graphically looks good, and can be compared with the Tecmo title, even if it does not equal it. The effects of light, of transparency, the reflections on the field and on the wrestlers, the bump mapping, the animated scenarios and which change under the blows of the fighters, everything that could be inserted in terms of special effects Studio Gigante has inserted it, even if some of these details seem like last minute modifications. Small flaws are not lacking: the camera occasionally makes a sudden change of shot when you move too far back or towards a wall on the battlefield; or there are inconsistencies when the floor is destroyed, sometimes if the blow is minimal the floor is destroyed as if it had received a weight of 200 kg, other times it does not break at all, and sometimes there is minimal slowdown in the presence of some special blow, using the ~ CHI ~, probably due to an optimization of the code that is not ... perfect . As we know, innovations are to be rewarded only for having been implemented, and we are sure that, if there is a sequel, they will be improved in every respect. Seriously, there are few comments to make, given that from a technical point of view this title takes your breath away, obviously also considering the defects listed above, and sorry if it's not much! Comment But the ~ Fist of the Lotus, does it miss ? ~ Well, not really. Because all in all, this title is fun, and a lot, especially in versus mode in obvious multiplayer Recommended for lovers of violent, bloody and trashy fighting games, for people who don't stop to analyze if ~the kick I gave you let's see if it breaks that wall over there, a very ambitious project which, even if it doesn't hit all the premises, is still a good title that I advise you not to leave in the shop. Studio Gigante had courage, and this courage must be rewarded, without a shadow of a doubt. A classic title to try before you buy, and currently, in my opinion, the third ( after Dead or Alive 3 and Soul Calibur 2 ) ~best~ fighting game out there, on Xbox. Pros: Great graphics. Broken limbs and wounds! The female characters Cons: A bit short Some sporadic slowdowns We want the sequel, now ! Coincidentally.. The development of this game was entrusted to Studio Gigante, a group that includes the co-creators of Mortal Kombat. TaoFeng presents itself with some rather significant innovations, which will surely be taken as an example by other development teams. The characters are characteristic, some charismatic, some not, but this is not the case with the female ones, which boast an enviable charm, the women's costume park is alsoand, particularly sexy and leaves little room for the imagination, a factor very often appreciated by the male audience. The wrestlers are divided into two factions: the Lotus Flower, the classic good guys, and the Mantis, let's say, the not too good.. Each of them has a different martial arts style, and there is no shortage of unlikely characters (members of the Mantis are all sorts of demons with special powers.) The special moves are performed by loading a second energy bar marked with the name ~CHI~, and are performed with the simple press of a button; pity that they are not real ~fatalities~. Going back to the innovations, we note that during the fight, the scenario suffers damage every time the wrestler is thrown against something, even the floor will be affected by the blows suffered.", "date": "2003-06-02", "grade": null}
