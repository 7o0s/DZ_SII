{"name": "Top Spin 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-spin-3-recensione.html", "text": "Comment There is little doubt in assigning Top Spin 3 the prize for the simulation tennis game par excellence, in the light of a deep game mechanics and with a long and gradual learning curve, which leads to a level of realism never reached before from no other videogame transposition of this sport. Too bad for a side dish in terms of options, methods and tennis players present not quite up to par, which in part limits its use in singles and clashes with the practically perfect reproduction of a tennis match. The beauty of the 2K Sports title is in fact focused solely on the pure gameplay (not a small thing ...), deep, rich and which gives a multitude of positive sensations once mastered, exploding in multiplayer mode between friends and online, where it is there is an excellent system that invites you to upgrade your character and to compete against other people until you try to reach the top. Highly recommended, bearing in mind that the game is anything but simple and immediate. Pro Deep, varied, rewarding Excellent Online Perfect match animations and transposition Cons Not very stimulating career Few licenses for tennis players and courts Not very easy to master To welcome the player there is a respectable soundtrack, which includes among its ranks artists such as Jamiroquai, Calvin Harris and The Stone Roses, and which accompanies the choice of options, modes and in the creation of one's own player, even in this third chapter very complete and satisfying. In fact, the editor allows you to intervene on a plethora of information and characteristics, which reach a level of detail in some cases higher than the creation of an equivalent character for a role-playing game, also touching on aspects such as hair rather than eyebrow arching, type of tattoo or method of celebration, ending with the assignment of the name, surname and residence of the virtual player. Your alter ego is closely linked to the offline Career mode and the online World Tour, being interchangeable and developable in both ways. In the first case, you start with low-profile athletic characteristics and have to face a sequence of matches (initially consisting only of tie breaks) in order to first gain access to an amateur career, then junior and so on, until you become number one in the world in the general classification. Two types of points are obtained for each successfully completed match, with the former which can be used to enhance the various athletic parameters of the tennis player, such as forehand, backhand, power, speed and so on, and with the latter which rise to economic capital for one's clothing and look, which includes shoes (also of various famous brands), rackets, shorts, hair and more, available in the virtual shopping center set up for this purpose. And so that you have to face increasingly strong and famous opponents, ride fields in the suburbs until you reach the Grand Slam tournaments, in a modality which, however, from our point of view is not structured in such a way as to entice the player to its completion given that, apart from some interesting side statistics, it is reduced to an infinite sequence of games, with little diversification (no training or mini-games for example) and a level of difficulty not exactly calibrated to perfection, which starts from the very easy to reach sudden peaks of difficulty, which can only be bridged after several games or perhaps by enhancing one's player more than necessary and the normal flow of events. In this sense, the online mode called World Tour is clearly preferable, among other things the the only classified, which first of all allows you to put your creation into play online, playing a quick game or participating in the series of cyclical tournaments that 2K Sports makes available, re-proposing everything every 14 days, and with a complete set of statistics on your Current and previous World Tour rankings. In each session it is possible to take part only once in each tournament, with the lower profile ones having a duration equal to a match of three sets and three games, to move on to the ATP ones (two matches) and finish at the four of the Grand Slam , each consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals. The matchmaking inside the game will take care of assigning the matches, and for each victory you will still get the points to enhance your tennis player, a way that becomes by far the preferable way to grow and climb the online ranking, for a decidedly more fulfilling and which in our view it representsthe real longevity factor of the game, to the detriment of everything else. Playstation 3 vs Xbox 360 The two versions, from a technical point of view, do not present particular differences, while in favor of Xbox 360 there is the possibility of creating private rooms to invite friends directly into the game and voice chat. On the PlayStation 3, however, there is the exclusive presence of Nadal, number two in the world, probably due to a question related to player rights. The gameplay is instead identical and therefore the choice falls on the basis of the preferences of the pad, we finally played several online games on both consoles, encountering very rare lag problems. Simulation to the max! To the detriment of everything else because the part dedicated to playgrounds and tennis players is underdeveloped, with the latter being 40 in total, equally divided between men and women, and which in addition to some of the most famous current ones (Federer, Nadal and so on), see old glories such as Boris Becker, Bjorn Borg and Monica Seles, but their number appears inadequate in the face of the numerous famous tennis players who populate the ATP circuit. The courts, on the other hand, are good in number (about 40) but poor in official licenses, and so that of Rome at the Foro Italico becomes the tournament of Alexandria (even if the graphic representation is close to the real one) and that of Wimbledon takes on an unlikely name , factors that definitely clash with the realistic and simulative ambitions of the title, and which somewhat undermine the identification. Not to mention that, online, matches between real tennis players and in private rooms do not provide for any type of ranking or score, and therefore lead to little consideration. Despite all these shortcomings and not exactly positive premises, the heart of Top Spin 3 beats more than ever and sees its strength in the actual gameplay, reaching really high simulation peaks that are currently unmatched. Simulation to the max! In the production of 2K Sports, more than elsewhere, factors such as the positioning of the player with respect to the ball and the timing with which it is impacted are fundamental, not to mention the variety of shots that can be made. First of all, the shot must be charged in advance by pressing the appropriate button, and released at the right time to make a precise shot that goes over the net, whereas in other other games the button had to be pressed only at the moment of impact itself. In combination with the left and right back buttons, it is possible to respectively perform more precise shots (which cover the court better, making it more difficult for the opponent to recover) and more powerful ones, but which require perfect timing beyond the fact that the tennis player arrives on the ball well in advance, under penalty of an almost certain mistake. The type of shots is also very high, with the full one using the X key (A for the 360 pad), cut with the square (X), lifted with a circle (B) and with the triangle (Y) assigned to lobs and short balls close to the net. Although initially very difficult (especially if you come from a title like Virtua Tennis), the control system gradually gives enormous satisfaction and allows incredible realism and a variety of situations, with matches in which it really counts to think about the shot to be executed, where tennis players are not supermen who can recover any ball and where risking when the stroke allows it means bringing home the point or making a very bad mistake. In this sense, the animations of the tennis players are also made in a very convincing way, as are their features, complete with sweat on the body and shirts, and the collisions with the ball, supported by the use of the Havok physics engine. The construction of the fields and surfaces is also excellent, while that of the public is below average, which once again clashes with the rest and seems to be an element in its own right. Finally, the soundtrack, which we mentioned a few paragraphs above, is good, while during the match there is deliberately no music, but the atmosphere is left solely to the noise of the shots, the tennis players and the audience, which reacts with more or less convinced depending on the blow performed, to be exalted following an execution at the limit or a prestige hit such as shooting with the racket between the legs.", "date": "2008-07-02", "grade": null}
