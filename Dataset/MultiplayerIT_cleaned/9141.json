Its gameplay is reminiscent of World of Goo, but more serious, it has a Limbo-esque style, but more colorful and lively, and it's as challenging as Pixel Junk, but less complex. The general structure reminds veterans of that magnificent Super Metroid. To the younger ones it will instead remind something of Shadow Complex. I mean, what the hell is this ITSP? To begin with, it is a creation of the animation master Michel Gagn, already appreciated for Star Wars: Clone Wars and The Iron Giant, whose artistic peculiarity is to create wonderful 2D worlds colored, stylized, cartoonish but in a serious way, to Tim Burton and his Nightmare Before Christmas. The side-scrolling view lets the imagination roam in every cardinal direction: ITSP is packed with backtracking, albeit short and low-stress, and it's often necessary to go back and forth through its levels before finding the right passage. The plot, brilliantly told only through images and without a spoken or written word, tells of a mysterious dark force that is conquering the planets of our small galaxy. The adventure begins by entering aboard the spaceship that we have supplied and heading to the source of the dark force. In a short time we acquire all the peculiar characteristics of which the spacecraft is capable, and which are then the basis on which the entire gameplay of the game rests. Missiles, shield, and grappling hook are the most important ones. In ITSP you fly through levels combining exploration, boss fights and puzzle gaming. The first phase, the adventurous one, is one of the most intriguing because the worlds are rich in animals, plants, spaces to look at and creatures to admire, not to mention the various items to collect and discover which lengthen the average time to finish the game. The boss fights are decidedly intelligent and not only revolve around the concept of ~shoot and defend yourself~, but it is always necessary to perform some type of move or technique to win it. The last phase, that of puzzle solving, is also pleasant because it is non-invasive, never stressful or frustrating. These are always quite simple but not trivial, easy but not stupid puzzles, so that in any case the game action is always fluid and linearly dynamic. As mentioned above, the progress in the game is made of exploration and Metroid-like backtracking, it will even remind some of Castlevania, in any case it is a question of moving in intelligently constructed levels in the four cardinal directions, especially vertically. The ~worlds~, structured in levels, are vast but not dispersive. Through a convenient map, which can be activated with the back button, we always realize where we are and where we need to go, also displaying the various closed entrances and the labyrinths to follow to get to the goal. Xbox 360 goals Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, like every DLC game on Live Arcade, also offers players 200 points to unlock through 12 achievements. Half of the points at stake are obtained automatically by simply completing the main adventure. The others are sweaty through particular actions, such as exploring 100% of the map, finding every collectible artifact or having the spaceship upgraded to the maximum. Challenging but enjoyable. It's all about reflexes It is without a doubt that we can define Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet an excellent game from all points of view: a real surprise. Is it possible that it is an absolutely perfect title? Obviously there are no similar games, apart from three or four who live up there in the Olympus of video games. ITSP looks at them from the world of humans, and like any human game it has some flaws. First of all, the management of the various capabilities of the spaceship is quite cumbersome and indigestible: it is possible to assign each ability to a front key (A, B, X, Y), but apart from the fact that even doing so the ~switch~ is quite slow, there are many more items. The pop-up HUD is just as inconvenient. In any case, the game works and goes, only in the most chaotic situations it is very easy to mix up the keys and make a wrong selection. There is no way to view the health of our ship, there are no on-screen indicators, and this can often be a problem. The control system is the tried and tested one of every Geometry Wars-style game: double analog, the left to shoot in various directions, the right to move in the same number. Another point against this little gem is the duration:needless to say, once again proportionate to the cost of the download. The adventure is completed in 5/6 hours, something more to unlock all the objectives and look for every hidden item. There is, however, a decidedly nice multiplayer mode that manages to revive the fate of an otherwise compromised longevity. In essence, it is a question of having to guide our ~lantern~ through various increasingly dark levels, protecting it and at the same time keeping enemies and other players away. It's a mini-game for points, and therefore the challenge can be high within our friends list. ITSP has good accompanying music, in a very ~ambient~ style that underlines the wild part and the alienation of a distant world. The effects are beautiful: echoes inside the caves, clear and crystalline sounds outside, different sonorities and all particularly beautiful. Finally, we remind you that ITSP is part of the Summer Arcade 2011 game collection, and that if purchased together with the other four titles (From Dust, Bastion, Fruit Ninja Kinect and Toy Soldiers) it automatically triggers a promotion that gives all users the latest game of the Summer Arcade: Crimson Alliance.", "date": "2011-08-03", "grade": "8.0"}
