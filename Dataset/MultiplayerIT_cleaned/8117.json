Wii Fit to whom? As expected, it is necessary to have a Remote to undergo the training routines made available by Ubisoft, given that the GamePad is used here only to navigate the menus and perform some secondary function: the bulk of the work is done instead by holding a controller firmly in hand and repeating the exercises performed by the on-screen character. There is no support for either the Motion Plus or the dear old Balance Board, an aspect which, if on the one hand makes accessibility to the product much wider, on the other hand penalizes it in terms of precision in detecting movements, which actually leaves a bit to be desired. Beyond this, Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2013 proves to be a truly complete title of its kind, practically fulfilling all the needs of a user eager to burn a few calories in front of the TV. Once you have entered your basic parameters (age, sex, height, weight and so on), you are faced with a main menu in which four macro-sections stand out. We start with the Workouts, a set of 49 sets of exercises of variable duration and difficulty, divided according to the area of the body on which you intend to work: the offer is quite rich, and includes, among other things, useful warm-up routines , cool-down and activities aimed at children and the elderly, in short, a nice cauldron in which everyone can find something suitable for their goal, their physical condition and the time they have available. Then there are the Lessons, to all intents and purposes interactive courses to learn techniques in kickboxing, dance, yoga and other specialities, useful both for broadening one's knowledge frontiers and for giving a dutiful touch of variety to the more classic physical activity . Here too the numbers are respectable, with 53 different elements ranging from short five-minute sessions up to demanding full immersions that can be close to half an hour. Both in Workouts and in Lessons, the GamePad screen acts as an assistant, showing the countdown at the end of the current routine and the count of calories that are being burned, a value that obviously cannot be considered particularly reliable. Returning to the modalities offered by Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2013, it is very pleasing to note the presence of an excellent Program section, in which the desired goal can be set (weight loss, toning of a part of the body, increase in muscle mass, etc.) and let the software establish an activity calendar, customizable as regards the total duration and number of workouts per week. Finally, the Activity icon gives access to the two more strictly playful parts of the title: the first allows you to let off steam by dancing to the notes of four songs (Born This Way by Lady Gaga, Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO, She Wants to Move by N.E.R.D. and S.O.S by Rihanna), while the second is called Zen Flow and requires the user to assume a yoga position and use the GamePad's gyroscope to follow a light on the screen, focusing on balance and breathing. Already very rich and varied in terms of physical activity proper, Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2013 does not spare itself even in the field of secondary characteristics. To begin with, the title has a complex system of objectives, medals and small daily challenges, useful for keeping interest alive and above all for accumulating bonus coins to spend in the appropriate shop to buy new exercises, training routines, songs and clothes for virtual personal trainers. The work done by Ubisoft regarding the online features is also truly remarkable: by connecting to the network, you can compare your statistics with those of your friends, engage in global online challenges (for example, burn a certain number of calories within a given deadline), propose personalized ones and more. The section called Compagno di Fitness also deserves applause, an exotic name that actually hides a very useful list of culinary recipes also divided according to the type of training to be followed and including solutions for vegetarians, gluten intolerant and so on. Street. In short, not really lacks nothing in this Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2013, not even the aesthetic pleasure: the menus are elegant and easy to consult, even if the fact that they can only be viewed via the touchscreen can give some problems to those who do not get along with small size fonts. During the exercises, however, you can appreciate clean and well-made scenarios that host believable and well-animated polygonal models of the coaches.", "date": "2012-12-13", "grade": null}
