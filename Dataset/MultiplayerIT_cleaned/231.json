The DVD contains no automatic installer and no presentations, so it's up to the user to launch the individual add-ons he wishes to install. Clearly, it seems superfluous to say, but caution is never too much, you must first have your copy of Oblivion installed, since Knights of the Nine is absolutely unusable without it. Once installed, the various expansions will activate automatically, and it will be up to the player, if necessary, to deactivate the unwanted ones via the options menu before starting the game. Let's take a quick look at what the expansion CD actually contains: Oblivion version 1.1 update patch (required to install expansions). The Knights of the Nine (Oblivion - Knights of the Nine.exe) the main expansion, which also gives the title to the collection and consists of a long sub-quest. The planetarium (Oblivion - Orrery.exe) adds a subquest. Wizard's Tower (Oblivion - Wizard's Tower.exe) adds a subquest. The Vile Lair (Oblivion - Vile Lair.exe). Horse Harnesses (Oblivion - Horse Armor Pack.exe) the first, unpopular paid add-on, which adds the ability to use horse harnesses and armor for horses. Among Thieves (Oblivion - Thieves Den.exe). The Blade of Mehrunes (Oblivion - Mehrunes Razor.exe) adds the ~Blade of Mehrunes~. Spell Tomes (Oblivion - Spell Tomes.exe) adds some tomes of magic. Nine divinities for me, may be enough... As already mentioned, the highlight of this collection is ~Knights of the Nine~, which guarantees the average player an adventure lasting between 6 and 8 hours. Unlike the other quests which, when installed, automatically update the objectives during the game, this one has the merit of silently integrating into the game and can only be activated by talking to the various NPCs and asking them to report the usual ~voices of hallway~. The story of ~The Knights of the Nine~ begins in the seemingly peaceful village of Anvil, whose church has been desecrated after the brutal murder of all the priests inside. Upon arrival in the small town you come into contact with a preacher who prophesies the end of the world caused by the return to life of a certain immortal called Umaril (if he is immortal it is not clear how he came back to life, which implies the be previously dead, but that's it...), and it's just talking to this preacher the fastest way to start the quest. The only way to hinder the destructive madness of Umaril seems to be to find the vestiges and weapons of the ~divine crusader~, lost in the mists of time and capable of defeating the ruthless immortal. And the task, needless to say, falls to us. The famous ~Nine~ are none other than the earth deities of Cyrodil, and the ~Knights of the Nine~ were an ancient sect of warriors in their service who once fought Umaril but were defeated. Ultimately we can say that Knights of the Nine is a more than welcome expansion, fun to play and that adds good extras also thanks to minor add-ons, such as ~The wizard's tower~. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view there is very little to report. The expansion doesn't introduce any new graphics, so it will remain exactly as you can already see it on ~smooth~ Oblivion. From the sound point of view, only a fair amount of new voices for the dubbing of the characters and some new sound effects here and there can be reported. As for the system requirements, the same as those required for Oblivion. Final comment What could push a user to shell out 25 for a series of updates, when the community of Oblivion players is among the most active ever and produces tons of completely free add-ons and modifications? The answer, barring the sheer pleasure of having an official Bethesda expansion, is simple: the Knights of the Nine add-on is the best add-on available yet. While not guaranteeing stellar longevity, what is added is well made and is enjoyed playing. Recommended for all true fans of the universe created by Bethesda.Pros ~Knights of the Nine~ main add-on quite interesting A must-have for true fans of the Elder Scrolls saga Cons Additional longevity below the standards of the series Nothing new since technical point of view The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - Knights of the Nine is available for PC and Xbox 360. The version used for this review is the PC version. Who just can't help but wander around the lands of Tamriel, who can't tear themselves away from the magical world created by Bethesda Softworks has one more reason to be happy: it is already possible to find in stores a DVD containing the Knights of the Nine expansion (the same one that can be found online on Xbox 360) accompanied by all the additional contents that have been released by Bethesda in recent months. Let's see what it is.", "date": "2006-12-07", "grade": null}
