Yet, someone had tried to kill him with a boulder just before he reached the entrance door, and this is a bad omen for any traveller. Arrived at his destination he therefore finds himself having to complete two tasks, both difficult: to solve a medieval yellow on the suspicious death of a brother, and to find something to do for that incapable of his novice (a young man as pure as he is stupid). The adventure takes place entirely within the walls surrounding the abbey, with the different buildings that make it up. The medieval atmosphere is intense and palpable; rich in religion, esotericism and age-old human pettiness. The contrast between the American cartoon graphic style, very cartoonish, and the dark story is unsettling, but makes the more crude scenes disturbing. On this point we are curious to know what the gaming community thinks, because it could open an interesting path for point and click adventures. Yellow is tinged with noir Unfortunately, not everything is so perfect in The Abbey: there is a lot of talk, and some passages in the dialogue are repeated several times. Some characters' five-line responses aren't always well written, and most of the time we have to walk back and forth through the same rooms, day after day, questioning the monks several times. In part this aspect reinforces the sense of conducting an investigation based on logic and deduction, but sometimes it just paves the way for boredom. Luckily the plot is solid, and on the other hand it is freely inspired by The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco's masterpiece. The most interesting aspect, however, concerns the monks. All show an ambiguous attitude, revealing quirks and peccadilloes that make them well-rounded characters. The most interesting is the protagonist, whose weaknesses and tinge of vanity we learn about, as well as the man of the world attitude towards human beings and religion. The perfection of doctrine and the limits of man are one of the subterranean themes of the adventure, which seizes various opportunities to open cues for mature reflections. And it does so without malice or winks, so that a reflection on religion and human life does not turn into an a priori stance. On the sixth day he created man If we have spent many words on the setting and the characters there is a reason: The Abbey is mostly narrative substance, mystery and dialogues. Of course it's also a graphic adventure that couldn't be more classic, and for this there are puzzles. It is appreciable that all puzzles are based on logic and do not lead to amazing uses of a pin to pick a lock; everything Leonardo does is plausible and to some extent realistic. Unfortunately, however, they are not even very creative puzzles, and the lack of imagination adds up to the tedious comings and goings for one room and another of the abbey. The monks are not very cooperative and we will have to carry out tasks for them that involve a long series of steps. Once the obstacle has been unblocked, the interrogations start again, paying attention to possible inconsistencies. By carefully following who said what, it is easy to guess what the next move will be, combining the right objects collected here and there. The only difficulty lies in the fact that many selectable objects only open new paths for us during certain passages. In some cases, however, we have to ask that incompetent Bruno. Aesthetically The Abbey is of great value: the painted backdrops are splendid, in particular the sky, which changes color to mark the passage of time, up to the fourth chapter, when it takes on a sinister pale grey. The characterization of the characters is very good, although the facial expressions are rigid: don't expect a Disney film to be clear. A sore point: the English voice actors have acted without the game in front. The amount of sentences read in the wrong tone ruins the sense of immersion, eventually exhausting the player's patience, especially in Bruno's case. We just have to console ourselves with the subtitles in Italian. Too bad, this element alone makes the game lose some points, which is still an adventure that stands out from the crowd in terms of style and will certainly attract lovers of the genre.", "date": "2009-11-26", "grade": "7.3"}
