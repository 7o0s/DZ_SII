Yes, okay, Alisha unceremoniously leaves the group at the beginning of the adventure. Can we move on now, please? No, because Tales of Zestiria would have something more to say even to those who are not a horny otaku with Pretty Cure designer pillows and sheets. The historic producer Hideo Baba has packaged this Tales by fishing with both hands in two decades of history and collaborators, in a meeting of brains devoted to retracing the salient moments of the franchise while looking to the future, because one cannot continue to live on reflections and the next-gen has now arrived and has set the tents. In short, it is no coincidence that the western version of Tales of Zestiria also comes out on PlayStation 4 and PC. We've played the PlayStation 4 version and seen a more stable frame rate and overall cleaner image than the PlayStation 3 version, but the experience remains largely the same. Whether it's worth living or not, we'll tell you in the next few lines. Tales of Zestiria is an experiment partly successful and partly not, but still a great JRPG Great powers and great responsibilities Sorey and Mikleo are two best friends with a passion for archeology: together they explore the oldest crypts and ruins in their region following the suggestions of an ancient manuscript. During one of their adventures, the two come across a wounded knight, the beautiful Alisha, and decide to take her to their village to help her get back on her feet. Alisha is reticent at first, but then decides to trust that awkward young man who speaks to himself. Yes, because Alisha cannot see or hear Mikleo, as the latter is a seraphim, that is a kind of spirit. Sorey, on the other hand, succeeds, and grew up as the only human being in a village of seraphim, without ever having seen the outside world: a threat to Princess Alisha's life is in short the excellent opportunity to travel and find out what lies beyond the confines of its microcosm. A carefree young protagonist, a world to discover, an adventure that will become bigger than it began: Tales of Zestiria concentrates all the clichs of the series and Japanese cartoons in the first half hour, even risking a yawn, but in a short time the situation changes radically. Sorey is forced by circumstances to assume the role of Redeemer, a key figure in the history of his world who appears in times of crisis to oppose the devastating power of malevolence, a ~syndrome~ induced by the negative feelings of humans that transforms seraphim into monstrous beasts. Usually, the protagonists of Tales and JRPGs are complete strangers who eventually become heroes, but in Tales of Zestiria the opposite happens: Sorey is a kind of messiah that some look at with suspicion and that others admire regardless, but in in both cases it is the seraphim who are to pay the price and should be venerated in his place. The fantasy philosophy of the story rests on this delicate synergy which, to be honest, would seem to reflect the precarious condition of spirituality in our real world: at a certain point we will come across a Pope who has abdicated and disappeared, fed up with the intrigues of church and politics, inadvertently causing a catastrophic imbalance in its faithful. Impossible not to grasp the parallel with a very similar event that took place a few years ago. The more witty will grasp many more or less veiled references to our universe, and the beautiful message that Baba tries to convey through a compelling screenplay but unfortunately not always assisted by an equally good direction, sometimes unable to manage the most intense moments with the necessary intensity. important in history. Despite this, Tales of Zestiria relies on the sparkling dialogues of a diversified and bizarre cast at the right point, which overturns the stereotypes to which the series has accustomed us. The little girl on duty, for example, is called Edna, but she is not a little innocent but rather a centenary seraphim with irresistible sarcasm, and most of the most comic skits contemplate her incredible exchanges with the other characters, during the cutscenes of the story but also in the middle of the fights, thanks also to a truly superlative Italian adaptation that goes well with the excellent English dubbing (or with the Japanese one, if you prefer the original audio). In this sense, it isa pity that it is the same introductory cartoon movie (orphaned of the Japanese song ~White Light~, replaced by the instrumental version of the same, perhaps because in the West the refrain ~I wanna be white, white, light~ would have made many frown ) to anticipate some particularly important developments in the plot: we would really like to tell you not to watch it until Rose joins the party, but at that point it would be impossible to explain the combat system in its strengths and weaknesses. One step back, then always forward Our first fight is also the moment in which we realize that we are dealing with a different Tales than usual: the camera frames the character we are controlling from behind and follows his movements on a battlefield we arrived without no transition. Instead of loading them separately, the clashes in Tales of Zestiria take place exactly in the place where we came into contact with the enemy on duty, and the area we were exploring becomes the actual battlefield. The passage is fluid and practically instantaneous, it does not make us regret the old Tales and the loadings between fights and exploration  until we find ourselves arguing with the aforementioned camera. In open spaces it may happen that he struggles a bit in an attempt to keep up with us, especially if we move a lot between one enemy and another, but in closed places such as caves or crypts delirium happens, and more often than not the camera he goes completely out of his mind, getting stuck in the corners or losing sight of our character, perhaps due to a wall or some other environmental element. This is an extremely annoying catch, which you have to get used to. Fortunately, the battles of Tales of Zestiria aren't so frantic that you risk Game Over just because the camera is acting up, but the new combat system, a hybrid between that of Tales of Graces and that of Tales of Xillia, needs a few hours to digest. The magic points have given way to the Spirit Chain, a resource which both martial arts and spirit arts draw on: the former are essentially the combos that can be performed by pressing a key and a direction, while the latter are the typical special attacks and spells of the series, loading or instantaneous. The player can combine martial and spirit arts in combos of up to four hits, which will make fans of the series turn up their noses, used to performing chains of dozens of hits with a single character. In reality, continuing in the adventure, new functions are unlocked that expand the combat system, making it much deeper and more complicated than it appears at the beginning. One of these, for example, is the Explosive Bar, a small indicator that is recharged by fighting and which allows you to extend the combos beyond the fourth input or to launch the spectacular mystical arts. In reality, the combat strategy revolves entirely around the Explosive Bar, since it is precisely the one that allows us to resort to Armatization, an ability that allows certain humans in the group to merge with a seraphim, becoming more powerful and unlocking martial arts and completely different elemental spirits. The Armatization is close to the exploit for the advantage it offers against common enemies, but the player risks running out of Explosive Bar when having to face the opponents that count, such as the bosses. In a certain sense, the Armatization is a mechanic that makes you turn up your nose a bit, given that you are often forced to fall back on it to cope with otherwise deadly blows; moreover, the very concept behind the game and the story implies restrictions: the player is forced to keep a seraph for each human in a group. Forget a party consisting of four seraphim, or three seraphim and a human. You simply can't. Every seraphim must have a human partner, and vice versa. Fortunately, it is possible to switch seraphim with the d-pad during combat, so as to be able to exploit any vulnerabilities of the enemy and rest the newly replaced ones, but the artificial intelligence sometimes leaves something to be desired, especially when controlling the more slender characters by throwing them with impunity in the fray. As we said, you have to practice and learn how to manage Armatization, individual strategies and the subtleties of layered mechanics involving anomalous states, weak points, parries and dodges. In short, it is easy to guess that beyond the initial impressions and the schizophrenic camera, Tales of Zestiria on the combat system front does not disappoint at all, and indeed turns out to be one of the most strategic and reasoned episodes of the long sagto. Playstation 4 trophies With 40 bronze, 6 silver and 3 gold trophies to obtain, platinum may seem like a chimera but in reality it only requires a lot of patience: you will have to complete the game at least once and change the difficulty level against at least certain enemies , then it will be necessary to ~grind~ a lot to level up the characters, their equipment and dissect each secondary mechanic. Mirror of my runes If the combat system tends to gradually stratify as the hours go by, the story unfolds and the unlocking of new skills, arts and mechanics, the same cannot be said of the auxiliary mechanisms inherent in the customization of the characters and their equipment. The general idea, reading the tutorials and explanations offered by the game, is that not even the developer was very clear about the mechanisms in question. The most contrite mechanic of all certainly concerns the equipment, hand in glove with the passive skills that alter the statistics of the characters. In fact, runes are engraved on each weapon or armor which correspond to various types of bonuses, for example to attack or defense. Each of these runes has a specific place on a sort of grid, and equipping multiple items engraved with the same runes adds up to their bonuses. So far, it's quite simple. The fact is that by ordering the various runes on this grid in a certain way, for example by placing some close to each other or by completing the vertical columns, sometimes exaggerated bonuses are unlocked, and this would be good if the runes and the aforementioned bonuses did not depend on the note from the equipment. In other words, it's often the case that you sacrifice a new item, like a nice shiny weapon or a never-before-seen pair of boots, just so you don't change your runes and lose your previously unlocked bonus. The alternative is to constantly rotate equipment from one character to another in search of the best combination, and perhaps fuse items with the same name to gain others with the same runes or their combinations. Ironically, fusing items costs several galds, unless you've raised their individual level enough by keeping them equipped in combat to reduce the expense... and that means continuing to use the same items for a long time for one reason or another. for the other. As we said, it's an intricate system that seems to go against the very variety offered by the game in terms of loot. By being careful, it is possible to exploit it and derive enormous advantages from it, but the impression is that the entire rune system forces you to spend a little too much time between the menus. Much more fun to manage the regional bonuses thanks to the Normin, cute sprites scattered everywhere who play the role of collectibles and secondary customization tools. In these situations, Tales of Zestiria seems like a half-reasoned game. The basic idea is great, but the development leaves a bit to be desired. The same goes for maps, for example: perhaps in an attempt to open a small glimpse into the future of the franchise, Hideo Baba has chosen a vaguely ~open world~ approach to exploring the game world. The outdoor maps are immense, even when separated by short uploads. Distinguished by a good visual variety, beautiful atmospheric effects, plays of light and shadow and a discreet geographical irregularity, the areas require many ups and downs, long walks and a few moments of reflection when it comes to using an ability on the field to solve a simple environmental puzzle. We are faced with maps of a completely different caliber compared to the monotonous ones of Tales of Xillia, but the problems are also of a different nature: if Bandai Namco's intention was to make us feel small and lost in a gigantic world, the Japanese developer he succeeded very well because, hey, the maps are really gigantic, and maybe even too much. There are never many visible enemies, and this is a good thing, but ultimately the areas appear far too lifeless for an ~open world~ scenario and, therefore, monotonous in the completely opposite sense: rapid movements from one save to another other alleviate the weight of any backtracking, but cost a fortune for most of the game, forcing us to run from one area to another. Thankfully, this is not a worthless endeavor. Although belonging to the last generation, Tales of Zestiria is a great sight more than anything else thanks to an over the top artistic direction: beyond the joint character design of Minoru Iwamoto, Ksuke Fujishima, Mutsumi Inomata and Daigo Okumura, we were pleasantly surprised by the softness of the features, by the attention to detail and by the s", "date": "2015-10-23", "grade": "8.3"}
