{"name": "Call of Duty 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-3_a.html", "text": "The game Those who have already tried a title in the Call of Duty series will not have to face revolutions or particular changes with this third release, as already mentioned. Each stage follows a chronological thread, complete with dates and places, and places your and your team's exploits in the bigger picture of the war. You control a single soldier and cannot issue orders to the squad, whose members are immune to your fire (fortunately) and, it seems, also to enemy attacks, at least in broad terms: when a teammate falls, it is an event foreseen in the mission economy; event that can translate into a game over in case you had the task of covering it, or represent an ~emotional~ contribution to the game. One of many, because COD3 succeeds in representing war in a realistic and plausible way, therefore in all its drama. The team does not need to be coordinated or managed, it was said, and indeed plays a guiding role as regards the itinerary to follow, with the commander who will decide how to proceed if necessary and will entrust you with specific tasks. Don't expect good support in the fights from the group, however, because it is clear that you will be the one to produce yourself in the decisive actions, as it should be. But you can count on a respectable arsenal, made up of numerous rifles (automatic or single-shot, more or less powerful and more or less accurate) as well as a limited number of fragmentation or smoke grenades. The control system on Wii Call of Duty 3 does not represent the decisive test of the Wii's ability to grapple with cross-platform titles, given the youth of the machine and therefore the limited time available to developers to grasp its technical nuances. And it's fortunate, because honestly the game on the Nintendo console loses something instead of gaining it, so much so that more than once you will feel the desire to be able to use a normal joypad to gain precision and comfort. But let's go in order. As mentioned, the control of the character is entrusted to the Wii Remote / Nunchuck combination: the latter allows us to move, jump and crouch, while the Wii-mote takes care of all the other functions and deserves a more accurate analysis. Directing the Wii ~remote control~ towards the TV translates into controlling the gaze of our alter ego and therefore the viewfinder of the equipped weapon. To shoot you pull the trigger, of course, while the A button acts as a zoom and the  and + buttons lend themselves respectively to standard action (picking up weapons, reloading, operating devices, etc.) and pausing. You have to go up to the directional cross to change weapons (you can keep two at a time, replaceable at will), throw grenades and hit your opponents with the rifle butt, an action that can also be physically performed by jerking the Wii-mote. COD3 boasts some ~alternative~ phases that may have been designed for the Wii version (although also present in the other versions of the game) and which represent short ~minigames~, effectively alternating ups and downs. The first episode to occur is the hand-to-hand fight with an enemy soldier: you will have to move the Wii-mote and the Nunchuck back and forth like madmen to snatch a disputed rifle, then move the devices as if you wanted to strike with the butt of the weapon to get the better of the enemy. The second opportunity arises when you get behind the wheel of a jeep and you have to hold the Wii-mote and Nunchuck as if they were the ends of a steering wheel, ~steering~ accordingly and using the other buttons to accelerate and brake. If the latter application of motion detection works very well and translates into a fun and engaging activity, the same absolutely cannot be said for hand-to-hand combat: at that juncture, motion detection is absolutely inaccurate and you really have to kill yourself of effort to snatch the weapon from the enemy, and then hope that the attack movement is seen in the best way by the Sensor Bar. An experience that is not enough to define as frustrating, but which does not represent the lowest point of the game. The lowest point of the game, in fact, is revealed in the monstrous slowdowns that occur from time to time (certainly not often, but not too rarely) and which make COD3 on Wii unplayable for a few long seconds, in which the Wii-mote ~enchants~ and consequently exposes us to enemy fire. The presence of these problems, unfortunately not insignificant, is a pity in a global framework that absolutely does not make the control on Wii preferable to other consoles, but which in general works well and proves to be unexpectedly precise when aimed shots are needed, thanks a probable (and appropriate) recalibration of the difficulty for this version, which could make the experience a little more ~casual~ and less rigid than what was seen on Xbox360 or PS2. Certainly a bundled rifle-shaped adapter would have done a lot of good, for reasons of practicality, precision and involvement. [C] To increase variety, COD3 presents us with alternative situations. The ~zoom~ of the rifle, unfortunately, is limited. really inaccurate. The Wii control system allows for a number of small ~physical~ applications. [/C] The technical realization on Wii If the control system of Call of Duty 3 on Wii arouses great curiosity, the same curiosity arouses its technical realization. There has been a lot of talk about the technical characteristics of the new Nintendo console, often in the negative, and the graphics of this launch title (we reiterate: launch) cannot, by itself, establish what the real capabilities of the machine are. Looking at the polygonal models, resolution and textures, the impression is of being faced with something slightly superior to a good Xbox title. In this sense, episodes of serious slowdown are to be considered ~accidents~ relating to programming, also because they do not occur in particularly agitated situations. The frame rate is different, which by eye does not reach 30 fps and represents a limit for the type of use of the game on the Wii, which always needs very ~fluid~ graphics to express itself at its best. That said, we must consider that COD3 is a product of the Western school and that it is a multiplatform title, therefore that it must ~adapt~ in its core to several different machines, all to the detriment of an optimization that is certainly possible and with large margins. From the defects of the multiplatform nature we move on to the merits when we focus on the sound sector, in this case excellent both for the realism of the sound effects, and for the quality of the music (which in war games is always rather inspired), both for the acting level of the Italian dubbing. Finally, compared to the other versions, the one for Wii is the only one that does not offer any multiplayer mode. Comment Call of Duty 3 is a great game, perhaps not innovative compared to the previous episodes but certainly full-bodied and thick. On Wii it had to be even more engaging thanks to the control system, but unfortunately it's a half-successful experiment: some applications of the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination work well (albeit not exciting), others less so. The end result is a technically not cutting-edge product, as could be expected, which must be taken exactly for what it is: a first step for Wii in the obligatory direction of multiplatform titles. With the hope that the Nintendo child will quickly learn to walk Pros: Full-bodied and engaging Dubbed in Italian Innovative control system Cons:  but in many ways poorly studied Some problematic slowdowns Technically only sufficient Explaining the plot of Call of Duty 3 is simple: in the role of a soldier at the front we will have to contribute, in a decisive way, to that phase of the Second World War which saw France freed from Nazi control. The scenario changes compared to the previous Call of Duty, therefore, but the game structure remains almost unchanged: depending on the level we will fight in the ranks of American soldiers or allies, and we will have to complete more and more complex objectives. The difference lies in fulfilling our duty with a Wii Remote and a Nunchuck in hand. Quite a challenge, huh?", "date": "2006-12-14", "grade": null}
