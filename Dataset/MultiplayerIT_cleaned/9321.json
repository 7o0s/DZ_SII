{"name": "Tre razze in cerca di equilibrio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87779-rappelz-tre-razze-in-cerca-di-equilibrio.html", "text": "The world of Rappelz is populated by three races: one original and uncontrollably ~human~ and two created by the gods to bring balance. The original population is made up of the Gaia who, after long years of equilibrium, have given rise to a rebellion following an ambitious witch. However, many did not follow the woman and by joining the Devas, the race of light, and the Asuras, who represent darkness, they managed to restore peace. All right then. But no. It is said that the witch somehow came back to life and this is how players find themselves having to deal with a terrible new threat. The color of money Rappelz is quite complex and rich for a free to play MMO. One of the most relevant features is the management system of trained creatures which is based on cards and gives us the possibility to upgrade, mix and level up our ~fellows~. The title also includes PVP, power-ups in quantity, a good number of quests, over 150 experience levels with different advancements and hordes of monsters roaming the game world. Furthermore, the lands of Rappelz are quite large and varied. There is no shortage of caves, volcanic areas, prairies and cities of all kinds and travel is rather quick and comfortable. The most common method of travel is represented by a system of teleporters, each of which can take us to multiple destinations, but it is also possible to happily hop into the adventure using the most faithful feet or relying on a mount. In short, the nFlavor MMO is quite varied but the main activity of the title is to incessantly beat creatures that are not particularly intelligent. Even in parties, strategy is limited and almost all classes have a healing spell to get themselves out of trouble. The bosses require more than anything else to have equipment up to par and often do not require particular strategies but obviously represent a greater challenge. Fortunately, in some cases teamwork becomes relevant and it becomes necessary to organize yourself to manage more creatures or keep a tanked boss away from healers and damage dealers. As we said, the equipment must always be at its best to overcome the toughest challenges and the fastest way to improve it is to give yourself to wild farming. On the other hand, beating hands is also the only way to get rare drops and specific cards to capture a given creature. Among other things, when you immerse yourself in long sessions of systematic extermination it is good to have with you a medallion capable of channeling the Lak essence which can be converted into rocks (game coins) and temporary buffs. In fact, every single coin is essential given that in Rappelz almost nothing is free. Money is used to combine creatures or items and in general is used for all kinds of enchantments and bonuses that cost a fortune at high levels. Furthermore, money is also needed to rent mounts or to buy more powerful ones and obviously money is also needed to use teleporters. Finally, it is always good to be supplied with Fragments (or Chips) which are temporary bonuses and, as in any gear-oriented title, are essential for overcoming the toughest challenges. Force Chips boost physical damage, Soul Chips boost magic-type damage, and Luna Chips are hybrids. Centaur, I choose you! The creature summoning system adds a fair amount of variety to both the overall game and the combat that isn't particularly exciting on its own. Three ~companions~ can be purchased in the city and used once the Invoke and Recall creature skills have been obtained, but from the tenth level of the character it becomes possible to capture new ones thanks to the creature training skill. Creatures can be upgraded both with equipment, which follows special rules and must be combined with object cards in order to be used, or by mixing two cards from the appropriate NPC, or by bringing them to evolve. Each creature has two different evolutions and with the acquisition of an advanced skill can guarantee bonuses to the owner. Furthermore, magical classes that engage in summoning have the ability to further enhance pets, making them more effective in combat. Powering up creatures and items isn't always guaranteed, however. Leveling up increases the possibility of failing and the lower the player's skills are, the more complex it will be to complete an upgrade. The only exception are the bonuses guaranteed by the blacksmith. This is the only type of bonus that can be obtained without risk of bankruptcy but security has a cost. In fact, to obtain a maximum level blacksmith upgrade you get to spend figures exceeding 100 million rupees (the game coins). In short, although Rappelz is focused on sul farmin,g is still a rather complex title and also includes PVP with lots of morale points for those who try their hand at playerkilling. There are obviously special areas where you can fight without gaining immorality points and areas where it is not possible to kill other players. Unfortunately the low depth of the combat doesn't enhance this part of the game and the deathmatch gets boring pretty quickly, but it's still an extra option in a free to play title. Ups and downs of a modest engine Rappelz certainly does not revolutionize the genre but between creatures, upgrades, point missions and arenas it offers more than many other free to play titles. Unfortunately, but this can also be seen as a plus, a large part of the experience is reduced to farming and unfortunately, and this can hardly be a source of pride, the technical sector doesn't even shine in the panorama of free to play MMOs. To tell the truth, the models are not bad for a free title, the clothing is varied and differentiated by class and race, the draw distance is good and there is no shortage of large and suggestive lighting effects, glows on magical weapons and antialiasing. Instead, monsters and related animations are quite fluctuating and it happens that a low-level mob is more convincing than one that should terrify us at the mere sight. On the contrary, the buildings are not bad and here and there throughout the game world there are rather fascinating structures. Unfortunately they are immersed in a general desolation and the washed-out soil affects their performance. In fact, as regards textures and backgrounds, the title is undoubtedly lacking. Most locations are nothing short of unwatchable and it's not just about technological poverty. Many environments almost completely lack design, pop-ups and glitches are the order of the day and as regards the proportions, it sometimes seems to be trapped in a surrealist painting. Fortunately, the symphonic soundtrack, which recalls the classic atmospheres of oriental-style RPGs, is evocative, is qualitatively discreet and is capable of balancing, at least in part, the drop in pathos determined by the gaps in the graphics engine. The Italian version of Rappelz is updated to the Epic VII version and therefore enjoys all the recent contents. The store obviously allows you to buy buffs, items and creatures to make life easier.", "date": "2011-04-27", "grade": "7.0"}
