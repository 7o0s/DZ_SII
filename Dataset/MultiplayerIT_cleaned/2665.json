Graphically, the game is practically the same as its Japanese counterpart and, given that Namco has managed to improve their most famous fighting game by adding anti-aliasing, one wonders what EA might be missing for not having done the same. Furthermore, leaving out for now the graphic aspect, which to be honest presents some really beautiful animations with a detail of the players' physiognomies unique in its kind, we are faced with a title that is too arcadey, which can be good for spending a few minutes, but that in the long run becomes quite repetitive but above all unreal: I happened to take 10 corners in a row in which every time my attacker performed a bicycle kick in front of the goalkeeper and the latter sent it out ... only at the eleventh corner are managed to bag the ball but always in overhead kick! Graphically speaking... Apart from all the outline offered by the official license (real names and teams from all over the world), this football game risks pale in front of the more refined Winning Eleven (on PSX), but already the ~closest~ ISS pro for the Ps2 itself is more playable and addictive. Certainly doing bicycle kicks and dribbling in such a simple way can attract the less experienced and in any case the less demanding gamers, but nowadays a little ~graphics~ shouldn't be enough to decree the beauty of a game, it takes thickness and depth; it is also true that the figures speak for themselves, with a quantity of copies of FIFA sold always very high. Basically we are dealing with a football game that is more than ever a shooter, in which you manage to run on the wing with your player and get to shoot on goal without too many hitches, kicking absurd cannon shots Do we buy it or not? Another thing that can be annoying is that it is not possible to decide the power of the shot: a simple loading bar would have been enough to remedy this lack since in this way you can only shoot hard. Returning to the graphic aspect, there are fluid but sometimes a little cumbersome animations, with an annoying skating effect typical of the other chapters of the series, even if this time it must be said that it is less evident than the past titles. The stadiums are very beautiful and above all the management of the light sources with the really nice ~daylight through the spotlights~ effect. In essence therefore a discreet title which, as already mentioned at the beginning of the review, offers lots of beautiful graphics and options at will but which in any case is very lacking in terms of playability, so the advice is to try it only if you are passionate about the series or cannot help you run out of some football game for your new console. Second opinion by RED The diatribe as to whether Fifa was better than ISS (or W.E. :) has always existed: on the one hand it asserted that ISS was better in terms of graphics, playability and animations (which is unquestionable), on the other hand that, not caring about the graphics, has always enjoyed an arcade game and equipped with all the necessary licenses. In my very humble point of view, FIFA has always been ~more fun~: the mythical ~ball forward and pedal~ has given rise to challenges with friends that I have rarely been able to meet in other games, perhaps only when I approached the game on line, thanks to the friends of Multiplayer.it, while with ISS I always had the feeling of ~impotence~. Choosing between two philosophies, which is the best is impossible: but I can give you some advice: if you enjoy playing the old and dear Sensible Soccer, don't be ashamed! Play it and have fun. For posterity the arduous sentence .... Comments in the forum are welcome .... FIFA 2001 EA Sports faces the PS2 world with the umpteenth chapter of the multi-exploited FIFA series. Already released a few months ago in Japan, FIFA 2001 proposes all the themes that have distinguished it over the years: excellent graphics but bad gameplay. Sorry to say but it is strange that the programmers in all this time have not managed to make any changes to a title that had many shortcomings.", "date": "2000-12-12", "grade": null}
