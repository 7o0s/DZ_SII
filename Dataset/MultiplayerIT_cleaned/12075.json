{"name": "The Sims 2 Pets - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-pets-recensione_a.html", "text": "A decidedly intriguing and exciting game Electronic Arts proves to believe a lot in Wii, so much so that they want to launch this Sims 2 Pets just before MySims, the original title developed just for the Nintendo console. Pets is the ~spin off~ dedicated to human domestic friends, i.e. cats and dogs, which you can create and control throughout the simulation. Sims 2 Pets doesn't promise revolutionary controls on Wii, or out-of-parameter graphics, but rather a strong attraction that a game like this can have on the great masses of (non)gamers, girls and kids in the first place. To start, you have to create your own digital alter ego, as in any self-respecting Sims. Subsequently we continue with the animals to accompany our protagonist, dogs, cats and even hamsters. It is possible to modify the physical appearance of the animals, from nose to tail, by selecting specific breeds or by clicking on ~crossbreed~, an option that will give us a random puppy. Sims 2 Pets doesn't promise revolutionary controls on Wii, or out-of-the-box graphics A decidedly intriguing and exciting game In the ~mixed breed~ option, by pressing the B button it is possible to generate animals at random until we find one that suits our tastes. It is also possible to share the nice little animals created by us, by selecting personal information from the pause menu and obtaining a special code: for those who receive it, just enter it in the ~create a family~ option and they will see it magically appear as it is as we created it. The game structure of Sims 2 Pets is substantially that of the previous ones with the addition of animals, which actually play an important but not fundamental role in the game. Our Sim always has a career to pursue and we will have to help him in his personal climb to the top of the company, he will have to relate to the other Sims and will have to get by with the housework, especially in the kitchen! The goal is the hardest one, to be happy Every good ~Sims~ has always been a simulation of real life, and for this reason it has only one goal to pursue, the most difficult one in anyone's life! There is no real purpose in the game other than to make our character happy. An indicator of our Sim's mood appears on the screen, showing a brief summary of their basic needs. The amount of green color represents our happiness, red denotes discontent instead. This affects the whole game: Sims who don't have a good mood go to work unwillingly and don't engage in their daily chores. Moreover, human relationships deteriorate and lose quality. In fact, one of the primary needs is ~sociality~, that is the interaction with other people or the animals themselves that we have created at the beginning of the game; the entertainment comes immediately after, and contemplates various activities such as watching television, listening to music, dancing or enjoying a game. Then there are many other factors to consider, as in any good self-respecting ~strategist~: energy, comfort (i.e. the level of idleness), hygiene, hunger, bladder (the need to carry out one's functions, in short!) and the environment. The latter is a very particular factor, influenced by our ability to furnish the house. In fact, even in Sims 2 Pets the choice of furniture, decorations, appliances, decorations and colors plays a leading role. A lively and well-appointed abode keeps the ~Ambience~ gauge high, while a dirty and cluttered place will definitely depress us. Cooking Sims Our Sim will have to develop numerous skills or careers during the game: one of the first we will experience is that of the culinary art, through recipes and ingredients we will find ourselves on the counter preparing tasty dishes like the most experienced of housewives. To get started, just go to the fridge, select the raw materials we need and start: the choice is vast and includes meat, fruit, vegetables, oils, game animals, dairy products and grains. As far as the ~harvested~ foods are concerned, it will even be necessary to devote oneself to cultivation and subsequent harvesting. Our character's creativity can also be developed by drawing pictures or playing musical instruments, while logic by playing chess or using the computer. In addition to the brain, it is also advisable to take care of the body with treadmill sessions and targeted workouts that will increase our charisma with the fairer sex. The Sims 2 is also a ~building~ game, in the sense that you can build a house exactly how you want it; entering the ~build~ menu we are faced with numerous options from which to start: raise a wall, put a parparticular floor, place objects, windows, doors or accessories. Every little detail is configurable and editable, and there are hundreds of different items to buy and use. Animals have many needs Even our pets have their own needs and will be well looked after by feeding them, cleaning them and occasionally taking them for a walk. Each pets has its own character, a factor that denotes an interesting level of artificial intelligence, defined by the race and characteristics that we initially gave them. Hygiene, sociability, fun, energy and comfort are always present among the indicators of need, to which must be added ~chewing~, dedicated only to dogs that need their nice little bone to nibble on, and ~scratching~, which it's about cats and their tedious habit of sharpening their nails on the most beautiful and expensive armchairs we have in the living room (for this it will be essential to buy a scratcher right away!). Animals, fortunately, have fewer needs than their owners, and they just want to eat when they're hungry and play when they're bored. Animals, fortunately, have fewer needs than their owners Animals have many needs For the latter function there are many toys to buy in the city. The latter is accessible from the square, which includes a beautiful park for playing and many shops for unbridled shopping. There is the one where animals are sold, the one with toys, the general store where you can buy objects and accessories, the boarding house, the beauty salon and the oven where you can stock up on tasty delicacies to bring to your beloved Pets. Our life partners can be good bodyguards, entertainers or helpers in the house, it all depends on the training we give them, scolding them when they make a mistake and rewarding them when they have good behavior. It is possible to give certain orders and teach some basic commands to our dogs, for example. Of graphics, sound and character design. Sims 2 Pets controls use entirely the Nintendo Wii remote controller, which acts as a pointing system similar to the PC mouse. The system works very well and is definitely comfortable, practical and accurate for a game like this. Surely it was necessary to push the accelerator on the control in particular circumstances, perhaps making the game become a sort of ~Wii Fitness~ during training, or a ~Cooking Mama~ while we cook. It is equally true that the control system cannot be exploited to the maximum for each ~mini game~ present in Sims 2 Pets, because there are really dozens and dozens of them and it would have been hard to optimize them all to the maximum. From a graphic point of view, this Wii version differs little from the Playstation 2 and GameCube versions, differing in a greater number of polygons, albeit slight, and a general video cleanliness. The look and character design are spot on and very pleasant as usual, perfect for a particular title like this; the animations are also excellent, very varied and well done, even if sometimes there is a lack of a connecting frame between one and the other, precisely because of their large number. The audio sector is decidedly not very varied, however, a pity given that Electronic Arts owns the rights to exploit a vast musical catalog that could be inserted in a ~virtual radio~ within the game. The noises and sounds are instead well made, especially those of the animals, with excellent samples and a good variety of expressions. Comment Sims 2 Pets, like any good title of this very famous franchise, is a deep, long-lived and definitely fun title, also thanks to the inclusion of virtual pets that keep us company during the virtual life of our alter ego. In the game there are dozens and dozens of parameters to consider, excellent interaction with the environment, a good AI and many, many things to do, with other Sims or with our pets. The ~building~ factor is always important and fun, as is the development of our (many) skills. The use of the remote control is comfortable and accurate, although perhaps underdeveloped. The fundamental problems of Sims 2 Pets are two. The first is to arrive late compared to traditional consoles, the second is to come out close to a title like MySims in which Electronic Arts places a lot of resources and trust, attracting much of the attention of the general public. Ultimately we recommend Sims 2 Pets to anyone who has missed the latest releases of the EA franchise and wants to try it on a new-gen console like Nintendo Wii. Pros: Adding pets Lots of skills and options to discover Great and precise controls Cons: Late releasecompared to the ~old gen~ versions Remote control to be exploited more Graphically slightly superior to the Ps2 version Sims is certainly the most famous brand in the history of PC video games, with its multi-million dollar sales and countless expansions and versions released over the years. Sims was then released on virtually any existing gaming platform, from portable to home consoles, making the fortune of the Maxis software house and its creator Will Wright, brilliant and creative game designer and inventor of SimCity. ~Pets~, the Sims version dedicated to domestic pets (so popular after the international success of the Nintendogs), has yet to appear on the screens of next-gen consoles, but Electronic Arts, its publisher, has had an eye for Nintendo and released it on Wii, first ~New-gen~ console.", "date": "2007-08-06", "grade": null}
