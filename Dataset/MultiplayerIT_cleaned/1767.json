{"name": "Sim City 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sim-city-5.html", "text": "Simulate a city. Sim City or ~we simulate a city~. The city is, and will always remain, the fulcrum, the nerve center of the game. Our adventure as mayors of glorious and rich metropolises starts (after a full-bodied and creaky loading) on a vast map divided into areas of different sizes depicting the maximum limits of our potential territorial expansion. Carefully choosing the most interesting area, on which to lay the foundations of our building empire, we soon get to the heart of the game. The first phase of any ~colonization~ of a virgin area is always the ~terraforming~, a sort of editor, defined as ~god mode~ in which we will be able to indulge ourselves by creating, destroying and shaping the environment to our liking and adapting it to our taste and to our needs; just as happened in Sim City 2000, while in 3000 this option was removed to give space to a random generator of terrains which was based only on a synthetic choice of the fundamental characteristics of the territory, such as the position of the coasts, the presence of rivers and the percentage of forests and mountain ranges. Given free rein to our ~divine imagination~ we prepare to embark on our adventure as mayors. The ~mayor mode~ (mayor mode) throws us in the middle of the action. A quick look at the interface, and The Sims immediately comes to mind, then just a click on the adviser menu to understand how much the thesis of interconnection or the creation of a ~Maxis~ standard is very realistic. Our advisers, in their animations reduced to tiny windows, have all the look of our Sims friends, missing only the nice curses in ~simiese~ (the very international and universally incomprehensible language of the Sims) to make us feel at home. Another menu brings our inseparable friends back to view, highlighting the possibility of placing our Sims in the city to always keep us informed of its evolution and state of health. The graphics immediately catch the eye, which despite being very complex, accurate and full of details, the graphics of the game always remain linked to an isometric view, a solution to which Maxis does not seem willing to give up (and perhaps dictated not only by habit but also by the extraordinary complexity that would result from making such a game, with such a level of detail, if it were based on an engine capable of allowing 360 panning with unlimited zoom). Nonetheless, the terraforming process and the entire background on which the city is based are based on a 3D graphics engine, which moreover only allows ~level~ and not continuous zoom (in practice in SC4 you cannot zoom as you like but you it will be allowed to zoom only at established altitudes). comparisons, nor can it be said that the graphic aspect has been neglected by Maxis in the creation of one of its spearheads. Elegance seems to have become the watchword at Maxis studios. It is flaunted not only by the clean graphics of the game, but also by the fascinating possibility of seeing day and night alternate and by the completely cleaned up interface. Once the mythical fixed grid on the ground has disappeared, in its place we find one in a reduced format and with soft edges that follows the movements of the cursor on the ground and whose diameter does not exceed ten squares, a real ruler that follows us wherever we go. The amazement increases when we try to trace the areas for building planning. With the usual method we try to draw a large green rectangle (residential area) on the ground and, amazement!, within it there is already a network of roads aimed at optimizing and meeting the specific requests of the specific area. If I could have a few thousand imeons a month... Following an advanced RCI graph (which indicates precisely what kind of density is required for each thematic area) we draw the sketch of a small city and we soon realize how much this game has insisted on the realistic aspect of the urban management. Some of you (like me after all) will have had in the past, with the previous titles, some difficulty in the very first games to get the right pace for a reliable and economically stable development of the city. SC4 does not in any way allow you to start with great fanfare by making a lightning-fast development. The question is simplice, for a city to flourish out of nowhere, you have to start slowly and not get over your head with crazy grabbing strategies. Although the initial budget is very high, it is good to immediately consider the possibility of being able to spend the first periods in heavy losses, mostly due to the impossibility of receiving exorbitant income from a small population. Furthermore, the importance of urban maintenance costs seems to have made a comeback, apparently dormant in the last edition but the real protagonists of the first two chapters. Building roads and railways costs money, the same thing goes for buildings, but their cost is not only linked to the initial expense, but above all to maintenance costs (which always appear in the service presentation labels). Without adequate funding your streets will soon rot and your water pipes will fail, causing not only general discontent among the population (which if left untreated soon leads to dangerous riots), but also the inexorable degeneration of the urban area. Buildings and infrastructures have two items on the tag indicating the initial cost and the monthly cost for maintenance, therefore carefully evaluate each investment because you could pay the (salty) price very soon. The round table. One thing is clear, in Sim City the mayor is equal to God. All the decisions made for better or for worse depend on him, for the glory or the infamous destiny of the city. Nonetheless there are advisers, the faithful servants of ~his majesty the First Citizen~, who with praise or insistent criticism always keep the player's attention on the state of health of the urban centre. These likeable (and very competent) figures, who like all characters in Sim City 4 look like dear Sims, cover all areas of interest in the city and constantly monitor people's mood and the state of their sphere of interest. Seven advisors for seven aspects of the game, all to be treated in detail: an expert in urban planning, one for the economy, one for energy and resources (mainly electricity and gas), a safety manager, a doctor for apparatus of health and the didactic environment, a transport engineer and finally the person in charge of the environment and the territory. Pay attention to the color of the windows, like a litmus test they will indicate whether your administration is doing a good job or is ruining the city. Fourth edition. Novelty? Up to now we have only listed the gaming opportunities that Sim City offers. However, we must not forget (and I have not done so) that many of you readers have probably already gone through the previous titles and will be interested in the real news of this latest chapter in the series. SC4 presents itself as a wide-ranging game that does not want to fossilize the player's attention on a single city but aims at the management and cooperation of a large number of coexisting cities. We are no longer faced with the old game concept in which the city lived an isolated life even if apparently immersed in a larger context. Remember Sim Nation and nearby cities? These were mostly fictitious projections, created by the computer to simulate the minimum involvement necessary to justify the external connections of the city. Things have changed (thankfully). Now the whole region will have to be colonized in order to guarantee solidity to the entire city system. For this reason we cannot expect to start immediately with a metropolis of millions of inhabitants, but we will have to take the first steps by creating the foundations for an empire made up of several urban nuclei. The city's economy will be greatly affected by what happens in neighboring countries, basing its future above all on the potential of the neighborhood. All this can only help the primary objective of the game: to create a realistic SIMulation. The player will have the opportunity to transform the initial map into the land of dreams, as the entire region (divided, as we have already said, into small lots) can be completely remodeled as desired. Sim City 2000 also offered something like this, but this time we are talking about truly plastic and realistic modeling. The game has very accurate and detailed graphics, while remaining faithful to the standard that wants an isometric view and buildings made up of bitmaps. So once again we are not faced with exasperated 3D, but with the careful choice of a graphic design compatible with thegame needs that require very articulated, complex and extensive maps, in continuous evolution. Observing the city from above, in fact, one will easily realize how it looks very much like an anthill; houses and buildings, even trees, are growing, changing and being replaced all the time. Also pleasant is the effect of the ~work in progress~ which depicts hardworking workers at work during the construction of roads and buildings. And what about the opportunity to see day alternate with night? A purely aesthetic novelty but very welcome and capable of giving a touch of class to a game that has class to sell in rivers. If you were used to cities perpetually in the sunlight you will find it very pleasant to see how it changes after sunset. On the other hand, every self-respecting city changes its appearance during the night: the lights, discos and clubs will give your town a really cool air! Finally, I would say a last word about disasters, which have always been the ~leitmotif~ of Sim City. There is certainly someone among you who for years has been wondering what is the point of being able to destroy the city so painstakingly built with your own hands. Well, it is a challenge with oneself to see if the city can survive even in extreme situations. In SC4 we will find exciting new catastrophes to plague our beloved metropolis: fires, lightning, volcanoes, meteors, earthquakes, tornadoes and a sci-fi invasion of space robots. Some classics that have always been present in Sim City are missing, such as riots and floods, but don't despair: you will still find bread for your teeth (waiting for an expansion, another Maxis classic, which could spice up your games ). The Sims and Sim City, a happy marriage. It seems that Maxis' goal in recent years has been to aim for a standard of success that unifies the main titles of its recent history. The Sims and Sim City are the main representatives of this story, but also two major best-sellers capable of attracting the attention of many people. Let's not forget the dualism between these two series. The Sims was born from a rib of Sim City, focusing precisely on the inhabitants of Sim Towns. It therefore seems that the idea of bringing the Sims back into the limelight within SIm City is liked by the geniuses of Maxis. Precisely for this reason, not only will we find clear traces of The Sims at the interface level (see indicator bar, menu and advisors), but we will even be able to create or import sims directly from the game to see them live in our metropolis. This possibility is not linked to a purely aesthetic fact, but above all serves to continuously monitor the quality of life in our city. We will be able to place the Sims in different parts of the city by clicking on the house we prefer; from here our virtual alter egos will communicate their impressions of the city seen from the streets, the quality of services and the imminent dangers (read crime, services, pollution, low level of education and cases of medical malpractice). We think this is a really good idea! Obviously, parallel to this, SC4 revolves and flourishes around the community that was born around The Sims, for this it will be possible to count on the help of numerous enthusiasts ready to exchange maps of cities and regions to pump up the level of fun that a title like this can offer. Remember that the multiplayer-oriented aspect of latest generation games is increasingly important (and we at M.it know something about it :-) in terms of involvement and without a shadow of a doubt an approach of this kind gives a high longevity. Precisely for this reason The Sims, apart from the fact that five expansions full of add-ons and important news have been released, is still alive after almost three years from the release date; without such a large community ready to exchange ideas, and above all objects and skins, most likely the attention would have dropped much more quickly. Also don't forget that the last title of the mentioned series is based exclusively on multiplayer and presents itself as a respectable mmorpg (ok, without a fantasy setting and legendary dragons, but if it's not an rpg The Sims... but this is a another story). Let's sum up. Confirmed that SC4 is undoubtedly a title that has no rivals in its genre, Maxis once again conquers the golden palm for leadership in the simulation / management sector. As was the case with The Sims the game is accompanied by a rich and extremely", "date": "2003-02-08", "grade": null}
