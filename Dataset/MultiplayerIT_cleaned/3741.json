{"name": "Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-xv-episode-ardyn-recensione.html", "text": "Ardyn Izunia is the absolute and undisputed protagonist of the latest DLC dedicated to Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn should have been the first of a new tranche on which Square stopped work a few months ago, putting a stop to the support of one of the most discussed titles of recent years. On the villain, for better or worse everyone agrees: he is one of the most successful characters in the long history of the franchise, an impression confirmed by the tragic background first mentioned in the original storyline and then deepened later especially thanks to an animated short film. The vision of the latter is practically necessary to fully understand the events told in the DLC, since the script would seem to assume that the player knows the background and the characters that appear in the cinematics. For this reason, in fact, Episode Ardyn appears from the very first minutes a DLC designed specifically for the super fans of Final Fantasy XV. So it is written and so it shall be Our story begins on Angelgard, the island where Somnus had his brother Ardyn imprisoned under the code name Adagium after betraying him and stealing his throne. For those who have forgotten, Ardyn Izunia, actually Ardyn Lucis Caelum, was an ancestor of Noctis with the power to heal or inflict the Blight that turns living beings into monsters. Locked up and forgotten for two thousand years, Ardyn is freed by a young Verstael Besithia who convinces him to support the empire of Nifhleim in the war against the kingdom of Lucis. The DLC therefore explores Ardyn's reasons and the reasons that led him to pursue revenge against his own lineage, explaining how he subjugated the sidereal of fire, Ifrit, and how in the end he completely went mad, consumed by rancor and loneliness . The plot constantly jumps from the past to the present, through flashbacks and hallucinations that immerse us in Ardyn's mind, helping us to understand his point of view. Let's face it: Ardyn had at least a couple of excellent reasons to be mad at Lucis and both the short film and the DLC help to better frame his role as a villain, making it much more three-dimensional. The DLC pours out a lot of crucial information about the mythology of Final Fantasy XV, mostly in the form of databases or archives that the player can consult freely after unlocking the corresponding item. The problem is that, narratively, there is little substance. The main storyline, divided into three chapters, is completed in less than two hours, and concludes with a revelation that also questions the meaning and moral of Noctis' experience in the original game. In this sense, Episode Ardyn adds little to the plot of Final Fantasy XV, representing just an interesting but negligible insight. As Ardyn The actual gameplay of the DLC takes place in the city of Insomnia which Ardyn visits on behalf of Emperor Aldercapt with the express purpose of confronting Regis and prompting the spirit of Somnus to manifest. To enter the royal palace, however, you must first deactivate its defenses by destroying the generators scattered around the city: they divide Insomnia into sectors and essentially represent the main challenge of the DLC. The player's goal is to eliminate at least two generators - the others are optional - by defeating their keepers and Insomnia's soldiers defending the city. There are no other NPCs: the streets are deserted, while Ardyn moves from one point to another using the translation system assigned to the back button. Exploring Insomnia is therefore quite simple and each destroyed generator reveals, on the map, the locations of collectibles, save points and shops: the latter allow you to spend the yen earned on hats with which to customize Ardyn's model. The combat system is essentially that of Final Fantasy XV, modified for the occasion. The most striking difference is that, after weakening the opponent with a few hits, Ardyn can ~daemonize~ him, inflicting additional damage and regenerating a small amount of HP. As a member of the Lucis dynasty, Ardyn fights with his ancestral weapons, but by spending skill points earned in combat, his stats can be improved and new attacks unlocked. It is a simple and linear progression system that also allows you to enhance Ifrit, the sidereal that Ardyn can summon after having charged the appropriate indicator to attack the enemies that surround him. The combat system is immediate and fun, even if it is easy to get confused in the chaos of the battle, above all because of an uncertain camera that really gives its worst in closed environments, incastrando the shot and disorienting the player. As we said, Episode Ardyn is not a very long-lived DLC. There are two levels of difficulty and by completing the campaign, you unlock some bonuses in the base game and martial combat, an optional fight with Noctis that makes us relive the final battle of Final Fantasy XV from Ardyn's point of view. Collectibles fans could spend an extra hour or so on the DLC to defeat all enemies in the city of Insomnia and collect all the items, but that's an activity in itself and exploring the city didn't excite us at all, being practically deserted and accompanied by a fully sung, rocking theme song that we found quite out of place. The Final Fantasy XV soundtrack is one of the best out there, as the other songs we heard in some moments of the DLC remind us, but that track has been out of tune for so long as to be unsettling. Ultimately, as the last DLC, Episode Ardyn proved to be quite disappointing, especially at the proposed price. It is a short adventure that now reveals little about the secrets of Final Fantasy XV and that questions the story as we have known it, conveying a dark and pessimistic message about the inevitability of fate which, although it overturns the traditional RPG clichs Japanese, somewhat detracts from the importance of Noctis's late-game actions. However, Episode Ardyn clarifies some questions, but on the gameplay front it returns a repetitive and uninteresting experience that we feel like recommending only to hardcore fans of Final Fantasy XV who want to tread the soil of Eos for the last time.", "date": "2019-04-02", "grade": null}
