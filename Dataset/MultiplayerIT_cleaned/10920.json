{"name": "Baby Life - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/baby-life-recensione.html", "text": "It seems that there is still room on our shelves for new titles dedicated to a very young audience that aim to take care of a virtual baby. It seems that they may now be on the verge of replacing traditional dolls, perhaps with the strength of a modernity, an interactivity, a format that marks the time for a new way of playing for today's children. We leave you wondering if this new progress is to be accompanied by feelings of sadness or goodwill, in the meantime let's see if this new Baby Life is a product that deserves attention and presence in the consoles of our children, just older than those protagonists of the game itself . Once inserted into our console, the game welcomes us with cheerful music and colorful, sunny and cheerful screens. We go through the usual screen for creating our profile, in which we must define the baby who will then be our virtual son or daughter. Still in the womb, the first step is to answer a short series of questions that will somehow define the character of the unborn child, trying to make him as similar as possible to us and consequently guaranteeing greater possibilities of identification. Among the questions we don't find anything particularly abstruse: it's about choosing our favorite game, the object of the heart, where we would like to live, our favorite animal and so on. At this point the door of our colorful home will open and the appropriate little frugoll will make his (weeping) entrance into our virtual life. The controls are extremely simple to use, all of the actions and options are manageable through the stylus and the touch screen of the DS. The menu allows us to move from one room to another in the house, to talk to the baby or access the inventory. The help of the push-button panel is instead necessary to guide some toys in the garden. The domestic environment is made up of different environments, each of which is preparatory to a series of possibilities for interaction and care of the newborn. In the garden we will be able to play in relaxation, the bedroom will naturally be used to let the little one sleep, in the kitchen we will take care of baby food and bottles, the bathroom and wardrobe will be used for the hygiene and dressing of the baby. There is also a photographic studio, where you can capture the growth of the child. The stork arrives One of the characteristics of Baby Life, however, is not the colorful and cartoonish setting, nor the cheerfulness and radiance that definitely come out of the screen, but its complexity. While remaining a substantially similar game, in its structure, to many other competing products, it can be seen that a care worthy of applause has been given to the variety of available options and game possibilities, which make it less prone to tedium and repetitiveness than many other competitors. One of the options added is, among others, the one relating to the message window to be exchanged with our baby. In fact, it is possible to have a rudimentary form of communication with the child on the screen, who can also be taught to respond to us. Touching the messages icon on the menu will open a window in which it is possible to trace a series of symbols which will be interpreted by the child. Drawing a heart will mean ~I love you~, it will serve to take care of the little one's need for affection, while a triangle is used to ask him what he wants to play. A circle will ask him about his willingness to play a sport, a square if he needs to be changed, there are symbols to know if he's hungry, if he's sleepy, if he wants a stuffed animal and so on. It is obviously an elementary communication, which however marks the step of greater interactivity and involvement with our character. But it doesn't end here! In fact, children grow up, and ours does too. Who will begin to take his first steps from the cradle and, like all children, will begin to deal with the world of school. In addition to experienced parents, we will have to prove that we are also good kindergarten teachers, and every morning we will be confronted with a class of very lively children, in addition to our own, to take care of both from an educational point of view and from that of basic needs. like the afternoon nap or the bottle. It's a kind of complex minigame, in which we'll have to satisfy the requests of children with strokes of the stylus. Parents who are happy with the good treatment we have given to their children will reward us with gifts that we will then need for the care and growth of our baby. Last but not least, we must not forget that there is a shop for clothing and accessories in the game and that the game includes a number of multiplayer functions that allow uset to exchange all the items we have in our inventory with friends who own another copy of the game. In short, nothing is missing to guarantee a good number of hours of play for our children, who will find in their console a really well-maintained, long-lived, well-structured product both in terms of gameplay and graphics and sound. It is certainly one of the most successful titles of its kind of the current season. Comment Baby Life certainly cannot boast the advantage of bringing an innovative product to the market, it is one of many, perhaps too many titles intended for a very young audience to re-propose the theme of the virtual doll. However, it manages to stand out for its quality, thanks to the good level of iteration, graphics and sound and the complexity and vast availability of game options it boasts. It is a product that really manages to convince, well structured and usable, destined to fill several hours of fun in the hands of children who want to play at being a mother.Pro Sunny, colorful, cheerful Well done graphics and sound Great variety of options and complex game structure Against It fits into a very crowded type of product", "date": "2009-01-16", "grade": null}
