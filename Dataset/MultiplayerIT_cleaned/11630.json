{"name": "The Club - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-club-recensione.html", "text": "Comment The Club is a fresh and original game, and due to its nature it is not suitable for all palates. The game by Bizarre Creations is ideal for those looking for a healthy arcade challenge, the classic ~score attack~ and climbing the leaderboards, even if done in a third person shooter. The single player therefore has the depth of an arcade cabinet: immediate, engaging, but not very varied. Ideal for short, hectic and rewarding sessions, it doesn't promise and doesn't even try to offer an experience that leads the player to identify with the recreated setting. The Club has no real end, improved performance is the key to almost limitless longevity. Provided you get into the right perspective. Pros Immediate like an arcade Very nice graphic section Almost infinite Cons Can be repetitive Online multiplayer Too difficult at advanced levels A shooter but with style The experience gained in their previous works has been fully put to use in this new purely arcade-style title. The Club mixes shooter elements with those of a racing game in an original and fresh way, PGR's kudos system, combos and bonuses to increase your score. In fact, the purpose of The Club is not to kill all the enemies to finish one scheme after another, but to collect the maximum possible score within a ~guided circuit~ in the game level. There are many elements that contribute to raising the counter. First the speed; secondly it is important to hit the enemies in the best possible way: a long distance head shot gives many more points than a machine gun burst from a few meters away. Basically the style of the ~kudos~ of PGR, compared to a shooter. The experience gained in their previous work has been fully put to good use in this new title A shooter but with style It is also essential to chain combos: once we hit an opponent we have a few seconds to take a second one, and so on, increasing the score as the sequence increases in number. If we can't kill anyone, the bar runs out quickly and we go back to zero in a few seconds. Secondary elements hidden in the levels also give bonus points: finding them all is not easy at all and a long work of memorizing the patterns is required to perfect the games and constantly improve. The collaboration of SEGA is felt throughout The game view is in third person, but by pressing the left side button the camera zooms behind the character, in Resident Evil 4 style, with the body on the left side and the weapon in the center of the screen. The general feeling that you feel moving within the ~tracks~ in the various levels is very reminiscent of games like Lost Planet, but also Outrigger. The first for the particular way in which the characters are animated, with slightly independent bust and pelvis to favor the rotation of the camera and the viewfinder at the same time; the second for the visual sector, with well-made textures and colors that refer to the ~SEGA~ arcades. The graphic detail is excellent: diagrams such as the factory and Venice are treated in detail, with very different textures for each material, defined and designed in a very realistic way. The amount of polygons is decent, but no miracles; the nature of the game, scripted in very small settings, facilitated the work of the developers, who were thus able to painstakingly polish and perfect every corner of the game that could pass in front of the camera. A race against time. The frame rate is solid and you never notice any slowdowns, even in the most frenetic moments of the action. Numerous effects are present on the screen such as an excellent blur that emphasizes fast movements, explosions and depth of the field of vision, but also a decidedly realistic light. The audio sector is well cared for, but does not leave its mark or remain impressed in terms of variety and quality. Voices and sounds are sampled flawlessly, and are enhanced by effects such as reverbs, echoes, and intensity changes depending on the position of enemies on screen. The Club is a race against time, like a racing game The Club is almost always a race against time, like a racing game, but where the way you proceed is what makes the difference and on which the playability of the title itself revolves. Its very nature, purely Arcade, could be boring and not very varied for some, a source of longevity and challenge for others: The Club is loved, or hated. Its particular originality is another factor that can lead to easy classificationni. It is a virtually infinite title, which hinges its gameplay on filing scores (with almost 600 different types of online rankings) and on continuous improvement. There isn't much to see, apart from those settings on which Bizzarre has created paths and challenges, and the high difficulty rate of the more advanced modes could lead you to give up once you've seen all the schemes, in the absence of progression in the game. score. The main mode consists of a virtual tournament, in which you have to face all the stages in succession, after having chosen the level of difficulty. In each level you have to face a series of modalities distributed over a series of events, at the end of which points are obtained which allow the chosen character to grab victory in the ~stage~ of the tournament, unlocking the next setting. There are three main modes: in the timed one the goal is to complete the stage in the shortest possible time, without letting the stopwatch reach zero. There are three ways to earn precious seconds: collect the clock icons on the ground, destroy the stopwatches hanging on the walls or kill enemies; each of these actions adds three seconds to the counter. Once you reach the end of the level, you break through one last obstacle (usually a door or wooden planks) and end the race. In survival mode, on the other hand, we have to resist enemy attacks for a limited time. In the purely arcade ~race~ phases, the most frequent, you have to follow the path established within the scheme following the indications given by the various signs located on the walls. It is often possible to change direction or venture for short distances in antigue or lateral areas, finding bonuses and additional weapons. Its success is also inextricably linked to that of the creation of a valid community of online friends who play it: the challenge is the primary factor, more than the various multiplayer deathmatch modes, in which the title does not excel at all. In fact, it is possible to challenge each other in special arenas up to a maximum of 16 players, or 4 locally with a split screen, in team mode or all against all. It is very clear that this is an addition and that the actual game is studied, conceived and designed with other purposes in mind. That of a perennial challenge with friends, to obtain the highest score, by memorizing locations and sequences of opponents. Xbox 360 - Goals The Club provides the player with the canonical 1000 points, most of which are unlocked in the single player, by completing the various levels and gradually reaching higher and higher scores. Its arcade nature inextricably links the score to the reward in points, which is generous and repays the player frequently and continuously. The first 6-10 objectives are in fact given in the first hour of the game, simply by progressing in the very first stages, the rest almost all arrive automatically by completing the game.", "date": "2008-02-08", "grade": null}
