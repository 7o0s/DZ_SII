{"name": "FIFA 15", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/138067-fifa-15-sentire-il-gioco.html", "text": "With the FIFA series, it certainly cannot be said that the guys from EA Canada have not had the ability to introduce innovations into what are game dynamics that have consolidated through years and years of running-in. Elements such as tactical defense and the success in removing the famous rails have contributed significantly to the affirmation of the series, especially at the turn of 2010, in the years in which FIFA had now set the arrow to overcome the historical competitor Pro Evolution Soccer. Having obtained the scepter of best simulation and centered the consecration with FIFA 14 as ~total football~ of the old generation consoles, last year was also the time for the debut of the new Ignite Engine. A sort of preview of what we would have in our hands now, with FIFA 15 which we find ourselves talking about today. The direction, even at the time, seemed quite clear: to focus everything on the impact of the game in the eyes of the spectator, taking advantage of the new hardware to increase the similarity of the simulation with what we see on television during Sunday matches. Now that FIFA 15 has arrived, we can take stock of the situation, also taking advantage of a PC version that finally has nothing to envy to those of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Before launching into the analysis, a note: we continued to test the title after the publication of the first official patch, so the following considerations are the result of the latest version released. FIFA 15 brings football to PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One like never before! Never change a winning team The absence of competition that can be defined as strong leads those who dominate a market to risk less and less. It is an attitude that can be found in every sector, including that which concerns the eternal challenge between FIFA and PES, within which EA's product has been able to take advantage of a search for its own identity by Konami's, which now continues from several editions. Contrary to what has been done in the past, EA Canada's intention to maintain the existing framework without particular upheavals can be read from the first navigation through the FIFA 15 menus, similar to those of FIFA 14. Which we do not mind at all in reality, because with the work carried out on the previous edition, excellent usability of the various sections that make up the game had already been achieved. Along the same conservative line, those looking for new game modes will be disappointed by the fact that these are practically absent, unless you want to define the return of the Tournaments killed off with FIFA 14 as such, thanks to which you can give life together with your friends to custom competitions. For the rest, there is everything we already know: the various challenge and training sections, the online seasons both in single and in co-op, the Pro-Club, the Career and of course the real goose that lays eggs. gold on which the economic success of FIFA, or the Ultimate Team, is based. Goals The objectives of FIFA 15 are 45, divided among the various modes present within the game. To obtain them, it is therefore necessary to acquire a certain mastery of all the aspects that make up the simulation, also working hard to save a goal on the line, score with a goal shot or an elegant conclusion, beat a friend in skill tests and more. Here is the complete list of objectives Live football Having ascertained that there are no particular novelties among the modes of FIFA 15, by starting to dig inside them it is possible to notice what are the additions inserted by the developers. The most obvious concern FUT, within which player loans have arrived: thanks to them, we can integrate players who are also quite strong within our squad for a limited number of matches, taking advantage of it to involve them in crucial matches so as to obtain important victories without the need to have found them inside a package. A new tool for building your ideal eleven is represented by the Experimental Teams: using all the cards/players present in the game, you can simulate the creation of the dream team you have in mind, thus discovering how it works in terms of cohesion of its interpreters and plan the next moves on the market. After all, Messi and Ronaldo may not be happy together (but let's say they can certainly help). A further addition, identical to the one made in the Seasons mode outside of FUT, is the one dedicated to the Friendlies Seasons, thanks to which you can challenge a friend to win the single competition in 1-on-1 mode: a derivation of the old Online Friendlies, within which he assigns ittion of the trophy was already contemplated. Returning to FUT, as far as players are concerned, the section relating to Exchange Offers has been eliminated, due to those who took advantage of it to carry out shady operations, while the individual cards have gained the new PHY parameter: it is a combination of the Strength attributes , Stamina and Salto, through which you can get an indication of the individual player's ability to emerge victorious from the various physical battles on the pitch. Let's move on to Career mode, to find some small news dedicated to scouts, now more proactive in following talents, and to the analyzes of players and leagues during our game: nothing shocking, waiting to see the forbidden dream come true sooner or later of an Online Career similar to what has been present for some time in the NBA 2K series, which has now become a yardstick for all sports simulations. Finally, we find the update of the FIFA 15 Match Day component, the beating heart of the integration between simulation and real football: the updates from the main leagues around the world are naturally increasingly accurate, also thanks to the collaboration with the portal Goal.com to bring editorial content into the game itself. The Xbox One version FIFA 15, as connoisseurs of the series will know very well, is the first episode after several years to offer an identical experience between the reference versions (Xbox One and PS4) and the PC one, with the latter therefore finally filling the gap in which she had been forced into in the past. The consequence is that we can therefore speak of the same product for all 3 editions in question, without having to make any more unpleasant distinctions. We also spent a few hours on the Microsoft console to confirm this situation, finding an episode of the EA football series that is undoubtedly very convincing, rocky and satisfying, although not without some shadows. The imbalance between the effectiveness of the offensive phase and the inconsistency of the defensive one has worsened, above all when the attacker does it with fast and technical players: from this point of view, the team will probably have to roll up their sleeves to limit the inevitable frustration that is created in some situations. More generally, however, FIFA 15 is an episode that practically does not distort anything, limiting itself to that work of refinement and optimization which undoubtedly makes sense in the face of the success achieved by the series, but which also risks being interpreted in the light of a certain laziness especially in the face of the extraordinary enthusiasm and desire of the direct rival to recover ground. Even from a purely technical point of view, those who have played FIFA 14 on what is now the current-gen console will not find any revolutions: certainly the expansion of the list of animations and the changes in the proportions of the polygonal models are appreciated , and the proximity to the television experience of ~real~ matches is increasingly tangible, but placing the two products side by side requires a very careful eye to see the differences. Then, also from this point of view, some of the now ~historical~ defects of the series remain, above all the very visible difference in treatment in the reproduction of the most famous athletes compared to the ~secondary actors~, which clashes a bit like - to make a bold comparison - in the distinction between Premium and Standard cars in Gran Turismo. Between a Vidal and a Caceres, just to give an example, there really is an abyss. And even the aforementioned animations, extraordinary in most cases, rarely lend themselves to situations of authentic ~destruction~ that mostly make you smile. FIFA 15 is therefore overall a very solid package, mammoth in content and extraordinarily satisfying in gameplay, but which prefers to confirm itself in its qualities, characteristics and - inevitably - defects rather than seek new paths. If this is what you are looking for, you could hardly find yourself dissatisfied with this new episode. He takes to the field When we talked about the menus at the beginning of the article, we voluntarily left out the part that anticipates entering the game rectangle, radically modified by EA Canada. The list of players' names seen in the latest versions of FIFA leaves room for a preview of their arrangement on the pitch, complete with photos and the possibility of exchanging them with those positioned on the bench. The improvements, however, do not stop at the aesthetic aspect alone: the six different slots at our disposal for saving the team settings allow us to establish as many tactical styles, thus obtaining the possibility of quickly switching from one to another in case of nnecessity, during the match or before facing a specific opponent. The section dedicated to instructions to players on the attitudes to keep on the pitch has also been enhanced, with the introduction of five different tasks to observe, both in the defensive and offensive phase. However, the part in which to establish the style of play of the entire team does not change, using the usual slider system. Once the tactical component is completed, the time finally comes to take the field, to evaluate the changes to the gameplay made by the developers. Let's say right away that even in this case those waiting for radical innovations won't find them, given that the choice was to keep a large part of the already existing game system. Physics dominates FIFA 15, with all that follows from it: the simulation of reality through the reproduction of the laws that govern it permeates all aspects of the game more than ever, from the tackles to the phases that precede and follow them, taking into account a player's balance after a move. The management of the ball follows these indications to the letter, reflecting deflections and rebounds in terms of changes of direction and acquired effect, thus giving rise to new trajectories that make the game more similar to reality. New player animations allow for smoother ball control, with greater use of the outside of the foot and the sole to handle and pass the ball. While retaining the same control system, the tactical defense has been revisited, making it overall less effective: if on the one hand the sliding seems to have acquired a little more weight, on the other hand the standing tackle has been heavily limited . The button that used to be used repeatedly by defenders to work experience with the body and stay glued to the opponent, now acquires a fundamental component linked to timing, given that arriving out of time there is a real risk of giving a lethal advantage to the winger shift, by definition faster than our central; a small step back in favor of a less reasoned game in the attack phase, which probably not everyone will like. You also need to be careful not to use the sprint button too hard, thus ending up on the opponent, given that the referee will tend to whistle a foul, forgiving this attitude less than in the past. As hinted above, the greater weight of physics brings with it joys and sorrows, represented above all by the occurrence of clashes bordering on the grotesque, in which several players, even from the same team, end up going down in a comical way: prevent all of this happening is perhaps impossible, given that it is still a video game, but fortunately the frequency of these events is quite low, even if it must be taken into account. As for the maneuver in general, the impression is that the developers have decided to reduce the space dedicated to reasoning in midfield, to return to favoring speed a little more. The overall pace also seems to have increased in its default setting, but as usual it's adjustable from the menu through the classic three levels. Another exclusive novelty of the latest generation version is related to goalkeepers, for which the developers have declared that they have rewritten entire portions of code: the impression is that in the parts of Vancouver we were inspired by the current greatest exponent of this role, Manuel Neuer, in the figure of a free adjunct rather than a man nailed between the posts, where however he knows how to have his say very well. Thanks to the arrival of the new animations, in some cases it is possible to witness incredible reflections at the last moment, as happens in reality, almost ending up applauding your goalkeeper. But the goalkeeper is not even this time free from defects, especially relating to positioning when the action does not take place in his area: between those who swear they have found a way to always score from 40 meters and those who don't, the impression on the version available to us at the time of closing the article is that goalkeepers actually tend to advance a little too much, letting themselves be surprised from time to time by guessed parables. In the ups and downs of revised elements, dead ball situations also enter: in throw-ins, free kicks and corner kicks it is now possible to control who is destined to receive the ball, while the hitter can instead ask the team to raise the center of gravity ( in goalkeeper kicks) or to adopt one of the predefined patterns (in corner kicks). Continuing the roundup, the high filter finally seems to have less effect, also in this case thanks to the new animations they can enjoy", "date": "2014-09-26", "grade": "8.8"}
