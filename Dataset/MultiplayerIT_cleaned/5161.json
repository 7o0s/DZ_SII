The Deadly Tower of Monsters, downloadable for free this month for PlayStation Plus subscribers, starts out as a work that systematically pierces the fourth wall, presented by the narrative voices (in English, subtitled in Italian) as the extra content of the new edition DVD of an old classic. And so the director produces amusing anecdotes about how the film was shot, about the actors who lent themselves to the various roles and about the technicians who created the stop motion animations of the monsters and dinosaurs with great effort (and very little money). that populate the scene. The incipit is simple: the intrepid astronaut Pippin Starspeed ends up with his spacecraft on a sort of ~planet of the apes~ controlled by an evil dictator, and decides to free its inhabitants by climbing the many levels of a mysterious and very high tower, on top of which is the villain of the moment. Pippin will soon be joined by two other characters: the beautiful and deadly Scarlet Nova and the cold but efficient Robot, her co-pilot. The three share the same set of weapons for close and ranged combat, but each have a specific special ability: Pippin can make fast dashes, Scarlet can run very quickly for a few seconds and Robot slow down time. To switch from one character to another you have to go to certain cabins, usually located near the stations where it is possible to upgrade weapons with the materials collected and change the basic equipment. The Deadly Tower of Monsters offers a very pleasant experience, especially for Plus users Mix and match The humor of the audio commentary immediately appears preponderant compared to everything else, and it is a pity that to understand certain passages it is necessarily necessary to take a look at the Italian subtitles. Of course, a complete localization would have been impossible, so we have to settle for it. However, The Deadly Tower of Monsters experience offers much more: the game mechanics are practically those of a twin stick shooter but the ACE Team title does not disdain melee attacks, despite their slippery implementation. The equipment is upgradeable and adjustable, although finding the most precious materials is complicated and greatly limits the progression in this sense. However, there is no shortage of devastating weapons, such as the rocket launcher or the ~Jewel of Tesla~, a gun that launches powerful electric shocks, as well as clubs, lightsabers and even whips for close combat. Switching from one type of maneuver to another is fortunately simple, given that the balancing of the gameplay is also based on the cooldown of the guns and therefore exposes us to many risks when the numerical superiority of the enemies is overwhelming. However, the lion's share is not played by the combat system, but by the level design, which gives us this mysterious planet to explore far and wide, with some secrets to discover and areas that become accessible only after having unlocked certain skills. On the surface stands the very high tower referred to in the title of the game, to be ~climbed~ using conventional steps but without the backtracking being annoying from a certain point onwards: if it is necessary to return to a lower level, you can then use the teleporter to instantly reach the last captured location. The degree of challenge is not trivial and it will often be necessary to repeat some sections during the final stages of the adventure, which can be completed in about four hours. There is also no shortage of spectacular bosses, in which we will find ourselves facing imitators of King Kong, giant snails, huge octopuses and other gruesome creatures, created by the ever-present mad scientist. The system, which proves to be solid and in many ways interesting, is supported by a fairly well-made graphic, which struggles a bit in terms of frame rate but which at the same time offers funny and original visual solutions, such as the simulation of the stop motion or ~shot errors~ that show microphones, wires or sticks at the edge of the view.", "date": "2016-11-21", "grade": "7.3"}
