Almost nothing was known about the first project, and it seems that Nintendo did not see fit to transform that embryo into a real game. Project Guard was instead more fortunate, since it managed to reach the shelves - albeit only the digital ones - of the eShop in the form of a finished product. The elapsed time, in addition to having obviously strengthened the experience, has also brought with it an association with the Star Fox brand and consequently with the characters and settings of the historic Nintendo series. Renamed precisely Star Fox Guard, the spin-off was included in a special edition of Star Fox Zero, as well as being purchasable individually at the price of  14.99. Star Fox Guard is a small game that is definitely worth a try Metal not metal Star Fox Guard is a tower defense, a very abused genre in recent years especially in the mobile sector; however, this shouldn't be taken as a reason for prejudice against the game, because the much evoked Nintendo Difference is able to give new luster even to a genre that is believed to have nothing relevant to say. The story is that of Grippy, Slippy's uncle, engaged in much more earthly matters than those of his nephew: mining, more precisely. A particularly interesting business, so much so as to appeal even to a mysterious saboteur who has chosen to use robots to penetrate and tamper with the precious structures of the protagonist. In practice, this means picking up the GamePad and widening your eyes, because it is precisely through the controller screen that you can manage the twelve surveillance cameras arranged in the building. On the other hand, on the TV the image, divided into just as many boxes, shows in real time what these cameras are seeing at that moment. The difficulty lies in quickly moving your gaze to each of the different boxes, with the aim of perceiving any movement that might suggest the presence of an invading robot. In this case, with a quick touch on the GamePad on the relative icon, you can take control of that precise electronic eye and above all of the weapon with which it is equipped, in such a way as to bring down the enemy as quickly as possible. Yes, because the intrusion always targets the central nucleus of the structure, and a single blow can immediately lead to game over. Being able to eliminate each robot decrees victory and the subsequent collection of minerals which translate into the growth of one's level: each ~stage~ of the relative bar brings with it new equipment in one's favor, cameras with additional powers or the unlocking of subsequent missions. The robots are then divided into two types: the jammers and the raiders. The latter are the ones that it is essential to eliminate in order not to suffer the game over, but also the former must be kept an eye on since they can put a lot of spokes in the wheels, perhaps releasing a thick smoke or generating interference in one of the monitors. Before the start of a mission it is also possible to change the position of the cameras, even if in most cases we found the default situation effective enough. The hundred total levels, set in different planets, are divided between the main ones and the extra ones: the latter usually offer modified rules, which can concern various aspects such as the reduction of the time available or the availability of a limited number of shots. Despite all these modifiers, the game still remains rather simple to understand, and usually the defeats simply represent an additional incentive to do better in the next game. The excellent management of the level of difficulty, with a curve that rises gently introducing the different elements in a progressive way, therefore makes the overall experience particularly pleasant, albeit inevitably repetitive in the long run. Perhaps something more could have been done in the graphic area: even considering the low budget nature and the distribution via eShop, Star Fox Guard is still an extremely basic game technically, in which the aesthetic part offers nothing more than the simple purpose functional.", "date": "2016-04-23", "grade": "7.8"}
