{"name": "Lords of EverQuest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lords-of-everquest.html", "text": "foundation Comparisons with other titles of the same genre cannot be avoided. Lords of Everquest undoubtedly takes its cue from the most acclaimed fantasy titles such as Warcraft III, offering different factions (three: Shadowrealm, Dawn Brothrhood and Elddar Alliance), each with its own buildings and customized units led by a Lord. The units, like the various pieces of a chessboard, have very distinct abilities such as gathering resources (in LoE it is platinum) or different combat and defense modes. The buildings and units are managed directly by the player through the options present by selecting the Lord. There are also references to role-playing games, which give the strategic part greater importance and a small (very small) wave of novelties. In fact, the Lords and their units can level up by gaining experience, which will lead to a stronger and improved army thanks to the new skills. A Lord can also ~turn~ two units into knights, making them even more powerful as a result. Characteristics As mentioned, the RPG elements make the game much richer and ~thinking~ about the methodology becomes even more important. For example, creating units with a high-level Lord makes the units stronger from the start than those created with a lower-level Lord. For this reason it will be necessary to reflect not only on what type of units to send into the fray, but also how many to send, so that most of them can gain as many experience points as possible (fewer troops means more experience points for each of them). The old Starcraft strategies, of the series ~sending tons of units to cause maximum destruction~, will lead to having units of too low a level over time compared to the enemies that will face each other. At the same time, it will also be necessary to safeguard high-level units as much as possible, so as to avoid sacrificing them for futile attacks and making them become more powerful and useful over time. Lords of Everquest also allows you to take advantage of interesting objects (all ~already seen~ for those who know the Everquest saga) that can be found scattered throughout the maps. They range from scrolls, which allow you to cast spells such as summon creatures or poison or mist, to equipment that you can make the Lord wear, such as enchanted rings. Singleplayer & Multiplayer The single player mode is full of battles and twists, with a well thought out story that accompanies the player throughout the missions. Thanks to the interludes between the missions themselves, in fact, it will be possible to get to know the characters and factions with (or against) which we will play better, thus making everything much more exciting and never waning to find out what will happen ~after~. For those who have experienced Everquest before, many familiar names will be found in the game, making the setting even more immersive. On the one hand we are therefore faced with an excellent single-player product. But good news never comes alone. The multiplayer mode is the trump card of Lords of Everquest. The game is sold with numerous maps exclusively dedicated to multiplayer mode. There is no shortage of one-on-one maps, which require perfect knowledge of the units in order to guarantee an invincible attack and unbreakable defense and also perfect knowledge of the timing of the game, to evaluate with the utmost attention when to launch an attack or when to expect a enemy invasion. The game supports up to 12 players at the same time, and you can choose whether to join alliances or throw yourself into a highly spectacular free-for-all. Unlike the MMORPG, however, thanks to the soegames.net servers it is possible to play on the Internet against other players for free. Technique The graphics of the game are average of other products in the category. The view is the classic perspective with the ability to rotate the shot and zoom in and out. The settings are varied and range from snowy to desert, from the depths of the earth to ruined cities. There is no shortage of special graphic effects given above all by the use of magic as well as environmental effects such as waterfalls or fires. As previously mentioned, the interlude animations were created with the game's graphics engine, which allows you to show scenes with a good impact, although the expressions of the characters remain fixed and the movements are very awkward. Above average sound and dynamic musicaccompanying ica that really involve to the maximum, accompanying the player in the continuation of the missions. When danger approaches, it will happen to feel panic that increases when hearing sinister noises coming from parts of the map that may not be framed at that moment. Final comment Lords of Everquest looks good in front of the most famous real-time strategy titles. Virtually flawless, it offers an addictive single-player mode and a very long-lasting multiplayer. Yet the accounts don't quite add up. If for Everquest fans it is a must-try to feel involved in the saga in an ~alternative~ way, and if for RTS fans it is another excellent title to try without fear, here it is for those looking for their first or the best fantasy strategy the choice becomes difficult. Better a brand new title like Lords of Everquest or indisputable successes of the past like Warcraft III, Age of Mythology and their expansions? Perhaps this is the real problem: Lords of Everquest is an excellent game, but in the end it suffers the weight of the comparison with the past, coming out in second place. The translation of the texts and menus into Italian is a point in favor of the title, which stops at the threshold of a very decent 7/10. Pros: Long-lasting single player campaign and addictive multiplayer Excellent immersion in the setting Localized in Italian Cons: Virtually everything ~seen and already played~ Introduction There is no doubt that Sony Online Entertainment ~enjoys~ in taking full advantage of the enormous success that the ~Everquest~ name alone brings with it. Nor should we forget the highly positive impact aroused by his timeless ~massively multiplayer online RPG~, open to all four years ago and which has grown from a simple subscription game to a real boom with hundreds of thousands of players (regularly paying ), who regularly log into the virtual fantasy realm of Norrath to role-play and chat with other players from around the world. Up to that point, Sony Online Entertainment has been busy with the Everquest RPG universe by proposing expansions for its already mentioned acclaimed MMORPG, as well as a couple of RPG titles for PlayStation 2. Let's not forget also the future projects, which foresee outlets in other genres such as Champions of Norrath, an action RPG released in the first half of 2004 again for PlayStation 2. Lords of Everquest, the title we are going to review, still remains the most important attempt to break away from the classic canons of role-playing games, proposing a strategic set in the lands of Norrath, in which lands and possessions will be the foundation of an intriguing storyline and an increasingly complex strategy that will evolve over the course of history and combat.", "date": "2004-02-23", "grade": null}
