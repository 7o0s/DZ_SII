Released in 2006, the game very effectively showed what the Microsoft console was capable of in terms of polygon count and frame rate stability, and at the same time boasted an absolutely unprecedented attention to detail. The protagonist, Frank West, could in fact visit any of the many shops in the Willamette shopping mall to find objects of all kinds inside, reproduced in great detail (even the boxes of cereals in the supermarket...) and usable as more or less effective weapons to oppose the boundless horde of zombies that had invaded the structure. ~What do you say, grandfather? Do you have any money?~ Dead Rising also offered numerous cutscenes characterized by convincing animations, an exciting plot (albeit clearly inspired by the filmic work of John Romero, who in Capcom must have a lot of fans), with the ~sick~ aspects typical of the great cinema classics horror, and a single player campaign full of surprises, twists, alternate endings and different weapons to slaughter the undead. Contrasted with these great qualities, however, the title also highlighted some annoying defects: the cumbersomeness of the controls, a very unfriendly rescue system and above all a structure that forced us to choose which survivors to bring to safety, with the obligation, however, to bear their slowness while we ordered him to follow us within the same locations, again and again, pursuing rewards (in terms of experience points and, therefore, character enhancement) which then turned out to be less satisfactory than one might expect. ~Beccateve 'sti change.~ The most perplexing thing about the sequel, Dead Rising 2, released a good four years later, is that rather than developing the formula of the original game, it limited itself to aping its characteristic features, polishing a few edges here and there (a better AI for survivors, for example, able to defend themselves better during the crossing) but without giving the players what they really expected, that is the substantial revision of a structure that already in 2006 showed all its limits. Fear and Loathing in Fortune City The creation of Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, which arrived in stores in retail format at an almost budget price, is a sort of ~disconfession~ in narrative terms with respect to the work carried out for the second episode of the series by the former Blue Castle Games ( now Capcom Vancouver). As much as Chuck Greene was moved by noble intentions, in fact, fans hadn't forgotten Frank Castle and the intriguing possibility of taking pictures within the game to get extra experience points. Both elements have therefore been recovered: Frank aims for redemption after having miserably burned the success obtained with the reportage of the events of Willamette, which had transformed him into a real hero in the eyes of the public, and his faithful camera allows him to immortalize zombies, survivors and spectacular situations to compose the puzzles of the story that takes place against the backdrop of Fortune City. The problem is that once again the game offers mediocre rewards for our efforts: the best photo we will ever be able to take will not result in the acquisition of a disproportionate amount of points, which makes the practice of taking out the reflex during fights more bloody absolutely superfluous and avoidable. But let's go back to the plot and setting, which are exactly the same as Dead Rising 2. During a Capcom event in Tokyo, some producers had assured us that the single player campaign of Dead Rising 2: Off the Record resumed the setting of the second episode but offered a completely new story, bosses included, but this claim to the test of the facts turned out to be a nice lie. The differences from the story starring Chuck Greene are indeed so subtle as to offer practically no new ideas to those who have already crossed the streets of downtown Fortune City chased by zombies: Frank finds himself facing the same situations with the same supporting actors and the same background. He is the one who needs an injection of Zombrex every twenty-four hours and there are therefore few new features that characterize this reinterpretation: a few more weapons, the Uranus Zone theme park with its rides and a different positioning of the undead, now much more numerous in some areas. Ah, and then there's Sandbox Mode... Go West In fact the most substantial novelty of Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, the Sandbox Mode allows us to utiuse the same save slot of our ~normal~ game to face the pitfalls of Fortune City from a different perspective: free from the constraints of the omnipresent timer and therefore also from the obligation of having to reach (very slowly, moving in the ~mud~ represented by the multitude of zombies present, who occasionally inevitably hurt us) the opposite end of the map to start a new mission, we will be able to go wherever we want, visit the thousand attractions of the city and earn experience points that will improve the skills of our character, shared with the standard single player mode and therefore also upgradeable using this trick. Poor Chuck! At first we thought that the developers wanted to test the game dynamics in the field by depriving them of the timer, to understand if for a possible third episode it was possible to opt for a more traditional solution, without distorting the franchise too much, but in practice also the Sandbox Mode proved to be inconsistent, incending on the mere killing of a progressively higher number of zombies in order to access the missions (which often also involve the same objective). The presence of cooperative online multiplayer, the same seen in the original version of Dead Rising 2, unfortunately does not add anything new to the experience. From a technical point of view, the PC version we tested offers a good degree of scalability but does not stand out for the lightness of the engine, which loaded with effects for the improvement of surfaces and antialiasing often shows the side of significant drops in the frame rate when the zombies are particularly numerous on the screen. Apparently the console versions of the game also suffer from the same problem, i.e. the amount of undead in certain areas has been modified and the interesting location of the amusement park has been added without however ensuring that this does not have an impact negative on frame rate. In our specific case, we have passed with relative frequency from 60 fps of calm situations to 20 fps of the most problematic ones. Nothing to say about the sound: music and effects are unchanged, while the new dialogues in English (subtitled in Italian) boast the same quality as always.", "date": "2011-10-17", "grade": "7.5"}
