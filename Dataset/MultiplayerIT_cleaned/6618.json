{"name": "Saints Row 4: Re-Elected", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143716-saints-row-iv-re-elected-il-re-dellinferno.html", "text": "We tested Gat out of Hell in the PlayStation 4 version, present in the version of Saints Row 4: Re-Elected, which costs 44.90 and also includes all the DLC released for the fourth chapter. The Re-Elected offer is also present on Xbox One and PC, and starting from the latter it has been faithfully brought to the new consoles, updating the technical sector and obviously adding all the streaming features. On older generation consoles Gat out of Hell is instead available individually, at a cost of 17.90.Available as a stand alone expansion within the Re-Elected version of Saints Row IV (for completeness here is the original review of the PC version), this Gat Out of Hell takes us directly to hell, in the city of New Hades, playing the role of Johnny Gat (or Kenzie Kensington) in a desperate attempt to stop the interspecies marriage of the century, namely the one between the President of the United States and his daughter Satan's teenager. In fact, who better than the Saint who sits in the White House, an expert in massacres and carnage, can marry the daughter of the Evil One? In short, the head of the Saints is really a good catch, but not such as to end up in Hell due to his excellent references in applied destruction. The Saints go to Hell to mess: will it be worth it? Playstation 4 trophies Gat out of Hell rewards the player with 46 trophies. The easier ones to obtain are simply earned with progression, while to obtain the more complex ones, both bronze and silver, the player is asked to create situations that are often decidedly complicated, but also intrinsically fun. In short, Gat out of Hell must be gutted properly (even by impersonating Kinzie for a couple of hours minimum) to ~platinum~ it. Poor devil... The circus set up by Volition is simple, with almost no particular story to complicate the raids for the small town. Obviously there is no shortage of ~twists~ but as the game immediately makes clear, the final mission will only be available when the bar of Satan's fury is at its maximum, that is, when we have made the term caciarone very clear to the King of the Underworld. How? Simple, completing tasks, missions and challenges. In short, everything is as per the textbook, and it goes without saying that by carrying on the conquest of the city we will earn money and experience, without forgetting the collection of blue spheres (here called clusters) which give us the possibility, once a certain amount has been collected, to enhance our special powers. The powers are a direct emanation of those seen in Saints Row IV. In addition to the super run and the jump with glide thanks to a pair of wings, we find the ~super kick~ with a generous area impact, the blow that turns enemies into stone, the possibility of summoning imps and setting enemies on fire simply by passing by them . Offensive powers are ~acquired~ by immediately completing missions for likeable supporting actors, for example people of the caliber of Blackbeard, Count Vlad and Shakespeare, and as they are strengthened they steal the scene from firearms. But not the bazooka. The reason is soon clear: in addition to being far too powerful, they are much more fun to use given the prehistoric combat system (without covers) and the artificial intelligence, which as usual has not been received. Be it that of enemies, on foot or by car, or that of ~civilians~. The concept of firing behind cover does not exist (and this may not be a problem per se given the open spaces) and it is not uncommon to see entire platoons of enemies blocking themselves behind an obstacle. In this sense, a shot from an area is enough, perhaps from a bazooka, and the game is done. Ancient problems, which we had already recognized with the third and fourth chapters, and never resolved and which are even more annoying here given that everything is more concentrated and ~restricted~. Consequently, the setting that pushes us to accumulate things to do to grow and to get to the final mission certainly does not help Gat out Hell. The city is small, and as much as the developers have tried to differentiate the various areas, it is still all the same, and in the end a simple, decidedly bare papier-mch backdrop where you can fly or run at breakneck speed. As always, there are many activities to do, ranging from the usual insurance scam to survival challenges, passing through the timed flight, the conquest of the plants, the destruction of the city and more, but in the long run, everything is all too repetitive and not very fun given what was written above. The altars and the conquest of teleporters seem to make up for this criticality but it is only a drop in a sea of repetitive mediocrity, tasks for the loyalty of the supporting actors included. Furthermore, the typical madness of prhe previous adventures of the Saints is less marked here. Not that the tone is serious, far from it!, but there is little laughter and even the proverbial coarse-grained incorrect humor is not very incisive here. At one point the narration with simple cutscenes gives way to the musical, but it is very little and does not go beyond a simple smile. Sin. On a technical level, Gat out of Hell despite the 1080p and a granite frame rate denounces all its ~ancient~ being. And ~ancient~ it was already at the time of the third, if not even fourth chapter, even on a properly pumped PC. The effects linked to the explosions are the only component (almost) in step with the times, otherwise the whole thing is really inconspicuous, not exactly a good show. Finally, how much time did it take us to complete this expansion? Four hours and twenty-two minutes, with a 54% completion rate. Consequently, those who want to ~beat~ the game one hundred percent can easily add about another two - three hours of devastation in New Hades.", "date": "2015-01-19", "grade": "6.0"}
