Even before writing this review, while we were playing Nippon Marathon we couldn't help but remember the broadcast signed by Gialappa's Band in the late 80s, in which the funny protagonists of the Japanese TV show Takeshi's Castle were made fun of. After years of laughing at what we saw on television, the title developed by Onion Soup Interactive finally makes the dream we've always kept in the drawer come true: the possibility of living ~first-hand~ the mystical experience of running in role of a man dressed as a lobster, or in those of the other funny protagonists of Nippon Marathon. Also considering the period, the recent arrival of this title presents it at least on paper as a perfect party game to spend a few fun evenings during these Christmas holidays. We just have to find out if that's really the case. Methods: better in company Before getting to the time to run, Nippon Marathon offers us several solutions to face its crazy trials. The first of these is the Story mode, where each of the protagonists tells us their own way to redemption, accomplished through their deeds in the most important marathon ever. The style of the entire game is linked to a typically Japanese sense of humor: thus we find the aforementioned guy dressed as a lobster, intent on redeeming himself after years and years spent raising shellfish, a kind of man-dog, an old man who hears a teenager dressing like one, and so on. The stories unfold with a story that incorporates the dynamics of visual novels, thus giving space to long dialogues. Although from the latter emerges a certain work done by Onion Soup to give a minimum of depth to his work, for themes and type of comedy Nippon Marathon is not always easy for us Westerners to understand. The chances of liking this game are therefore linked to one's level of affinity with Japan, above all for the way of making humor with Engrish verses and various memes. Still with regard to the story mode, you have to be ready to wait a long time between one race and another, given that in some cases things end up going a little too long: sometimes even inexplicably, with the characters standing still without saying Nothing. The other modes of Nippon Marathon include the one called Versus, in which you can jump straight into a marathon with your friends, and two mini-games. The first is called L.O.B.S.T.E.R., and puts players in front of a random path in which whoever gets furthest wins, while the second is called Go-Go Trolley and is a kind of bowling played with shopping carts in which you can jump with your own character. In light of everything, Nippon Marathon is a game that winks at local multiplayer, thus directing the player towards games with friends on the sofa. The characters controlled by the CPU are in fact often too tough to beat in the various tests, and for this reason it is much more stimulating to deal with human beings on an equal footing. Playstation 4 trophies Nippon Marathon has a total of thirteen Trophies, among which none of the Bronze type appear. The usual Platinum, obtainable after having conquered all the other Trophies, is in fact accompanied by ten of the Gold type and two of Silver. Bringing them to your virtual bulletin board is relatively easy compared to other titles, provided you patiently dedicate yourself to all the modes offered by Nippon Marathon, for example covering two hundred meters in L.O.B.S.T.E.R. or making three consecutive strikes in the Go-Go Trolley. Gameplay and graphics: a stationary race If in terms of Nippon Marathon mode all in all it can have its say, once the game has started all the limits of the Onion Soup Interactive creature emerge. We do not deny that in the first races played the game knows how to entertain with a certain conviction, which however after the first hour spent racing reveals the side to what are the problems of the product. Starting from the gameplay, in addition to the direction, the player can also give his character the order to crouch, jump or dive, in the latter case to cover a greater distance in flight. Shots that are sometimes not very happy and fluctuating speed of response to the commands mean that everything comes out in a somewhat random way, therefore making it very difficult to guess the right timing of the actions: if in the early stages this can undoubtedly have amusing effects, later it risks to make too nervous those who have the ccontroller in hand. The concept behind the game is similar to that seen in other racing games: those who fall too far behind are eliminated from the current round, then being able to re-enter the next one to get back to scoring points. During the race it is possible to collect objects that can become a bonus on one's speed, or weapons to use against others to generate unpredictable situations. The obstacles that Nippon Marathon puts in front of us are of a different nature: from fruit carts to men carrying fish or glass, up to the hateful Shiba dogs who, with their constant throwing us on the ground, made us reconsider our position towards friends at four paws. Still with regard to the gameplay, the direction to take to continue the race is sometimes unclear, thus generating further confusion in the players. It's not worth dwelling too much on the technical sector of Nippon Marathon, as it looks like a game from at least ten years ago: the quality of the textures, in particular, seems to be what it was at the time of PlayStation 2. The soundtrack obviously resumes the setting that we have described previously, counting in the audio sector also the presence of a commentator intended to point out the most bizarre events that take place during the race. While the few spoken expressions have remained in Japanese, subtitles are available in English.", "date": "2018-12-27", "grade": "5.0"}
