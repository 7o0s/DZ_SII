{"name": "Unpacking", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unpacking-recensione.html", "text": "In recent years, video games have followed one another whose common thread was the desire to offer a relaxing experience, which would allow one to completely detach the brain from the daily problems of the single player; fascinating experiences capable of capturing both audiovisual and playful. The most recent proposal of this macro-category is represented by Unpacking, a light and meditative title developed by the small Witch Beam team. Among boxes and recurring objects, we unpack a life-long story in this Unpacking review. A narrative through objects Unpacking: The narrative follows a girl's moves from childhood to adulthood Unpacking takes players to grapple with the life of a girl, from her childhood to building her own family unit, all through the pivotal moments of her existence, represented by moves to new locations and homes. The charm of Unpacking lies precisely in discovering the vicissitudes that have seen our semi-alter ego as the protagonist (given that the interaction does not coincide directly with the physicality of the character) through the objects that we find ourselves unpacking every time: a chipped cup, a new souvenir, photos to attach to the bulletin board or on the fridge, new and old game consoles, with all the titles that follow. Let's get to know the stylistic, artistic and cultural tastes of the young woman through the elements that are added as hand or who resort to every move. The objects thus become the mirror of the protagonist's personality, which are then mixed with those of the new faces who join her growth path. The duration of this adventure coincides with how precise and meticulous we decide to be during our game, but, ultimately, the entire narrative arc takes no more than five hours of gameplay. A result that is still quite satisfactory for a title like this, in constant danger of being either too hasty or excessively drawn out by the hair. One of the qualities of Unpacking certainly includes the awareness of understanding when to stop. Tidy gameplay Unpacking: tidying up is the key to the game The goal of the Unpacking player is to tidy up their home after a move. Depending on the period of the protagonist's life, we will find ourselves exploring different spaces, some larger, others more contained, others still shared. One package at a time, the game gives us carte blanche to put the objects in order. Or, at least, so it seems. Indeed, Unpacking is a very focused title with respect to the positioning of objects, which cannot be left in any place (for example, a game console must necessarily be inside the TV cabinet, or dishes cannot be left on the counter of the kitchen). Until you have placed every single object in a suitable place, you cannot proceed to the next level. This tends to highlight the puzzle dynamics of the game more, with millimeter and often forced joints, than those of a ~zen~ title that leaves the player full freedom. We don't think it's necessarily a fault, but it's certainly a missed opportunity in terms of replayability (although at the end of the adventure modes are unlocked that allow the player to manage the scene as he sees fit, but with the sole purpose of sharing the social own work). Unpacking: Completing in-game achievements rewards stickers for use in photo mode There is also a sort of progression through objectives, which can be unlocked by performing certain actions within the game, such as completing a level or placing objects in a certain way or place. These goals reward with stickers, which you can use to beautify your image in the dedicated ~photo mode~. Technical compartment Unpacking: technically it's not revolutionary, but it's still an excellent exercise in style If you're looking for audiovisual freshness, Unpacking may not be the title for you. In fact, on a graphic level we are faced with the usual, overused pixel art with an isometric view that made the fortune of the gaming industry, both in its early years and during the nostalgic research of recent times. Be careful, though: the fact that it is not original does not mean that it is not well done, on the contrary. The only flaw that we feel we can attribute to the technical sector is precisely the lack of refinement. For the rest, it remains an excellent exercise in style. Also at the audio level we are in the same boat, that is a very pleasant 8-bit musical commentary (with a song for each quagame dro) and a truly overwhelming amount of sound effects (practically every object present has dedicated sounds depending on the surfaces with which it interacts or the way we move it).", "date": "2021-11-12", "grade": "8.5"}
