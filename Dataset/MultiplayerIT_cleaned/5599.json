At first the basic elements were simply applied to different contexts and scenarios but lately there has been a remarkable evolution which has led to the progressive introduction of game mechanics that are quite different from the original structure. High Sea Saga represents this latest trend of Kairosoft well, inserting the classic management mechanics in the broader and more multifaceted context of an RPG and expanding everything thanks to a good dose of exploration and the possibility of managing various aspects simultaneously. The story sees us playing the role of a sort of mercenary captain in the service of a king, with the triple purpose of fighting external threats, discovering new lands and contributing to the growth and expansion of the kingdom, all while sailing around and commanding a group of adventurers to be applied in various tasks. The micro-management aspects are divided here into a greater number of specializations, practically filling every second of the game with things to do and eliminating downtime, an aspect increased by the possibility of multitasking by carrying out various actions simultaneously. As seen so far, High Sea Saga is perhaps the most advanced Kairosoft title from this point of view, even if as a result it lacks the compactness and ease of use that characterize the team's previous experiences. The hard life of the pirate, explorer, builder and manager according to Kairosoft Captain handyman The management of the team is similar to that of the other titles in the ~series~, with the possibility of hiring a progressive amount of characters (the slots increase as the experience level and the places available on the ship increase) and specialize them in various functions ship care and combat. Each individual has a specific affinity for some particular role, from fighter to sailor to merchant to cook, and obviously the best way to harness these skills is to apply them in their specific field, which also unlocks the ability to build new structures inside the ship. However, each character receives evolutions based on the actions performed or by using the boosts that are collected with the treasures around the quests, so there are really many parameters to keep an eye on. The ~city builder~ element concerns both the ship and the base village, with the possibility of perfecting one's own boat by inserting new berths and specific areas to be dedicated to various actions and at the same time also trying to expand and enrich the starting village with shops and buildings with various functions. In addition to all this we then find ourselves completing various quests, which usually concern the exploration of new lands and the fight against various enemies, with the latter taking place automatically but with results obviously linked to the parameters of the team sent to bring completed the mission. The fact that the quests go on independently, occupying a small portion of the screen, allows us to deal with various other commitments at the same time, thus always keeping us focused on several fronts. Unlike many other Kairosoft titles, High Sea Saga is presented as pure free-to-play, downloadable for free but with microtransactions, linked to the possibility of playing by removing the ads (always present but to tell the truth not too annoying, remaining limited in one small portion of the screen) with a purchase of 3.99 euros which also unlocks full screen mode and the possibility of recharging the inevitable energy bar faster which affects the amount of possible actions and any success in the quests, but it must be said that this is also recharged by advancing through levels and in general, at least for normal game rhythms, it does not represent a major obstacle to use.", "date": "2016-04-06", "grade": "7.0"}
