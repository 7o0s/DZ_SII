{"name": "Trauma Center: Under the Knife", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trauma-center-under-the-knife.html", "text": "A life as a surgeon We will take on the role  pardon, the white coat  of a new surgeon with good looks and good prospects, a certain Derek Stiles. Initially undisciplined and with a few too many negligence, our doctor soon discovers the hard life of the path he has undertaken, as well as attracting the attention of the various primaries to himself for a special and at the same time uncontrollable power. Called healing touch (healing touch), this special gift floods our Derek with inhuman concentration and speed, only to physically destroy our protagonist. Here therefore begins a surprisingly articulated and well thought-out narrative plot, which will see the handsome doctor grappling with the gestation of his power in the first place, and which will lead him, in parallel with the increase in his skills, to work for increasingly illustrious hospitals and even to combat medical terrorism. Our apprenticeship begins with rather simple interventions and perpetually supervised by capable nurses, who in addition to supervising our actions also have the burden of describing every single usable tool present in the operating room. The first interventions put the player in front of glass fragments to extract, small sutures to perform and some tumors that are easy to resolve. Such a tutorial soon becomes essential given the peremptory surge that the level of challenge undergoes. Trauma Center: Under the Knife proves to be an atypical, difficult puzzle game right from the start, and, why not, with many facets. On the one hand there is all the involvement dictated by a solid and well-finished plot, on the other it slams against the wall of increasingly complex challenges that require excruciating efforts both on the part of the protagonist and the player. In fact, the Atlus title lacks, even if only in part, in balancing the level of difficulty, capable of giving the 'game-surgeons' moments of real frustration. What in jargon is called a learning curve turns out to be anything but smooth, and some acute difficulties proposed in not too advanced internships can really discourage the less tenacious. On the one hand there is all the involvement dictated by a solid and well-finished plot, on the other it slams against the wall of increasingly complex challenges that require excruciating efforts both on the part of the protagonist and the player. Nib in hand, Trauma Center: Under the Knife puts the player in the multifaceted situation of being able to take advantage of numerous tools to operate on their patients. Enclosed in square icons on the side edges of the touch screen, the 'tools' of the trade are reduced to a number of 10, and range from the canonical scalpel to the syringe, passing through the more sophisticated laser up to the suture kit. Normally you have to proceed methodically, first disinfecting the area to be opened, then making a precise cut with the scalpel. A suture, for example, which is performed with the nib in a zigzag pattern along the entire wound, will be better evaluated if the ends of the wound coincide with the start and finish of the stitch, which will in any case have to make use of not too many doodles. At this point the severed area is enlarged and brought to the attention of the player who, thanks also to the precious advice of the assisting nurse, will have to move with speed and precision, as well as following well-defined procedures. It is vitally important to keep the patient's heartbeat under control, intervening with injections to increase the pulse and, in some cases, also resorting to cardiac massage. Everything must take place with the utmost precision and speed, and so here come some welcome aids that the benevolent coders make available to budding surgeons. As mentioned, we will be able to zoom in certain points, narrowing or enlarging the view so that we can always clearly see the focal areas on which to intervene. A small unclosed circle, and each time the view will be modified. As regards the aforementioned healing touch, however, it is necessary to carry out a star with the stylus in order to be able to slow down the game speed, and thus have more time to perform the countless actions. Logically, this peculiar ability has a limited time and affects the judgment that, at the end of each intervention, will be given to our work. In fact, we will be evaluated on the basis of the time taken to complete each intervention, where particular relevance is obtained by the quality of each of the actions performed. A suture, for example, which is performed with the nib in a zigzag pattern along the entire wound, will be better evaluated if the ends of the wound coincide with the start and finish of the stitch, which will in any case have to make use of not too many doodles. All this in the endand to warm up the only mode present in addition to a rather short main game, the challenge. Here you play any unlocked level to the bitter end, without too many dialogues and suggestions, just a challenge against yourself and your abilities. From the technical side Trauma Center: Under the Knife divides, just like the two screens of the Nintendo console divide, the artistic side from the practical one. On the upper screen we will be able to follow every remnant of the plot, with characters drawn to perfection and in perfect anime style. The touch screen, on the other hand, has the dirty work of combining essentiality and clarity with a targeted look that hits the mark. Pressing music belonging to the anxiolytic-dramatic school, manage to arouse perennial tension, as if there were a need The quintessential DS game, that's what this Atlus title aims to be. It is difficult to deny the uniqueness of the gameplay offered in Trauma Center, which repeatedly succeeds in the majestic work of entertaining and exciting. Strengthened by the innovation it brings and the total exploitation of the tactile potential of the Nintendo laptop, this game hits almost all the objectives it sets. Just a shame for a level of difficulty that is not always balanced and a rather low general longevity of the main game, also little helped by the almost non-existent unlockable bonuses. Recommended for all those who love novelties and innovations, all aspiring Clooneys and thirsty for real challenges. Pros: Fresh and innovative. Well thought out plot. Well-made technical compartment. Cons: Sometimes frustrating. Short main game. Almost no bonuses to unlock. Dreaming never hurt anyone, come on. It's hard not to see yourself there, in the middle of the department, with a confident air, a white coat and a forelock typical of those who advertise anti-dandruff products. Shall we also include a team of breathtaking nurses? It doesn't cost anything anyway. At least now we will be able to facilitate our 'surgery dreams' thanks to the pleasant, as well as awaited, arrival of the themed game crashed on a DS as young as it is overflowing with well-chosen titles. The touch screen effect has enlightened the software houses like few other concepts, and the results have been seen in this first year of life of the double screen from Nintendo. Atlus has done its part, bringing a fascinating concept such as surgery within reach with its Trauma Center: Under the Knife.
