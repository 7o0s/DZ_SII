Thanks to the introduction of the first person view and an approach often tending towards passive survival horror, i.e. those in which the protagonist is a normal person who reacts to the horror by fleeing and hiding instead of fighting, the Osaka house has been able to renew a series that hasn't been able to express anything new on the narrative front for a long time. If you've completed Resident Evil Village (warning: if you haven't done it, better not read on) you'll know how Ethan's story ends. After the end credits, however, we witness an ending set several years after those events, with Rose now a teenager: at that moment we discover that the girl has special powers and that Chris Redfield sometimes makes use of her help for some missions . Well, how did we get to this point? We tell you about it in the review of Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, the awaited expansion of Capcom's survival horror included in the Winters' Expansion package together with the third-person view for the base game and the new characters for the Mercenaries mode. Story: I don't want to be a monster Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, the protagonist holds the gun Rose Winters is endowed with special powers, we said: she obtained them during her stay in the Village due to the ~ritual~ to which Miranda subjected her, but they did not improve her life, on the contrary. Outcast by her classmates due to the visual manifestations of these abilities, which turn her skin into white patches, the girl finds herself alone and desperately looking for a way to get rid of what she believes is a curse. Well, it seems that a solution exists: a man explains to Rose that by using his powers near a sample of megamycete he can access a sort of dreamlike dimension based on the consciousness of people linked to the mysterious mold and find out where there is a crystal capable of absorbing the substances present in her body, making her a normal girl. Setting: Return to the Village Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, combat between the halls of the castle Having come into contact with the fragment, Rose finds herself projected into a world built on the basis of Miranda's memories ... and beyond. There are mainly two settings that we will be able to visit in the Shadows of Rose expansion, namely Castello Dimitrescu and Casa Beneviento, with a short excursion through the streets of the Village: a choice that is anything but random, if we consider that these are the most fascinating and inspired by the last episode of Resident Evil. Sure, there are no new scenarios and it's a bit boring; but it is a lack that is narratively justified (the places of the adventure can only be those actually visited by certain characters) and which in the end does not detract from the value of this DLC, especially considering the accessible price of the Winters' Expansion and the 'inclusion of a couple of extra content in addition to the Shadows or Rose campaign. In the world reconstructed by the megamycete, the Duke presents himself as a mocking and cruel enemy rather than a neutral and even benevolent figure: with his face covered by a mask, the corpulent merchant will try in every way to kill Rose (and her numerous ~shadows~ ) unleashing the power of the megamycete and summoning aberrant creatures, born from the reddish slime that covers a large part of the scenario. The latter arises in the early stages of the story as an insurmountable obstacle, but the appearance of a sort of guardian angel will allow the protagonist to use your powers to turn sewage into ashes and open your way to new areas, as well as solve some of the environmental puzzles that enrich the expansion's short campaign, the duration of which settles on three hours. Gameplay: Third person again Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, the protagonist explores the dungeons Taking advantage of the new option that allows you to replay Resident Evil Village using a third person view instead of the first one, Shadows of Rose immediately adopts this solution, traditional for the Capcom series, although some technical details (see the fact that the doors open by pushing them, without a specific animation of the hand turning the handle) leave a little to be desired. The movement of the character resumes in some ways the typical canons of the brand and its woodiness, referring however to the dynamism of the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3. The ~presence~ gradually provides Rose with different weapons to be able todefend against enemies (pistol, shotgun, grenades), as well as substances that amplify the girl's powers and add to her repertoire a sort of ~stasis~ a la Dead Space with which to slow down the movement of opponents before riddled with shots in the most sensitive areas . Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, on the trail of Casa Beneviento The mix of escape, combat and puzzles works well, albeit from the point of view of a rather short experience, but the developers have also taken the whim of experimenting with new mechanics in the section set in Casa Beneviento, which starts by mimicking what happened in Ethan in the Resident Evil Village campaign (including some successful jumpscare) to then propose exciting stealth sequences within a nightmare made up of killer dolls and disturbing mannequins. There are also some interesting boss fights: some traditional and more demanding, others original but a bit inconsistent; including a well-constructed final battle also on a narrative level, which opens the door to what in theory should be the definitive conclusion of the Winters family's adventures. The other contents of the Winters' Expansion Resident Evil Village, Ethan in third person view As mentioned, the Winters' Expansion package does not only include the Shadows of Rose expansion, but also the unprecedented option to use the third-person view in the Resident Evil Village campaign (in all gameplay phases, while the interlude sequences necessarily return to the first person) and some new characters for the Expendables mode, including the powerful and ruthless Alcina Dimitrescu. Technical Realization: Teenage Nightmares Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, Rose has found a valuable item Having the ability to start from already very solid foundations, that is, those that constitute the technical and artistic foundations of Resident Evil Village, Shadows of Rose doesn't even have to make too much effort to deliver us a visually solid and well-made experience. The cutscenes are excellent and the model of the protagonist is really well done, thanks to the sophisticated technologies put in place by Capcom for some years. Returning to the halls of the Dimitrescu Castle and the corridors of Casa Beneviento, as mentioned with a brief parenthesis in the Village, can only make to please the many players who appreciated the latest chapter of the franchise, but who nevertheless will inevitably notice the lack of unpublished scenarios: a justified choice on a narrative level, we have already explained it, but the data remains. Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, the new version of the Duke On PS5, the graphics of the expansion run smoothly at 60 fps, without particular uncertainties being noticed, and the level of detail always remains very high. The design of the creatures that emerge from the slime clearly cannot boast the character of the gothic monsters of the base game, but from this point of view the sections with dolls and mannequins make a big comeback. Finally, as regards the audio sector, the soundtrack succeeds to accompany the action on the screen very effectively, adding depth and involvement to the various sequences. The dubbing in Italian is excellent, with a great Riccardo Peroni who enjoys once again playing the role of the villain, and a capital performance also by Valentina Pallavicino.", "date": "2022-10-24", "grade": "8.0"}
