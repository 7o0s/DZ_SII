The holy war is over and battle is no longer necessary, even forbidden, how can we appease the warrior spirit that roars within us? Let's find out in the review of The Procession to Calvary, a graphic adventure that stands perfectly in the balance between a masterpiece and heresy. Joe Richardson is the brilliant mind who created a kind of genre in its own right: like the previous Four Last Things, this too is a rather peculiar graphic adventure, all based on Renaissance-era paintings but partially modified, decomposed and repositioned, as well as being animated with hilarious effects to say the least. The result is an irreverent revision of characters, settings and historical events carried out through the systematic ridiculing of great masterpieces of Renaissance art: the works of Michelangelo, Bosch, Rubens, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Velazquez, Canaletto and others are used as scenery and distorted in the most ridiculous way possible, stuff to make critics and art historians pale but to make many others laugh. There is a premise to be made: for The Procession to Calvary to work properly it is necessary to be a little tuned in to the particular humor that animates it. To understand each other, it is a game that seems to come straight from the mind of Monty Python, it is not for nothing that ~Pythonesque~ is precisely the definition that Richardson himself uses to describe it and if you have seen the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail you can get an idea how it all works. The result is a bit like a reinterpretation of a chivalrous story set directly inside the paintings of the Great Renaissance Masters, however written under the heavy influence of opiates. Like all great stories, the initial premise is quite simple (and remains so even later, in fact): the protagonist is a knight who during a mysterious ~holy war~ got carried away a little too much and can't more to contain his irresistible killer instinct after the end of hostilities. Since the kingdom is now at peace and gratuitous violence is no longer welcome, the only solution to let off steam is to eliminate the evil Heavenly Peter, head of the opposing faction, which reigns in the southern territories. The picaresque journey necessary to reach the enemy is dotted with strange characters, crazy situations, absurd dialogues and puzzles to solve, in what can be defined as a classic point and click but which has very little normality. A story of swashbuckling and madness The action takes place within screens composed of modified versions of famous Renaissance paintings, thus illustrating the journey of the protagonist to reach Heavenly Peter. Control, in typical point-and-click style, takes place through a simple interface that allows you to look, talk and interact with characters and elements of the scenery, almost always with hilarious results. With a simple drag it is possible to use the objects of the inventory and then there is a further variant to be dosed sparingly: by drawing the sword it is possible to give rise to different and often decidedly heinous interactions, which can cause important consequences in the continuation of the game. history. The protagonist always tends to solve problems by cutting off heads, but these solutions can lead to changes in the surrounding world that eventually lead to different endings, so it is necessary to carry out various runs to discover all the ways in which the story can end. The puzzles are usually quite simple but this possibility of taking different paths increases both the depth of the game, implementing interesting ramifications, and its longevity, forcing you to repeat the adventure several times to discover the various paths, which is extremely important considering that the its duration is really small, falling within the three hours for a single run. Richardson's writing is the main weapon with which The Procession to Calvary strikes at the heart: recovering typical elements of medieval and Renaissance culture, mixing Old English with the more down-to-earth current slang and essentially making fun of everything and everyone with an irreverent satire, makes it really difficult not to laugh heartily following this crazy tale. It is remarkable how it manages to be in some ways witty and cultured but also tremendously rough and even offensive to some: when one finds oneself being heavily mocked by an unspecified ~lady with child on a donkey~, or one encounters a sort of cheap magician who seems to be the protagonist of a certain last supper and seems to possess the secret of walking on water, one would think that this game could havento run into some serious trouble if he achieved too wide a notoriety. Finally, a special mention for the audio accompaniment: each setting is supported by a piece of music taken from the classical repertoire ranging from the 500s to the 700s. The beauty is that musicians and orchestras are always clearly visible within the scenography, with the gag recurrent that makes the soundtrack a strictly diegetic element, contrary to what one might expect.", "date": "2021-01-16", "grade": "8.4"}
