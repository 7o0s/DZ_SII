His new Drop Wizard refers more than evidently to classics like Bubble Bobble and Snow Bros, but just like Super Crate Box, it adds, subtracts and changes just enough to give the game its own well-defined personality. Drop Wizard is a colorful arcade game for iOS that harks back to classics like Bubble Bobble and Snow Bros Magical Magic Teo Like the previous Neutronized games, Drop Wizard also captures the spirit of the tradition of the old arcades right from the premises, staging a small and simple story, very similar to that of Bubble Bobble. In summary: there are two wizards named Teo and Tea; the mysterious villain arrives; Tea is kidnapped and taken to an island; Teo has to save Tea. Stop, we are not interested in knowing anything else, because the focus passes in the blink of an eye from the sketched plot to the design of each screen, which through the layout of the platforms and the type of enemies present, offers a challenge that must first be interpreted and then faced . The mechanics to keep in mind seem to take and mix different exponents of the genre: you move along a platform through touches on the screen, but no other type of input is possible. You can't jump like in Mario Bros., you can't shoot bubbles like in Bubble Bobble and you can't pick up an enemy like in Don Doko Don. However, the moment you fall off a platform and land on the one below, Teo automatically throws a small star in the direction you are looking. And this is the magician's trick: the star stuns the first enemy it encounters and gives the user a handful of seconds to touch it and make it roll, involving all the monsters it encounters along the way in the avalanche. This sort of chain effect seems to be taken quite clearly from Snow Bros, but the fact that you can only attack once per platform and not be able to defend yourself if you miss the target makes everything more interesting and complicated. As you progress through the levels, enemies are introduced who fall from the platforms, who jump, who disappear from view or who petrify if too close, and for this reason it becomes increasingly important to study the screen and the behavior of the monsters to understand when it is the most opportune time to fall. This especially if you want to maximize your score and find all the stars, as the bonuses only appear when enemies roll onto certain platforms. To a formula that already works by itself, the author then added some very spot on ideas, such as boss battles that require different strategies and a sort of ghost that, like in Spelunky, appears and chases the player if it takes too long to finish a level. But the completeness of the Italian developer and his love for old-school experiences can be seen not only in the ability to know how to choose a type of gameplay from the past, customize it with some apt design ideas and re-propose it effectively today , but also from the aesthetic realization, which goes from a delicious pixel-art to menus and backdrops that seem to come straight from a Mega Drive, passing through a whole series of winks, such as fruit dropped by enemies or the curtain opens at the start of the game exactly like in Bubble Bobble II. Not to mention the 16-bit soundtrack composed by Rakugaki Otoko, full of very varied, pleasant pieces that wink, indeed the ear, to some themes and fanfares of old classics.", "date": "2015-01-19", "grade": "8.5"}
