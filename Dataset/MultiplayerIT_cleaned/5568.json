{"name": "Orrore procedurale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/166945-phantasmal-orrore-procedurale.html", "text": "The Walled City of Kowloon, a former Chinese military citadel that became a disturbing human hive in the eighties and demolished in 1994, is the particular setting of Phantasmal, a hybrid between Lovecraftian survival horror and roguelike that combines procedurally generated levels with first-person gameplay person, all centered on tension and thrifty management of a handful of resources essential to overcome hordes of supernatural beings. The nightmare begins in a small room where we find a notebook full of notes, a pistol with a magazine and a wooden table. Once we have collected the weapons and become familiar with the controls, we venture into a dark corridor meeting, on the left, a disreputable guy who sells weapons and objects that we cannot yet afford. We just have to keep going straight to get to a room overlooked by several doors among which the only one that interests us stands out, that of the elevator that takes us to the floor below. When the ride ends we find ourselves in the middle of an immense concrete maze full of dimly lit corridors, bolted doors that provide useful improvised weapons and tons of switches that allow us to gradually illuminate the bowels of an even more eerie and populated Kowloon than the original. by dark presences. Phanthasmal drags us into a creepy Kowloon dominated by horror and madness Fear of the unknown Phantasmal's gameplay rests on the same foundations as most of the survival horror games out there. Surviving means making the best use of improvised melee weapons, saving your breath to escape from the most fearsome creatures and conserving bullets without wasting, at the same time, flares, homemade bombs and firecrackers which are fundamental tools for tackling the most demanding challenges. Initially it is not impossible to get by as long as you keep your ears open to avoid surprises and keep as much health as possible, but after the first three or four levels, the Eyemobi title changes gears, putting us in front of increasingly fearsome creatures who demand a cautious approach, the measured use of every resource and a discreet propensity to escape. Furthermore, it is important to use the flashlight to explore every nook and cranny of the game in search not only of offensive tools but of pills to restore the invaluable health and to reduce the effects of the loss of sanity which, once the random generation of the levels has been removed, represents the Phantasmal's secret ingredient. The darkness and the growing threats put a strain on our avatar's mind, which gradually loses clarity until it generates illusions which, in addition to representing a real threat, make it difficult to distinguish the world around us. The quickest way to recover sanity is to resort to flares or look for the switches that allow you to illuminate short sections of the long corridors of Kowloon, but this solution is not always practicable. The lights, as well as the noises caused by moving without caution and fighting, attract attention, helping to make Phantasmal a potentially interesting experience on a par with the procedural generation of the levels which guarantees a very important factor for a horror: unpredictability. And the formula sometimes works, preventing us from foreseeing the threats that lurk behind the innumerable gates of the Walled City and making us victims of its darkness. In many cases, however, the obvious shortcomings of Phantasmal prevail over the intentions of the developers, compromising the usability of the title. Let's start with the design problems that depend precisely on that randomness we just praised. If on the one hand the procedural generation of the levels is a distinctive element of Phantasmal, on the other the lack of balance in the spawn of objects and enemies alternates moments of absolute emptiness with unmanageable situations. Furthermore, the enemies who spot us are limited to charging headlong, significantly flattening the depth of the gameplay. In all of this, the only consolation is the progression system which, however limited and slow, increases the chances of going further during the next run and reduces the risk of frustration. Once we leave the mortal coil we find ourselves at the beginning, as in any roguelike, but the money we have collected is still in the inventory allowing us to buy equipment, keys and upgrades from the disreputable guy we talked about in the introduction. They come out of the fucking walls Like a thousand other indie Phantasmal does not focus on jaw-breaking cosmetics but, unlike other titles with a modest genesis, can count on the work of Brian Bell, an special effects expert who has worked on films such as Riddick and Life of Pim. Bell's experience offers us engaging and convincing environments which, thanks to the excellent lighting, overshadow the obvious technical shortcomings of a decidedly modest title. Nightmarish operating rooms, dismembered corpses and faintly illuminating glimpses from the neon give a nice boost to the tension that should explode with the arrival of the first real threats. Unfortunately, these manifest themselves in the worst possible way, with models of disconcerting poverty, bad animations and clouds of red smoke that emphasize the disappearance of the bodies of downed enemies. Then, almost as if to prove us wrong, Phantasmal brings out more than convincingly animated spiders, credible hallucinations and genuinely disturbing creatures that allow us to recover a pinch of suspension of disbelief. But this is destined to fall into a bottomless abyss when enemies rebel against the collision system to pass through walls and doors with negative results on the gaming experience. When this happens, the pathos dissolves and the balance follows closely when a particularly strong creature emerges from the concrete, completely compromising a game. And as if this weren't enough to the negative notes, the poor optimization is added, evident in the slowdowns that bring the frame rate from 150 frames per second to less than 30, on a configuration that has no particular problems with The Division, even when there is no it is the shadow of a nearby enemy. The only things that seem to work well are the short narrative brackets, underlined by photos and drawings made quite well, and the sound sector which, although without a soundtrack, contributes to the tension thanks to sighs, exploding light bulbs and disturbing noises of all kinds. Quality and variety are certainly not at the highest levels but overall the sound effects do their duty together with the few lines of speech in English.", "date": "2016-04-19", "grade": "5.0"}
