{"name": "Ratchet & Clank: Nexus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125365-ratchet-clank-nexus-falle-spaziali.html", "text": "Insomniac Games was one of the champion software houses of PlayStation 3, capable of managing two of the most important sagas of the console over the years, Resistance and Ratchet & Clank. On the one hand, the shooter series was among the first to push PlayStation 3 from a technical point of view and to support the multiplayer cravings of the Sony console, on the other Ratchet took charge of carrying on an action and platform discourse that in a few developers claim. What perhaps didn't always succeed with Resistance, instead went perfectly with little Lombax and his robotic friend, thanks to a handful of games with solid gameplay and a thousand colorful found in the arc, above all, of the trilogy set in future and which ends with this Ratchet & Clank: Nexus which comes out in Italy on November 20th. A title to close a very long and exclusive collaboration with excellent results, therefore, which left us curious to understand how the saga would end, whether by inserting new ideas and twists or if more simply Insomniac would limit itself to market a good game for the many fans of Ratchet. Ratchet & Clank: Nexus is a good game that doesn't last a little too long... The story is the one we mentioned some time ago during the test, namely that of Ratchet & Clank who must escort two very bad brothers in a maximum security space prison. Something goes wrong during transport, and a team of Thugs attacks the spaceship carrying our heroes, devastating it and leaving the two free to plot a diabolical plan to bring into our reality a terrible creature hitherto relegated to the afterlife, where for afterlife means a parallel dimension in which, from a certain point on, Clank can enter to solve a series of puzzles, based on the alteration of the force of gravity, replacing the ~temporal~ ones of A Spasso nel Tempo, the second chapter of the trilogy. These new mechanics work much better than the previous ones and the Clank levels are very fun to complete, while the weapon level up system is confirmed as excellent, as is the goodness and fun set up by Imsomniac over the years and which here it certainly gets messed up. In fact, apart from a new feature of the basic weapon that allows you to activate gravitational tunnels to move through a series of platforms, everything else is almost unchanged from the previous episode. Weapons level up as you use them, while upgrades are managed by purchasing tiles along a hex ~map~ that expands as you progress through the game. However, if on the one hand we could have expected a ~food~ episode that would give fans a nice ~more of the same~, on the other we hoped that it was a full-bodied conclusion, but the problem is that we realize that already after passing three of the five worlds, three weapons can be upgraded to the maximum and that the worlds themselves can already be cleaned with very high percentages of completion. In short, Nexus, in short, is very short, well below the average of the other chapters, so much so that you can get to finish it at a normal level in two in-depth game sessions for a total of no more than five hours. The space navigation sections between one planet and another have been removed and the maps are really reduced to the bone, not to mention that, precisely, managing to maximize your favorite weapons in a short time, when you get to the final battle the it can be faced almost thoughtlessly because even the balancing of the game is affected by this evident haste with which the project was completed. After that, all that remains is to clean up a small world with a few more secrets and replay the whole campaign at two extra difficulty levels, but we are talking about a title aimed exclusively at the ranks of Lombax's most loyal fans. Playstation 3 trophies A good number of trophies can be taken home already with the first series of games, so much so that it is not unrealistic to score 40% or so. Getting to platinum will certainly not be a titanic undertaking, provided that you have the desire to play the campaign at least three times. From planet to planet Insomniac's engine is now famous for the wide spaces and the thousands of objects it can handle on screen, making Ratchet's world one of the most visually pleasing to explore. Nexus, from this point of view, if it does not bring any innovation or change, it certainly does not disappoint and what you see is as pleasant and captivating as ever, starting from the animations to the places where you move. Glimpses of futuristic metropolises, jungles and swamps populated by Thug and adventurers are the ones we have all grown fond of, but it seems that this happened on another occasion and not this one. The sense of deja vu is felt several times; it almost seems that Nexus, just as it has not evolved in terms of gameplay, is the collection of a series of levels and settings resulting from the work gained over the years and which is collected here to produce a new episode without particular inspiration. All very nice, all very pleasant, but already seen, and the ending in itself does not seem to properly close a trilogy that has been played by millions of players all over the world anyway. The production is always at the top between movies, music and sound effects, but we are faced with a good homework that is attractive only for the extremely affordable price it is offered.", "date": "2013-11-11", "grade": "7.3"}
