{"name": "theHunter: Call of the Wild", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180279-thehunter-call-of-the-wild-fottuto-bambi.html", "text": "Over the years, experience and good reading have demonstrated to the writer that it is impossible to separate one's system of values from the interpretation of a work and that, indeed, the very idea of doing so is extremely naive. Indeed, often it is precisely the adherence or otherwise of a certain work to one's own system of values that makes it more or less attractive. When collecting trophies we are told where we hit the animal This is especially true when we talk about pure entertainment, i.e. all those products that just want to entertain and make their target audience spend time. Video games make no difference and indeed, more than any other medium, their use requires prior acceptance of what we will ideally make happen by playing. Not that you need to know the whole game to want it, mind you, but we still need to know that it will be based on a certain moral system and that it won't violate certain unwritten agreements with the user. This necessary introduction helps to understand why playing many do not have problems to carry out massacres of human beings, while they have more than a few problems in accepting the existence of hunting simulators like theHunter: Call of the Wild, the more realistic they appear: from on the one hand, the massacre is culturally connoted so as to be harmonized with the values of those who play, and therefore is projected onto a purely fictitious level that affects us relatively, while on the other we have the reconstruction of a real activity, i.e. one that produces effects tangible. In short, in reality no one would take up a sword to go and kill the guards holding a woman prisoner in a tower, while many arm themselves with various equipment to go and shoot animals. theHunter: Call of the Wild is a good hunting simulator, plagued by a few too many bugs Come home Bambi The long introduction serves to clarify the intrinsic difficulty of reviewing a similar simulator for someone who does not necessarily accept its basic values. We felt it was right to specify it so as not to run into misunderstandings of any kind. Some landscapes take your breath away Having said that, let's put on the hunter's outfit, take up the rifle and enter one of the two game reserves offered by theHunter: Call of the Wild. Just think that added together they form an open world of more than one hundred and thirty square kilometers to be explored inch by inch in search of traces and, above all, of prey to kill. The landscape, driven by the Apex engine of Avalanche Studios (those of Just Cause), offers large forests dominated by rocky hills, which are reflected in small and pristine freshwater lakes. We almost want to continue the review by imitating the accent of a Wyoming lumberjack, but being written it wouldn't make sense to do so. Just know that hunting aside, exploring the reserves you find yourself admiring truly superb landscapes. In particular, the first reserve, which we will visit in the middle of autumn, has splendid colours, as you can verify by looking at some of the images we have captured for the article. But no sentimentality, also because we are not romantic poets: it's time to reunite Bambi with his mommy. Pure simulation As we said, theHunter: Call of the Wild is a hunting simulator. The action is framed in first person and sees us engaged in the activity of finding animals to shoot at, whether they are defenseless deer, or more dangerous beasts such as bears and wild boars. The atmospheric effects are really well done To do this, it is not enough to go around and hope that they will step in front of us, also because if they hear us they would run away without too many compliments, but we must learn to recognize and follow their tracks, avoiding making too much noise or putting ourselves in a position to let them reach our odor carried by the wind. Once the prey has been identified, it can be highlighted using the scope supplied or the viewfinder of the rifle, so as to have it clearly visible for a few seconds, then you can shoot. A trophy must be recovered from each prey, which gives experience points and money (once taken to one of the outposts scattered around the maps). The better we are at aiming, the richer the prizes obtained will be. For example, a sharp blow to the head, which kills the animal instantly, is worth more than a series of blows to the body. If desired, there are alternatives to traditional hunting. For example, you can spend money to build staging points (they are fixed on the maps) and use baits to attract potential prey to your area, or you can use different types of weapons (revolvers, shotguns, etc. away) to change approach. To help us explore the reserves well there are several strumbles. In addition to the classic compass, the most practical is a phablet that we always carry with us on which the closest points of interest are indicated. The panoramic points are also very important, i.e. structures generally placed in elevated points that give us an overview of an entire area, showing us the icons on the general map (a bit like Assassin's Creed). Outposts full of bugs The aforementioned outposts, on the other hand, serve various purposes: carry trophies, buy weapons and other equipment from the shop, such as decoys or scopes, sleep to rest and perhaps avoid hunting at night, and unlock fast travel so you don't have to retrace the road already covered in each game. Graphically it is excellent, not much to say To introduce us to the fundamentals of hunting, the developers have also implemented a mission system that gives us objectives from time to time: capture a certain prey, follow tracks, go to a certain place and so on. Reaching them yields the classic experience points that allow you to unlock skills and perks, such as obtaining more precise information by looking at the tracks, or a steadier aim when you hold your breath. Don't be fooled by so many nice features that seem to be taken from an RPG crossed with a first person shooter, because theHunter: Call of the Wild's pace is slow, often very slow. Running is discouraged because it makes a lot of noise and tires the character excessively, making it more difficult to hold your breath when aiming. Then when you shoot, you have to calculate the shot well, since each weapon has its own characteristics (ballistics, bullets and so on) and you certainly can't go around shooting wildly, also because the number of bullets is limited and you have to repurchase them from time to time in the outposts. In short, if you are anxious leave it alone. Playing here means paying attention to tracks and learning to follow them, slowing down to a crawl as you get close to your target. After all, hunting is made above all of long waits and the title of Expansive Worlds does everything to reproduce it as best as possible. Problems Beyond any content or moral issue, theHunter: Call of the Wild has major problems in terms of cleanliness. To put it another way: it is infested with bugs of all sorts, some of which are compromising. Tender little animals of the woods, tremble! Let's start from the interface, which sometimes doesn't want to respond to our commands. This applies both in and out of the game. For example, it happens that you have to click several times on a menu item to be able to access it, or you find yourself with the phablet with a hole in the screen, or you open the map and find it centered on nothing. More serious, however, are the bugs that infest the actual gameplay, such as the one that mercilessly kills us when we end up stuck between two rocks, automatically transforming them into the worst enemy to deal with, or another one that blocks the animals, making killing them all too easy. Both happen more often than necessary, just as it happens, but more rarely, that the traces of an animal we are chasing mysteriously disappear. The most annoying bug we encountered, however, was that of the loss of points for skills and perks earned by leveling up: the system reported them to us, but entering the character file we did not find them. In terms of gameplay it's a lot of time wasted. Fortunately, patch 1.1, released a few hours before the review, has partly fixed some problems, such as the poor responsiveness of animals in some circumstances, or another myriad of problems concerning the interface and options. Of course, there is still a long way to go to have a considerably complete game, but at least the developers are showing that they care about the game and do not want to let it drift.", "date": "2017-02-24", "grade": "7.5"}
