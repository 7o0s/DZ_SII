{"name": "Puzzle League DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/puzzle-league-ds-recensione.html", "text": "Twenty thousand leagues on Ds Those who are passionate about the genre will probably have no trouble recognizing in this Puzzle League the belonging to the fifteen-year Panel de Pon series, famous above all in Japan. The mechanics behind the title in question is based on the umpteenth variation of the theme ~bring at least 3 blocks of the same color closer to make them disappear~, while bringing with it some peculiar characteristics. In this case, in fact, the blocks rise from the bottom, and can only be moved horizontally to the left or right, obviously using the stylus, within the entire row. The challenge factor lies precisely in creating horizontal or vertical lines, but above all combos, with which to obtain precious points; all this without reaching the top of the screen, in order not to run into game over. We were talking about combos, and it is precisely the creation of these that provides the greatest stimulus and interest in the Nintendo product; the ~difficult~, if we want to say so, lies in being able to organize one's actions in view not only of their immediate reaction, but also of the consequent one. And so, for example, eliminating a trio of yellow cubes is fine, but even better is making sure that the purple one just above falls right next to the other two. To create tasty combinations it is necessary that there are quite a few blocks, but not so many as to put the game at risk; therefore, a subtle balance is created which requires setting the ~ideal~ level of filling in the middle of the screen, possibly varying it with the key delegated to accelerate time. Mastering this concept is essential to be able to obtain results at advanced difficulty levels, but above all in multiplayer; Puzzle League is in fact one of the DS titles that support wi-fi connection, and allows you to challenge players from all over the world in free or ranked games. Voice chat is also available. The ad-hoc multiplayer mode is also robust, allowing you to challenge up to 3 friends with a single game cartridge. Better a full barrel? Puzzle League is not stingy at all even with regard to the single player. We start with the ~infinite~ mode, which as can be easily understood does not put any limits on one's ability to collect points until game over; Vs CPU allows you to challenge a virtual opponent, while ~blocks~ requires you to destroy the increasingly large blocks that fall from above by eliminating the panels that touch them. ~Goal~ requires you to eliminate all the squares above a line in the shortest possible time, and finally ~Puzzle~ requires you to solve some situations by following certain pre-established rules. There is also a kind of daily challenge based on 3 short tests, a bit like Brain Training (and the vertical book handle of the DS brings them even closer), but in reality it soon turns out to be monotonous and not very stimulating . It is a pity that, in the midst of all this abundance, there is a lack of a sense of cohesion, a real goal to pursue. The modalities seem a bit thrown out there, it is not clear exactly which one is the main one (and in reality there is none), one never has a feeling of concrete progress apart from obviously the growth of one's skills. Puzzle League is therefore played with pleasure, the solid and intelligent mechanics are appreciated (although sometimes too conditioned by randomness), but it is difficult to find something in the Nintendo production that makes it enter the heart like the great masterpieces of the genre. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, given the genre it belongs to, there isn't actually much to say; the graphics are colorful, functional and enjoyable, with a series of thematic skins that vary the look from level to level, while the sound is limited to an electronic accompaniment to which many will prefer silence. Comment Puzzle League DS is a good puzzle game within the offering of a console that is certainly not lacking in regards to the genre in question. Just the great competition ~at home~ requires us to underline the imperfections of a decidedly more than valid product, but which leaves some perplexity in the face of an intriguing but hardly exciting gameplay and a poor sense of cohesion between the game modes offered. Pros Solid and challenging gameplay Excellent choice in game modes Multiplayer more than robust Cons Not at the top levels of the genre Poor cohesion between modes Technically only sufficient If we were to name the most crowded and popular genre of games on the Nintendo DS, choosing puzzle games would be extremely easy. Since its debut, the Nintendo portable has proven itself practically perfect in providing an ideal interface, of courseusing the stylus, to manage puzzles of various kinds and molds. And so alongside the various Zoo Keeper, Meteos with an annexed variant in a Disney key, Picross, Tetris, Puzzle Quest and so on, DS owners not yet satisfied with puzzle games can now get their hands on a new title created directly from the big N, which responds to the name of Puzzle League.", "date": "2007-07-25", "grade": null}
