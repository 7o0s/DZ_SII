There is a niche of enthusiasts that resists, but the wager of videogame producers has always been to create such an experience, which is not only fun but also accessible and unifying. Presented during E3 2017, Sony's PlayLink platform seems to have found the proverbial square, starting from an application for PlayStation 4 and using iOS and Android devices as advanced controllers, whose features can be intelligently exploited. The first title in the line, Tell Me Who You Are!, is free this month for PlayStation Plus subscribers, but can also be purchased as normal for 19.99. Here are our impressions. Very fast Developed by Wish Studios, Tell Me Who You Are! it is structured like a boardgame that is actually quite simple, in which the goal is to intercept the opinions of other users in order to provide the same answers. The question that is asked to the players is in fact ~do you really know your friends?~, and you have to prove it by making the right choices. A trivial example: a photo is shown on the screen and we are asked which of the participants it could belong to. All those who respond in the same way to one or more users will earn points, possibly doubled through the use of jokers, with the ultimate goal of overcoming the others and thus winning the game. We expected an easy and immediate setup, and the PlayLink platform didn't disappoint: just launch the game on PlayStation 4 and the related apps on phones or tablets, connected to the same Wi-Fi network, to immediately see the list of participants on the TV, therefore without the need to create accounts or carry out special procedures. An intelligent solution that makes the Sony product accessible to everyone, without limitations or wasted time. Depending on the number of people involved, it is possible to choose between two different modes: a cooperative for two or a clash in which three to six players can take part. The first option, we say it immediately, is the least exciting: the rules are basically the same, net of some limitations, but it is the very concept of being only two that cuts off the legs of the experience. Like any boardgame, in fact, the PlayLink title gives its best when played in company, because it will be the participants who will make it more or less fun. Better than many If you have a close-knit, shrewd and maybe a little crazy group of friends at your disposal, play Dimmi chi sei! they inevitably take off, also because many of the minigames included in the package lend themselves well to the most vulgar interpretations. The only initial selfie, which determines the image of our card on the screen, can be a cause for hilarity, but clearly there are situations in which having a laugh will come absolutely spontaneously. The game includes about a thousand questions (but it is possible to add more via mobile) and therefore it rarely happens to come across a question that has already been tested, while visually one moves within ten settings, all very inspired from an aesthetic point of view, detailed and charming: a simple living room, a suite with a view of Paris, a campsite, school desks, etc. As mentioned, you have to respond in the same way to at least one other user in order to score points, but some tests are undoubtedly more fun than others: the mime game, for example, in which you have to take a selfie to imitate the expression of a photo that is shown on the screen; or the minigame in which each participant takes a picture and the others in turn have to draw on it, trying to give the figure the traits indicated by the virtual ~master~, a narrative voice in Italian that is immediately clear and pleasant, although some puns deserved a better adaptation in our language. In all cases, the ~anthropological~ value of the experience must also be recognized, as the answers provided by your friends will reveal what they really think of you in certain situations, and vice versa. A wrong impression or the plain and simple truth? Playstation 4 trophies Tell me who you are! allows you to unlock a total of twenty-eight Trophies. Some of them are obtained simply by completing a game with a different number of participants, others involve the completion of particular actions: a selfie with a deformation effect, the use of custom questions, the exploration of all ten scenarios and etc. Crocand and delight If it is true that Tell me who you are! it boasts a refined and refined appearance, suggestive visuals, an adequate sound accompaniment and, above all, an extraordinary accessibility, at the same time not all the minigames that make up the experience have impressed us well. The excellent idea of using smartphones and tablets also to draw on the touch screen collides with the reality of a very problematic and imprecise finger drawing, which can only return insane results, while the questions in which you have to complete sentences appear conceptually weaker than the rest. Likewise, it's a pity that the two-player cooperative mode does nothing but mimic the competitive group multiplayer, but as already mentioned, the strength of this type of application lies precisely in the quantity and quality of the participants, rather than in the product itself. A factor to take into due consideration if you do not have a PlayStation Plus subscription and therefore have to choose whether or not to buy Tell me who you are! at full price.", "date": "2017-07-18", "grade": "7.5"}
