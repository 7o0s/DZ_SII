Let's say that fans of the genre have long had a vast choice and, especially in recent times with the various remakes and remasters of old glories, to be able to come out and be noticed, surely you need to do that little bit more than the chaos of offer in circulation.NIS America and YummyYummyTummy Games, historic creator of the Fallen Legion series, have tried to get the fourth (even if the lore of the series is the third) chapter of the two-dimensional RPG saga out of the hat, but not without some problems. The use of outdated mechanics, almost nothing new and loading times that for a two-dimensional game are at least 15 years behind or perhaps more, make this chapter a missed opportunity to make that leap which at this point was needed by the series. But let's go in order and see what didn't convince us in the review of Fallen Legion: Revenants. History Fallen Legion: Revenants: A combat phase The plot of Fallen Legion: Revenants, as we have already seen in our demo test, takes place in the floating castle of Welkin. The manor is under the control of an evil wizard, Ivor, an unscrupulous old upstart who would do anything to succeed in carrying out his sinister plans, to the detriment of any living being. Our goal is to be able to dethrone the shady figure, crossing the destinies of the two protagonists. The first is Lucien, a politician known within the walls, the other is Rowena, or rather what remains of it, being the ghost of a woman to whom Ivor has imprisoned her son and who wants at all costs to be able to free him . The latter has the fantastic ability to summon the Exemplars at her side, an anthropomorphic materialization of the soul of weapons, in order to be able to complete her mission. Lucien will have to maneuver within the walls of Welkin to ensure that he is not caught plotting against Ivor, and to do so he will have to try to make friends with as many people as possible. As always happens, nothing is simple and our conversations will become increasingly complex and twisted as we make room for the tyrant. A point in favor of the title is the fact that the story does not have a single ending, in fact depending on the choices made and the crossroads undertaken we will be able to witness different conclusions, more or less happy. Obviously there is a ~True Ending~ but you will have to work hard to be able to get it. Just plain old gameplay? Fallen Legion: Revenants: an illustration The game is divided into two modes: the first purely exploratory during which we will only play Lucien, with not always very successful dialogues with which to deepen the dynamics that unite Welkin's various characters; the other exclusively of action with our Rowena and her Exemplars intent on fighting against different types of enemies. The sensations returned by both types of gameplay are diametrically opposed. While the action phase is at least well thought out and with interesting dynamics, the exploratory one, apart from a few small points in which you will find yourself having to cross dialogues during Rowena's actions to allow you to choose the right path in the various crossroads it will encounter, is extremely repetitive and flat. The dialogues, all strictly in English, as well as all the game menus, are not branched in the slightest, but sometimes, after some specific points in the game, items are unlocked only to advance in the plot, and then often return to the previous scripted phrases . This implies an ~exploration~ if you can call it that, an end in itself, without secrets, hidden dialogues or particular passages, details that in this century one would expect to find in an RPG. In our game we managed to unlock three endings with 8 Exemplars, but in fact we didn't do anything so particular as to actually change much of what we saw on the screen or to be able to drastically influence this or that non-player character. Yes, obviously the various epilogues involve decisions, but we have never been faced with epic twists or particular events. Unfortunately, to all this we must also add a detail that we had already highlighted in the demo test. Even if it is certainly not a game that pushes the console to 100% (among other things we played it in backwards compatibility on PS5) it is absurd how even after a string of dialogue the animations go idle even for 10 seconds without the possibilityity of course to move nothing. This loading problem also led to total freezes a couple of times, but only after some fights. Obviously this is a problem that we hope is given by the game's not exactly refined code, but certainly such slowdowns are worrying even at this stage. Hopefully they will be fixed in a patch later. Fallen Legion: Revenants: dialogues do not live up to our expectations To return to the gameplay, let's see how the fighting phase takes place, certainly the best part of the game, even if not without flaws. When we talk to Rowena inside the castle we will have the possibility to go on an expedition choosing which of the Exemplars to take with us, up to a maximum of three, their equipment and their peculiar skills. These skills are unlocked by achieving certain objectives in battle and have the aim of differentiating the various Exemplars even more from each other, making them more tank or more ranged, more support or even more fighter. Each of them then has slots available in which to place the so-called Archeus, special objects that give other abilities but which can be easily interchanged with each other. Here we go from a speed increase after casting a spell, to an attack boost after a parry, through increases in hp and activation of various beneficial statuses. In short, in terms of combat customization we cannot complain. Once we go into battle we have the possibility to attack with the Exemplars, each of which is associated with a key with the exception of the fourth which corresponds to Rowena's actions, which can either use a healing spell on one of the available boxes, or push or shoot enemies with an offensive spell. If you have timing then you can also parry enemy attacks and even send the bullets back to the sender; in case you manage to make parries with perfect timing, you will also have an extra action available with each Exemplar. Each enemy has a hp bar and a stun bar which, as the name suggests, once exhausted with consecutive attacks, will make him weaker and therefore lead him to suffer more damage. For the bosses this period takes the form of a kind of limit break during which the segments of the actions are not used, thus being able to chain together a good series of attacks. After each fight the action simply transitions to the next with an animation of the characters running to the right so they can charge. So on up to the boss of the turn at the end of which to receive an evaluation regarding damage inflicted, suffered, parries and reanimations performed, useful only for receiving 1, 2 or 3 Archeus that can thus be equipped for the next expedition. Don't expect exploration or secret bosses, just as there isn't all this variety of enemies unfortunately. We hope that, if the series goes on, the whole part relating to combat will develop better, perhaps expanding and deepening the various characteristics that distinguish it. 2D animations and technique not quite up to par Fallen Legion: Revenants: an interesting style but technically far from the excellence of other products As far as the artistic side is concerned, we are still light years away from more renowned productions. The illustrations and characters, although still pleasant and with a fairly consistent color palette, have a detail that doesn't make you cry out for a miracle. The animations are repeated with a few frames and the effects of the battles are sometimes confusing, so much so that it is often not clear who is doing what. The menus are very dull and lacking in stylistic details, definable as essential if desired. Another sore point is the general balance of the battles. Sometimes we were faced with enemies that are very easy to take down, while some bosses are really tough with dynamics that are difficult to assimilate and understand on the fly. Without spoilers, we had to fight one of the final bosses at least twenty times because more than a fight it felt like we were playing a song for how many times he repeated the same things. Making a mistake even once we found ourselves having to resuscitate continuously without having the time to keep up with the thousand things to do. Let's understand each other well, the difficulty is not in itself a bad thing, but we are criticizing the general confusion of the product and above all of some battles. Last note on longevity: it didn't take us more than 6 hours to finish each narrative line, placing the title well below the average duration of RPGs. In short, this Fallen Legion: Revenants does nothing to improve the previous chapters, continuing the storyof Rowena and Welkin's Castle without acute details and leaving a bad taste in the mouth for what could have been done and has definitely not been done.
