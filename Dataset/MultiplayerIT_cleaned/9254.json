Loreid goes mad after hunting down a dangerous killer. Locked up in a psychiatric hospital, while he is still dazed by drugs, he witnesses an incredible scene: someone approaches his bed, knocks out the nurses and injects something into his veins that immediately makes him unconscious. When he wakes up, days later, he finds himself in a deserted house, lost who knows where, far from the hospital, with a message from the mysterious man who tells him to go to the city of Arkhamend to find out what binds him to a series of events that could change the fate of the world. Exploring the empty house serves somewhat as a tutorial to familiarize yourself with the control system of Darkness Within 2: The Dark Kindred: the usual WASD keys are used to move the character using a first person view, while the mouse pointer it directs its gaze and allows it to interact with the environment. Howard can collect an infinite number of objects and analyze them later, accessing the inventory. Likewise, it can move crates, chairs and anything else hiding something of interest. Lastly, the ability to jump and crouch allows him to move within narrow spaces and to enjoy a fair amount of freedom of action. The dark inside It is clear from the first moments that the title developed by the Turkish team Zoetrope Interactive bases its gameplay on classic mechanics, which in this case provide for the consultation of documents and the collection of objects even more than exploration, and even relegate the solving of puzzles to a far from consistent part of the experience. Once the inspection of the empty house is over, our character takes a train that takes him to the city of Arkhamend, naturally arriving at his destination at night and can do nothing but rent a room while waiting for day to break again. The next day, in fact, his goal will be to check the library in search of a particular book that could prove useful in understanding exactly what he is looking for in that forgotten place. Darkness does not bring the longed-for rest, but nightmares and visions, projecting Loreid into a sort of alternate dimension in which reality is distorted, and it is possible to feel the menacing presence of evil creatures. The interface, in its simplicity, proves to be up to these situations and allows us to face them in a very natural way, leaving the task of surprising us with some disturbing twists to some predetermined sequences. A goal unfortunately far from being achieved, because despite the claustrophobic atmosphere of Darkness Within 2: The Dark Bloodline is undeniable, in the same way the dated technical sector ends up ~rowing against~ and making the experience very little scary. An interesting story, which even manages to be original in some of its aspects, but which requires a certain adaptation on our part to exercise the necessary involvement. A light in the darkness The graphics engine of the game has been enhanced compared to the first episode, introducing support for PhysX technology for object management (actually very little used) and a completely new lighting system, which allows us to split the dark using torches or lanterns as the main prerogative of the exploratory phases. As mentioned above, the adventure often sees us collect and analyze maps, tickets, book pages and so on, because they contain the information necessary to locate our next destination or to solve a puzzle. In this sense, the Zoetrope Interactive production includes three different difficulty levels that substantially influence our approach to the game, passing from the automatic suggestion of data to the elimination of any type of help. It is clear that facing the adventure in one way or another will be very different, however it is a feature for the use and consumption of those who consider themselves an expert of this particular genre, considering that the choice must be made at the beginning and not can in any way affect the replayability of the title. So let's go back to the technical sector. The addition of a decent lighting system and a minimum of physics made the visual impact in some ways better than the first episode of the series, but in terms of ~art direction~ and style it almost seems like a step backwards. The graphics, in general, appear very dated andmoreover little optimized, given that with the test configuration you travel between 25 and 30 fps at the resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels. The sound has the presence of a dubbing in Italian, albeit anything but phantasmagorical, and a series of simple but effective effects, which help to create the necessary atmosphere.", "date": "2011-05-30", "grade": "6.8"}
