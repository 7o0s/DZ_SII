{"name": "Breed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/breed-2.html", "text": "A bit of history If last year was that of shooters set in the humid Vietnamese jungles, this year we could see a new trend. We are referring to splendid islands, with a typically tropical flavor, in which to roam far and wide, joyfully shooting at everything that moves. Almost. Together with Far Cry, Breed in fact takes us to a series of lush tropical atolls and islands literally infested by hordes of ravenous and merciless creatures. Those who have even a minimum of familiarity with the settings described by the ~Starship Troopers~ series will immediately find themselves at home. All the others, on the other hand, cannot help but think of Unreal II or (guess what?) Halo. The story that is the background to Breed is decidedly stereotyped and subdued compared to the rest of the production. We are in 2625, when the Darwin expedition returns from a twenty-year war mission in the Besalius system against a horde of aliens nicknamed Breed. The welcome on Earth, however, is certainly not the best, instead of celebrations and worthy recognitions, our veterans will find a nasty surprise: in fact, the Breeds have now taken control of the planet. It will be up to us to strike the crucial points of the Breed defenses - mostly a series of islands located in the Pacific - to regain control of our beloved planet Son, one day all this will be yours The initial impact with Breed is unsettling. In many ways we are reminded of ~Command & Conquer: Renegade~, the ill-fated attempt of the (defunct) Westwood in proposing their idea of a shooter. The game scenario immediately appears enormous, mostly set outdoors with the possibility of switching to indoor environments without any solution of continuity, the graphic setting of Breed immediately betrays the entire game philosophy. The desire not to set the game in claustrophobic environments, or in forced and short outdoor paths must have bound the developers of Brat Design to a rather painful choice: to be and not to appear. Son, one day all this will be yours On a purely aesthetic level, Breed renounces the intensive use of Pixel and Vertex Shaders and denounces some defections, above all in view of the graphic marvels that everyone expects in the course of this 2004. The textures are not always state of the art, the shadows are been implemented in a rather essential way and some three-dimensional models are quite poor. But this is only a small price to pay, especially considering what the graphics engine that moves Breed, the Mercury, is capable of handling. More than once you will stop on top of a hill and admire the landscape that stands out before your eyes: truly spectacular! Just like in the aforementioned Renegade, the impression of being in the midst of a large-scale conflict is reproduced in a completely believable way. The artillery fire that shoots us from hundreds of meters away, aerial vehicles that patrol the area and numerous groups of aliens sent into jeopardy: pure adrenaline. All seasoned with atmospheric effects recreated in an accurate and always variable way. Unlike what happens in the FPS we are used to, the game scenarios are really passable in their entirety. No invisible wall or mountain too high to climb: what you see you can reach, and if it's too far you can use any means of locomotion (air or land) to get there sooner and more safely. All without being interrupted by any, not even minimal, loading screen. Another feature perhaps only hinted at in Breed, but so far only intensively exploited by the two ~Red Factions~ with GeoMOD technology, is the possibility of being able to destroy certain elements of the scenario (such as vegetation or enemy buildings). The same minimum requirements, necessary to benefit from all this, are really low and allow you to take advantage of the game, even at high resolutions, with certainly not cutting-edge hardware. Seeing is believing. Contaminations The unfolding of the various game missions, somewhat as has been the case for years with the more complex air combat simulators, appears to be variable; this thanks to the dynamics associated with our successes (or failures) achieved during the evolution of the game which will influence the unfolding of events. Just so as not to spoil the taste of the surprise you mentionI just love an excerpt from the very first level: we begin our mission aboard the landing craft, once we have taken control of one of the turrets we have to destroy a radar emplacement, in case of failure, once landed we will face a greater number of Breed, fortunately aided by a team of reinforcements. One for all, all for one In Breed we will not have to play the role of a solitary and spotless hero. Rather, we will be called to impersonate all the components of a landing team, in the context of varied warfare operations and futuristic guerrilla warfare. There are different types of fighters and each, depending on the game missions, may prove indispensable for the resolution of a given level. This choice inevitably leads to an impoverishment of the game identification which, if needed, reveals once again the objectives of Brat Design: to offer us an unconventional shooter with a marked tactical/strategic flavor, a sort of wise mix between a traditional FPS and BattleField 1942. Obviously it will be possible to take control of only one character at a time, while all the other team members will follow our orders and, more generally, will follow us. The commands available to us will be few and elementary: we could call our group back to us, establish its formation, order to cease fire or not, decide to disperse the group in retreat or, in the most difficult cases, request ammunition or medication. Basically the artificial intelligence that will take care of our fellow soldiers manages to perform its duties, although from time to time we will find some member of the group preparing to climb a cliff (from which he has just fallen) or dive (drowning) in the crystalline waters. Fortunately, it will often be possible to conclude a mission using even one character (usually the sniper) making us turn a blind eye to the still not optimal management of our companions. In short, the team is there but sometimes the presence is more than useless and almost harmful. Sin. We are sure that a small corrective patch - as in fashion after all - will be able to solve these small, but decidedly boring, behavior anomalies. Let's forget virtuosity in the field of weapon design, also in this case attention has been paid more to the substance, offering us an arsenal which, although already seen, manages to satisfy every need: from the sniper rifle used for killing from long distances (which, since the time of Project I.G.I., always give an inexplicable and immense satisfaction) to the slow but lethal rocket launcher. The multiplayer Mentioning the design choices of the developers, we have already mentioned the different conception of the concept of ~Team~ compared to others which, such as for example in the recent Vietcong, make us impersonate a single character while still giving us the possibility to interact with other teammates. In Breed, while being able to give rudimentary commands to the other members of the team, we will have greater satisfaction using them ourselves. If in single player this choice can leave you dumbfounded, it has all the chances of being rather apt and successful in the promised multiplayer sessions, especially in cooperative mode, which will be made available in a now upcoming free patch. Of course, as always, the real success of the various Multiplayer modes (competitive or not) can only be sanctioned by the preferences of the players and the MODders community, however, as of now we can say that the premises are really all there. Huge scenarios, many means available, the possibility of planning real game strategies and of differentiating the contribution of the different players according to one's preferences, all seem to promise sparks. The only unknown lies in the implementation of an efficient NetCode. As usual, the arduous sentence to posterity. Not just FPS The usable variants offered to the player, to face the various situations, are always different and almost never mandatory. The only limitations during the course of a mission are those imposed by the geography of the place and the waypoints set up by our commander, everything else is up to us. For example, attacking frontally going up a slope will always be very disadvantageous, this is because our fighters will be slower, similarly equipping a character with heavy weapons will increase his firepower but will also limit his movement speed. Another element that tries to distinguish Breed from the other tThe titles on the market consists in the possibility of being able to use the fire stations or the means of locomotion found along our path. The choice is never mandatory, and often involves different approaches to the rest of the mission: leave one component behind to then bomb from a distance or attack with the full team when the time comes? In some cases we will have to abandon the ~Space Infantry~ to try our hand at driving a landing shuttle (complete with game sessions in full Wing Commander style) or some armored vehicle. All while always using the same game engine. The success of these divertissements oscillates between good and frustrating. In fact, if the sessions on the ground are always fun and demanding at the right point, the aerial and spatial ones sometimes risk being too difficult, always leaving the bitter impression of randomness in the success or otherwise of the clashes. Final comment It is always difficult to judge a game, especially when it courageously tries to explore new solutions, however running into some youth problems. The Burut guys have managed to pack a graphics engine that can support, without too many problems, a fresh, innovative and above all always varied gameplay. Unfortunately we cannot speak of an absolute masterpiece. Mainly due to the rather marked imperfections of the routines that manage the artificial intelligence of our team members and of the enemies themselves; secondly for a series of game design choices which, poised between singleplayer and multiplayer, impoverish the depth of the single-player experience compared to the future online counterpart. I am referring, for example, to the conception of missions, sometimes unlikely and frustrating, or to history. On balance Breed is recommended above all to lovers of multiplayer shooters (we therefore eagerly await the next patch that will make this mode available in all respects) and to all those players able to turn a blind eye to some purely cosmetic or choreographic defects in order to be able to focus on the more technical and tactical features. For the rest, Breed is an immense game, able to continuously offer new surprises and experiences, able to be analyzed and judged according to different interpretations. And speaking of a ~simple~ shooter, this doesn't seem like a little to me... Pros: Innovative and always varied Promising in multiplayer Hardware requirements within the reach of many ... Cons: Deficient artificial intelligence ~Light~ history and background The aerial combat sessions are not very successful Although it cannot boast the blazon of the most anticipated titles of the year, Breed has been a well-known name by the most attentive observers of the scene for many years. Especially since in 2002 it won the prize for best game presented at the ECTS in London. Repeatedly announced as the most valid moral replacement for Halo for the PC platform, the development of Breed had to deal with various hiccups, so much so as to decree, paradoxically enough, its release on the shelves, even after the almost unexpected Windows version of the aforementioned Halo. But defining Breed as a clone of the Bungie title is certainly wrong, Breed is in fact a title with a strong personality that tries to get away from the clichs of the genre by offering the player a series of new ideas that will deserve to be further explored in the future.", "date": "2004-03-29", "grade": null}
