If we tried to frame their films within the history of cinema, we would find few, if any, masterpieces. But limiting ourselves to considering the two characters within their expanded universe, so to speak (where the massive, surly and good-natured Bud Spencer always found his natural counterpart in the slim, charming and mischievous Terence Hill), they were called to play policemen , of gamblers, cowboys or petty knaves, it is inevitable that the feasible considerations become very different. The films of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill were innocuous and amusing products, which involved above all thanks to the charm of the duo. Looking at them inevitably takes you back to that age of innocence from which it is emotionally impossible to detach yourself. Bud Spencer & Terence Hill - Slaps And Beans was born from the irrepressible affection of at least three generations for the comic couple and their films. It's not just a game, but a form of redress for a perceived injustice. Fighting, of course Bud Spencer & Terence Hill - Slaps And Beans is a scrolling beat 'em up, of course. The genre of Double Dragon, Golden Axe, Final Fight, Streets of Rage and a thousand other titles is the natural container for their deeds. From a video game point of view, it is impossible not to imagine them fighting their way through levels overflowing with enemies. Amen. Any other solution would have been a contradiction. At the beginning of the game you have to decide whether to play Bud Spencer or Terence Hill, leaving the control of the second player to the CPU or a friend. This is a non-binding choice, given that during the games it will be possible to exchange them at any time (obviously not playing in pairs). Once the selection has been made, a long ride inside their films begins, each of which is used as a starting point for at least one level. The tribute nature of the entire production is not only evident, but exhibited, starting from the splendid soundtrack, made up of a rich sample of effects and many songs by Oliver Onions taken directly from the various films, up to the highly detailed pixel graphics art that lovingly reproduces the most famous settings of the duo's adventures. The plot itself is an unpretentious canvas, useful for holding together a surreal collage of different situations, interspersed with funny and well-written skits. How else to tie the Trinity with Odd and Even, ... stronger guys!, Who finds a friend finds a treasure, Born with a shirt, Miami Supercops and so on all the others? Without too many mysteries, everything works thanks to its extreme lightness and its never taking itself seriously. What happens on the screen involves not as a story, but as a commemoration mass celebrated for an entire era. After all, there is no lack of scattered citations from other works of the 80s and 90s, such as Street Fighter II, Back to the Future and others, which further strengthen the so-to-speak religious nature of the entire production. In short, from a nostalgic point of view, Slaps And Beans is a spot-on and certainly successful title. Those who grew up with the films of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill can only adore it and grind all the levels in a flash, humming each song in the meantime, which they will surely know by heart. Violent punches But religious worship can't ignore a number of problems that the title of Trinity Team brings with it. The most important element to consider for the evaluation of a fighting game is the combat system and that of Slaps And Beans has several dark points, although in general it works well. Now, the development team's goal was essentially to make the sensations conveyed by the movie brawls. To do this, they created different mechanics, trying to make them coexist in a single organic framework. The problem is that such an approach pays off in some situations, less in others. For example, there are sequences in which you are attacked by a large number of enemies simultaneously that go down in one fell swoop, regardless of their size. These are well-crafted moments that immediately bring to mind certain scenes from the films and that offer an enviable pace (and are also very well suited to the characters). However, when the enemies become more resistant, having so many on the screen creates a certain confusion, also fueled by the light weight of our fists, which often seem to slipoff. Fortunately, moves have been added that allow you to break free, but the problem remains in part. It must also be said that as the levels go by, that is, after having done a lot of practice, you discover some facets of the combat system that highlight an unexpected depth, which is more evident when you play in pairs and are able to use fully the combined techniques. Alone, unfortunately, it is difficult to make the CPU understand what you want to do and, consequently, we tend to use above all the basic moves and not to consider the possibilities offered by the collaboration. Translation: if you can, play it with a friend. Instead, we would have expected something more from the bosses. Of course, each of them offers its own challenge and must be tackled in a different way, observing their movements and evaluating the possibilities offered by the scenario, with some solutions that are decidedly tasty. Unfortunately it is undeniable that they are very easy (advice: play immediately on the maximum difficulty level), especially when compared with those of other titles of the same genre, such as the recent Mother Russia Bleeds, whose level of challenge is much higher. The mini-games are also ambivalent: some are very fun and very suitable for the characters, such as those in which you have to press two keys in rhythm to beat up your opponents while remaining off the field or the various chases which, although not transcendental, are fast and spot on; others are less successful, such as the dune buggy race which is poorly done precisely in its fundamental mechanics (slimy driving system, completely absent artificial intelligence of the opponents). Finally, commendable having made the gameplay more varied with the addition of some small puzzles and a real stealth sequence. Nothing too complex, but these are moments that break the rhythm of the action, giving it a wider scope.", "date": "2018-04-26", "grade": "7.8"}
