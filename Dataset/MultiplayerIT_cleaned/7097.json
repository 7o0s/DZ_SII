An American vigilante who steals from the rich to give to himself, at least so it seems, and who to do so resorts to the wildest hack of a global computer network that controls and contains the data of the entire population of Chicago. The story is now known, namely that of a theft gone wrong that puts an unscrupulous criminal association on his heels which, in an attempt to eliminate him, causes the accidental death of his niece. From then on, Aiden just wants to understand why it has come this far and, above all, he wants to take revenge by resorting to any means, scorched earth around himself in a succession of supporting actors, sometimes borderline situations and different gameplay elements that work, starting from innovative ideas for a successful genre, that of free roaming, which struggles to say something new. In retrospect, Aiden's toughest feat seems to have been getting into stores, starting with a trailer that had us even wondering what kind of game it could be about for so long it seemed like the brainchild of a visionary game designer, arriving at a sandbox which, along the lines of GTA, focuses all the will to innovate on the means that a mobile phone provides the protagonist for interacting with the environment. Having taken note of what is being played, it takes about thirty hours to finish Watch Dogs: we liked it and we advise you to play it, trying to explain why first. After months of talk, it's time for the Watch Dogs review! Curiosity From today, both on Android and iOS it is possible to download the Watch Dogs companion app which, again in exchange for skill points and experience to grow your character, allows you to play even if you don't own the packaged title and for free. What do you do from tablets and smartphones? The challenge is launched to those who are running around Chicago and they hurl police cars and helicopters at them. Whoever is inside the real game must escape by car and reach the last of the checkpoints provided. A spy story Watch Dogs is confirmed as a dramatic title, a spy story that leads a man to discover himself through the lives of others. At the end of the game, Aiden knows who he is, but only after having rummaged through all the chaos that gravitates around him and in Chicago, a city that is peppered with elements that are almost all functional to playability. This process does not happen without trauma, yes for the protagonist, but also for the player, given that the adult plot is told through a series of beautiful characters who, however, are not given the right space, leaving some narrative holes here and there too much. Some protagonists, without wanting to go into detail so as not to spoil any of the surprises that the game is undoubtedly full of, are real missed opportunities, both well constructed and too quickly left to their fate without leaving the right mark. The story itself is pretty standard, but it's inevitable to grow attached to Aiden, so imperfect, and to the idea of wanting to help him find out why so much violence has befallen his life. You may not like the reason, the context may or may not convince you, but at least it cannot be said that the guys at Ubisoft have limited themselves to doing a little homework trying to achieve the success that these titles can achieve. Aiden's cell phone never stops and, as previously noted, the idea of being able to profile all the NPCs in the city, stealing their name, surname, sexual inclinations, income, up to recording private conversations or exchanges of messages , it helps not to feel their presence as that of simple animated puppets, which now often happens in this type of game in which you wander through huge environments where it is easier to destroy a bus with a rocket launcher than to have a word with a newsagent . Watch Dogs doesn't solve this problem, but it undoubtedly puts forward an idea that limits the sense of dj vu which is inevitable on these occasions and which helps to feel part of a lively context in which the inhabitants have their things to do and their petty crimes to accomplish. The map, however quite vast, unfolds between industrial ports, a downtown full of skyscrapers and a small rural part immediately outside, an area where trees and lakes give some relief to the claustrophobia of buildings that is felt for almost the whole time. The streets are littered with opportunities for cell phone intervention that can change the colors of traffic lights, raise traffic pylons, raise drawbridges and blow up manhole covers, but the team's clever level design has ensured that the experience does not turn into a randomly press the Ha buttonck on the pad to make anything happen to get rid of, in case, police and pursuers. We soon realize that not all roads have what's right for us and that we have to juggle to get the desired result, we have to try to head towards areas that we know we can exploit properly or resort to alternative strategies such as looking for where to hide perhaps lying down in the shade of the dashboard of the car you are using. The other novelty is that in Watch Dogs, when the police get alert or the bad guys are after you, you can reasonably escape by reaching the water and swimming or stealing a speedboat, because there is no rational reason why you should always find a patrol at to wait for us on the other side of a huge river when those pursuing us on the other side have lost their way. The city therefore becomes a tool for doing things and the real weapon at the service of the protagonist, who can emerge unscathed from a fight also thanks to the many interactive elements of the seabed and the technology worn by his assailants. The combat system you don't expect The map of Chicago soon thickens with icons with things to do. The yellow icons indicate the various steps of the main mission, those in blue and gray the many parallel activities. The main missions already offer enough variety since they almost never resolve in a go to point A and collect object B and which often offer diversions to the pure action and which often indulge in excellent stealth mechanics both on foot and by car. In any case, the analysis of the environment is fundamental, which must be done by passing from one surveillance camera to another and being able to understand how, where and when to move. In more than one case we are also asked to guide another of the characters to escape, showing him where to hide or where to run to avoid patrols and guards, studying the moves of the NPCs and luring them into dead ends by ringing cell phones or setting off the alarm of parked cars. An excellent sandbox therefore, aided by various intelligent ideas such as forcing the player to hack even the mobile cameras (similar to go pro) installed on the jackets of the bad guys on duty to be taken to inaccessible rooms so as to be able to violate security systems or switches otherwise unreachable. When Watch Dogs gives its best, there are very few moments to do all this, on pain of failure or having to resort to the combat system which is well done anyway. There's a good cover system, which only gives problems when you need to change sides of the same cover, and above all there's a huge skill tree in which to spend the skill points earned by climbing the 50 possible experience levels and which give Aiden a myriad of more possibilities, distributed between combat skills, the ability to hack increasingly complex systems, build useful objects to blackout the city or to interrupt communications between the guards, or to improve his chances of surviving during long chases by car or motorbike. The driving model, however, is not convincing both in terms of vehicle response and in terms of audio. The blows are felt, the explosions that can be caused by hacking explosives or control units while our opponents pass us unaware are exhilarating and the feeling of being able to always marry different approaches is simply gratifying. A bit like the characters, unfortunately, not all the potential is taken to the extreme consequences and you never get to the firefight in which to realize yourself as real urban heroes, but a good rate of challenge can be found in a series of secondary missions in which you have to defeat the outposts of some gangs scattered throughout the territory which usually require you to clear your way up to the boss on duty without being able to kill him. However, such complexity deserved a few more tough missions, without a doubt. Where, on the other hand, there is little to object to is in the level design of the city and of the databases that must be hacked to have access to all the missions and data of the various districts of Chicago. Imagine a series of control units scattered on walls and in rooms that must be reached physically or visually using the ubiquitous security cameras. Since Aiden isn't a superman, he can't climb wherever he likes but he has to figure out where to go, where to explore to find the cables and joints useful for sneaking into these complex security systems. Thus, the streets and buildings are filled with large environmental puzzles that force you to look and understand how to read walls and walls in what is a great way to recover the map of a city that is no longer just a megaarena in which to blow things up. To better understand this concept, one of the optional missions is enough in which you have to scan giant QR codes printed on walls and billboards, even distant from each other. Aiden must find the right camera to tile the different parts of the code so that they flatten into a two-dimensional image that he can detect. Finding such fresh and innovative ideas in a triple-A game rather than an indie title is undoubtedly a pleasant surprise. Too discreet a voyeur After all, Aiden is a voyeur, someone who can rummage through people's lives at the touch of a button and mind their own business, even the most private ones. The context is set up, the pretext as well and there are some secondary missions in which, solving the usual mechanisms of control units and contacts, one can sneak into a series of apartments in which to witness scenes from a slightly sick everyday life that ranging from couples in crisis, to friends who will not become lovers, through professional stalkers and plumbers who hook up after fixing a pipe in the kitchen of a beautiful girl in trouble. The fact is that Ubisoft, despite having a PEGI 18-branded game in its hands, leaves everything too much on the surface and that the narrative possibilities offered by this system are only scratched. We're not saying that Watch Dogs could have given the scene to a series of amateur porn images, but certainly after Mass Effect or after certain epic moments of GTA IV we were hoping for a mature title in the truest sense of the term. More courageous, basically. The plot of the game itself, about halfway through, has a moment that could really kick off a seminal game in terms of narrative strength, while ending up just being the most engaging moment of the game (for us, that's a phase that is really worth the rest) and to start a series of secondary missions that are still pleasant to face. Where instead Morin and associates hit the mark is in what are called Digital Trips, four mini-games triggered by taking digital drugs and which project Aiden into alternative worlds that allow him to do things like fly between buildings, bouncing on the petals of huge polygonal flowers, or take on the role of a mega mechanical spider to destroy cars, police vans and satellite dishes, jumping from one roof to another and collecting bonuses. Leaving aside a sort of Carmageddon in which to score points by rolling demonic passers-by, the one we liked the most was the opening of a fog-shrouded Chicago in which to overcome the guard of soldiers, distant cousins of the Hellgast of Killzone, in order to be able to violate increasingly distant control points with an excellent mix of open violence and the need to resort to the game's stealth mechanics. Each of these activities has a dedicated and complex skill tree to unlock in order to obtain ever higher scores in the digital trips themselves, but reaching a certain level unlocks skills that are also good for the main single campaign, which is true for each of the different types of optional missions. In short, there are quite a few things to do and in addition to the time to devote to getting to the end credits, you can spend dozens of hours, we estimate around fifty, to finish all the possible secondary activities. The contents are not lacking, therefore, and are supported by a gameplay which, as mentioned, works from almost all points of view. Playstation 4 trophies Free roaming, you know, is never easy to platinum and Watch Dogs is no exception. There are, of course, the trophies related to the completion of the different chapters of the main quest, but being able to complete the work will take a long time. Between online activities and those related to the various skills, one must arm oneself with a lot of patience. Chicago at night Ubisoft has always talked about Watch Dogs as a real next gen game and, if surely many of the ideas behind them are innovative and help support this sensation, it will be inevitable that those who play do not expect an evolution in this sense even from the visual point of view. We've played the PlayStation 4 version, but it's been said several times that even on past-generation consoles the experience should be similar in all respects. Chicago is interactive in dozens of elements on the screen, the particle system and that of dynamic lights are excellent, enhanced above all in the night phases, when buildings and lampposts light up due to the sparks that spring from electrical panels or detonated explosives without the engine slowing down from 30 frames shown on screen. This speed and solidity are especially appreciated in Digital Trips when in p", "date": "2014-05-27", "grade": "9.0"}
