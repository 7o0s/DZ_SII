{"name": "The downward spiral", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120980-spiral-episode-1-the-downward-spiral.html", "text": "At its debut on iOS, the Pixel Hero Games team has certainly not chosen the most comfortable way, in fact deciding to try their hand at an episodic adventure with an original plot, with a gameplay that mixes action and RPG elements and a graphic design based on the 'Unreal Engine that aims at the top of the category. In short, a project that is not insignificant, which however, judging by what this first chapter shows, already seems to be creaking under the weight of its ambition. Tempus fugit The inadequacy of Spiral Episode 1 as a mobile game manifests itself in a glaring way in the very first moments after starting the application, when one realizes that it takes the beauty of a minute and a half of initial loading (on both devices covered by the our test) before being able to start playing: an absolutely crazy timing, furthermore carried out by a looping animation without any information text on the screen, which at first can lead you to think even that the software has stopped. Another clue in favor of the thesis that the developers of Pixel Hero Games have not fully understood the fundamentals of videogame use on mobile devices then comes from the save system: there is no manual function, and the game does not bother to inform the the user of reaching a checkpoint, causing the constant risk of exiting the game and finding himself having to repeat portions of gameplay. A really annoying eventuality, even more so if we consider that the strictly playful component of Spiral Episode 1 leaves a lot to be desired. The game is configured as an action adventure with a splash of RPG (limited to the fact that the protagonist levels up by accumulating experience) which basically does not convince in any of its main pillars, starting with exploration. The environments made available are as vast as they are dramatically empty of elements to interact with, reducing everything to very linear walks interspersed with some unfortunate excursions into stealth and platform territory. The action phases are instead resolved in fights that on paper would seem to work, but which on balance turn out to be decidedly subdued in this case too. Once the opponents have been engaged, the protagonist Tempus decides independently which weapon to use based on the distance from the target, being able to count on melee attacks, a stick to cover greater distances and a firearm for long range. In the intentions of the developers, the entire system had to be based on simple touches on the screen, which in fact occurred to the detriment of enjoyment and to the advantage of confusion: you tap an opponent to hit him, a double tap to dodge and a long press for a charged attack, while doing nothing Tempus autonomously parries all the hits. Spiral Episode 1 has a lot of ambition, betrayed however by an implementation that is simply not convincing Too bad that, with more than one enemy on the screen (that is, practically always) the system goes ballistic, with combo attempts that are confused with dodging and vice versa, all while being attacked from several sides without being able to count on the speed of action needed to respond effectively. Things are not even better in terms of simple navigation of the environment, with Tempus which should move to the point indicated by the user with a tap on the screen, but which in reality ends up getting stuck with elements of the scenario more often than not: there is the possibility of manually managing everything by holding down the finger and thus making a virtual stick appear, but even in this case a noticeable lack of responsiveness is perceived. As is evident from the aspects listed so far, Spiral Episode 1 cannot be considered a satisfactory experience, even if with the next episodes the developers may have the possibility to correct the shot, limiting the inadequacies of the gameplay and focusing on the only two aspects that are really product positives. Let's talk about the plot, which puts on the plate several interesting ideas that will probably be explored in the following chapters, and above all of the graphic creation, with the Unreal Engine exploited properly to build large and detailed scenarios and convincing polygonal models with good animations. Unfortunately, however, we return to levels of absolute mediocrity as regards the dubbing in English, at times really embarrassing for the quality of the acting.", "date": "2013-07-10", "grade": "5.0"}
