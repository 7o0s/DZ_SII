Titles such as Adam Saltsman's Hundreds and Greg Lobanov's Perfection have demonstrated how the touch interface of the iPhone and iPad can be used to create brilliant challenges, but so simple that they don't require much explanation. Already winner of several international awards, Blek proposes an idea that just looking at it makes one wonder why no other developer had thought of it before. Intuitive, immediate, fun, modelable by the player and impossible to replicate without a large touch screen at hand. From Austria comes Blek, an elegant and creative iPad puzzle game Bek in Blek The one created by brothers Denis and Davor Mikan is halfway between a puzzle game and a drawing board: by passing a finger across the screen you can draw a line of any shape, whether it's a long spiral, a small arc or a slightly zigzag. crooked. The beauty comes when you take your finger off the screen, as your creation comes to life and crosses the screen repeating the pattern created by the player. So if you create an arc, for example, the line begins to move up and down like a snake, in an almost hypnotic loop that replicates both the chosen direction and speed. The Austrian authors don't give any tutorials, no information, with the player who, drawing one line after another, has to figure out what to do and how to proceed from one screen to another on his own. The goal is to collect all the colored dots scattered around the level and avoid touching the black ones, an idea that by itself seems anything but original, but which becomes unique thanks to the type of input required. So you have to try and try again until you get the right pattern that allows you to find that line that, crossing the scenario from one point to another, touches all the colored points without colliding with the obstacles along the way. There is no single solution, nor a perfect technique to learn, so each person might find a different way to solve the puzzle. Someone in the editorial team passed a level by drawing a sine wave, while others found it more convenient to draw a line and bounce it off the edge of the screen; in the same way there were those who tended to study the level before drawing, while someone else preferred to approach the solution by making quick attempts, tracing small lines of different shapes and observing their behaviour. It is a very personal experience, linked both to the ability to predict the path of one's creation, and to the creativity of the player, who is encouraged to draw new shapes instead of using and adapting the usual two or three patterns. Precisely for this reason it can happen to get stuck in a level for a long time and easily overcome the ones immediately following, but certainly those who don't have patience and don't like trial and error experiences will find it very difficult to digest a game like Blek. Being able to complete the sixty scenarios will be an almost titanic undertaking for many, and even if the first puzzles can be solved simply by trying, it soon becomes essential to ~decipher~ the level and find the hint hidden in the arrangement of the obstacles. In some scenarios there are also colored dots that rotate and which must be collected at the right time, dividing and creating a ripple effect. Too bad that, despite the interesting idea, some of these require perhaps an excessive dose of patience and timing, suddenly making the difficulty curve soar and risking discouraging less tenacious players. In this swing that alternates very difficult puzzles with others that can be almost trivial, it certainly doesn't help the absence of a way to allow the player to skip a particularly difficult scenario, and so it can happen to stay still for a long time. Final mention for the care in the presentation, given that, as mentioned at the beginning, the simplicity of the concept behind Blek goes hand in hand with a minimalist but absolutely elegant aesthetic realization, above all thanks to the sound effects that accompany the movement of the line, the collection of a colored dot or impact against an obstacle. All tiny details which, however, as in the excellent Threes, enrich and enhance the gaming experience.", "date": "2014-03-31", "grade": "8.5"}
