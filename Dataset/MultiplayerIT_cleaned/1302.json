{"name": "RalliSport Challenge 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rallisport-challenge-2.html", "text": "Arcade simulator The new RalliSport is the ideal companion to another excellent sequel which is Project Gotham Racing 2, itself a sequel to a very good first generation title. The ~half-brother~ has the presumption to position itself as the ideal model and beacon of every Rally driving game from now on, exactly as it did at its PGR2 release for arcade matrix road driving games. A very ambitious work to which the Digital Illusion developers have dedicated these last two years. The first difference that catches the eye is the inclusion of this title within the Xbox Sport Network, an option that will allow all players to participate in what is presented as the largest online videogame tournament ever existed. Participants from all over the world, from the United States to Japan, will compete for all sorts of titles and prizes with the inclusion of their times in a local and world ranking. Factor not to be underestimated since it allows you to virtually extend the life of the video game in an almost infinite way, giving it a powerful longevity. Surely, given the high popularity of online play with Project GR2, it won't take long to fill the servers of RalliSport Challenge 2. The game modes have multiplied so as not to disadvantage offline play at the expense of playing exclusively on the Internet. We are not dealing with a trivial update of the previous game system, but with a completely new and infinitely more varied one. The three old modes have become multiple, multiplying each of them with the possibility of choosing between even more diversified tracks and as many cars with which to participate. Finally, each car can be modified in every aspect of the engine before the start of the race. The introduced possibility of being able to change many of the vehicle's characteristics will help to find our personal driving style and to be able to tackle each track with the right calibration of the engine, chassis and tyres, which can be saved on HD. Always in order not to disadvantage the offline game mode, the A.I. of wall players has been adjusted upwards, giving CPU-controlled opponents more competitiveness. The response of the commands is always immediate and precise, wheels and brakes do their job thanks to the perfect functionality of the triggers. The behavior of the cars on the track is never nervous but rather, the latter always let themselves be steered, braked and accelerated in a natural and convincing way. The driving style is in fact anchored to a strong arcade component and can be compared with the high maneuverability of the Project Gotham Racing 2 vehicles. RalliSport has ensured that it can thus be played by the highest possible number of people and, despite this large accessibility, to remain a fun and complete title from all points of view. Precisely for this factor RalliSport is clearly opposed to the opponent Colin McRae 4 of Codemaster, of the opposite philosophy and tending towards pure realism. The learning curve is much shorter than games like GranTurismo, so it's less frustrating and more immediate to learn to drive vehicles. Audio-video compartment to scream The aesthetic component of RalliSport is something truly exceptional. Rarely have such detailed, defined and above all diversified scenarios been seen in a video game. The race environments change from the classic deserts, to cities, villages, snow-capped mountains, desolate countryside, day, night and every existing climatic condition, from the classic rain to winter snow. The heavy use of bump mapping and lighting effects makes the racing grounds and asphalt feel more real than ever. The cars are made up of a very high number of polygons and their bodies have a sparkling Environmental mapping that lets us reflect on everything that flows next to us. The deformation of the polygonal models of the car bodies is very accurate: the damage is truly realistic and the cars will be damaged exactly in correspondence with the accidents, losing pieces according to the intensity and violence of the impact. In the car, everything can be broken: lights, glass, bonnet, tyres, chassis. It is also incredible to note the quantity of elements inserted in the contour: often dozens of trees whiz by the edges of the track. Stopping, it is possible to notice how each of them sways with the wind and lets many leaves fall. By shifting the attention to the surrounding ground it will not be difficult to see multiple tufts of grass swaying too. Buildings, houses and towns are simply photorealistic and when the horizon becomes distant it is possible to notice how every detail always remains clearly visible and real. In gThe general impression that the new RalliSport graphics engine gives is that of being a very solid polygon grinder full of effects and gems. All this without ever affecting the game framerate, fixed at 60fps. The audio sector, as well as the graphic one, is at the top. The most recurring theme is mainly Rock, and it gives relief to note how it never manages to annoy even after hours of play unlike many other games of the genre. In addition, the environmental effects, voices and car rumbles are the most realistic you have ever heard in a Rally game. Innovations: the summary. As previously mentioned, the most acclaimed and apt introduction is that of online competition through XSN Sports which brings a real videogame world championship to your Xbox. The new game mechanics interact perfectly with the Xbox Live! system. RalliSport includes five different types of Rally competitions: Cross country rally, Rallycross (short tracks, indoor at high speed), ice race (what the name suggests), hill climb race (mountains, hills and each track has climbs and downhill), and finally the innovative Incrocio, like a car motocross, with high-speed parallel circuits that intersect at one or more than one point, making the challenges more dangerous and exciting in Fast and Furious style. The new graphics engine makes sparks: damage to the cars done very well that affect the driveability of the vehicle, polygons increased dramatically both on the cars and in the surrounding settings. RalliSport also includes more than 40 selectable cars, including the fateful ~group B~ which was excluded due to the unspeakable power of the engines that made the cars almost uncontrollable, and more than 200 secrets to unlock in the career mode. The tracks have also increased: almost double compared to the prequel, and they range from Australia to the Nordic countries, from the Pacific coast to the Alpine mountains through snow, rain, wind and fog. The inclusion of numerous goodies such as the signs of the brake discs, mountains that crumble as we pass with rolling boulders, new rain effects and splashes on the bodywork are also welcome. Innovations: the summary. Comment We can speak of RalliSport Challenge 2 as the most complete arcade Rally game in existence and add to this definition also that of the best graphics ever seen, so much so that we can consider the Digital Illusions game a must for Xbox owners. By virtue of the marked arcade component, this title is proposed as a valid alternative to all the more simulative rally games, strong in immediate playability capable of entertaining for hours and hours without tiring. Thinking then that RalliSport 2 is also virtually infinite thanks to the challenges via the Internet, it is easy to understand that we are facing one of the best Xbox games and one of the best games of this genre ever to appear on the Console. Great expectations, fulfilled or disappointed? RalliSport Challenge 2 is the sequel to Digital Illusion's acclaimed game, one of the most acclaimed games in Xbox's debut line-up. After being parked for more than two years at the developers' studios, finally here it is, and it is easy to see that much more has been done than a simple restyling or upgrade of the prequel. RalliSport Challenge 2 makes use of numerous innovations such as a completely new graphics engine, the possibility of playing online on Xbox Live!, numerous new game modes, many new cars and tracks and also the opportunity to participate in tournaments and championships worldwide through XSNsports.com.", "date": "2004-05-20", "grade": null}
