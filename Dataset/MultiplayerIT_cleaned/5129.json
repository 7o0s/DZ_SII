In most cases, developers who decide to tackle this topic tend to rely on electronic, pop or commercial tones, perhaps presenting the hottest hits of the moment as a main dish. The Superb team has instead preferred to go against the tide, offering with the present Pianista a rhythm game entirely based on classical music which aims both to involve those who think that Bach is only the one of flowers, and to wink at the enthusiasts. Pianista is a solid and addictive rhythm game, but the freemium system is not entirely convincing The classic that commits As easily understood from the title, Pianista virtually makes the user sit on a piano stool and allows him to have the illusion of playing some famous pieces of classical music. All this relies on an ultra-tested game system that will appear immediately familiar to anyone who has had to deal even once with an exponent of the genre: the notes to be played are therefore represented by indicators that must be pressed with the due timing when they reach the horizontal line at the bottom of the screen. There are three different types of icons and six lanes on which they scroll, so it goes without saying that as a Pianist (especially at higher difficulty levels) you will find your ideal scenario with the smartphone lying on a surface and both the user's hands busy tapping on the display. The feeling is excellent, thanks to essential but always fluid graphics and above all to a very precise and satisfying detection system. It doesn't hurt that the musical selection is particularly rich, both in terms of content and quality: the tracklist includes the beauty of 39 songs taken from the most famous works of 14 artists of the caliber of Beethoven, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Verdi and more . As icing on the cake, Pianista then guarantees a very considerable level of challenge which potentially greatly increases its longevity: for each game session it is possible to select between the normal and the technical mode (practically reserved for professional musicians), the speed of the and even fading in or out of indicators. So a standing ovation performance? Not really: the downside of Pianista is there and it can be seen, and it is clearly manifested in the many limitations of the freemium model adopted by the application. First of all, it is not allowed to freely choose the work to be played: the main mode in fact allows you to perform a rotation of songs established by the software, while the individual tracks can be purchased in the appropriate shop by spending the gold coins accumulated with the various games. Unfortunately, the income tends to be quite small, the cost of the pieces is decidedly high and a stamina system (appropriately represented by musical notes) also gets in the way, which decreases as you play and which recharges over time or with the inevitable injection of real money. Even for those wishing to reach out to their wallets, Pianista presents a decidedly hefty bill: by making the necessary conversions between real and virtual currency, each work is sold for between 3 and 5, which means that an insane amount of 150. With a little holy patience, however, all the contents of Pianista can be unlocked even just by playing, which limits the damage of a commercial choice that is still quite questionable.", "date": "2016-12-14", "grade": "8.0"}
