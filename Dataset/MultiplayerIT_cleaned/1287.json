{"name": "Mx Unleashed 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mx-unleashed-2004.html", "text": "Two less wheels, a lot more pain At first glance, MX Unleashed may appear to be simply a version of ATV Offroad with motorcycles, and in many ways that is true; after all, it's still a question of running on dirt tracks (outdoors and indoors) full of bumps and bumps in an attempt to cross the finish line first, perhaps showing off some tricks along the way. What is certain, therefore, is that MX Unleashed retains the same game mechanics of its previous four-wheelers (and, as we will see, also the defects), while not disdaining some structural innovations. The most obvious lies in the adoption of motorcycles as racing vehicles, which naturally have a different driving model compared to quads: and once again, the Rainbow Studios programmers have had the opportunity to demonstrate their ability in this sense, putting hands of the user of the two wheels easy to maneuver but at the same time with a very credible behavior. It only takes a few minutes of play to find yourself capable of managing the bike in all its aspects, launching yourself into powerful drifts and dizzying jumps: the mechanism of the latter, in particular, has remained substantially unchanged from the previous Offroad ATVs, with the user busy loading the suspensions immediately before the take-off (by tilting the left stick downwards) and then take a leap proportionate to the force impressed. In addition to guaranteeing the altitude necessary to perform the tricks, a correct determination of the jumps is necessary to aspire to the first positions during the competitions. The conformation of the tracks is in fact specially designed to stimulate the player's precision in this sense, on pain of losing precious seconds or, worse, disastrous falls; therefore, making a leap that is too large could lead the motorcycle off the road, while conversely an excessively little push can cause it to land on the uphill plane of a subsequent slope, with the above consequences. It goes without saying therefore that this proves to be the backbone of every MX Unleashed competition: in short, precise jumps mean victory, even if actually we must also consider the complicity of the opponents' AI, far from striking. In the long run, this last flaw tends to flatten the various races of the game: once sufficient familiarity has been acquired, it takes very little to always make precise jumps, diminishing the races to a solitary domain idly enlivened by the execution of tricks, however useless in economy of these competitions. He's good, but he doesn't apply But the most substantial novelty of MX Unleashed is certainly in the Freeworld mode. Similar to what was seen in the excellent SSX3, in this section of the game the user is free to move within very extensive scenarios within which there are light cones relating to a whole series of different challenges. The nature of these competitions ranges from simple trick contests to spectacular races against unconventional vehicles such as 4x4s, dune buggies and even a helicopter, which reward the player by giving them the chance to get behind the wheel of those same vehicles. In short, the Freestyle mode certainly proves to be an excellent complement to the otherwise sleepy Carreer Mode, and yet it cannot by itself remove from the user who has already had the opportunity to play ATV Offroad Fury an annoying feeling of ~already seen~. As mentioned at the beginning of the review, in fact, it is not wrong to define MX Unleashed simply as the motocross version of the previous Rainbow Studios works, with all the consequences that this entails. And if on the one hand the slavish transposition of a more than adequate game structure and technical sector does not cause a sensation, the same cannot be said about the failure to review the defects. In short, the developers certainly could have made MX Unleashed a better title, but they limited themselves to doing the homework without trying too hard. Jokes aside, however, MX Unleashed remains an absolutely discreet product both from a playful point of view, as we have seen, and in terms of cosmetics: as per Rainbow Studios tradition, the user has the opportunity to run within scenarios from unlimited visual horizon, expertly modeled and sufficiently varied. Then the polygonal models of the motorcycles and the riders are excellent, decidedly convincing also in terms of animations, especially on the occasion of the disastrous falls that can be encountered. Even the sound proves accurate, especially in the sector of effects, absolutely plausible in reproducing the noise of motorcycle engines. The roundup closes the inevitable soundtrack based on punk and hard rock, cheeringat first but certainly not unforgettable. Comment MX Unleashed is a good title, which manages without too much effort to extend the positive streak of Rainbow Studios that began with the two ATV Offroad Fury. The American coders got smart and instead of risking the rejection of users by proposing a third title based on racing with quads, they thought well of changing the subject of the action while keeping the basic structure of the product substantially unchanged. Leaving aside the new Freeworld mode, in fact, very few elements have undergone changes, beyond the obviously different behavior of the motorbikes compared to the quads: the graphics have not improved much, the gameplay has not undergone important changes and the AI has been unjustly left unchanged. In short, although certainly appreciable, MX Unleashed proves to be a decidedly more suitable title for uninitiated users than the two previous Raibow Studios productions: for everyone else, deja-vu is dangerously lurking. In the beginning it was Excitebike. Starting from the classic Nintendo, the motocross discipline has always been able to count on a relatively large number of titles dedicated to it, on essentially every available platform. Precisely for this reason, the genre has been largely eviscerated, without leaving much room for innovations that did not result in the most brazen arcade. It is no coincidence, therefore, that with this MX Unleashed Rainbow Studios has decided to focus everything on a plausible driving model and on a solid play structure, without too many extravagances. And the results are certainly satisfying.", "date": "2004-06-14", "grade": null}
