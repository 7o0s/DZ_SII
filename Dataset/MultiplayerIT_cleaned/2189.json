{"name": "Virtua Tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-tennis_a.html", "text": "Graphics and Sound Virtua Tennis, although released a few years ago, still manages to make its appearance at ~extreme~ resolutions thanks to today's possibilities! The players and their movements are beautifully done, even the stadiums show some care. The surrounding elements such as the public, the ball boys, the weather aspect, could certainly be improved, in any case you won't pay much attention to it since 90% of the time you will be concentrated solely on the movements of the players and the ball. As already mentioned, the final version is (clearly) equipped with sound effects, but among the classic ~appropriate~ noises, noises associated with the ~movement~ of the players on the various terrains have been added, which at times become really annoying when perhaps performed too often. Fortunately, not all courts are equipped with these nice sound effects ranging from the classic crunch of shoes on the floor to the sound of sand being trampled. In the background there is also some rocking music that can be listened to effortlessly. The game The game possibilities vary from the classic ~arcade~ mode, which follows the arcade version, in which you will choose your favorite tennis player and face a sequence of five matches up to the ~final~. The second game mode, the most interesting and long-lived, is the championship mode! In this mode you will have to try to climb the professional rankings and to do this you will have to participate (and win) in the various tournaments around the world. When you win a tournament or when you pass a training session, other tournaments will be unlocked, or some of the already existing ones will be ~upgraded~, in the sense that by participating again you will find more capable opponents, the same thing will happen for the training sessions. A detail to note is that the announcer of the various matches will speak in the language of the country hosting the tournament! Also in this mode you can participate in some tournaments that will include challenges between pairs of tennis players: in this case your partner will be ~bought~ in one of the various shops that will pop up around the world. Also in these shops you can enable new characters to choose from or new stadiums, new ~skins~ and so on. The game model is really simple: there are two buttons, one for the shots and the other for the lob. The longer you wait for your opponent's shot to arrive, the stronger your return will be, clearly if you manage to get to the ball at the last moment the resulting shot will be very weak. The type of shot you are going to make will depend on your position on the court and the position of the ball in relation to you. In conclusion Playing Virtua Tennis is really fun, even in single player, the opponents are still quite unpredictable and offer a decent challenge. The defects present are very few as far as playability is concerned: the main one, if we can speak of a defect, is that of course Virtua Tennis is not a real ~simulation~ of Tennis, so seeing mistakes made in the match will be very rare. Being able to make Aces or send the ball to the net will be very rare, but just watch any tennis match to realize how even the greatest champions manage to make mistakes quite often. However, the main fun however, as in the arcade version, comes from playing with your friends since after a sufficiently high number of games you will begin to learn all the various decision making patterns of the artificial intelligence linked to computer controlled players. In any case, thanks to the championship mode, the game can offer a fair longevity before it can be finished. If only there was the possibility to grow one's character (we will only be able to buy ~new rackets~ and ~strengthening drinks~) in the various skills we will be faced with a true masterpiece. I haven't seen a game like this since Blue Byte's Pro Tennis Tour for the Amiga, recommended to anyone who likes tennis! Virtual Tennis The conversion of the famous game that depopulated in arcades and on the Dreamcast has finally arrived on our PCs, in fact we are finally in our hands the final version! Compared to the beta, the various bugs have naturally been fixed and the sound has been added. For those who still don't know anything about the aforementioned title, Virtua Tennis is one of the few tennis games that are truly worthy of the name to arrive.iv on your PC. Its great value was to offer a highly simple but at the same time very reflective style of play and therefore capable of attracting all types of gamers.", "date": "2002-03-21", "grade": null}
