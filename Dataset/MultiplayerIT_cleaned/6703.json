It is therefore right to clarify the assumptions of the judgment that can be given to the expansion of a game in the making like any MMO: let's comment on the initial proposal, without a crystal ball to tell us if Blizzard will improve or worsen the situation, so that those who purchase the package know what they are getting into. And if Blizzard decides to abandon World of Warcraft to itself as happened in the last year of Mists of Pandaria, we'll talk about it again. Meanwhile, fresh from the first raid on Highmaul, we want to reflect on this first month of the game: we have upgraded the garrison and all its buildings to the third stage, we have completed each cycle of missions in each map, faced the invasions, fought the rare enemies , scavenge for treasures, battle new pet trainers, craft jewelry and armor, train an army of followers, and complete each dungeon in normal and heroic modes. And now that the endgame begins and the progression necessarily slows down, we are ready to talk, and a lot, about Draenor and its nice warlords. Warlords of Draenor is a great expansion, but Blizzard must be careful not to lose momentum Draenor, yesterday Blizzard's approach to the new expansion has been discussed a lot, because many believed it was a gamble to revive the planet that we have already explored with the name of Outlands in 2006, when The Burning Crusade expansion was released and the guys from Irvine had skipped the shark, passing from fantasy to science fiction between aliens and spaceships. The Draenor of this alternative timeline in which Garrosh Hellscream has found refuge, however, is not a recycled world, but a setting completely rebuilt from scratch and at the same time faithful to the mythology of the saga. Thanks to the new engine, the polygonal models redesigned with the latest game update, the high resolution textures and the dynamic effects gradually implemented over the years, the old/new Draenor is a simply amazing scenario in which to experience the new adventure. The merit is also, and above all, of the level design, conceived keeping in mind the (temporary?) Absence of flying mounts: the regions that make up Draenor are intricate, complex, irregular and despite being bound to the terrain, one enjoys a enormous freedom of movement. The guys at Blizzard took advantage of the structural complexity to fill each map with hidden treasures, puzzles, platforming sections and underwater areas, reinvigorating a sense of exploration that flying mounts had mitigated since their implementation and helping to liven up a world where, finally , you meet other players again along the paths, in the forests or on the mountains. From a purely artistic point of view, Warlords of Draenor is a true triumph of colors and details, and it is no coincidence that the technical requirements bar has been raised, contrary to a tradition that has always seen World of Warcraft as a technically subpar to run on the craziest PCs. Exploring the Shadowmoon Valley still untouched under the immense satellite that stands out in the sky, the boundless snow-buried wastelands of Frostfire or the mountains of Gorgrond, to name three of the most impressive and varied areas, is a thrilling experience, above all for those who have played The Burning Crusade and are able to grasp, with a sinking heart, all the little quotes, details and references. From 90 to 100 The leveling phase is probably the most successful part of the expansion in many ways. Those expecting who knows what innovations in terms of gameplay will be disappointed: Warlords of Draenor is World of Warcraft hard and pure with its kill, collect and deliver missions that have redefined the genre of theme-park MMORPGs. Blizzard, however, has implemented in practically every region an amalgam of all those mechanics conceived over the years, such as vehicles and phasing, so as to make the experience always sparkling, interesting and never really boring. The best news is not so much the open missions that are activated and deactivated simply by entering the interested area, but the ~episodes~ that outline the most important narrative cycles of a region and culminate in a final storyline complete with interlude cinematic. The episodic structure of the missions has two important consequences: first, it allows you to identify the most important quests and perhaps ignore the filler onesand optional; second, it breaks the linear progression to which the old expansions have accustomed us, dislocating multiple hubs simultaneously in the same region and allowing the player to choose how many and which questlines to carry out according to his times and his interests. Exploration then merges with progression into a dynamic and engaging whole. Leveling proceeds at a rapid pace and perhaps Blizzard has not managed to balance it well, from a strictly arithmetic point of view, given that the new level cap is easily reached even before entering the last area, Nagrand. On the other hand, it is a solution designed to circumvent the absence of new skills or spells, limited to a handful of upgrades and a final triptych of talents at level 100, leading players to the heart of the expansion, the endgame, in the shortest possible time. In short, from this point of view, the leveling is much better structured than in the past, thanks also to the variety of options that guarantee experience points: the discovery of new areas or hidden treasures, the killing of the many rare monsters scattered around the map, gathering materials, PvP and so on. The fact is very important, among other things, that practically every activity rewards you with objects and equipment, toys, pets and other amenities that are often automatically enhanced when they are collected: of course, most of the objects obtained in the leveling phase will be replaced very soon, but the idea of being able to get your hands on a more prestigious variant of a weapon or a pair of shoulder pads tends to increase the player's interest. Finally, the main storyline of the expansion deserves an honorable mention without a shadow of a doubt. We have long believed that the idea of an alternative era was a bit tacky and inconclusive, but Chris Metzen and his associates amazed us with the quality of the script and the twists and turns that follow each other at a rapid pace and which throw new shed light on characters we knew or thought we knew. The story of Warlords of Draenor is not limited to the battle against the warlords of the Iron Horde, and better defines the old and new heroes of Warcraft mythology. At times, it's a real massacre, but the drama and epic nature of some cinematic sequences has the merit of giving an edge to what otherwise would have been the ~usual~ MMORPG story. A very important role, in this sense, is played by the soundtrack, which has the contribution of a multitude of artists and in particular of the talented and historic Jason Hayes: Warlords of Draenor glides to the notes of some of the best songs in the long history of the franchise, hearing is believing. The garrison's dilemma Initially mistaken for housing according to Blizzard, the garrison proved to be the most important feature of the expansion, to the point that in the coming months it could decide its success or failure. The garrison, in fact, is intertwined with leveling, crafting the endgame, representing an innovation from many points of view and an experiment that could lead to even more elaborate solutions. Essentially it has two purposes: first, it shines the spotlight on the player in an expansion in which the various heroes of the saga have stolen the protagonist role and, second, it supports the gameplay both in terms of content and structure. It is, in fact, a phased area where the player can build his own fort and customize it according to his needs: in the various plots it is possible to build, for example, shops for goldsmithing and enchantments, or even a mine or a garden to accumulate the related materials without going to collect them around Draenor. The various services that can be added to the garrison allow for additional activities that impact the player's experience, allowing them to acquire very specific rewards such as mounts or transmog gear. It all revolves around a chain of resources which at first may seem a bit unsettling but which within a few hours definitively clarifies the identity of the garrison, namely that of a real management mini-game that touches a little ' all aspects of World of Warcraft, especially crafting. Game within the game, then, is the recruitment of followers, non-playing characters similar to real objects that will live in our fortress and will go on a mission for us: choose which ones to assign based on their skills and their power, watch them grow and face increasingly difficult challenges, passing through expeditions and even raids, it is incrediblysatisfying, and encourages the exploration of the world and the completion of businesses, expeditions and missions even if only to recruit famous personalities such as the legendary Leeroy Jenkins or the dear, old and crazy Millhouse Manalampo. Once you better understand the mechanics of the garrison and the type of gameplay we want to support - endgame or casual, for example - it is possible to effectively employ the services of the garrison and their bonuses by carefully using the resources in our possession. In the leveling phase, the garrison is a continuous discovery and the fort fills up hour by hour, grows more and more and continuously guarantees us a new goal to reach. The problems, however, can be understood once you reach the endgame and come to terms with a small detail: time. The regeneration of resources and materials depends on the passage of time and, however much a certain building or group of followers has improved, at a certain point we will have to do nothing but sit around and wait several hours before whether a new object is generated or our subordinates return to show us - or not... - the fruits of their labors. In the meantime, there are many other contents to play, as well as the materials necessary to trigger the functions of the garrison to be collected, but having reached the endgame and boosted the fort to the maximum or almost, the innovative feature of Warlords of Draenor takes on a somewhat ' more worrying, and that is that of a simple compulsive browser game like those found on Facebook. The basic psychological principle is basically the same, and Blizzard has rightly thought of implementing, in addition to a real ~block~ in terms of time, also a crazy request for materials as regards the best objects that is possible build itself. Crafting is, in fact, the great loser of the expansion, bound to an absolutely secondary role both for its limited usefulness and for the time and cross-efforts necessary to manufacture and then enhance a certain object. The possibility of building services in one's own garrison that replace, albeit within certain limits, the active role of the players in the World of Warcraft economy, has given trade and crafting a bit of a laugh, especially in the light of the changes made by the previous patch to stats and ~itemization~. Blizzard has already announced that it wants to focus on the garrison in the future as well: at the moment it is a minigame of shadows and lights, literally. I'm off with a bang The discussion on the garrison forces us to speak, at least for the record, of the problems that the expansion suffered at launch. Many have raised an eyebrow, and although Blizzard has already fixed them for a few weeks - giving away five days of game to compensate - it's worth spending a few lines on the matter. Of course, the garrison is a new technology within World of Warcraft, but Warlords of Draenor has been tested for months and the technical malfunctions encountered (inaccessible garrisons, malfunctioning phasing, blocked characters, slowed down progression) appear unacceptable at first sight. It must be said that no one, perhaps not even Blizzard, expected the mammoth return to the fold which translated into hundreds of thousands more players than expected in the week of the expansion's launch, all converged on the same points and in the same server. The disservice sheds a rather strange light on the whole situation, and the community has already taken sides: there are those who see Blizzard's unpreparedness as yet another sign of the problems that the company has encountered in recent times and those who, instead, in the overcrowding of the servers, he sees the myth of World of Warcraft reborn. Which side are you on? Before the battle Reached level 100, Warlords of Draenor does not betray the expectations of World of Warcraft fans and offers the usual combination of PvE and PvP divided between the usual contents: expeditions, raids, battlefields and arenas. However, everything is refreshed by the new formula introduced with the 6.0 patch, which changes the cards a bit as regards the endgame, especially in PvE. Starting from the bottom, the expeditions seemed to us to be among the most inspired of the latest expansions, if only thanks to the return of some non-linear maps and the implementation of sufficiently complex mechanics that make the new bosses above all a bit more challenging than to what faced in Mists of Pandaria. Among those that we liked the most, the Frecciacupa train certainly stands out (despite a game of cameras that to define as shameful would be a compliment) and Vetta dei Cieli, but also Auchindoun and Verdeterno struck us for the originality of", "date": "2014-12-05", "grade": "9.2"}
