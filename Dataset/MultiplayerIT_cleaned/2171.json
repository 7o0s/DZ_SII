{"name": "NBA Inside Drive 2002-PAL-", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-inside-drive-2002-pal-.html", "text": "Microsoft challenges Sega and EA I think many of you have heard of Electronic Arts' NBA Live or Sega's NBA 2K series, titles that manage to improve each year and gain new acclaim from the public and the press. In the presence of these two sacred monsters, the name of NBA Inside Drive 2002 could go unnoticed and be forgotten in a short time were it not for two important details: it is the first basketball simulation for XBox; is the first basketball simulation produced by Microsoft for the XBox. It is therefore with great curiosity that I approached this game of which great praise has been said in the preview phase in recent months. However, those who expected an NBA 2K2-style masterpiece will unfortunately have to look elsewhere, because this NBA Inside Drive 2002 is indeed a good game but one that is not completely convincing. To begin with, the feeling that is felt from the first selection screens is that of a very well-finished title but without the ton of options and modes that we usually find in other games of the same genre. The same feeling of incompleteness can also be felt during the game phases. We are in fact dealing with a title that does not want and is unable to be either completely simulative or arcade and in this way it is automatically deprived of the depth that we would have hoped to find instead. Fortunately, the qualities of NBA Inside Drive 2002 manage to balance the shortcomings and, in many cases, make us forget them. Coast to coast.. The game modes available are: single game, season and play off. There is very little to say about the first since it is the classic mode that allows us to immediately get on the parquet without worrying too much about the technical management of the team. The other two modes instead allow us respectively to play an entire season or to go directly to the play-offs for the assignment of the NBA title. It should be noted that the rosters of the 29 teams present are updated to the current season, so you will have the opportunity to see the legendary MJ in the ranks of the Wizards and to check the reigning champions of the Lakers, engaged in the conquest of the third consecutive ~ring~. The first negative note is the lack of an editor mode that allows you to create teams or players from scratch. If you dreamed of creating your own lookalike and having him play in the ~Pro~ then you will be disappointed... Once you take the field you realize the remarkable ease of control, which brings NBA Inside Drive 2002 closer to being arcade, nevertheless there is no shortage the elements that give simulation depth to the game. First of all, the possibility of using, creating, managing game tactics and changing them in real time or putting fresh men on the field instead of tired players. As far as the game itself is concerned, the high speed of the actions is particularly striking, which very often turn into frenetic ~coast to coast~ or lightning-fast counter-attacks concluded with spectacular dunks. However, the situation changes radically when one finds oneself having to deal with deployed defenses. The possibilities available to us will not be many, above all due to the small variety of feints that can be performed by the ball carrier and the poor movement of the wings. And so there will be nothing left but to try a 3-point conclusion or pass the ball under the backboard in the center which, evading the marking, will be able to deposit the ball for the basket without too much effort. Despite everything, NBA Inside Drive 2002 proves to be pleasant to play, offering a good level of challenge (especially on higher difficulty levels) thanks to the high artificial intelligence of the opposing players, very skilled both in defense and in attack. Defense! Defense! From a graphic point of view, NBA Inside Drive 2002 stands at rather high levels especially for the convincing reproduction of player models. Faces, facial expressions, tattoos and T-shirts have indeed been created with great care. The same can be said of the stadiums and of an audience that, even if in 2D, makes an honest impression. Some doubts came to me instead to observe the playing fields and the reflections of the players on the parquet which in a certain sense give the impression of being ~fake~. The animations, on the other hand, are good, although they are not very numerous and do not make one cry for a miracle. From the sound we get both positive and negative notes. The commentary, strictly in English, is provided by Kevin Calabro, Marques Johnson and Akemi Takei, well-known microphone specialists in the USA, who get along quite well, giving us a commentary of good quality and competence. During the game phases you may also sall the voices that come directly from the field, such as the coach's advice or the shouts of exultation from the players themselves. The show offered by the audience in the stands is rather disappointing. Where are the classic choirs that we are used to hearing on television (Defense! Defense!) or the accordion melodies that are becoming more and more pressing? As for the music of the menus, one certainly cannot complain, being suitable for the type of game and quite entertaining. Over time! In conclusion, NBA Inside Drive 2002 proves to be a decent title, more beautiful to look at than to play, but you probably won't notice it until you try NBA 2K2 by Visual Concepts. Despite some undeniable flaws, the first basketball simulation for XBox also boasts remarkable qualities such as ease of control, high speed and spectacularity, all features that will make American basketball fans happy. For everything else we will probably have to wait for the next version but at least for this year I don't think there is too much to complain about. Pros: Fast and hectic Great graphics A.I. high Cons: Few game modes Limited movements available Materials: Tips It's showtime! After two years of undisputed domination by the Lakers, the NBA season currently underway lives on the edge of uncertainty with numerous teams tied at the top of the standings of the two conferences (western and eastern). The conclusion of the ~regular season~ is not long away and, a few weeks before the playoffs, the fight between the teams is raging, competing for the last places available for participation in the finals. Among these teams there are also the Washington Wizards of player/manager Michael Jordan, a true monument of basketball and world sport that has returned to competitive activity on the threshold of 40 years. Just in recent days, unfortunately, the dream of ~Air~ Jordan seems to have shattered due to a knee injury that not only put an end to the season, but could end his glorious career. We may therefore never see the unforgettable former number 23 of the Bulls again on the playing fields, or perhaps we will have to be content with admiring him only on the virtual fields of our consoles ... And so, on a melancholy afternoon, disappointed by the team of the heart (there is I'll never say what it is :) ) and with thoughts flying to Washington, I turned on the XBox to try NBA Inside Drive 2002 for the first time, the new edition of Microsoft's basketball simulation specifically designed for the new console.", "date": "2002-04-10", "grade": null}
