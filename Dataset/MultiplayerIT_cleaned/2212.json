{"name": "Halo-PAL-", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/halo-pal-.html", "text": "From PC to console Thus begins the most exciting action film of recent years, because Halo, far from being a simple shooter, is perhaps the first example of a video game conceived as a cinematic colossal. A long construction period, a well-articulated plot full of twists and turns, lots of action to the nth degree, an epic soundtrack and many, far too many, words spent in recent months to announce the arrival on the scene of the iconic game of new console from Microsoft... in the end every element seems to have contributed to making Halo a very successful science fiction masterpiece. Shown to the public for the first time during the 2000 edition of the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Halo quickly conquered the title of best game of the fair. At the time Bungie, an independent development team, was working on the PC and Macintosh versions of the game which already promised to become the best shooter of the new millennium. However, Bungie's fate was already written and a few weeks later Microsoft announced the acquisition of the Chicago development team and all its projects. Thus Halo said goodbye to the platforms for which it was intended and immediately became the flagship title of the future XBox lineup. Transporting a title born on a personal computer to the console was certainly not a difficult undertaking as the kinship link between XBox and PCs is now known. The passage was not only painless but downright sensational for the result obtained. Today's date, March 14, 2002, will be remembered for the debut in the Old Continent of XBox but also for the arrival on the new Microsoft console of the most captivating shooter ever produced for consoles and beyond... Atypical shooter Halo is an atypical shooter as it certainly cannot be compared to the classics of the genre such as Quake or Unreal. However, there are some points of contact with Red Faction, which arrived on PlayStation 2 and PC in recent months, and above all with Half-Life. The plot plays a very important role and we will not be asked as usual to shoot anything that moves on the screen as the action is accompanied by other no less important phases ranging from exploration to the search for objects or people, from driving tanks to that of flying machines. Thus Halo abandons the definition of a first-person shooter to become an action game, often with a third-person view. Our Halo adventure begins at the landing point of the lifeboat and we are immediately called to take on the role of the commander of the land forces. At our side we find not a trusted ~squire~ but Cortana, artificial intelligence of the Pillar of Autumn in the form of a young woman. Cortana, implanted in our protective suit, will play a fundamental role throughout the game, being able to access all Halo computer systems, showing us the way towards the objectives of our mission. From the very first moments you notice how the XBox pad seems made for this game. The control, initially cumbersome, turns out to be very precise and suitable for the type of game with practice. With the left and right analog sticks, you can respectively move the protagonist and change the angle of view. The other keys allow you to jump, pick up and change weapons, turn on a flashlight which is very useful in situations of poor visibility. The triggers instead allow us to fire with the main weapon and to throw grenades, thus carrying out the task best suited to their shape and position. ~It wasn't me!~ After a few steps, the first red dots begin to appear on our radar, indicating the approach of the Covenant. The first encounter with the aliens turns out to be somewhat comical thanks also to the hilarious voices (in Italian) of the unfortunate little monsters that come towards us. With their small bodies, short legs and a mask that looks like a muzzle, some of you might mistake them for a rare species of puppies if they didn't speak our language and didn't have sophisticated plasma weapons. Hidden behind the boulders, the Covenant begin with ~I'll kill you~ but after firing a few shots they immediately lose their courage by running away and screaming in their little voice ~It wasn't me~. Unfortunately (or maybe not) not all Covenant prove so vulnerable. In fact, in the continuation of the game we will have to deal with powerful thugs with firepower and a far from reassuring appearance. What is almost immediately striking is the high level of artificial intelligence of the enemies and our stthey comrades. Covenant organize into groups, call on companions for help if pursued, flee when faced with a more powerful opponent, or hide in the shadows to attack by surprise. In the same way, our fellow marines follow us by actively participating in missions and very often providing us with precious support. Even if we decide to get behind the wheel of a jeep or a tank, our soldiers will follow us by jumping aboard the vehicle and shooting wildly at the Covenant. Only two weapons We won't always be able to count on the help of other soldiers or Cortana, and so in most cases we will have to rely on our experience as a commander and on the weapons that we will be lucky enough to collect. Unlike almost all shooters released in the past, we don't have the classic arsenal of weapons of all kinds available but only two weapons plus the inevitable grenades. The choice not to make all the weapons available at the same time certainly gives the game more realism, exponentially increasing the strategic component. While starting the game with a simple but very useful pistol and an assault rifle, during the game we will be able to collect other weapons that will not be added to those already present, as for each new weapon collected we will have to abandon another one previously in our possession. In this way it will be essential to act wisely by saving ammunition and picking up the most suitable weapons for the situations that will arise. In addition to the shotgun, the sniper and the rocket launcher, it will be possible to collect the alien weapons abandoned by the enemies or examine the lifeless bodies of the Covenant to find some hyper-technological contraption. Out of this world graphics The features described in the previous paragraphs are a small part of all the pleasant surprises that Halo will have in store for you. On the other hand, no surprise comes from the playability, the strength of a game that seems to have very few weaknesses. The feeling of actually being in a film, of being the protagonist of something great, of being part of a team is more alive than ever. Only by playing it will you be able to realize the value of a game which, like few others, allows you to actively participate in the development of a story, to experience moments of rare intensity, of unbridled action and of a spectacularity that does not allow for comparison. A big contribution is undoubtedly given by the incredible technical achievement that surrounds our enterprises. I don't think I'm going too far by saying that Halo is the most shocking audio-visual experience that consoles have been able to offer up to now. It's impossible not to stop and admire the beauty of the light and particle effects, the splendor of the landscapes and architectural structures made even more majestic by the most beautiful and defined textures ever used by a console. The much-vaunted bump-mapping, present in massive doses, has been implemented with nothing short of miraculous results and gives a realistic appearance to walls, floors, rocks and even tree trunks. Similarly, the soldiers and enemies are also made with great richness of detail and polygons. To give XBox owners such a visual masterpiece, however, the Bungie programmers had to compromise with the game's graphics engine which runs with good fluidity but still lower than the now standard one. Even the sporadic slowdowns make their presence felt, made frequent only in situations of greater chaos or when there are numerous vehicles or characters on the screen. However, this is an almost imperceptible defect that does not undermine the enjoyment of the game in any way. The same enthusiastic words spent on the graphics can also be attributed to the sound. To the excellent sound effects are added the convincing Italian dubbing of the voices and the beautiful music, always pressing and appropriate to the situations. The lucky owners of systems equipped with Dolby Digital will also be able to enjoy multi-channel audio with extraordinary sound performance. ~Be careful not to hit me!!!~ The multiplayer modes deserve a separate discussion: cooperative and multiplayer. The first allows two human players, via horizontal split-screen, to play the entire adventure at the same time. The resulting experience is extremely engaging and the expressions ~Go away. I'll drive...~, ~Cover my shoulders~, or ~Be careful not to hit me!!!~, will be repeated endlessly during your partsite. We dreamed of playing online being able to count on the internal modem of the XBox, unfortunately Halo's multiplayer mode allows us to participate in exciting death-matches only via split screen or by connecting up to 4 consoles with link cable. In the latter case as many as 16 human players can challenge each other at the same time. The resulting fun is however ensured by 25 different standard multiplayer game modes plus infinite others that you can create yourself by modifying the deathmatch options and rules. Killer Applications? It's really hard to find anything wrong with this Halo. Bungie and Microsoft seem to have hit the mark by betting everything on a game that not only constitutes the first real killer application for XBox, but which also represents one of the best titles I've ever tried in recent years. The extraordinary technical realization, combined with an Oscar-worthy plot and never banal playability, make Halo the first serious reason to buy the new console. The isolated frame rate problems in no way manage to affect the overall quality of a game which, just as it amazes us today, will still amaze us for a long time to come, at least until someone else manages to do better, and I think before that this will take a long time to happen... Pro: Let me shout it... Killer Application! Amazing graphics and sound Incredibly ~real~ textures Cooperative modes 25 deathmatch modes Cons: Some slowdowns Nothing else... Materials: Tips The Halo Mystery A deadly threat looms over the Earth. The Covenant, after having roamed the universe erasing entire peoples and their respective planets, are preparing to continue their work of destruction on our planet as well. However, the ruthless alien race finds an unexpected and heroic resistance from the terrestrial military forces who are temporarily able to withstand the impact of the powerful and technologically advanced enemy armaments. In the decisive battle, however, the human-controlled spaceships are overwhelmed and annihilated with the exception of the ~Pillar of Autumn~ which manages to escape the attack and flee the Earth. The ship's commander's plan to escape, drawing Covenant forces along in the process, succeeds perfectly. In the vicinity of Halo, a mysterious ring-shaped planet, and now at a safe distance from Earth, the Pillar of Autumn is however reached by the Covenant who place it under siege. All that remains is for the crew to abandon ship and head towards the surface of the planet aboard the escape pods. Among the survivors is John, a mysterious commander and leader of the resistance. It's up to him to unravel the mystery behind the Halo ring and lead the marines to attack the Covenant.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
