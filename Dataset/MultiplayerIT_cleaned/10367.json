{"name": "Space Pirate Trainer DX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-pirate-trainer-dx-recensione.html", "text": "Space Trainer is not really a new game, its first appearance dates back to almost six years ago: it was used as a demo to show the most advanced VR towards the end of 2015, it officially debuted together with HTC Vive in 2016, the same year arrived on Oculus and after quite a few updates, in 2017, it also took a turn on PlayStation VR. Let's talk about it again today because a few weeks ago it was updated to the DX version, a free upgrade for those who already owned the game and now the only version available for purchase at 24.99 Euros, six more than what was asked for the old Space Pirate Trainer. The novelties on which we will focus along this review of Space Pirate Trainer DX are three, three new modes that revolve around the same very courageous idea: to offer arenas to be faced in ~room scale~, therefore literally moving from one place to another, in an area of 100 square meters. We will immediately remove your doubts: it is extraordinary stuff. We'll take another one away right away: organizing a game isn't easy. High Score Shield and pistol, in the Arena this will be the paraphernalia at our disposal Before delving into the contents of the DX version, a very quick summary for those who don't know Space Pirates Trainer and perhaps have just bought a VR headset. The I-Illusion game is a little marvel if you want to feel surrounded by an 80s arcade. When you start a game it's as if someone has miniaturized you and then launched you into a futuristic version of the most infamous classics from the golden era of arcades. Space Pirates Trainer DX is the nightmare you had after spending 20,000 Lire of tokens in a day, but here you have full control and fun is guaranteed. The game puts you in the center of an arena, where you can move freely, surrounded by enemies that will show up and attack in increasingly difficult waves. Over the years of games like this, many have come out for virtual reality, some very beautiful, but Space Pirate Trainer has always remained among the most popular for the graphics, the precision of the system, the charm of its weapons and the defensive tools offered. Then, since she got rid of the thread, thanks to the Oculus Quest version, this iridescent battle has become even more visceral: you throw yourself to one side to avoid the blows, you lean, you roll up, you bend, you stretch . A struggle, of course, and that's also the beauty because you feel like in Tron, damn it; it's cyberspace, man. In short, this is why some copies have managed to sell it and as many will still sell for a long time. As agile as a gamer To play arenas you will need a playing field of 10 meters by 10 meters, practically half the size of a tennis court This thing that people have a lot of fun moving like real pirates of the stars (Alan Sorrenti Intensifies) has also understood the development team, and for the biggest update ever they have chosen to raise the bar of this feature at the maximum volume allowed. Space Pirate Trainer thus evolves into Space Pirate Trainer DX, the same game as before, but now with a new portion entirely focused on large arenas in which to run, jump and crawl against drones and other human beings, via the network or in a sci-fi versus locally, where everyone will naturally wear an Oculus Quest to find themselves on the same virtual playing field. To exploit this function, however, space is needed, prohibitive ten meters by ten, but given the exceptional nature of the thing, organizing oneself specifically is not as stupid as one might think. Faced with this small problem, everyone is prompted to think of the most obvious solution: go to a park. The problem is that for how device tracking works it is extremely important, in this specific case, to also have a ceiling available in order not to run into technical problems. A garage? The entrance hall of a building? An indoor tennis court? There are several options, it will be up to you to understand which is the most suitable and accessible in your personal case (we opted for parking in a shopping center at night). Laser Tag Duels between friend and foe like those offered by Space Pirate Trainer only in the 1800s... The reward for finding the right place to play Space Pirate Trainer DX's new modes is a truly amazing gaming experience. If in the classic game it was possible to do everything in a definable even small space, also given the simplicity of the only circular map, here we are forced to physically move around the level which is made up of different elements such as obstacles, walls, windows. There is no way to move in the game other than moving toohe in reality. As a good Italian you will immediately be thinking about how to cheat, perhaps overcoming obstacles, they don't really exist... but we don't recommend it since by going beyond the virtual consistency of the level you lose energy or even one of the three lives you have available. The arenas can be tackled in three different ways: in single we'll have to contend with drones even while remaining offline, while in multiplayer we'll have the option to challenge other online users or a friend with another Oculus Quest available. Here Space Pirate Trainer DX gives absolutely the best: after having made a sync of the positions remaining in the center of the arena, the distances between the two players will remain perfectly aligned during the game, we will therefore be able to give each other a high five at the end of a battle by touching each other in the same instant in the game and in reality. The experience is galvanizing, it's like those 90s laser tags, but made virtual and portable. And finally, here's an editor that allows you to create three new maps to add to the five present: the system is as simple as it is powerful, it supports coop so you can create your next battlefield in company, but it doesn't allow you to reach the complexity of the maps built by the developers, at least for now. At the point of duel There are also different skins for the characters and as many for the weapons In any Arena mode, the rules will remain essentially the same: armed with a blaster, which also allows you to load powerful shots capable of bouncing off walls, and a shield to be activated with the left trigger to protect yourself from enemy lasers, we will have to try to eliminate threats without losing our three available lives. The difficulty will change according to the player you will have in front of you, but as in the base game, even in the arenas it is not smart to underestimate the normal drones managed by the AI. The rules are simple, they are understood on the fly, and not having to manage cameras and so on, there is no one who does not know how to play Space Pirates Trainer DX in no time at all. During the evening, and until we ran out of battery, we had several friends, even non-gamers, wear the Quests, and no one had any problems. The nice thing is that even when it's not your turn to play, you can still enjoy the scene of two idiots who fake shoot each other with a viewer on their heads, and who risk crashing each other on the ground at any moment. Really beautiful, but when will we be able to do it again? Luckily it's possible to challenge random people via the Internet and luck that this Space Pirate Trainer DX also includes a third new mode still focused on multiplayer, but which doesn't need so much free space to play: in versus, we'll go back to playing the classic Space Pirate, but with a particular twist: all the drones we destroy will instantly appear in our opponent's field, a bit like the gems in Super Puzzle Fighter.", "date": "2021-10-24", "grade": "8.0"}
