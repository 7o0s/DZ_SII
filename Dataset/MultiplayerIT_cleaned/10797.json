{"name": "Experience 112 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/experience-112-recensione.html", "text": "Experience 112 has every appearance of being a game where the atmosphere counts, and for this reason we turn off the lights, starting it in silence. Our world becomes the background of a desktop, which could belong to an American government agency; there is a symbol, but we only have time to read ~trust~, ~dedication~ and ~silence~, because from an open window we observe a young woman, with an amulet around her neck, who wakes up inside a cabin of a ship. Her name is Lea Nichols, and we're spying on her from a camera. A communication starts between us and her made up of lights on or off and interventions on the ship's cameras. We don't know this woman's story and she doesn't know who we are, or if she can trust us. To help her in her research and understand what happened we can only count on the possibility of manipulating the video communications system itself. The ship is in fact full of closed circuit cameras. For now, that's all we know. Lea Nichols then offers us an agreement: we will in fact have to guide her in the direction towards which we want to attract her attention, while she in return will always reveal something more about the type of experiments that were carried out on board, also giving us the possibility of expanding our action range. We just have to move the camera up and down with the mouse. From now on, this will be our way of saying ~yes~. The conversation code Lea finally begins to explain the commands of our terminal. We have the personnel files available, even if to consult them it is necessary to find the respective access keys. Waiting to succeed, we switch from one camera to another, silently spying on Lea. We are a faceless voyeur who still does not know his own identity. Even this secret will only be clear at the end. Unfortunately, sneaking around and anticipating danger makes us feel closer to Lea, but a few hours pass and we realize how frustrating this partnership can be. It often happens that our only goal is to send it across a long portion of the ship, waiting for it to leave again after the activation of a subsequent hotspot. Better follow her on the map. However, this means that for long minutes we remain inert staring at a blue triangle that moves on the sparse computerized map. Furthermore, Lea is very slow; many times he doesn't even immediately understand our calls, and yelling is useless, he can't hear us anyway. Fortunately, at least in the beginning its mystery captures us and we feel the tension, we fear the fear. Are we inside that ship? If so, something behind us could also surprise us. This is why we endure the difficult collaboration and grit our teeth. Lea acts on her own, and draws all the necessary conclusions; we have the task of thoroughly examining e-mails and documents belonging to crew members. When we're not turning the lights on and off, we have to search for passwords, codes to decipher encrypted usernames and confidential information in staff chat logs that reveal jealousies, betrayals and plans for sabotage. Lea and her Experience 112 are a story that tells itself, that presses to be told. However, we have some specific tools available, such as the thermo-detector, which has allowed us, for example, to identify the bottle of a specific preparation in a room, after having appropriately raised the room temperature. There is also night vision, zoom and a sharpness adjuster. Later we also find out why we need a pheromone detector. Too bad that everything comes down to sporadic interventions. We would like to do more for you. In some lucky cases we directly control the machinery on board, such as the small remote-controlled robot or the synthesizer of chemical compounds. This keeps us awake, and the desire to go back to turning on the cameras is great. Furthermore, the commitment that Lea's problems require is not excessive, but grows with each of her requests, and gives us a hard time. At some point we are in it, we want to help her escape at all costs. A love finished before it began Now we can extract the DVD of Experience 112. We know all about how this story ended, and unfortunately the prevailing feeling is anger. It could have been an all-encompassing experience, one you remember for a long time. We were almost there, the involvement was high right away, even if what we saw from the cameras was sparse, not very refined and sometimes confused. But Lea is very slow, awkward in making decisions despite the grace of her movements and above all, she is the protagonist of an adventure full of errors, inaccuracies and rudeness of the code. We are patient, we wait while he takes a step to volta along the deck of the ship, but we can't lose hours of gameplay for a stupid bug. Or chasing the solution to a puzzle that doesn't come due to a penalizing level design. Furthermore, and herein lies the biggest problem, the story is childish and cheesy. Lexis Numrique could have made a big splash and instead, after having offered us a concept that is a boost for the world of video games, it abandons it to itself. Everything is wrecked like the EDEHN ship, which however does not sink completely, allowing itself to be explored as a wreck of what it was, or could have been. Comment Experience 112 leaves us speechless. Speechless for the bitterness of a concept that could have become an experience not to be missed, but which instead is all played out in technical coarseness. Unfortunately, the crashes and errors that the game regularly encounters translate into frequent restarts, and wasted hours. Observing the protagonist of a horror thriller, hidden behind the cameras of a ship, without knowing her history or our identity, is not only intriguing, but becomes a constant call to this virtual desktop to find out how Lea is doing, to be able to help to escape and finally discover our face. Unfortunately here also the story collapses, destined to resolve itself as an insipid fairy tale. It's a shame, Lexis Numrique had almost made it, coming up with an idea that cut the classic setting of the medium like a blade, and we would have been the first to applaud it. As it is, it remains a half-successful experiment, which only gives joys.Pro Brilliant concept Intriguing multiple view Against Too many imperfections Inaccurate controls Ridiculous plot PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Processor: Intel 2GHz RAM: 1GB Video Card: GeForce 6 or equivalent Operating system: Windows XP SP 2 or Windows Vista DirectX: 9.0c Hard Drive: 2GB Sound card: DirectX compatible Test configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 RAM: 2GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GT Operating system: Windows Vista", "date": "2009-03-24", "grade": null}
