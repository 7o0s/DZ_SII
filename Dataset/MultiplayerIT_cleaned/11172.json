{"name": "Spore Creatures - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spore-creatures-recensione.html", "text": "The name of Spore, Will Wright's ambitious work recently released on the market after a long gestation, is on the lips of many both for the evolutionary themes of particular interest, and for the actual goodness of the product in terms of pure and simple gameplay. But alongside the main title released only on PC and Mac, Electronic Arts has chosen to give life to a small undergrowth of ~minor~ editions that share only a few aspects with the illustrious reference. And so here is Spore Origins, an adaptation for mobile phones, iPhone and iPod Touch which in summary offers players only the cellular phase of Will Wright's project, or that of the organisms in the primordial soup, close in mechanics to the popular Flow for Pc and Ps3 (also if it is the latter to have been inspired by Spore). For DS however, with Spore Creatures, an even different path was chosen, which only takes inspiration from the original idea, choosing instead a much more traditional realization. Friendship above all The protagonist of the game is an invertebrate creature at the very beginning of its evolutionary process; the player gets to know it when it experiences the transition from water to dry land, casually in the company of a similar as well as friend Uggo. After a few moments, however, the drama happens: an alien spacecraft kidnaps the adventure companion, leaving the poor atypical hero in despair who then decides to organize a rescue after having evolved sufficiently. A quite paradoxical narrative incipit therefore, which however represents only a pretext to support the indeed particularly linear progression of the adventure. Basically it is about crossing some planets, which in turn are divided into small islands joined together; to move from one to the next it is necessary to perform a series of tasks or missions of various kinds, always precisely indicated by the appropriate diary available. As is obvious, the play area is populated by a whole host of other creatures that can be peaceful or hostile. In the first case it is possible to obtain their friendship and trust by engaging in a mini rhythm game, which is actually rather bland; successful completion can grant additional body parts or new sub-quests. Hostile creatures, on the other hand, must necessarily be eliminated thanks to combat, which takes place by swiping the stylus on the enemy and possibly using special powers provided gradually during the progression of the story. Unfortunately, the space for tactics or for a minimum of strategy has been completely set aside in favor of a simplistic and unsatisfying mechanic, which is simply based on the comparison between the strength values of one's little monster and those of the opponent. To act on these values, as well as on a series of other aspects, it is necessary to indulge - finally - in the editing phase, undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of this edition for DS. In the initial stages, the player can in fact count on only a few parts of the body with which to manipulate the appearance and capabilities of the creature; however, the progress of the adventure guarantees the expansion of this list as a new Dr. Frankenstein, and exactly like the Creature Creator on the computer it is possible to let go of the imagination, giving life to the best - or worst - that can be conceived. But even at this juncture, the flaws are not lacking... Useful or beautiful creature? Yes, because the linearity of the game is strongly imposed also in this section, greatly limiting the player's potential creation freedom; The fact that the various parts of the body determine specific characteristics and powers directs the choice phase in a very marked way. Why would anyone use a certain type of legs, for example, if the latest ones unlocked have significantly better qualities? Consequently, one finds oneself simply modifying one's creature by adding the last parts earned, or even more forcibly in relation to the impositions of the game which often and willingly requires a precise ~equipment~ to overcome areas otherwise destined to block progression. Even the graphic aspect is not very satisfying since it lacks in being able to return aesthetically in a convincing way what was achieved in the creation phase of the creature; all this since it was chosen to adopt 3D only for the settings, while the living beings that populate them are two-dimensional sprites without thickness, like sheets of paper. An interesting solution that shouldn't be rejected a priori at all, but which suffers greatly from the low resolution of the Nintendo portable screens with a final result that is really not far from a self-propelled and rambling tangleor of legs, arms, mouths and so on. Even the advertised wi-fi component, with which to exchange creatures with your friends, disappoints expectations by limiting itself to adding them sterilely in the game world as very simple inhabitants controlled by artificial intelligence. Comment It is at least a source of regret to have to note that a creative, original and ~open~ game like Spore on the computer has become, in its DS version, a dull and limited adventure game that takes a diametrically opposite path from the one adopted by the brilliant Will Wright. Except for the creation phase of the creatures, pleasant if tarnished, the only point of contact with the original, Spore Creatures in fact proves to be a bland product that could - and should - certainly have been much better. Pros Interesting in the early stages Creation of the funny creature Interesting graphic style... Cons ...but ill-suited to the DS Linear and soon boring Little or nothing in common with the ~real~ Spore", "date": "2008-09-25", "grade": null}
