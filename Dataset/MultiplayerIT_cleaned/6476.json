No, there is no onanistic reference, we are simply talking about the SEService GAmes of the times gone by, the one in which the upheavals of the most recent years were unthinkable and which dominated both in the arcade and at home, which churned out masterpieces with hammering regularity on masterpieces, impressive both from a technical and gameplay point of view, and for an aspect that today is taken for granted but which at the time was not easy to find: in English it is defined as ~attitude~, ~coolness~ , in Italian we would simply say ~figaggine~ or something similar. ~SEGA does what Nintendon't~, in short, and managed to do it also because among its ranks militated characters of the caliber of Yu Suzuki, one of the most legendary game designers in history, who after shocking the world with impressive arcade hits for technique and, precisely, attitude, he also allowed himself to reveal a surprisingly profound and poetic soul with Shenmue. But that, unfortunately, is another story. Even if, on second thought, even the good Ryo Hazuki has spent a lot of coins in the Out Run cabinet... The 3D Classics line is enriched with the classic of the classics: his majesty Out Run! Straight from the eighties One of the (some here would insert quite a few~, but let's stay out of judgments and insights) perfect moves of the last period of SEGA is the 3D Classics line, masterpieces of the past reproposed on Nintendo 3DS, digitally and at a very convenient price, with a remaking operation which, in addition to various additional options, mainly focuses on the introduction and exploitation of stereoscopic 3D. Although we have already had the opportunity to enjoy splendid versions of classics such as Altered Beast, Shinobi III, Space Harrier, Super Hang On and Streets Of Rage, let's face it, as soon as we heard about this series for the first time we all began to wait for a only title, and that is what we finally have in our hands, which in truth has been available in Japan for almost a year. Out Run, twenty-nine years old on the back, is probably still today the perfect arcade racer, very fast, very bastard, incredibly cool, equipped with a memorable soundtrack and a cabinet that still today, if you find it in any bowling alley or in some multiplex, he makes a good impression. Developed by Suzuki's AM2 on the aptly named SEGA Out Run Arcade System Board, it made use of Super-Scaler technology which allowed developers to treat two-dimensional sprites as if they were real 3D objects, still a long way off at least for the large number of gamers. Hence the extraordinary sense of depth and speed, just one of many examples of how the Grande Esse was ahead of everyone at that time in many aspects of the videogame world; it is no coincidence that in order to have a suitable home adaptation, we had to wait for the arrival of the Saturn. Driving a roaring Ferrari Testarossa (unlicensed, unfortunately), the dream car of those years, and flanked by an attractive blonde, the player set off on a journey against the clock that led him to face five scenarios inspired by European and North American landscapes: it was necessary to reach the end of a stage, the checkpoint, within the time limit, and only then was the stopwatch reloaded, however in an increasingly less generous way. One of the nicest things was that the stages were not consequential, but at the end of each one one could choose one of the two roads of a crossroads: this ensured replayability even if only for the desire to see all the scenarios, which at the time really made impression. The sense of speed was amazing, also thanks to the decision to place the video camera exactly behind the car, thus limiting the view; the level design aimed at favoring the best players, as well as (we are always talking about an arcade) to steal as many coins as possible from unwary patrons. A series of other vehicles with not always exactly safe driving, successions of high-speed curves and numerous obstacles immediately off the roadside were the main enemies of the driver, who had to juggle the steering wheel, brake, accelerator and, if desired, even a manual gearbox. And all this accompanied by a soundtrack that has remained historic: Passing Breeze, Magical Sound Shower and Splash Wave, composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, are still songs loved not only by gamers. The 3D effect Mind blowing to say the least. Perfectly made and shot upwards, we won't go so far as to say that it changes the way you enjoy the game, but it wouldn't be too exaggerated a statement either. First of all, from a graphic point of view: it does not affect the frame in the slightestrate and gives the Super-Scaler a depth almost comparable to that of a normal polygonal game. And a lot of depth also gives the gameplay, succeeding in the dual objective of making it more natural and intuitive at the same time (it is easier to manage distances, for example), and more frenetic and engaging. The best stereo ever seen on Nintendo 3DS? If not really, we're in the top five. Only warning, some may not like the level set to maximum, but the 3D lever is there for this. Make up your mind All this good things on Nintendo 3DS is delivered in a delightful way, starting with the controls which are very precise, even if we suggest the digital cross instead of the stick to steer, we are still talking about an arcade. And from a remake perspective, what new features does this edition bring? First of all, a lot of new options, to customize the gaming experience properly. We mention just a few: the possibility, for example, of reproducing the controls of the original arcade on the touch screen, ie brake and accelerator to touch. Nothing shocking, traditional controls remain decidedly preferable, but it bears witness to the care placed in the operation. Furthermore, the possibility of choosing instead of the version that was in our arcades, the original Japanese one, whose main difference is a different location of the scenarios. Again, a very nice option that tilts the main game screen when the player takes a curve, to simulate the movement of the driver's head, very well done and which makes the game action even more frenetic and engaging. And finally what is practically a must in any home conversion of a self-respecting arcade title, but which here assumes particular relevance: let's talk about adjusting the level of difficulty. Out Run, we said, is necessarily a very difficult game; this remains on Nintendo 3DS, but there is the possibility of making it less difficult, for example by decreasing traffic on the road and increasing the time available. It is in similar situations, too, that one sees how beautiful the base material has remained: with the difficulty at a minimum, without too much anxiety to avoid obstacles and to run faster than light, the pleasure of driving and seeing the scenarios flow on the sides of our Testarossa. Obviously experiences surpassed in more recent years by many driving titles, but still, believe us, very valid. Just as the graphics remain very valid, perfectly identical to the original, lively, vibrant, a little monotonous by today's standards, and clearly the bitmap sprites are not polygonal objects, but they scroll so fast that they still remain a pleasure. What's more, while the original ran at 30 frames per second, here we are at a constant, rocky, unshakeable 60 even with the splendid, as you can see in the box above, 3D effect activated. And finally the sound: also unchanged from the arcade, and therefore also excellent. But there are two more songs, Cruising Line and Camino a Mi Amor. In terms of style we are perfectly in line with the three great classics, in terms of quality we would say a step below, but it could also simply be the nostalgia effect, let's give them some time and perhaps, given the general quality of 3D Out Run, we will talk about two new cornerstones of videogame music.", "date": "2015-03-19", "grade": "9.0"}
