{"name": "Explodemon!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88310-explodemon-action-platform-scoppiettante.html", "text": "Available from March 9 on the PlayStation Network digital platform, at a price of 9.99 euros, Explodemon! is the third video game, in a relatively short span of time, to boast a protagonist capable of ~exploding~. Beyond the speeches on who copied who, the title developed by Curve Studios openly refers to the platform production for SNES and in many ways closely resembles Mega Man, were it not for the fact that, unlike the Capcom hero, Explodemon it can duck and even perform a slide to access hidden areas or to project objects upwards to be directed later via an explosion. The plot behind the game is quite simple: the planet Nibia is invaded by an alien race and it seems that the last chance of survival of its inhabitants lies precisely in the abilities of Explodemon, a sort of superhero who has been put into hibernation basically because he couldn't control his own explosive powers, causing disaster after disaster. Waking up almost by accident, the character is informed of the situation and immediately sets to work, eliminating the alien troops in his path and soon finding himself facing his own archenemy, Absorbemon, who is evidently in cahoots with the aliens to subdue Nibia. The battle will develop across three different planets, each divided into a certain number of levels, and Explodemon will be able to use the points earned on the field to improve their skills, as well as acquire new powers. Boom! Shakalaka Once you get over the first stages, in which you have to get a little familiar with the control system (very simple) and with the character's abilities, the game turns out to be quite fast and lets us decide whether to carry out an in-depth exploration of the scenario, looking for any hidden passages for the collection of further bonuses, or produce us in a sort of speedrun until the end of the level. The concept of the speed in completing the stages is reiterated through the online ranking, but in principle it is not a motivation such as to induce us to replay the same areas over and over again in search of a better time. The platforming action is preponderant, but that doesn't mean that the fights are secondary; on the contrary, the developers must be recognized for the implementation of many interesting ideas to make the most of Explodemon's powers, the impact of its detonations (always accompanied by short ~bullet times~ that emphasize them) and the different results depending on the position in which occur. In fact, the character can explode from a standstill, do it in mid-air or while running, with completely different and rather spectacular effects. Furthermore, the presence of a generous and difficult to empty energy bar allows us to experiment a little with all the attack maneuvers without fearing the game over. We can therefore destroy doors, crates and enemies in the same way, bounce off the walls and use the explosions to push us even higher, or activate bombs capable of creating chain reactions or activating mechanisms useful for continuing the adventure. Playstation 3 trophies Explodemon! contains twenty trophies, all of bronze. To conquer them, you have to complete relatively simple missions: eliminate fifteen enemies, perform a three-hit combo, fully upgrade the character, complete the game and so on. I explode therefore I am Bubble Explodemon gameplay! as fully committed to action would be a mistake though. In fact, there is no shortage of puzzles based on the switches to be activated or the need to eliminate certain enemies by deflecting their projectiles with an explosion, but finding the right angle to do so. Many of the boss fights are based precisely on this concept, although unfortunately the fact of always and only facing Absorbemon represents the weakest point of an otherwise pleasant experience, capable of returning moderate satisfaction. Closed the ~playful~ speech, let's move on to see what the Curve Studios product offers us from a technical point of view. The various levels are interspersed with cutscenes drawn with a frankly immature and questionable style, although the use of a good number of colors is good for the eye. The game is completely in English and often offers us to read too many things (through various ~notices~ placed within the stages), but fortunately we can proceed without worrying about it. The design of the protagonist does not shine for originality, however, it boasts a fair amount of animations, while the scenarios are rather anonymous and quite repetitive when they belong to the same planet.
