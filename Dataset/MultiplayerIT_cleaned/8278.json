As he crosses one of the intersections he is hit by a passing car. At the same time, a supernatural terrorist attack imprisons the Tokyo district in a space-time bubble. Akito is about to exhale his last breath when the spirit of an investigator specializing in the paranormal, also just deprived of his physical body like all the surrounding population, takes possession of him preventing both of them from dying. Now we have a brave and agile young man with the powers, wisdom and spiritual strength of a seasoned medium. Welcome to Tokyo, Shibuya, and welcome to the review of Ghostwire Tokyo, a new action horror from Tango Gameworks. Technical confusion Ghostwire Tokyo: The game's spooky Shibuya is kept alive only by electricity Ghostwire Tokyo exudes natural charisma. The combat system is colorful and captivating, and Shinto folklore has a particular hold on the Western public, and we at Multiplayer are certainly no exception. Furthermore, this rainy and rotting Shibuya immediately seems to have all the credentials to transform itself into a nothing short of perfect battlefield. The beginning of the game works great, and after the inevitable initial chatter you immediately enter the action, becoming familiar with the controls and exploring the mainly linear path on which the entire introduction will unfold. Despite the fun of facing the game's very first enemies, mostly ghosts in suits and ties among headless schoolgirls with ghostly karate skills, we can't fully concentrate due to the game's performance. We have no problem turning a blind eye or two to a wobbly frame-rate - if the gameplay deserves it - but the screen tearing that affects at least four of the six graphics settings in the PlayStation 5 version of Ghostwire Tokyo is very taxing indeed. For a console game, we spent too much time testing which setting was the best among those proposed, bitterly discovering that even the two with V-Sync active, a function that should solve the tearing, still fail to eliminate it entirely. But at this point why not put an advanced menu only for experts like on PC? Only after having found the best setting for us, lowered the motion blur and become familiar with the peculiarities of the graphics engine, we finally managed to fully immerse ourselves in the game, which in the meantime began to promise great things, introducing powers and characters in a gripping alternation between indoors and outdoors, horror pauses and increasingly challenging fights. The climax of this segment is its double final revelation: important plot details emerge and the doors of this convincing reconstruction of Shibuya, cloaked in mists and mysteries, open wide before us. The face of an open world Ghostwire Tokyo: Not all bosses in the game offer the same scenic impact as this unpleasant scissor-wielding ghost With clearer ideas in mind and free to explore at will, we finally begin to feel at ease. Some areas of Shibuya are still enveloped in a lethal fog, but this can be eliminated by purifying the torii shrines scattered throughout the metropolis. Once an altar has been purified, the fog will clear and key locations and the inevitable nearby side quests will be displayed on the map. Even if in the first chapters of the game we move mainly on foot, new options will soon be introduced, including flying demons to which we will be able to psychically hook up to be dragged quickly towards them, always positioned near some building on which we can then we will land with agility. Moving through demons is vertical, but thanks to one of the powers that we will be able to acquire, by subsequently launching ourselves into the void by holding down the appropriate button, we will be able to fly for ever longer distances as we level up. But as nice as it is to be able to fly for short distances, given the constant movements on the ground and some vertical excursions, even a more advanced parkour system would not have hurt. Naturally, for those in a hurry and not very interested in exploration, there is the most classic of fast travel which will teleport in a few moments to any area of the map. Shibuya cats Ghostwire Tokyo: Active Parry is the only way to restore a few shots when they are depleted Immersing yourself in Ghostwire Tokyo's Shibuya is extremely fascinating. The areas are desolate, but retain glimmers of past life. For the streetsade there are still clothes and personal belongings of the people who later evaporated after the attack, in the clubs the music continues to animate now non-existent parties and the lights of the street lamps in this perennial night are nothing but spotlights for diabolical chants. In addition to the souls left imprisoned, the same ones who will often offer us side missions, and beyond the enemies, what remains of Shibuya will be populated mainly by magical cats and tanuki on missions. Ghostwire Tokyo's cats are mainly merchants, in fact they will carry on the business of the classic neighborhood stores, where you can buy food and other objects, and they will always manage various specialized stalls. Some cats, in exchange for specific traditional items, give away upgrades, special items and new customizations for the character. Finding these mysterious objects could have been a fun activity, but there isn't much to do other than walk to the spot on the map where it is and bring it back to the affected cat. Restless ghosts Ghostwire Tokyo: the Hyakki Yako, a rotting parade from which it is good to stay away if you don't want to fight The side missions are potentially much more interesting, and especially at the beginning they bode well. However, it soon becomes clear that the quality is not guaranteed, it fluctuates violently between genuinely interesting ghost stories, and situations that require rather mundane actions to solve. A game like Ghostwire Tokyo could contain fragments of gameplay of all kinds within it, an abandoned building could turn into a pocket Silent Hill and an underground parking lot into a half-hour Resident Evil, but the opportunity was not exploited and for filling the large map ended up disastrously watering down every activity. Some main missions take you to actually disturbing abandoned apartments, on the trail of legitimately scary funeral dolls, others favor a more grotesque horror typical of the genre, but very few of these remain in the mind and deserve to be told. A worthy cast Ghostwire Tokyo: How many Torii Shrines can you cleanse before you never want to see one again for life? It goes much better with the main missions, these are effective in terms of rhythm, surprises and in their extension. But more than anything, just as we had guessed in the first few hours with the game, linearity is their greatest strength. No wasting time, collections of souls and useless purifications in sequence that lead to nothing, but action and mystery, new enemies and bosses to defeat. The heart of Ghostwire Tokyo is of excellent workmanship even if it needs to be perfected, the outline is instead a useless tinsel that demeans even what is undeniably good. However, there are moments, for example between the fourth and fifth chapter of the game, where a minimum of purified torii altars will be required to proceed with the plot, where in short, the side dish will become the main content trying to lengthen the broth even if basically there is no it would not even be necessary: to finish the game enjoying the best of the side quests, and thus unlocking most of the powers, it takes about 25/30 hours. Urban Ninja? Ghostwire Tokyo: the horror vein of the game is not always the predominant one Even the growth of the combat system is not as gradual as it should be and undergoes several hitches that affect its freshness and dynamism. It lacks the rhythm that God Hand and Killer 7 had, to name two titles on which the founder of Tango Gameworks Shinji Mikami worked and which in some aspects recall Ghostwire Tokyo, and it lacks feeling more and more powerful. The trinity of wind, water and fire spells works perfectly, we are fantastic fighting mediums, but there are very few ninja skills that would have made the fights more dynamic and fun. The bestiary of the game is excellent, however it always tends towards encirclement, it is no coincidence that in the most tense battles we will be teleported to a sort of arena that does not allow hiding places, where one is forced to retreat slowly while hitting enemies while simultaneously avoiding their attacks. Repositioning, and the consequent search for ammunition, are slow processes that unfairly leave you at the mercy of your opponents. To keep up the magic bullets of each elemental power we will have to rely on the active parry and extraction of the core of weakened enemies, a final blow that takes some time to work but which rewards with extra ammunition and experience points; if once the extraction has started it is not finished, the enemy comes back to life with the energy restored. Shot in the barrelGhostwire Tokyo: once weakened, the enemies can be finished using these psychic strings which will give us the opportunity to gain experience points and extra ammunition, leaving us uncovered for any hits Ammunition is a problem in the open world because magazines can only be filled in two ways: by killing enemies, who don't drop even a very large amount, and by hitting possessed objects such as garbage buckets if not entire cars with a peculiar appearance , purple and intermittent like graphic bugs, which once destroyed will release the precious resource. What does this entail? That we often walk around Shibuya just for this reason, and hitting cranes and telephone booths with a melee attack for five minutes following each fight is not exactly what we could define as fun. After the main missions, and the more horror and structured side missions, the funniest thing about Ghostwire Tokyo is the fights on the streets of the city. Handling the flying attacks of chilling winged ghosts while surrounded by ectoplasms that get ever closer, eerie and lethal, and doing it among the electric alleys and ancient temples of this distorted and immaterial Shibuya, is a unique and enthralling experience. Even Ghostwire Tokyo hides some surprises, for example it will be coming across for the first time in the great processions of ghosts and demons, called Hyakki Yako, which in the darkest nights light up the city, and break its silence, with their iridescence and distressing litanies. Be careful not to get too close! Explosive couple Ghostwire Tokyo: Since you like purifying Torii altars, here's another one... Yet no one can get it out of our minds that Ghostwire Tokyo shouldn't have been an open world. Almost all of his problems arise from wanting to copy an already worn-out game structure without even understanding its potential strengths. The result is a very good game, watered down by content that in fact can no longer be considered as such, because it leads nowhere and gives nothing in return. When after fifteen hours you invite us to purify more torii shrines, while at the same time you make me tick sixteen new ones on the map, what emotions should we users feel, perhaps excitement? And for what, a walk and two gestures on the DualSense touchpad? One ticket pays for the mystery, the excellent synergy between Akito and K.K. which will often deliver top notch dialogue, for the weird ghosts, for the spooky interiors, for the combat system despite its limitations; it is on these elements that they should have invested time and budget. The choice annoys because they are all present in Ghostwire Tokyo, but they are often hidden under a mountain of nothing. To really enjoy yourself you have to wait for them to surface, or slam yourself to bring them to the surface. Technical issues aside... Ghostwire Tokyo: This game is often at its best in interiors Graphically the game looks good, the atmosphere always remains intact, but often the graphics engine doesn't seem very comfortable, especially if you decide to play with ray tracing active, quite important here given the peculiarities of the city. The use of the DualSense is very good which will transmit different vibrations depending on the power in use, also providing us with useful feedback during the fight. However, the PlayStation 5 pad does not offer the same satisfaction/accuracy when used as a touchpad, it is no coincidence that when this is required, you will also have the possibility to perform the ritual automatically. Also of excellent quality is the sound that knows when to remain silent and when instead the right dose of adrenaline is needed. It is also possible to unlock and later listen to songs of various genres while wandering and fighting through the city: the selection is decidedly good and consists of modern and other more traditional songs, which together perfectly summarize the different souls of the game. Due to some kind of technical problem, even when changing the graphics mode on our PlayStation 5, the game was always displayed at 1080p, we tell you even if it is probably a bug that will probably be resolved even before the game's official debut.", "date": "2022-03-21", "grade": "7.5"}
