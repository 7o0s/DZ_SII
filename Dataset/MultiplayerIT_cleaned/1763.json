{"name": "Haven: Call of the King", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/haven-call-of-the-king-2.html", "text": "The game The first impact with Haven: Call of The King is unfortunately not positive, the introduction is in fact quite lackluster graphically and the Italian dubbing proves to be decidedly not very appropriate, the voice actors selected are foreigners and initially arouse uncommon hilarity followed unfortunately by a deep sense of annoyance. After this first disheartening part we move on to the actual game which turns out to be mainly a 3D platform devoted to action interspersed with some sections ~borrowed~ from other genres. So don't be surprised if you find yourself driving various vehicles ranging from motorboats to spaceships or if you sometimes have to solve puzzles or face some enemies in simple first-person sections. These variants, interesting on paper, unfortunately turn out to be boring, repetitive and lacking in originality after a very short time. The main platform section is mainly based on the search for the gears scattered throughout the levels, our protagonist, armed with a metal yoyo and an electric shield, is in fact also a mechanic and his little flying robot named Talon will join him during the course of history. The gears are used to activate the structures that will allow us to move on to the following areas (the first mission that you will have to complete, for example, is the search for the wheels for the engine of an elevator that will take you to a mine) and will be collected by solving simple puzzles, destroying vases or exploring specific parts of the levels. The weapons at our disposal, apart from the basic yoyo, vary during the adventure but their peculiar characteristic is that they can only be used during a limited space of time, in fact by collecting the classic and timeless power ups, it will be possible to use, for example, a laser pistol but only until the temporal charge is depleted. A little curiosity: among the various gadgets there is also a water jet pack, an element that seems to be very fashionable in recent times in this particular genre... The total areas to be tackled are about forty characterized by a certain linearity which is unfortunately the major flaw of the Midway title. Once you have faced a part of the game it will not make any sense to go back, the progress scheme is in fact fixed and simply pressing the start button will list the objectives to be achieved for advancement to the next phase. As if that weren't enough, the missions to be completed are repetitive, all supported by a plot that has very few interesting implications; Haven and the rest of the cast are not charismatic at all and the dubbing does not help solve this situation but aggravates it. The level of challenge is optimal, never high but still well calibrated. The technique If up to now the comments relating to the latest Traveller's Tale effort have not been flattering, Haven is appreciated on the technical side thanks to various merits. From the point of view of the graphic impact, apart from the 3D models of the characters (all in all well defined but animated in a far from excellent way) we are facing an excellent result. The settings are fantastic and made alive by valuable effects, such as smoke. The textures, also thanks to a bump-mapping-like effect, are of good quality compared to the standards to which the Sony monolith has accustomed us, the color choices are discreet, oriented towards bright shades. Aliasing is present but not invasive, image cleaning is overall good. The game engine, anchored to 50 fps, perfectly manages changes in both atmospheric and meteorological weather with all the consequent effects on lighting and colors that this entails. The control system is excellent, simple and essential: the left stick controls the movement, the right one adjusts the view, the square, cross and circle keys respectively allow you to use the metal yoyo, jump and use the aforementioned timed weapons. The management of three-dimensional space, on the other hand, appears approximate, to give a simple and clarifying example you can do endless queue jumps without the character actually touching the ground. A positive note also for the audio sector, well-made ~epic~ music will accompany us for the entire duration of the game. The dubbing in Italian, which I described above, is to be forgotten: subtitles in Italian with the speech in the original language would have been more appropriate. Comment Haven is not a game we will hear about for long. A good technical realization is not enough to mask a title that turns out to be repetitive in the long run, as well as having nothing really new to offer. This new schoolto platformers that look more and more like action games has recently offered a much better title both in terms of plot and game structure, such as Ratchet & Clank. Haven therefore will not excite the masses while not being a completely throwaway title. Recommended only for those who live on bread and platform. Pros + Good technical system: respectable graphics and sound + Care in the design and implementation of the various game areas Cons - Repetitive - Uninteresting plot and not very charismatic characters - ~Curious~ dubbing The protagonist of the game is Haven, a young slave as well as all the inhabitants of the kingdom of Lord Vetch, the classic bad guy of the moment. The ringing of the ~Voice~ dreamed by Haven could put an end to the evil slave regime by dethroning Lord Vetch who will therefore decide to investigate Haven and make life difficult for him. The player in this adventure will obviously play the role of the protagonist. Will Haven be able to free his people?", "date": "2003-02-11", "grade": null}
