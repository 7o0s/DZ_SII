Born in 1990 on the NES, this interesting cross between a turn-based strategy and a fantasy RPG never left its homeland until 2003, when Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade was released for the first time than in the USA and Europe for the GameBoy Advance. However, it would have been another 10 years before Fire Emblem Awakening, the first chapter for Nintendo 3DS, was able to achieve unanimous success. From that moment on, Intelligent System's strategy has earned a place among Nintendo's great licenses. With the review of Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light let's discover the progenitor of the series, published on the Nintendo Switch eShop to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Fire Emblem. Nintendo's operation for the celebrations follows the outlined pattern from Super Mario. In other words, you will only have a few months to buy Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light from the Nintendo Switch digital store. Then on March 31, inexplicably, the game will disappear from the price list. Another rather controversial decision of this commercial operation is the decision to publish the physical collector's version of Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light only in North America, leaving us Europeans dry-mouthed. As for the playful profile, Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light is the faithful revival of the game that came out for the NES in 1990. With all the advantages and limitations that this kind of operation can have. Finally in the West The possibility of playing the original Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light in English, therefore a slightly more widespread language in our parts than Japanese, is certainly the most interesting element of the whole package. Up until now, in fact, we had been able to appreciate Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light only through ROMs with an amateur translation. The 2008 remake for Nintendo DS, Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, in fact, is a significantly different game, which introduces more modern stories and game mechanics. From this point of view, the work done by Nintendo is of an excellent level and allows you to enjoy Marth's story even after 30 years. Nothing particularly complex, but it is still interesting to rediscover this masterpiece as Intelligent Systems conceived it 30 years ago. In other words, rediscovering a way of creating video games that did without tutorials, a readable interface, trailers and guides and relied more on dialogues and the inevitable instruction manual, the real lack of this re-edition, for being able to tell your game. In the abundant ten hours needed to get to the epilogue, it's nice to see how some of the founding elements of the Fire Emblem series are already present in this progenitor. We speak, of course, of the turn-based structure, permanent death, the epic tone and the use of fortresses and villages to hide bonuses, important information and secret characters. All Fire Emblem lovers, therefore, will find themselves at home and will appreciate this moment amarcord. Feel the years In order to fully appreciate Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light, however, it is necessary to come to terms with the passing of the years. Nintendo, in fact, has been careful to modify the original game as little as possible. A very fascinating thing on the one hand, but impractical on the other. Because if it is true that the lack of modern game mechanics, such as the triangle of weapons or support between units, is not felt very much, it is much more complex to adapt to a rigid interface, which hides various information and does not simplify unit management.In other words, there is a great lack of a system to automatically switch between units, indications on the range of movement of allies and enemies or a preview of how the fight will be. All essential aids to be able to read the battle correctly and to be able to decide whether it is worth trying an attack or not. The game doesn't even say if you have any other moves available or if you've met the requirements for victory. These are all things that are as familiar with today as they were with players in the 90s, but which make you appreciate the leaps in forward facts in terms of the interface and what is called ~quality of life~. The news However, Nintendo wanted, even if minimally, to meet modern players. For example, he has included the rewind, a convenient function with which you can go back a few turns. A workaround to avoid a character's premature death after one gpssa rash, so as not to screw up a game because of a distraction. The bookmark, on the other hand, creates an instant save point that allows you to retrace your steps in case things went wrong. options to speed up the gameplay, in order to increase the speed of the enemy turn or avoid combat sequences and a simple option that allows you to choose between the original 4:3 resolution and a slightly enlarged one, able to better exploit the screen of Switches.", "date": "2020-12-05", "grade": "6.0"}
