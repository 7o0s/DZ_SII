{"name": "Office Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/office-wars.html", "text": "Already presented in unsuspecting times in the form of news from Wirelessgaming, Office Wars has finally arrived at its destination, after having aroused many curiosities in the insiders in the preview phase. In fact, the Vivendi Games Mobile product immediately stood out for a truly original concept within the playful panorama for mobile phones, as well as for a tasty humor that was already apparent from the screenshots released a few weeks ago. Well, now that we have tested Office Wars we can say that the apparent qualities mentioned above have actually proved to be such, even if unfortunately there was no lack of sore points to resize the work Vivendi Games Mobile. But first things first: Office Wars allows the user to impersonate four employees of Calamaro Piccante S.P.A. (Buck the boss, Mary the secretary, Bob the apprentice and Jeremy the trade unionist) who fight for survival in the office, dividing themselves between friendships and quarrels with colleagues, jokes and more or less veiled conspiracies, all peppered with truly absurd dialogues . The control system is very simple: eight keys to move in the same number of directions and a single button dedicated to contextual actions. In Office Wars it is possible to carry out a whole series of activities, except for work: there are magazines to read, plants to water, coffee to drink, video games to complete and so on. Each action taken takes up a certain amount of minutes, and above all it allows you to appear in a better or worse light in the eyes of your colleagues. The title is structured in missions with the most diverse objectives, which however most of the time are resolved in routine procedures. And here the biggest limitation of Office Wars emerges, namely that of not being able to sufficiently revive a play structure that is by its nature rather cyclical and repetitive, which forces the player to tasks that are not always fun and stimulating. In this sense, the loadings - very frequent and not always short - and the substantial limitation of the play area, limited to the handful of office rooms, certainly do not help. The actions to be performed soon become boring, and the similarity of the missions between the various characters flattens the gameplay: fortunately, the humor that leaks from every situation sweetens the experience, making it pleasant even if not thrilling. The cosmetic sector also helps to raise the situation, of which the contextual animations of the characters should be praised above all, very diversified and always decidedly nice. Office Wars is a very nice game to look at also thanks to the perfect use of colors and the attention to detail of the settings, and finally it is accompanied by quite varied and absolutely non-invasive music.
