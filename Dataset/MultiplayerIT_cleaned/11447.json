{"name": "Sega Bass Fishing - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-bass-fishing-recensione.html", "text": "Your friend, a joint made of magic Sega Bass Fishing is a pure SEGA-style arcade game, it has few modes and is stingy with options. The first is the classic practice, thanks to which we don't have to fear the incessant passage of time and which we use to fish in peace, deepen our knowledge of hooks and refine casting techniques. Arcade mode is the perfect TV reproduction of the arcade cabinet, complete with a timer to mark a frenetic pace of play. Selecting tournament, on the other hand, starts a ranked challenge that takes place in ten different casting locations, and has the goal of catching as many fish as possible. Finally, there is an option that allows us to fish where and as much as we want, without limits and in complete relaxation, a characteristic sensation of this sport made up of waiting rather than action. Arcade mode is the perfect TV transposition of the arcade cabinet Your friend, a joint made of magic The gameplay of Sega Bass Fishing is typically hit and run due to its origins: the games last a few minutes, and there is no real sense of progression, both in the sense of manual dexterity and in regards to the game itself. Unlike many other SEGA arcades, where despite the simplicity of the controls and the ease of learning there was a very differentiated skill curve, Bass Fishing is decidedly flat from this point of view: once you understand the mechanism and what you have to do to to pull up the fish, you do it as quickly as possible, and the game ends in this way. No multiplayer options have been implemented, nor for online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: modes that would certainly have given a new and vigorous lifeblood to this title by now folded in on itself for too long. An old, new fishing experience Seven completely new levels have been created exclusively for this Nintendo Wii edition, which are added to four of the arcade version and four others seen on the Sega Dreamcast, for a total of fifteen different locations where we can throw our hook. The ~Bass~, or freshwater trout, are of four different species: the Florida Large Mouth, the Red Eye, the Small Mouth and the Northern Spike Large Mouth, and each has different behaviors and reactions to the hooks selectable in the game, more than fifteen different types. The gaming experience has been renewed thanks to the Wii controls: the movement to be carried out to cast the line faithfully follows that of the fishing rod-shaped peripheral already seen on the Dreamcast, with the difference that now you can choose to retrieve the hook between pressing a button, or the realistic and rotating gesture to be performed with the nunchuck. The Wii Remote vibrates, moves and creates sounds that intensify the sensation of actually being face to face with our aquatic prey, making the simulation excellent but at the same time keeping the gesture fun and immediate. Furthermore, the possibility of driving your own boat has been added thanks to the control stick. The environmental conditions in which the fishing sessions take place are dynamic: the seasons and the climate influence the density and behavior of the preys. Even the time of day we choose to fish affects, or at least it should, the amount of trout that populate the game area: in reality there are no big differences, and the situations seem to be guided by fate rather than the weather. Fishing has no age or limitations, in perfect harmony with the Wii spirit Each hook works differently, and each requires a different detail to be retrieved and dragged. There are surface ones, floating ones and deep ones; it is not difficult to know how to maneuver them but it is important to learn which ones are more effective in certain circumstances. Once the fish bites, the challenge begins and a bar appears on the screen indicating the tension of the line. If the latter is too weak, it is necessary to pull more, on the contrary, if it is stretched too much it risks breaking, and it is therefore important to release at the right time, neither too late nor too early. With small fish the procedure is quite simple and quick, while with those of a certain size you have to fight and sweat a bit before being able to haul them up on the boat. Sega Bass Fishing is a game from almost ten years ago, and its graphic cosmetics are affected by all the years it carries on its shoulders: nowadays it is almost anachronistic to see a game converted from the less powerful console of a generation ago developed. Sega Bass Fishing is a game from almost ten years ago, and its graphic cosmetics are affected by all the years it hasshoulders Fishing has no age or limitations, in perfect harmony with the Wii spirit There are no effects, there aren't many polygons, but above all there is no banal online ranking. The design, the HUD and the controls and display graphics have remained identical to the previous versions of the game, with the result that this Bass Fishing oozes a retro air from every pore, giving - so to speak - to all its players a 90s deja-vu with a typically SEGA flavour. Bass Fishing is characterized by colorful writings, menus with huge and round fonts, but above all an audio sector that is the son of the same synthesizer that created Sega Rally, Virtua Cop, Daytona and all the other legendary games from the house of the blue hedgehog. The sound effects, the music and the voices shouted in a forcibly British English are now a trademark of the SEGA arcade titles: beautiful, warm and recognizable, but terribly ancient nowadays, belonging to a world that we all love but peaked a decade ago. Comment Bass Fishing Wii is yet another console revival of the famous SEGA franchise that had its peak in the past generation. The controls of the Nintendo console were certainly the reason for this conversion, which brings very little new and has all the flavor of an easy commercial choice. Despite the new levels and controls that work perfectly, its aftertaste is too old, especially for those who already know the game and enjoyed it in the past. For everyone else, Bass Fishing represents a good pastime, an arcade game with a decidedly flat thickness but still immediate and fun in its simplicity.Pros The control system works Realism of the fish It's still fun Cons Technically obsolete No multiplayer and online Low depth", "date": "2008-05-02", "grade": null}
