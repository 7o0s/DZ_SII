{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-2004_a.html", "text": "But that's me! After the full 3D passage on 128-bit platforms, the definitive maturation at a playful level took place in the 2003 edition, with the improvement of the analog swing system, which was finally satisfactory. What was missing for the final glorification was a massive side dish capable of entertaining the player for a long time, and this is precisely the way that the programmers decided to go. Hence, after an exhilarating intro made with the game's engine, we are faced with an infinite sequence of modalities, an extremely rich tournament that re-proposes the PGA tour experience, and even a random event based on a calendar aligned with the internal clock of the console! If all this were not enough, the proverbial icing is represented by a new feature loudly trumpeted on the back cover: the Game Face mode. This mode is one of the best EA gimmicks of recent years, and deserves an in-depth description. Through an intuitive interface, it will be possible to create your own virtual golfer, establishing his connotations and physical features through numerous parameters. Of course, you have already seen such a possibility many times, but the programmers have definitely outdone themselves in terms of completeness, offering the player the possibility of perfectly recreating his own digital alter-ego, as well as the opportunity to enjoy the improvements made to the graphics engine. Such detailed polygonal figures have never been seen in a similar game, with a modeling of the faces that borders on the maniacal and a softness that reaches the most refined oriental productions. The comparison will seem senseless to you, but evaluating the direction taken by the game in this edition, Tiger Woods 2004 looks like a Gran Turismo that delights on the green, the enormous decision-making flexibility and the sense of progress closely resemble the Polyphony masterpiece. Once the creation of our player is finished, we will be diverted to a well-stocked shop where we can invest our savings in the impossible: from the basic equipment for model games, to the coolest clothes, ending up with the most futile objects. We can also glimpse the imprint of post-Barbie fetishism (but also The Sims of EA itself) revived by DOAX, with the possibility of embellishing one's characters with the most disparate objects, from earrings to necklaces, from watches to hair dyes! It is immediately clear that the pro-shop is an element that is anything but marginal or dissociated from the playful context, making it essential for improving one's skills, and therefore progressing in tournaments. Obviously everything comes at a steep price, and the database is nothing short of mammoth. Hence the need to immediately jump headlong into the most affordable tournaments to raise the money needed to fulfill the most immediate needs. Doesn't all this remind you of your first races with a very modest Mazda, dreaming of the most performing custom-built cars? Yes to us. Xbox vs PS2 We tested Tiger Woods 2004 for both versions. The palm of the winner is awarded to the Microsoft console, but only for greater video cleaning and slightly faster loading thanks to the support of the hard disk. The PS2 version suffers from aliasing and flickering phenomena, but otherwise we are faced with the same graphics engine (therefore excellent). In our opinion, these are not differences capable of representing a decisive criterion of choice. Instead, the inevitable comparison (in the Xbox area) with the now upcoming Links 2004 which, unlike TW, offers full Live support. Certainly not an easy choice, which we at Multiplayer diplomatically leave to you readers. W the abundance As already mentioned, the available modes have reached an inordinate number: training, stroke game, one-on-one matches, eccentric arcade challenges and even a world tour. All this could vanish in the face of a small number of paths, but also in this sense abundance reigns supreme. As many as 21 courses, including many licensed courses such as the inevitable and enchanting Pebble Beach, but also TPC at Sawgrass, Spyglass Hill and many others. For the more imaginative, there is no shortage of rather bizarre original paths, to be unlocked by progressing in the game. Even the number of golfers available is certainly no less, with the black champion who stands out for his marked charisma, but considering the completeness of the edit mode, being able to tread the fields with your own character represents an essential opportunity. Technically speaking, although the engine has not been rewritten from scratch, the aesthetic quality achieved in this update is literally astounding. The eye constantly escapes the cambit of action by the athlete, getting lost in the poignant panoramas, on the flocks of birds that rise to the sky, on the audience that silently watches the shot. The latter is finally at a decent quality level, and comes alive in relation to the results of the action. The coup de grace comes from the typically EA directorial cut, totally projected to the most extreme spectacularization, with breathtaking zooms, 16:9 cut and everything necessary to raise the galvanization beyond the guard limits. For the rest, it is played as always, performing the swing using the analog stick after preview zooming on the point of impact of the ball. The programmers have played a lot on general permissiveness, gently accompanying the newbie with a plethora of tutorials, tips and instant assignment of the most suitable club for shooting. Spaghetti! The intentions are immediately clear, the playful offer presented by the game mainly wants to satisfy the needs of an arcade immediacy, a factor further underlined by the presence of super-shots in the style of the famous SPA-GHET-TI of the cartoon Ashita Tenki Ni Nare (in Ita All in the field with Lotti). As always, it is possible to apply the spin to the ball in flight to correct potentially harmful landings, a characterization that could make the purists of this discipline turn up their noses. But Tiger Woods 2004 is like this, an arcade dressed for special occasions, bloody fun, relaxing and evasive. One could argue the lack of substantial innovations in the play department, the approach has remained completely unchanged compared to the predecessor; winning team does not change, but a further study of the swing would have been at least desirable. In fact, it is still impossible to establish the perfect calibration of the power of the shot, denied by the lack of a special indicator. The possibility of correcting post-swing shots exaggerately encourages the player to use the turbo to consume the most demanding distances, bringing the simulation factor to practically zero. Even putting still proves to be a bit too approximate, providing only a faint trace of the slope on the optimal ball/hole trajectory, leaving everything else to skill and luck. Paradoxically, this section proves to be much more simulative than long shots, requiring a fair amount of effort not facilitated by the impossibility of a precise dosage of power per shot. The soundtrack is decidedly more apt than last year, with a well-chosen series of pop-rock and hip-hop motifs that contribute to a fresh and very cool look, even if with a strong Yankee taste. Too bad for the lack of online support (completely absent on Xbox, limited to America on PS2), a deficit that casts a worrying shadow on EA policies in this area Comment There is no doubt about it, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is the state of grace of the series. A first-rate graphics engine is combined with an immediately satisfying playability, qualities that reach their peak with an amazing custom mode and a longevity glorified by endless competitions. At this point you may ask yourself the reason for the contrast between our enthusiastic words and the final evaluation. The reasons are mainly to be found in the lack of real innovations compared to the previous edition, a factor that is by no means negligible for those who have been following this saga since its inception. All the others can easily raise their score by one point, EA Sports hit the mark, but for next year we expect a real step forward. Pros: Relevant technical realization The Game Face mode is fantastic It will last you until next year Cons: Nothing new from a playful point of view Too basic for the most demanding No online support (PS2 USA only) Faithful to its annual release policy, EA Sports continues unabated to offer its successful sports brands. Among these we have the new Tiger Woods, the latest representative of the golf saga that has been able to renew itself the most over the years, at least in relation to the titles of the famous Canadian softhouse. Let's see what are the additions made by this juicy sequel.", "date": "2003-11-13", "grade": null}
