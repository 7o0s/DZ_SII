After the excellent BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger by Arc System and the superb Super Street Fighter 4 by Capcom, the word goes to the third pole of beat'em up made in Japan: the historic home of Fatal Fury and King of Fighters, SNK! After some time of absence, the neo (so to speak) Korean software house author of hundreds of successes at the time of NeoGeo returns to the next-gen environment dusting off one of its ancient past glories, that Samurai Shodown which, like Street Fighter 2, brought to the coin-op environment a whole series of novelties and innovations that made history, such as the use of weapons, the zoom, a different combat system and unprecedented graphic effects at the forefront of the time. What can another fighting game tell us about matches after hundreds of them have come out in two decades, but above all right now that the ~definitive~ titles seem to have come out? It's hard for SNK to innovate again and at the same time maintain the tradition that characterizes it, especially with perhaps the most historical and culturally Japanese title of their infinite and wonderful soft library. A Samurai who takes time For the new chapter of the series, called Samurai Shodown: Sen, one of the best SNK illustrators returns to the fore, that Senri Kita already character designer of the old chapters Samurai Shodown 64 and the Warriors Rage for PlayStation, as well as Garou, numerous KOF and Fire Emblem by Nintendo. As for Sen, however, it is actually a coin-op port released in far April 2008 in Japan, and initially intended for Xbox Live Arcade (for this reason, probably, it remained exclusive for the Microsoft machine). These two factors have certainly had a significant and negative impact on the final qualitative yield as regards technical realization and the completeness of the final package. The development of Samurai Shodown: Sen indeed began way back in 2006, and subsequently had a very long and troubled year of beta-testing in some selected arcades between Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, USA and Mexico; the long trial period around the world, however, did not in the end lead to the creation of a truly valid product worthy of the important name it bears. This is a series that no fan would have ever felt the need or the desire to have a transposition in full 3D, exactly as happened with the disastrous spin-off Street Fighter EX. This chapter is in fact the concrete example that demonstrates all the reasons why SNK should never have engaged in this (excessively) daring project. Samurai Shodown: Sen is not the first chapter of the series to have a three-dimensional look, and the previous ~experiments~ had certainly not inflamed spirits: with a much slower and dull gameplay, a graphics sector not in step with the times and for more scarcely deep and challenging, we can safely think that Samurai Shodown is today in a dead end squeezed between the evergreen Street Fighter, the new BlazBlue and the excellent Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter. Xbox 360 goals Like any Xbox 360 game, this Samurai Shodown also puts the usual 1000 points on the plate to unlock, through 50 objectives. Almost 2/3 of the total score is obtained simply by completing the game with each fighter, and is therefore related to the offline mode. The rest is unlocked (with a lot of effort) by playing ranked matches and getting as many victories as possible. A decidedly retro game The mapping of the pad studied for Samurai Shodown: Sen reveals that yes, all the available keys have been used, but that the combination of them does not give rise to a sufficiently wide variety of moves and combos for all 24 available characters. We find among them some true icons of the series such as Galford, Jubei, Haohmaru, Ukyo and Hanzo, joined by some new entries such as the Korean Kim Hae-Ryeong, the Nordic Garros and the black samurai J. Their fighting style is relatively varied and ranges from faster characters, more adept at sinking blows or dodging opponents. In matches, in addition to the classic energy bar, we find a second, smaller one, which indicates our level of ~Rage~ (anger) which increases as we suffer the opponent's blows. Once filled, this allows us to carry out a series of more devastating and powerful moves capable of turning the tide of the match. During a match, regardless of the special move that can be activated thanks to anger, the shots that really work and manage to inflict any damage on the enemy are counted on the fingers of one hand, discouraging the player bothlook for new combos than to use the few that he manages to carry out. The range of possibilities, compared to any other 3D fighting game (just think of the SEGA or Namco ones), is infinitely more restricted and castrating. What annoys, in addition to the lack of a concrete variety of attacks, combos and special moves, is also the chronic lack of animations and movements, a factor directly connected to the first problem. Samurai Shodown: Sen, therefore, is an extremely repetitive game. Most of the time it's a question of having to block the opponent's combos and go back with the two main blows, the fastest and most lethal, hoping to have good timing and therefore win. SNK originally used a Taito TypeX2 arcade board to develop the game, still valid for churning out excellent 2D games (BlazBlue, for example), but with decidedly poor and backward technical characteristics for a 3D title of today. The polygonal models of the main characters seem to have been borrowed from a PlayStation 2 or Dreamcast title (with all due respect to these two wonderful consoles), with too sparing use of polygons and textures, decidedly flat and dull, but above all drawn at too much resolution. low and watercolour. The backgrounds, which (historically) reflect typically Japanese landscapes with castles, rural views and villages, are evocative and decidedly attractive for any lover of Japanese culture, but also made with too little care and use of effects. A missed opportunity Regardless of an all-too-basic gameplay and a dull and backward technical sector, the problems of Samurai Shodown: Sen certainly do not end there. Even if we want to get into the spirit of the game at all costs, it certainly doesn't help us to be understood and appreciated. In training mode, which is always necessary in games of this kind, it is not possible to set or calibrate the enemy AI in any way, for example by giving precise orders such as being on guard or attacking. There's not even a combo counter that allows us to practice and improve, all options present in any fighting game worthy of respect. As in a sort of samurai simulator, Sen bases most of his gameplay on the use of defensive techniques and counterattacks (vertical, horizontal and grappling strikes) with truly brutal execution moves, in which blood flows freely, and special strikes capable of almost halving the opponent's energy. Someone might find this decidedly simplified system amusing, but a true lover of fighting games will feel terribly limited by the limited possibilities offered. The arcade mode is devoid of any sensible story to follow, and in addition to the lack of a real training mode, there are no other options than the classic survival and online multiplayer. The latter works quite well, without lag or slowdowns, but the real problem seems to be rather the difficulty in finding opponents since almost all enthusiasts are playing online titles of a much different thickness. Some sporadic offline slowdowns should also be noted, identified in particular stages and only in some confusing situations, and an anonymous sound sector with effects and music reduced to the bone both in quality and quantity. More than a next-gen return, for the historic SNK saga we really have to talk about a missed opportunity.", "date": "2010-06-01", "grade": "4.8"}
