Hard to think it's positive, given that as soon as you bring your mind to China the first images to appear are those of shameless clones justified by almost non-existent copyright regulations. Yet Chinese developers are not simply drones without skill and creativity that emulate what comes from the West by adapting it to their audience: there is a mysterious undergrowth of independent teams and skilled programmers that for us European gamers is completely alien, from which they can emerge far more remarkable products than one might expect. On the other hand, if you spend years studying the evolution of the market of others and absorbing the knowledge of teams from all over the globe, sooner or later something good must come out of you, especially if you are part of a population that has billions of people and boasts unmatched adaptability. With the absurdity of the situation described above, however, the amazement of seeing such projects arrive on our shores remains, and in fact there are many jaws dropped after playing Icey, a curious action game by the Shanghai Fantablade Network. However, don't think for a moment that Icey is a classic 2D action game: if it left us speechless it is because - while referring to other already known products - it dares to completely overturn the classic narrative of this genre of titles and experiment with find brilliants of various kinds. Icey is, in simple terms, proof that Chinese independent developers are closer to ours than we thought. Indeed, perhaps they have already surpassed them. Icey's review, a Chinese indie that isn't what it seems In the mind of the narrator Icey initially seems the most banal of the action. It starts with a skin and bones plot which, after a short tutorial, sees the robotic protagonist looking for a certain Judas, the inevitable final boss to be destroyed to save the world. However, when we were talking about ~already known products~ that inspired the Fantablade title, we didn't mean other action games, but a game very far from this genre... or The Stanley Parable. No, wait, we haven't lost our minds: Icey really has a lot to do with The Stanley Parable, because it exploits very similar gimmicks, its campaign is almost entirely built on meta-narrative, and it boasts a non-omniscient narrator who commands the player he is free to disobey at almost any moment, creating absurd situations. Where The Stanley Parable, however, often veered towards the absurd or the hilarious representation of modern videogame development, Icey tries to take darker, illegible and unpredictable paths. Sure, there's no shortage of hilarious moments and fourth wall breaks, but once you've reached some ~blocks~ you realize that to reassemble the real story of the game you need to explore all its secrets in detail, and that's where things get complicated. In fact, Icey has a checkpoint system that also restarts the narrator when used, precisely for the purpose of replaying the various stages in multiple ways and revealing every facet: thus he manages to expand his longevity from a barely couple of hours up to more by triple. However, believe us if we tell you that you will really want to discover all the secrets of the game, because some really give you great satisfaction, while others will surely make you laugh out loud. For heaven's sake, when the storyline detaches itself from the humorous meta-narrative to follow more unfathomable roads, it occasionally exceeds, but the final result remains highly commendable. Once the narrative element has been overcome, then, we are talking about a more than solid game even in terms of mechanics, because at the base it is still an action. Perfection does not exist From the point of view of pure gameplay, after all, Icey does not differ much from similar actions that have applied to the two mechanical dimensions seen in the most famous members of the genre. For example, the excellent Dust could come to mind, yet Icey contains a combat system based on multiple maneuvers, complex combinations and counter-moves after dodging opponents' shots at the last second that bring it closer to the Platinum Games titles. In addition to enjoying an incredibly branched and unpredictable storyline, in short, here we play, and especially if we face the greatest difficulties, there is no shortage of truly challenging moments, against enemies capable of combining ranged attacks, sudden grabs and truly devastating blows for the protagonist. Precisely this push on the accelerator of the difficulty shows the side of the mechanics, however, since against certain combinations of enemies in difficult Icey it forces an extremely passive approach, almost entirely managed around the countersomosse just mentioned and the ability to deliver area shots by collecting the energy of fallen enemies after an execution (or, again, by exploiting attacks that make you invulnerable at the cost of a small percentage of life points). In an overall assessment, in practice, we do not reach excellence due to obvious imbalances in the maneuvers, and the possibility of developing the protagonist at the checkpoints is not enough to rebalance everything. For heaven's sake, we're actually splitting hairs in four, and we're talking about a very enjoyable title even if taken as a pure action; simply the Fantablade product stands out more for its narrative than for its playability. Stylistically, on the other hand, we have no criticisms of any kind: it is a stylistically solid game, which often accompanies its crazy narrative with sudden image distortions that are very appropriate to the situation, and defends itself admirably also with regard to sound. For the record, don't worry about optimization problems, it seems to run great even on old carts.", "date": "2016-12-24", "grade": "8.5"}
