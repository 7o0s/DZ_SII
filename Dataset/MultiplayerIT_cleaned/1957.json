{"name": "Hitman 2 - Day Three", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-2-day-three.html", "text": "Monasteries, cities, secret shelters Problems with the camera following the character have been fixed. Now, before the camera follows the exact movement of the character, a few seconds pass and it remains a little further away, giving a greater sense of depth to the game and avoiding creating scenes in which it is not clear where our killer is. However, it is also possible to play in first person, even if in this case the fantastic animations of our favorite hitman are completely lost; animations that have been treated in detail even with regard to facial expressions. Enemies have also been made more realistic and animations have been improved tremendously. The settings seem less ~plastic~; cities are built according to a plausible logic and even the interiors of buildings have their own functionality. In short, no more empty rooms placed there just to make up the number. Among the nicest aspects there are some details such as the birds in the meadow of the monastery, which we can make run away and chase, the atmospheric effects and other ideas that make the game itself less fictitious and more plausible. The only thing that Hitman 2 really lacks to give a sense of depth and immersion in reality is a quantity of people walking around the cities. The only people we meet are the guards, or the bosses, or at least someone willing to kill us if we're not careful. There are no old ladies walking around, people going to work or shopping, etc. It's a pity because they would certainly have given more dynamism to a game that is in any case at very high quality levels. The technicalities of the case I got to try this title on two different systems: the first is an Athlon 1700+ XP with GeForce3Ti and 1GB of RAM; on this system, at maximum detail and very high resolution, the game runs very well. Fluid like never before and even with a ton of effects simultaneously on the screen it doesn't make sense. The second configuration is a Pentium3 800MHz with GeForce and 512Mb of RAM. On this system it was not possible to go beyond the resolution of 1024x768 without suffering from the low power of the CPU and the graphics chipset. However, remaining in this resolution or below, the game is still very fluid. It is probably quite playable even on a slightly lower-end machine, as long as it is equipped with an nVidia GeForce card or higher. Conclusion Hitman 2 is a particularly complex game that summarizes many aspects of other games in a single title: we have the action of FPS, the strategy, the puzzles to solve and the management of our resources in preparation for the missions. In practice it is a very complete and attractive game for those who like to try their hand at challenges. One might complain that it is a bit ~short~ to finish. It is possible to be able to finish it in less than 20 hours, but it must also be said that the gaming experience of these 20 hours goes far beyond that of many other longer titles. It should also be taken into account that Hitman 2 is absolutely replayable. Each mission can be completed in many different ways, and even if you have already finished the whole story once, you want to replay all the missions to see what other systems you could adopt in the various missions to be able to finish it again. Another sore point is that it's not a multiplayer game. From my point of view, this is good. I really don't see a title like Hitman 2 in a multi-user version. As it is, it's a beautiful single player game that offers the complete experience. Monasteries, cities, secret shelters In Hitman 2, as in the previous chapter, the view is in third person behind the back of the protagonist. Already with the first Hitman this was a winning choice. The fact of seeing your character and part of the environment that surrounds him, in a game that relies heavily on stealth elements, is something not to be underestimated. We can safely control where we are and ~walk~ the corpses of our enemies and hide them so that no one can see them. All this, without having to hope to have guessed the right positions.", "date": "2002-11-02", "grade": null}
