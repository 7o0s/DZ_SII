The passion for this fascinating sport, often opposed to the ~ball~ for the behavior of the players inside and outside the pitch, is especially rampant in countries linked to the former British Empire, which brings together the strongest teams in the world such as New Zealand (the legendary All Blacks), South Africa and Australia, protagonists of the fascinating ~Three Nations~ until 2011, when it was transformed into The Rugby Championship with the addition of Argentina. Considering the millions of people involved and the huge following of the most important international competitions, it is incredible to think that up to now a videogame truly worthy of this sport has not been produced, between low-budget or simply mediocre productions that have followed one another, with no solution continuity over the last decade. Among the software houses at the forefront of supporting the movement is the Canadian HB Studios, author of various themed titles up to the controversial Rugby World Cup 2011, a generally poor production which however has gathered some admirers, probably satisfied due to the total lack of alternatives. After a few years of pause, the surprise announcement of Rugby 15, among other things also shaped for new generation consoles, has awakened disappointed fans from their torpor, igniting hope for an at least decent work. We thoroughly tested the PlayStation 4 version, and to find out how it went, you just have to read on. EA and HB Studios try again with Rugby 15, but awkwardly miss the goal Same weight, same size Ok, simulating a complicated sport like rugby union must be anything but simple, not only for the technical regulation, rich in nuances, but also and above all for the numerous physical contacts that characterize it, where scrums, rucks, mauls and so on and so forth are not at all easy to translate into commands on the joypad. Historically, the ~disasters~ made on the old rugby simulations fell particularly on the aforementioned phases, which defining approximate and grotesque is a compliment. Unfortunately, things have not turned for the better in the latest effort from HB Studios, but let's proceed in order and start with the positive aspects - very few - that characterize Rugby 15. The appearance of the menus is not the most elegant, but it is the intention is clear to wink at the fascinating interfaces of the latest Fifa and Pes, where the various options are enclosed in well-organized squares and rectangles on the screen. The first thing that catches the eye is the official license for some tournaments, such as Aviva Premiership Rugby, i.e. the top English professional league, the Top 14 and Pro D2, respectively French League 1 and League 2, and the Pro 12 , a tournament open to European clubs where this year our Benetton Treviso and Zebre di Parma are also playing. A rather rich and interesting dish for fans, who will find the official logos of the various teams and the original names of the players. The other side of the coin, as far as licenses are concerned, is represented by international tournaments and teams, yes present but without original logos and names. In short, in Jacques Brunel's Italy, instead of the already mentioned Castrogiovanni or Sergio Parisse, we find guys called Columbus Stanton, Alexander Lupercio and Pasquale Villafuerte, without even attempting to mimic the original names, as happened nicely in the old Pro Evolution Soccer . The Super Rugby competition dedicated to some Australian, New Zealand and South African clubs is also accessible in the main menu, but it too is completely unlicensed and is nicknamed Southern 15. Fortunately, it is possible to indulge yourself with the appropriate editor and rename all the players with false names, an interesting option which however, upon closer inspection, hides the mediocrity that characterizes the entire project. All the players, in fact, appear to have a height of 188 cm and a weight of 100 kilograms, an alarm bell that is revealed with violence once they take the field. We will talk about it in the next paragraph. Beyond the aforementioned competitions, it is possible to play a friendly match or create a custom cup with sufficiently complete options, although even in this case some puzzling details emerge. Trying to access it, in fact, a message immediately appearsor error that tells us that we have reached the limit of ~40 characters~ to write the name of the cup. A doubly curious fact, considering that the default name is ~New Competition~, which has only fifteen characters, including the space. Turning a blind eye to these defects and selecting the desired challenge, before taking the field there is one last set of options that can be managed, namely the duration of the match, the level of difficulty, the time, the weather conditions and the management of the draw, with extra time and ~sudden death~. Another curious note, by selecting the match at night, a mysterious ~delete~ appears among the various weather conditions available, which we still haven't been able to decipher. Run Forrest, run! Suspicious of the flaws mentioned above, as a first test we launch ourselves into a fascinating Six Nations tournament, with the hope in our hearts that it was only a matter of ~mistakes~ in the translation; the spectacle that appears before our eyes, however, confirms the suspicions that have been circulated from the outset. Beyond the anachronistic technical sector, which we will discuss in detail in the next paragraph, what is striking is the absence of any presentation of the match: whether you are playing the current friendly or the final of the most prestigious tournament, each match will always start in the same way, with the shot on the field and the player ready to kick off. In short, forget stadium choreographies, close-ups of players, national anthems and the like, there is no presentation in Rugby 15, just as you will not find replays. The amazement for the visual rendering is even less than what you feel pad in hand, given that the control system, although full of commands, is not very responsive, sometimes governed by chance and sunk by some absurd solutions to say the least. Let's proceed in order. With the left analog stick of the Dualshock 4, the selected player moves (L1 for the switch), but there is no key for running: simply, by holding the stick pressed in the desired direction, the player accelerates accordingly. The most ridiculous aspect lies in the fact that the shot is so sudden, especially with the fastest players, that in practice you go from a static phase to a maximum sprint, with no intermediate phases. Even more bizarre is the fact that, running diagonally, you often go faster than going straight, and continuously changing direction with sudden rotations of the stick, sometimes the control system ~stumbles~ losing input: the behavior of the opposing lines at our evolutions, which follow the movements of the ball carrier like a school of fish or a flock of birds chased by a predator. As you surely know, in rugby the aim is to score points possibly through tries, and the dribbling of opponents who try to tackle is one of the most exciting and spectacular actions. In Rugby 15 this is probably the only successful and fun moment, because sometimes, despite the above defects, it is possible to create some interesting action by making quick passes between the various players, to be performed with the combination of the right stick plus the R2 key. Nonetheless, due to the sudden accelerations, the image of Forrest Gump flying over an American football field often comes to mind, eliciting more than one laugh. Dreams of glory towards the goal, to be fulfilled with the simultaneous pressure of L3 plus R3, are often shattered by the last opposing defender, who emerges from the screen at exactly the best moment, sometimes without even being signaled on the mini-map at the bottom. The tackles are often clumsy and grotesque, and the ball carrier is practically sucked into the opponent, with very little leeway to wriggle out of the hold. Once on the ground, in the classic ruck, but also in the scrum or during the mauls, the round minigame to take possession of the ball starts, in which, depending on the situation, it is necessary to correctly position the indicator on green - with the right stick - and madly press the R2 key, also useful for heeling. Winning the aforementioned minigame is very easy even on the highest difficulty level, making the games decidedly unbalanced in favor of the player. There is no doubt that simulating such contact situations in a video game is very difficult, but it is beyond dispute that the developers could have done much more to make them believable. Because of the ~annoying~ tackles, playing the ball with your feet is almost impossible, and the various up and unders, chips and grubbers become practically useless for the action, so much so that even the artificial intelligence hardly uses them butthe. In the dozens of games played to analyze the product, we have conceded only one drop goal, while all too often we have seen free kicks into touch, even when there was no real need. Things are noticeably better with set pieces, where it is necessary to go through a classic minigame by regulating the power of the shot - with the right stick - and paying attention to the speed of the wind, although even in this situation there are imponderable situations. With the directional cross it is possible to set different attack and defense strategies, some of which also work sufficiently well, if they were not trivialized by the aforementioned playful dynamics. The entire gameplay therefore lacks the care and refinement that would be appropriate for a simulation worthy of the name, and, although as specified it is also possible to have fun in certain circumstances, there is no doubt that we are dealing with a cheap job. However, it cannot be excluded that some enthusiasts, as was the case for Rugby 08 and Rugby World Cup 2011, will be able to close both eyes (one is not enough) in the face of these objective shortcomings, which explode - literally - in the absolute mediocrity of the technical sector. Back to the past If from a purely playful point of view, the HB Studios work shows its side to serious critical issues, the technical one reveals itself as one of the ugliest and most buggy that have appeared in recent years, and probably as the worst on PlayStation 4. At the first shot of the field game, we really couldn't believe our eyes: we haven't seen a turf with such uniform and repeated textures since the days of the Amiga 500. You read that right; with certain lighting conditions, the pitch is simply awful, and the stadium (only one for the whole game!) that welcomes it is a fuzzy jumble of polygons, where an indefinite audience squirms. Furthermore, the players are all the same mannequins - forget you can recognize the famous ones - differentiated only by the hair and the color of the skin. The animations are often ridiculous and lack fundamental frames, which culminate in polygonal interpenetrations or hilarious situations, in which perhaps the movement of the hands is directed to one side and the ball splashes like a missile from the opposite one. Fortunately, the physics of the oval ball are not always bad, but seeing players and the ball teleport or crawl - especially in scrum situations - is really depressing, considering that we are talking about a 2014 production on a console as powerful as the PlayStation 4. If this that wasn't enough, the frame rate is dancer in various circumstances, a symptom that the Unity engine has not been optimized properly. In rainy conditions, among other things, the dull colors of the uniforms often create confusion, in a visual jumble of rare ugliness. The audio commentary by Stuart Barnes is also bad, with sentences repeated beyond belief like the one on the ~Olympic sprint~ mentioned at practically every goal scored, just as the sound effects are bad, with really poor and not very incisive samples. The icing on the cake is the total absence of online multiplayer, essential for any modern sportsman, and there are even systematic crashes. Playing the Six Nations on medium difficulty, for example, finishing in the ruck between Italy and Scotland, we encountered the CE-34878-0 error several times, which sent us back to the console dashbaord as the most feared of the ~Guru Meditation~. To conclude the tournament we were forced to lower the difficulty level to easy, which strangely does not make the mistake happen. Having won the competition, we were hoping for at least some form of congratulations, but we were projected into the very sad ~classifications~ screen (classifications were too complicated) obtaining only the word ~Champion!~, placed in the middle of the screen, as a prize.", "date": "2014-12-09", "grade": "3.0"}
