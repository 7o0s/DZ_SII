{"name": "Mind Quiz - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mind-quiz-recensione.html", "text": "IQ 2007 Mind Quiz looks graphically like a traveling school, equipped with all the necessary spaces to be able to refresh and increase one's brain reactivity. The teacher who will guide the brains waiting for new subject within the game, after a summary presentation of the possibilities offered by the Mind Quiz school, will ask the player's age and gender and then proceed to a first summary intelligence test, to establish thus the starting point. The games/tests will be divided into four distinct categories: calculation, memory, judgment and reflexes, each category will in turn be formed by a whole series of quizzes which, starting from the simplest and most basic, will evolve (by unlocking them) into their decidedly more complex versions and which will take more than a few seconds to be able to reach the solution. The PSP adapts as it can to the format of the game: once the stylus and the touch screen have been removed, the player will be able to give answers by selecting them from the 4 associated with the four buttons circle, square, x and triangle. In the calculation exercises it will be sufficient to initially insert the correct sign to complete the operation, as the difficulty increases, however, the player will have to solve equations of the first degree, make complex calculations based on the color and position of the numbers displayed. With the judgment the game will propose a series of exercises based on the recognition of shapes, on the addition of the same and on challenging numerical series to unravel. The reflex category will rely on each player's eye-hand speed, putting them in the situation of having to press a series of buttons in series, based on how they appear on the screen. Lastly, memory will be linked to pure memorization exercises of numerical sequences, shapes and combinations of images. In addition to the now classic daily mode linked to the test of one's own brain capacity (of which historical trace will be kept absolutely, in order to allow the player to verify any improvements or deteriorations), Mind Quiz will allow players to train with the already unlocked quizzes, compete with the challenge around the world (useful to unlock additional quizzes and some extras) and with the exams: a special section dedicated to specific tests linked to one or more elements such as time, precision and category. In addition to the pure test modes, it will be possible to analyze one's progress in the menu dedicated to the graphs, also divided according to a whole series of particular rankings aimed at analyzing each specific aspect of the game. Also noteworthy is the presence of a ~network~ mode that will allow you to connect online in search of an opponent to challenge with calculations, shapes and all the weapons necessary in the classic challenge between brains. Missed target? Unfortunately, it must be said immediately, despite all the good will that SEGA has put into the development of Mind Quiz, there are many (perhaps too many) indelible stains that weigh on the final judgment. The platform chosen for the development of the game doesn't help particularly: the answers are cumbersome, you almost waste more time checking that the button you are pressing is correct rather than actually thinking about the proposed question, thus inevitably lacking the immediacy that made the fortune of the Nintendo product: in Brain Training, providing the correct answer was within anyone's reach, it was enough to know how to write, here further knowledge of the world of video games is required (and in this specific case that of Sony). Mind Quiz is a half game: too busy emulating much more famous cousins to be able to provide any rewarding gaming experience Missed target? Taking a practical example, some games will force the player to press in sequence (and possibly even quickly, given that the final outcome depends) a series of keys in the manner of a classic quick time event, or a music game, one of the absolutely less immediate things for those approaching the world of video games for the first time. This type of impact, combined with the actual lack of originality, makes Mind Quiz a half-baked game: too busy emulating much more famous cousins to be able to provide any rewarding gaming experience. If Mind Quiz had focused on precise gameplay elements, forgetting about Brain Training and its heavy legacy, it probably could have turned out to be a fun and engaging game, apart from some decidedly well thought-out mini-games suitable for the PSP format, what remains is very little. and having your starting point from the ~non-game~ category certainly doesn't help. Having your starting point from the ~non-game~ category certainly doesn't help.It is not easy to judge a product like Mind Quiz, because from a certain point of view there is the feeling that Brain Training has completely filled the demand for this type of product, and from the other it is undeniable the fact that Mind Quiz is a dull imitation of Nintendo's product: boring in the long run, not very innovative and above all decidedly not immediate. The goal has been partially achieved: now PSP also has a game for those who want to improve, doubts remain about the actual quality of such an operation. SEGA could have had the opportunity to offer something absolutely innovative in the non-game genre and instead preferred to ~align~ with other productions. Pros: Some games are definitely suited to the PSP The ~network~ mode provides a different and original point of view of the game Cons: Very little immediate Frustrating and boring in the long run Calculation of brain age sometimes seems absolutely wrong If there is one thing that history teaches without leaving any doubts about it, it is that mass phenomena will always be copied and imitated. The world of video games makes no difference and if 2006 can undoubtedly be considered as the advent of intelligent games (?), 2007 seems to want to present itself as the one of more or less successful clones. Brain Training, it is useless to deny it, has been able to bring thousands of people closer to the world of video games and more precisely to the Nintendo DS thanks to a collection of simple, direct tests and mini-games which above all had the precise task of making them smarter or more simply putting rusty memories in motion. And for a Brain Training that looks pleased at its successor (Brain Training 2, arriving in Europe in the coming months), here comes SEGA's answer to the cerebral phenomenon of Nintendo and the bespectacled Kawashima: Mind Quiz, the perfect compendium of games of intelligence for all PSP owners. Will SEGA have succeeded in discovering Nintendo's secret recipe? The answer just below.", "date": "2007-04-02", "grade": null}
