{"name": "Pokemon Dash", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-dash.html", "text": "Gotta catch 'em all? The answer this time is no, no pokemon to look for, no trainers to challenge, the music changes and the variant of writing in the score leads to the cue. It is not the first time that the infinite saga of pokemon as soon as it moves from known tracks misses the target (just to mention two recent episodes: Pokemon Colosseum and Pokemon Pinball), the spin-offs prove once again not to withstand the blow of -million seller- versions in rpg style. The only and absolute protagonist of this game is Pikachu, the electric mouse will be the only pokemon that you will have the possibility to accompany in the competitions. The game mechanics are quite simple, there are three difficulty classes (chicks, experts and champions) each divided into five cups of five races, by winning the cups the next ones are unlocked and by completing the difficulty level you can move on to the next level. Before starting to play, you are introduced to the art of piloting pokemon through a handy tutorial that in five (seems to be the recurring number of the game) lessons explains commands, settings, use of bonuses and game modes. Before anything else it must be said that it is not possible to use the analog commands in any way, Pikachu will be moved by the continuous scrolling of the stylus on the touch screen in the desired direction, which in addition to being tiring can also become frustrating in the long run especially when the checkpoints of the slopes increase. It is precisely the checkpoints that mark the pace of the race, as it will be necessary to pass them in a certain order suggested by a direction arrow. The tracks are presented as complex environments in terms of design and very sparse in terms of graphic design with areas that are lost in pixels that are all too visible in a recurring 16-bit deja-vu. The design system of the track is grafted as a set of green, wooded, desert, lava and maritime areas, for each environmental area you will have the possibility to find a certain bonus that will allow Pikachu to get a boost so as not to slow down in dedicated area. One of the key points of the game is represented by the possibility of being in front of an impassable point in the search for the next checkpoint, thus the use of balloons enters the scene which transform the electric mouse into a flying electric mouse which, flying over the playing area, can land exactly where you want it. Unfortunately, from theory to practice the result is different, if while the game takes place on the ground level, in addition to the directional arrow, you are helped by a radar positioned on the upper screen, when you take off to sail between continents, the radar disappears completely leaving the player stunned in search of the right direction (more than once you will land at the wrong checkpoint, only to find yourself in a crisis with the exhausting search for another balloon-area where you can take off again and restart the new search at the dark). Graphically, the game does not stand out for its particular qualities, the graphics engine seems to have come straight from the glorious era of super nintendo and the interactive Pikachu-3D at the end of the championship is not enough to raise the tone of a clumsy graphic choice. Also from the sound point of view, nothing to report apart from the exhausting ~pika-pika~ which is repeated at an all too fast pace during the competition and selection menu. The dialogue cartridges Despite everything pokemon dash also marks an important novelty, in fact by inserting one of the games for gba Pokemon Fire Red, Leaf Green, Ruby or Sapphire into the lower cartridge compartment, you will have the possibility to open a new option that will allow the player to create new cups whose tracks will have the shape of the pokemon contained in the inserted cartridge. More than adding much to the value of the game, this type of connectivity between games also bodes well for the near future of the Nintendo DS. It must be said that despite everything Pokemon Dash fails to earn a place in the worst video game category but fits into that limbo of insipid games, good for those who have a deep love for the series and mediocre for those who want to spend a couple of hours hands an original racing game. Pokemon Dash could (and should) have been better under an infinite series of details and game modes, this was not the case, this suggests that Nintendo still wanted to exploit the strong pokemon brand at the launch of its console hoping for a favorable towing of sales. However, particular applause goes to the fact of having wanted to develop the game entirely around the use of the stylus ... given some games coming out on the DS, this unfortunately does not seem to be a rethroat. No usable character other than just Pikachu, game action confused and all too repetitive in the scheme of cups and difficulty levels (definitely badly calibrated), tiring control method and unsuitable for long game sessions. These are just some defects of this pokemon dash, the macroscopic ones, thinking of this as a Nintendo DS launch title, one can only turn up one's nose. Gameplay, graphics and sound stand at rather disappointing levels for what could have been a title with a strong appeal but finally turns out to be a half-disappointment, perhaps the big flaw of Pokemon Dash is not knowing how to exploit the innovative potential offered by the new Nintendo laptop . Pros: 360 use of the stylus It's Pokemon Cons: Severely limited in every game mode Only Pikachu can be used Frustrating in the long run Often you don't understand what to do or where to go Imagine a Pokemon game, more than three hundred critters usable in a series of races to the last breath where what counts in addition to the gamer's manual skill is an excellent pre-tactic based on the study of the peculiarities of the track and on the intrinsic characteristics of each pokemon, natural elements, adaptability to the environment, resistance. Now imagine that this game is well established on a solid graphics engine assisted by a graphical interface as simple as perfect as only Nintendo knows. Are you there? Well, you should at least have in mind everything that this Pokemon Dash is not. I'll explain...", "date": "2005-03-25", "grade": null}
