{"name": "Disgaea: Hour of Darkness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disgaea-hour-of-darkness.html", "text": "The darkest hour In Disgaea the screenwriters Atlus seem to want to concentrate all those absurd ideas which, for one movement or another, did not take their place in the already rich panoramas of antics of Thousand Arms and Rhapsody. But let's go in order. The protagonist of Disgaea is called Laharl, a young and demonic prince of the infernal realm of the Netherworld. Awakening after a nap, Laharl discovers that he had slept for two years, during which his father, King Kriechevskoy, was murdered, and a fierce struggle for the throne developed. Awakened in an unconventional way by the little devil Etna, Laharl decides to step forward for the throne that rightfully belongs to him... Here, the plot of Disgaea may appear, from this concise narration of the first ten minutes of the game, rather trivial or in any case devoid of depth, but in reality there are not a few twists and characters who will help to deepen it and transform it into an explosive cocktail of unprecedented narrative devices. Disgaea offers the player a series of unexpected events that all revolve around the oldest narrative dilemma: is there some light in the darkness? That's exactly what Flonne, an angel sent from the kingdom of Celestian, will try to find out, without knowing that her innocent curiosity and her selfless spirit will unleash the most feared of wars. Contrary to how dark it may seem, the plot of Disgaea is characterized by a frenetic and sunny development, sometimes shaded by sadder and more reflective shades. But Disgaea is also the craziest game you could play: the aforementioned main storyline unfolds through fifteen episodes divided into missions, among which you can witness narrative sequences. These cutscenes are characterized by hilarious comedy and fast-paced exchanges; the humor of the gags is dosed, crystalline, direct, not as cryptic as the Japanese one. The cast of characters that enriches the plot of Disgaea can only be defined as absurd, but it is the backbone of an enjoyable and entertaining story, in the true sense of the word, but also captivating and full of surprises, like we have not seen for some time and as if they should see more. Strategy RPGs are going to get... Let's start immediately by saying that unlike many similar games, which are developed through dozens of menus, in Disgaea between one mission and another it is possible to take breaks to be able to check the status of one's units or objects and at the same time explore the (few , actually) rooms of Laharl's castle to talk to its residents and have access to services such as shops for the purchase of various items and equipment or a sort of medical clinic where you need to be treated after each mission, paying for it. Two other features accessible from the castle are also two of the main elements of The Hour of Darkness: we are talking about the Dark Assembly and the Item World. The first is what the name suggests: an assembly of demons, through which to vote on some ~laws~ that will influence the game, such as an increase in enemy power, the possibility of buying new and more powerful objects in shops or to lower their prices and so on. The Dark Assembly is made up of a certain number of senators, who will side for or against you based on some factors, such as your demonic rank or their interest in the proposal itself. Before making a vote, it will therefore be necessary to check the attitudes of the various senators, perhaps trying to correct those against them by giving them some objects of particular interest. Again through the Dark Assembly it is then possible to create a new unit by choosing from the various classes available (Warrior, Thief, Cleric, Magician, etc.) or ~transmigrate~ it. This last possibility is the key to understanding the playful mechanisms of Disgaea. To transmigrate a unit means to kill it and reincarnate it into a new one: this action allows a transaction of statistical bonuses from the deceased unit to the newborn, which will restart its level 1 experience boosted, however, compared to a non-transmigrated level 1 unit. This operation allows, little by little, to give life to increasingly unstoppable characters, and it is not surprising if the maximum experience level that can be reached in Disgaea is even 9999: in this game, literally billions of experience points and the statistics of the various units reach exorbitant figures. The weirdness of Disgaea also extends to the Item World, a mode that allows you to explore the world contained in each weapon, divided into a certain number of stages in which you must, obviouslymind, fight the various opponents or aim directly at the exit: every ten fights the weapon you are exploring gains an additional level of power, becoming stronger and more damaging. Not to mention, then, the presence of the Residents, monsters that once defeated can be virtually moved from one weapon to another by attributing different abilities to them. ... a serious kick in the ass! But we have already talked about fighting without getting into the heart of the matter: how do you fight, therefore, in Disgaea? Basically, Disgaea behaves like any turn-based strategy: at the beginning of each fight, your units are arranged on the map, starting from a point of origin, for a maximum of ten. Therefore, during the player's turn, it is possible to move them within their personal action area, and possibly make them perform actions, which can be the use of an object, the casting of a spell or simply an attack. So far so normal, or so it would seem. In fact, once the action of a unit has been decided, it will not perform it immediately, but will remain in stand-by until the ~Execute~ command is launched from the menu, which will cause the units to execute all the actions decided up to that moment, to then give the player control of the still inactive units. The same thing happens manually ending your turn, but in this case the inactive units will remain inactive, and the ball will pass to the enemy. However, the most interesting and atypical feature of Disgaea is the fact that the movement and action of the various units are independent of each other, in the sense that after having made a move with a unit it will be possible to cancel the action even after another unit has acted on it, almost like putting back time while maintaining the effects of the actions. Confused? Well, you're not entirely wrong, this game system actually escapes all logic, but with a little practice it's impossible not to realize the potential of such a control system, which allows for the renewal and continuous experimentation of different strategies . In addition to the numerous spells and special moves, even the basic attacks of each character are the masters in Disgaea: Atlus has implemented a strange and spectacular combo system that allows you to attack the same enemy with multiple units, despite being only one main to actually perform the action. Speaking of the relationship between the units and their actions in the field, the time has come to talk about the cross and delight of Disgaea, the Geo Panel System: it will sometimes happen to play in environments covered by, precisely, colored panels, and to scrutinize objects with a curious pyramidal shape here and there. These objects, called Geo Symbols, if placed on a panel of the same color activate its additional abilities: this means that if a red panel allows you to inflict 50% more damage as long as you stand on it, this will actually happen when a Red Geo Symbol will be placed on a panel of the same color. Considering the various powers of the Panels inserted by Atlus, the Geo Panel System forces the player to study his moves with the utmost attention, in order to avoid exploiting the Panels for his own purposes and then discovering that the enemy is using them as much and more than us . To avoid this, it is possible to trigger Color Combos: in practice, by destroying a Geo Symbol of one color on a Panel of another color, all the Panels scattered around the stage like the latter will assume the color of the Geo Symbol, inflicting a certain amount of damage to units standing on it. By destroying the various Geo Symbols in the right order and in the same turn, it is possible to trigger deadly combinations, capable of wiping out anything on the Panels. In general, the fights of Disgaea develop in this way, but there are many, many goodies that the Atlus title reserves for the most hardened players and strategists, not least some not particularly pleasant defects, such as a sometimes hallucinating difficulty of the stages or the general chaos that pervades some fights, where the Panel and the enemies seem arranged at random, without criterion, and where the player finds himself implementing cowardly half-bakes (like the dear, old baits), but which in Disgaea sometimes save lives and avoid the neurosis. To Be or Not to Be Technically, Disgaea has its ups and downs. On the one hand, the excellent quality of the animations, the lighting effects (especially as regards explosionscellars and distortions) and the high resolution of the huge sprites leaves no doubts about the 128 bits that move, without any slowdown, all this goodness on the screen (not to mention that already the very first special moves available to the units develop into amazing and spectacular detonations that envelop the entire screen); on the other hand, the scenarios, often sparse and devoid of details, bring to mind the 32-bit era, not to mention that sometimes the settings were more detailed and better done already in Final Fantasy Tactics and Hoshigami. Nonetheless, the general visual quality settles mostly at excellent levels, giving small touches of class, such as the weapons in the hands of the various units, which are not indifferent. A praise goes undoubtedly to the effervescent character design: the protagonists of Disgaea are nothing short of irresistible and captivating in the essentiality that distinguishes them; the cleanliness of the line and the sharpness of the coloring also make the large artworks that appear on the screen during the cutscenes a real pleasure for the eyes. On the musical side, we are faced with a soundtrack that adapts to the liveliness of the entire production, accompanying the player with pleasant and rhythmic tracks, never annoying or inopportune, sometimes entirely sung: this is the case of the fight with Maderas, faced on the notes of the enthralling ~The Invasion from Within~ by Tsunami Bomb, or of the bizarre songs that accompany the passing of the credits. Furthermore, the possibility of selecting Japanese or English audio at one's discretion should certainly be noted. In short, a technically more than good title: it does not enter the Olympus of the best achievements ever, but it defends itself more than well and serves its purposes in an excellent way. Nice work, Atlus. Comment With Disgaea, Atlus demonstrates that it can still come up with innovative ideas for the genre in which it excels. Disgaea is a receptacle of innovations, both from a purely playful and from a narrative point of view. The hilarious, bizarre plot, parody of dozens of games, comics and films, seasoned with a cast of unforgettable characters for their absurdities, accompanies the user to discover a vast, deep, rich in possibilities game system, perhaps undermined by the too much complexity of some ideas and a not always well balanced difficulty. It is fair to say, however, that Disgaea is a title that requires more than ever the always current and sometimes motona practice of level-up but which can still be finished without having to take too much time or without completing the numerous side-quests, which include discovering secret classes, solving extremely difficult but highly profitable extra missions and watching ten different endings. The Item World, in itself, is a continuous incentive for replayability and able to offer an ever new challenge to all those who, after having played Disgaea thoroughly, will hardly be able to break away from it. A must for fans of the genre, definitely worth trying for all those who want to enjoy a challenging and rewarding game with good laughs. Final notes go to the Pal version of the game, equipped with a manual in Italian but with texts and dubbing in the Anglo-Saxon language. Pros Very entertaining plot Vast, deep, innovative game system Extremely long-lived Cons Difficulty not always balanced Poorly cared for polygonal settings The real-time strategy genre has never been very popular on consoles. If anything, turn-based strategic games have always dominated, but only some software houses, as well as a little in all things, are synonymous with quality, so much so that every new game out there is a real party. This is the case with Atlus. When it comes to Atlus, the first name that ideally forms in our little heads is Ogre Battle, in a certain sense the true emblem of this ingenious softco, which has enormously influenced the following productions, starting with that much acclaimed Final Fantasy Tactics which on PSOne represents the paradigm of the genre, the milestone with which all the following titles (and there are many) are confronted. Because it is also true that the glittering Atlus hasn't sparkled so much in recent years: after the discreet Brigandine and The Legend of Kartia (intriguing as they are incomplete) the title that should have brought it back on PSOne, Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth, yes proved to be an unbalanced title in difficulty, at times unplayable. Atlus then proposed two really interesting titles, unfortunately passed on the sly: Thousand Arms and Rhapsody (remember these names, we'll get back to talking about them shortly).
