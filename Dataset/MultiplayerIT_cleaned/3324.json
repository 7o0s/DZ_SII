The reason is simple: since its launch, Jurassic World Evolution has evolved a lot, if you pass the obvious pun. Update after update Frontier has improved the game, reviewing the interface, adding functions and content and making some activities more pleasant to perform, especially those related to maintenance. The management side is always far from perfect and remains superficial, but at least now in sandbox mode (added with one of the updates we were talking about) we realize that it exists. In short, you no longer breathe that air of incompleteness that permeated the first version. New content Having said that we come to Return To Jurassic Park, the DLC that fans have been clamoring for since the launch of Jurassic World Evolution. As the title suggests, it is a package that introduces a new campaign inspired by the 1993 Jurassic Park, that of Steven Spielberg, and the two subsequent films, those that make up the so-called historical trilogy. The first mission, of eight, begins immediately after the events narrated in the first film: we are on Isla Nublar (but in the advanced missions we will move to Isla Sorna, the mysterious Site B) and we have to work hard to rebuild the destroyed park and recapture the runaway dinosaurs. In addition to Dr. Ian Malcolm, already present in the original game, mentoring us will be Dr. Ellie Sattler, Dr. Alan Grant and John Hammond, the historic owner of Jurassic Park, all with their original portraits. If this detail weren't enough to tickle the nostalgics, know that even the dinosaurs have undergone a restyling in line with the original trilogy and in the DLC they have a more retro look than those of the other two campaigns. There are therefore new skins for the velociraptors, for the tyrannosaurs, for the triceratops and for all the other beasts that appeared in the three films. New species have also been introduced: the compsognathus longipes and the pteranodons. The former are small and very light creatures whose fundamental characteristic is that of being very fast and very agile in their movements; the latter are the classic flying reptiles, equipped with wings that can reach a maximum extension of seven metres. In addition to the two dinosaurs, some structures have also been added, all linked to the iconography of the classic trilogy. Obviously, the historic gate of Jurassic Park could not be missing, which nostalgics will want to build immediately, but there is also the visitor center and the immense pteranodon aviary, which alone creates a truly exceptional eye-catcher. Gameplay The game mechanics of Return To Jurassic Park are identical to those of the original title. Frontier has focused more on making content in line with audience expectations than on trying to revolutionize the gameplay of Jurassic World Evolution. After all, why should he do it at this point? In general, the tasks we are called upon to carry out are those already seen in other campaigns and range from repairing structures and fences, to recovering a certain number of fleeing dinosaurs, to protecting park visitors, to discovering samples of new species from produce in the laboratory. The campaign itself is simpler than the previous DLC Claire's Sanctuary, and doesn't offer much of a challenge. To be honest it just seems like an excuse to be able to use the new content extensively (which is not a bad thing in itself). However, the presence of some historical characters, which we have already listed, makes the narrative side particularly interesting. Not that the story told by Return To Jurassic Park is who knows what masterpiece of world literature, but finding certain faces in certain roles has moved something in our dry hearts, motivating us to continue the campaign more than the main story has managed to do. This, if we like, is also one of the main defects of Return To Jurassic Park: if you haven't seen the three original films and you don't care much about the classic skins and a few more buildings to build, you really have no reason to consider it. Another sore point: the extra contents cannot be combined with the original ones in the various modes, but always replace them. For example in the Sandbox mode you have to choose which style of buildings to adopt for the park, without being able to select both at the same time. The substance is that we are faced with the classic fan pack, indispensable for storici of the series, but useless for all the others, new campaign aside.", "date": "2019-12-11", "grade": "7.5"}
