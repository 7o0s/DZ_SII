{"name": "Botanicula", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102082-botanicula-vita-maestro.html", "text": "Drunk with the success of Machinarium, Amanita Design must have gotten lost in the woods. Or maybe they live in a forest and have pointy ears. Or they make risotto with the amanitas and instead of poisoning themselves, they experience portentous visions. Otherwise, the birth of Botanicula could not be explained, an adventure teeming with life set in a fantastic microcosm that breathes to the rhythm of music. Animations and drawings were made by Jaromr Plach, who for Machinarium created only the animated scenes inside the balloons, while here he gave free rein to all his overexcited imagination. Congratulations to Plach then, but above all to DVA, who with their musical compositions and hilarious sound effects earned Botanicula an Excellence in Audio Award at the last Independent Game Festival. If the words were known we would play a melody to make you understand what we are talking about. Fortunately, on this page you will find a video that will delight your ears for a few minutes. The work tells of five little friends who all run together next to each other and who in the game move as if they were a single life form. More closely knit than a synchronized swim team, this group has one crucial goal: to save the last seed of the tree they live on, which is being targeted by vicious black spider-like parasites - actually balls with twine instead of legs. . If our friends fail, all the incredible life forms that populate the wonderful world of Botanicula will also perish. And we cannot allow this. Therefore. Let the adventure begin! Microscopic trouble We launch Botanicula and our mouth takes the shape of an O. Again with this amazed expression we discover the rudiments of the game, which bans dialogues and writings. Everyone speaks an incomprehensible language, so stylized gestures, sounds and symbols guide us. In the latter areas of the game we will have to get into the mindset of the developers a bit to solve the puzzles, but by then the difficulty curve should have gently trained us to think in the right way. Our task is to help the quintet of heroes overcome the obstacles that prevent them from continuing. To do this, you need to hover the mouse pointer over the game screens and click sensitive points to solve a puzzle or win a mini-game. That's all: mouse and left button. Sometimes you pick up an item in one screen and use it in another, but we've never had more than three items in our inventory. Despite this underlying simplicity, Botanicula is full of intriguing puzzles, which above all require imagination. The game is divided into five major moments that mark the stages of the adventure, each with a goal to achieve that always involves collecting objects: five feathers, fourteen little creatures, four artifacts and so on. The puzzles scattered here and there are precisely the challenges to be overcome in order to obtain these indispensable objects to continue. In some particular situations it happens that we have to choose which of our five heroes to do the action. In these cases only one of them is able to complete the task, while the other four fail in a hilarious way. The variety of comical and surprising situations they manage to get themselves into with their goofy skills is just a dewdrop in the sea of dazzling extravaganzas that Amanita Designs have woven over this simple structure. And guess what, they're the ones we're talking about in the next paragraph. We ran a lot and had a blast Botanicula, even more than Machinarium or Samorost, has an essential game structure on which it stages surprising shows. Each screen is a small universe with its colors, its secrets, and a unique life form. We are the conductors of this throbbing orchestra, because not all sensitive points are linked to the solution of an enigma. Many are there waiting for our command to activate and start a buzz, an animation, or a change in the atmosphere. At our command, flying light bulbs fill a room, night gives way to day and a party lights up, or penguins emerge from an igloo like rabbits from a magician's top hat. Sometimes it happens that after a first jolt the environment returns to its initial state; try to visit the same screen later and you might discover a previously hidden evolution or puzzle key. The constant ability to amaze us with games, skits, brilliant sound effects or a new perspective of colors and volumes is the stylistic hallmark of Amanita Design and the great value of Botanicula. Our five heroes run like mad and are the first to cheer for success or run away scared. Their genuine openness to the new is the same as that of the player, who smiles and remains enchanted staring at the small miracles of an imaginary creation. Small secrets are hidden among the screens of this whirlwind of inventions for the most curious and stubborn players. Furthermore, all the living species that we manage to study end up in a screen that resembles a fairytale bestiary, where animated cards portray the beings we have encountered or the special objects collected. To acquire a new species it is not enough to see it, often it is necessary to interact in the right way, sometimes activating a small event. Details designed for the most attentive, who at the end of the game will then get gifts based on the results achieved. We have discovered one hundred and three species out of just over one hundred and twenty, almost all of them, and we have enjoyed two bonus animations. We hope that your rewards are richer, even if the satisfaction of the trip counts more than the awards. Two notes out of time Botanicula is a splendid exploration adventure, which could have been even more exciting if the drive with which it begins had been maintained for longer. Unfortunately from the middle of the game onwards the pace slows down almost to a standstill and all the precipitous cheerfulness of the quintet gives way to more sad phases. The world is still a treasure trove of wonders but exploration expands and even the exuberant music that won us over right away fades away. As in a funnel, the fizz narrows down to the last part of the game, which is so reminiscent of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet that it seems like a tribute to the sprawling shooter by Michel Gagn and Joe Olson. Then it all ends with an anticlimax far from the initial outbursts. Don't get it wrong: everything is always very well cared for and probably designed to vary the progress of the exploration, which very wisely does not last more than five or six hours at the most. Perhaps Botanicula's greatest limitation is that it is simply a concentrated emotion with no fixed points. That is, devoid of memorable moments to recall. A carousel with now dark and now bright colors on which to take an exciting ride at different speeds and then get off the ground and leave it behind.", "date": "2012-04-19", "grade": "8.5"}
