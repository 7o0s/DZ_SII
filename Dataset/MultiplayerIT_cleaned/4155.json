{"name": "Sonic Mania Plus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-mania-plus-recensione-202278.html", "text": "Last year Sonic The Hedgehog blew out its first twenty-five candles, but the fans took home the birthday present: for the occasion, SEGA has churned out two titles dedicated to the fastest blue hedgehog in the world, Sonic Forces and Sonic Mania. The latter was greeted with blasts of trumpets and rolls of drums, proving to be one of the best 2D chapters of the entire series: solid, deep, with an exquisitely retro flavor, but at the same time also capable of looking to the future and coming to terms with the needs of modern day gameplay. Exactly one year later, Sonic Mania Plus tries to draw the spotlight on himself: he is back with a substantial dose of news, and is ready to debut once again on all consoles. Is it worth returning to Sonic's company? It's a rhetorical question. Even more varied gameplay: Mighty and Ray arrive Sonic Mania Plus is not simply the updated, revised and corrected version of last year's title: it includes all the patches and corrective updates made by the developers in the last eleven months, but above all contents that make it a full-fledged version 2.0. Let's start with a detail that will surely delight collectors and lovers of the retail versions: Sonic Mania Plus will be available in stores in physical format, with a beautiful special edition that will include a 32-page artbook, a holographic cover, and also a alternative that reimagines the title as if it were released on the SEGA Mega Drive; all at a price that seems honest to us, around 30 Euros. And all those who already bought Sonic Mania last year, how will they happen to the bonus content of the new edition? By purchasing a special DLC Plus separately and at a reduced price, available on launch day on all major platforms. Anyone who didn't have the pleasure of completing Sonic Mania last year will find themselves in a perfect situation: by purchasing Sonic Mania Plus they will have everything they could want with a Sonic 2D theme, without having to think too much about base packs, expansions and possible repurchases of a physical version after already getting my hands on the digital one last summer. If anything, the problem arises for those who Sonic Mania has already duly completed and gutted it: is it worth going back to it after about eleven months, in the face of the new introductions? The answer is yes, because here we are not dealing with a couple of additional levels, but with an alternative review operation that invests all the game modes, also adding new ones. For starters, in addition to Sonic, Knuckles and Tales, Sonic Mania Plus also introduces two other new characters that have not been seen for a while: Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel, directly from Sonic the Hedgehog even before Sonic Generations. Don't even think about calling them simple Knuckles and Tales reskins, because their abilities are completely different and allow you to experience the main adventure in a completely new way: Mighty is a super-armored armadillo, with his special ability Hammer Drop he can destroy some elements in the levels (you will recognize them by their different color) and resist a blow from the sharp spikes without losing the rings, it is sufficient to take a good jump and then execute the jump command again to crash to the ground; even more technical is Ray's ability, which allows him to glide up or down for a certain distance, reaching some positions otherwise out of reach for the other characters, or even brake at the right time to avoid crashing against dangerous obstacles. In the company of Mighty and Ray, the Sonic Mania Plus adventure takes on a completely new face, especially thanks to the Encore Mode. Playstation 4 trophies Sonic Mania Plus seems to share the exact same Trophies list as its predecessor - a real shame, considering that usually the full-bodied updates of PS4 games have a list with new unlockable achievements aside, able to enhance the new additions. A wasted opportunity also to add the Platinum Trophy, a great absence for an important Sonic game: the other trophies present will still require a certain amount of skill and patience. Completing the Story Mode will be the first step, then you will have to dedicate yourself to finding some hidden places in the various levels, conquering all the Chaos Emeralds and obtaining the Gold and Silver medals of the bonus modes. Let's do an encore: storyline and game modes Two new characters and a physical edition are very welcome additions, but for a plus version of Sonic Mania you need more. SEGA has thought of this well, and here is the Encore Modeallows us to relive the story of Sonic Mania in a completely new perspective, starting where it all began: just under the heading dedicated to the main Story Mode, the Encore Mode now appears, where we do not immediately experience the events related to Green Hill Zone and to Doctor Eggman's new plan, but we end up catapulted by the power of the Chaos Emeralds directly to Angels Island Zone. Do you remember this level? It already appeared in Sonic The Hedgehog 3, but like all the others present in Sonic Mania Plus it has been visibly revised, updated and enhanced, both in the artistic style and in terms of fluidity, exactly like all the other levels of the title, able at the same time to delight those who grew up with the first chapters of the series, but also admirers of retro games partially contaminated by modern times. In Angels Island Zone Sonic discovers that Mighty and Ray have been taken prisoner, frees them, and from there the whole main story mode starts again, but modified in some level design details, which honor the new abilities of the protagonists: we can in fact bring with us two characters at a time, and exploit the full potential of the armadillo and the flying squirrel. If we have Mighty with us, for example, once we return to the Green Hill Zone we will notice not only changes in the time of day, but also in the new presence of small alternative paths and destructible elements with his Hammer Drop. In short: an encore of the story mode, an encore of playable characters, an encore of boss fights, and we must at least mention the new Competitive Mode, which allows four players to challenge each other simultaneously within certain levels: the goal is to reach the finish line as soon as possible, but also accumulate more points than the other participants: an additional boost to the possibilities and longevity of Sonic Mania Plus", "date": "2018-07-11", "grade": "8.5"}
