{"name": "Midnight Billiard 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-billiard-2.html", "text": "If on consoles and PCs the various ~niche~ sports simulations (bowling, billiards, darts, etc.) have never been able to carve out a large slice of the public, on mobile the situation is very different: for a whole series of reasons , primarily of a practical nature, this kind of product also lends itself perfectly to quick and impromptu use; therefore it represents a perfect pastime during long waits or when we want to entertain ourselves briefly, carefree and without obligation. Specifically, Gameloft's Midnight series can count on the best possible approach to these sports: an arcade setting, very simple and immediate but which does not disdain a certain thickness, combined with a structure that is always rich in substance. From the start screen you can start a quick game, challenge a friend on the same mobile or start the career mode. The latter represents the fulcrum of the game, as usual: after selecting one of the three characters initially available, we will embark on a long series of challenges by moving to various areas, each time confronting an opponent with different characteristics and abilities. Winning a game does not only translate into progress towards the next stage, but also into a gain in terms of money, which varies according to our performance and our initial ~bet~. We will then be able to spend the money in the shop, buying accessories and anything else to improve our power values, precision, and so on. We will also have the opportunity to take lessons from a virtual master, who will show us a series of spectacular and effective maneuvers to score precious points. The control system sees us control the trajectory of the shot via the joystick, with a key for quick ball changes. We will be able to carry out normal or special shots, or with a lot of jump, where necessary. In any case, a graphic indicator will show us the first part of the trajectory that the ball will travel and any rebound. The exchange of blows with the opponent is fast and exciting, moreover you can decide to skip the maneuver of the other player to make the action even faster. The behavior of the balls is plausible and realistic, with good physics management, and we are faced with anomalous reactions. The technical realization is excellent, from all points of view. Even the sound sector is able to have its say, with a series of simple but effective sampled effects, while the graphics show off excellent characters (the result of digitized photos, as often happens) and some scenarios rich in colors and details . The pool table is essential but well made, the movement of the balls is fluid and convincing. As far as the controls are concerned, the power of the shot is determined using the usual indicator (which must be blocked at the right moment), and the rotation of the club to vary the trajectory is quite precise. The only note concerns the uploads, much longer than the average. PRO Rich in thickness Technically excellent Basic but effective sound AGAINST Uploads too long Only one weight mode Maybe a little easy", "date": "2008-07-31", "grade": "S.V."}
