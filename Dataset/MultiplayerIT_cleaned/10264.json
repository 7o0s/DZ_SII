{"name": "Piccola sorpresa volante", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73509-altitude-piccola-sorpresa-volante.html", "text": "The developers of Altitude, the debuting Nimbly Games, have done the simplest that could be put on the plate to package a (fairly) successful indie product: on the one hand the small size of the team led to the gameplay of a shoot'em up - a generational constant from Geometry Wars onwards - on the other they bet everything on a multiplayer strongly based on the growth of one's profile, similar to the formula which brought Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to the pinnacle of first-person shooters. The derivative premises obviously could not be enough and fortunately the execution was no less: the Indie Game of the Month is a small pearl that many should absolutely not let slip away. Airplanes Altitude offers battles for up to 24 players in two-dimensional arenas putting users in command of small, funny cartoon-looking airplanes but equipped with two weapons each and intent on facing each other in games ranging from the classic deathmatch, team or otherwise, up to objective modes that involve destroying the enemy base or carrying a ball inside the opponent's goal - ok, Altitude's kick. If the novelty does not lie in the premises, the first element in favor comes from the simple yet satisfying control system that deputies the use of armaments and power-ups obtainable on the battlefield with three buttons, moves the control of the vehicle and the accelerator: seven buttons in all without the use of the mouse are in this case sufficient to perform highly complex manoeuvres, bringing the vehicle to a standstill and attracted by gravity on the ground but for a few moments capable of rotating on itself and aiming with great precision, or by accelerating to maximum to sneak inside some narrower passages, perhaps by exploiting the weapons that some aircraft can mount in the rear part of the cockpit. In short, a few minutes to get carried away, many hours to be able to perform all the possible evolutions, perhaps training with the nice tutorial, capable of teaching the basics, leaving you free to decide the difficulty and the map, or in Skirmish mode against the bots that boast a decent artificial intelligence. The game can be purchased through the most popular digital delivery systems, Steam and Direct2Drive in the first place, at a price of less than 10 euros. For those interested, a demo is also available, available through the official website. Aerial warfare What has been described makes Altitude a decidedly fun, balanced and replayable game. What is still missing to describe is the level system which, by rewarding each kill, assist or reaching a certain number of seconds without being shot down, assigns a certain number of experience points which translate into new planes - five in total, from one small hunt for an alien vehicle, passing through bombers and the like - and a series of skills that can be assigned at will, as if they were the perks already seen in Call of Duty. Each plane has three slots, one of which determines the type of fire available and the other two the passive skills related to the aircraft's resistance and maneuverability. There are not thousands of possible combinations and the challenges designed to reward those capable of obtaining particular results with extra experience do not represent the meta-challenge offered by other products, however they always manage to give something new to try without creating imbalances in the field. where battles are always decided by the skill of the players and not by their equipment. Altitude is therefore a little jewel that entertains and offers hours of entertainment on any type of machine and on any operating system: Windows, Linux and Mac OSX are fully supported. Praise your praises, however, it is not possible not to highlight the shortcomings that do not affect the good that has been done but rather tend to further sectoralise the product. Technically we are at the lowest levels, both for the style and coloring of airplanes and environments, cute but without charisma, and for the technical realization of the same, which does not guarantee an appearance comparable to that of other similar productions. Added to this is the price, of around 9 euros at the time of publication: not an astronomical figure in itself, of course, but perhaps a little too much compared to the limited scope of this successful debut, which given its particularity should actually entice you to get try from all possible buyers. Details that do not affect the final result, however, also thanks to many small additions such as the map editor and bots.", "date": "2010-01-07", "grade": "8.0"}
