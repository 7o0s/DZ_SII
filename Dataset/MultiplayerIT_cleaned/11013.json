{"name": "Bully: Scholarship Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bully-scholarship-edition-recensione_a.html", "text": "Scale change Bully takes up the graphics engine and mechanics of GTA San Andreas (yes, you read that right) to offer a generally less dispersive and more concentrated gaming experience, while trying to keep its Sand Box soul. In Bully the player is called to impersonate the fifteen-year-old James Hopkins, a young boy with a difficult childhood, an unknown father (someone claims, however, that he looks a lot like the protagonist of Manhunt), a cheerful mother and an easy punch. After being rejected, expelled and kicked out of the vast majority of schools in the state, James is packed up and sent to Bullworth Academy, a sort of school penitentiary for minors where teaching goes hand in hand with repression and abuses of the body lecturer, headed by the obnoxious principal Crabblesnitch. In short, in a nutshell, the description that any 14-year-old would make of their school, obviously changing the names. The primary purpose of the game, to acclimatise in the school and, along the unraveling of a plot divided into several chapters, extricate ourselves and get by in a sort of Dante's circle infested with suburban bullies, bullying classmates and violent teachers until we become masters of the institute and enjoy the holidays you deserve. All told through the eyes of Rockstar who, with his usual verve, manages to represent a deliberately stereotyped and caricatured game world capable of making fun of both clichs and the gamer himself. In a sort of denunciation work which, if read with a minimum of critical sense, absolutely does not want to instigate violence but rather to make people think and take themselves less seriously. To act as a retaliation a plot which, although seasoned with pungent dialogues and situations bordering on the surreal, appeared to us sluggish and predictable. Fortunately, this defect does not weigh excessively in the calculation of game economies. Everyone to class! Under the banner of the likelihood of the game world, the Rockstar Vancouver programmers took advantage of the relatively small scale of the reproduced world to dedicate themselves to characterization and diversification of the elements represented. The school, for example, is populated by numerous Non-Playing Characters belonging to different ~factions~ of the game (the nerds, the jocks, the rough and so on), depending on our reputation towards each group we will be able to appreciate behaviors more or less friendly. Likewise, most of the pupils (and the inhabitants of the town) have their own unique personality that differentiates them in terms of activities, animations and approach to the player. The same missions in which we will have to participate in order to advance along the course of the plot manage to be appreciated for their variety and inventiveness. During Halloween night, for example, one can delight in pranking one's classmates, rather than dedicating oneself to the joke of the century by giving teachers a particularly lucky gift. Compared to a normal GTA, Bully also differs in the presence of mini-games, puzzles and playful activities which, although they can sometimes be too simple and simplified - almost like a party game - manage to further break the rhythm of normal games. ordinary virtual bullying missions. These sections have been introduced in the form of normal school lessons which we will be obliged to attend during the morning and afternoon of our virtual days (and be careful not to be late!). In this context, you will be called upon to navigate between lessons such as music, art, grammar, mechanics, biology in a succession of mini-games that go from rhythm games to some real revivals of video games from the 80s and 90s. Between tradition and innovation Playing Bully, forget shootings and dangerous chases through the streets of downtown. Although the language used still remains quite pushed and for someone maybe vulgar, at least in this case your parents will be happy to know that you won't have to become experts in heavy weapons or invest anyone. At most, you will make extensive use of the noble art and, in case you don't want to get your knuckles dirty with the blood of others, you will have the opportunity to use stinky vials, marbles, slingshots, potato shooters or other makeshift weapons built with the most unthinkable objects. On the locomotion front, you won't be able to steal the principal's car but you will be given the opportunity to zip around the corridors on a skateboard, rather than your flaming BMX. In case you suffer from the call of the engines, you can still go to the nearby amusement park (a real playful gem, a sand box in the sand box) andd sign up for karting races. The control system, at least using a joypad, is effective and precise while not totally losing the woodiness of the movements which, despite itself, has become a hallmark of Rockstar productions. Despite some aesthetic improvements, technically Bully heavily denounces its age, as well as its derivation from an engine designed to run better on PlayStation 2. The game menu itself and the configuration possibilities appeared to us poor and limited if compared to the standards today. Moreover, while playing with a respectable system, from time to time we have had the opportunity to witness sporadic and annoying slowdowns that are unjustifiable. On the audio front, the excellent dubbing (in English) of the characters on the screen stands out, especially during the cutscenes. Sound effects and, above all, soundtrack (repetitive and uninspired) however, are decidedly in the background. Comment Beyond the criticisms and controversies that accompanied the release of Canis Canem Edit, Bully is a title that deserves to be played for the freshness of the gameplay and for the double interpretation with which the missions and their context can be tackled . More than once we wondered why Rockstar didn't take more cues from the dynamics of Bully during the development of the next (on PC) GTA IV. There is no lack of defects, such as a technical realization just above the sufficiency and the lack of a soundtrack worthy of the name but, if you manage to get caught up in the meticulous reproduction of the game world, you will easily be able to turn a blind eye and get carried away by a gaming experience as personal as it is long-lasting.
