For those who just tuned in now, it's no joke. It is precisely the 80s anime, that Voltron fusion of the two Japanese series Golion and Dairugger XV, by World Events Production for the western market. THQ has entrusted the work to Behavior Interactive, the software house responsible for controversial products such as Naughty Bear, let's see how they fared for this curious license. It transforms into a missile rocket Voltron faithfully follows the story told in the first season (that of Golion), five young terrestrial pilots fight the ruthless Drule alien race, led by the wicked King Zarkon and Prince Lotor, using five mechanical lions able to unite to create a very powerful fighting robots. Each level is punctuated by videos taken directly from the cartoon, including the initial theme song, with audio in English and subtitles in Italian, an idea that greatly increases the involvement. The setting of the game is that of an action twin-stick shooter child of the trends of the moment, but with some unexpected twists. Each of the three worlds available is made up of several sections: the main one sees us engaged with our trusty lions through a multi-scrolling scenario and dynamic visuals, very similar to what has recently been seen in titles such as Gatling Gears. There is also a vertical scrolling part set in space, an evident homage to old school shoot'em ups, while a completely different approach has been used for the clashes against the Robobeasts. Those who know the cartoon of origin will have no trouble recognizing these bizarre and gigantic enemies, they are the most dangerous weapons launched by Zarkon against the earth, typical of the Japanese robotic series. The first to appear on stage is unforgettable, a space coffin from which a terrible mechanical anthropomorphic vampire emerges! The fights are managed with a series of turn-based quick time events, where a certain quickness of reflexes is required in choosing the shots and pressing the keys indicated on the screen to execute them. This not before the transformation into Voltron, where we finally see the five lions unite through an interactive movie where the player can increase his score. This choice is aimed at maximizing the spectacularity of the clashes, displayed with the hyperbolic rhythm typical of the Japanese series, including the inevitable final blow. With circuits of a thousand valves Of the various parts of the game proposed, the main one is undoubtedly the most in-depth and interesting. The five lions are quite different from each other, thanks to the cannons mounted on their backs. Each has customized attacks, but all retain in common a special charge capable not only of evading enemy projectiles, but of hooking onto the numerous flying ships on the fly, a decidedly useful move that also applies to a specific target. Before reaching the end of the level, where a large-scale battle awaits us, we are asked to perform the most diverse tasks, such as escorting allied troops, destroying certain generators or rescuing imprisoned civilians. On the field we can also find fragments of a star which, once completed, allows us to earn an extra life and new blows to inflict on enemies. Another curious feature is the destruction of our lion, which freezes when entering self-repair mode, during which our pilot is forced to get off the vehicle exposing himself to enemy blows. The aim is to survive certain seconds necessary for recovery, after which we find ourselves essentially pardoned with a slight recovery of energy. As a first impact, the action is excessively chaotic, due to the suffocating amount of bullets and enemies on the screen, at least until the offensive mechanisms of the five lions are understood. Xbox 360 goals 200 player points await you divided by 12 goals, i.e. the Live Arcade standard. Concluding the adventure, a task that will not take you more than two hours, leads to the achievement of half the points. The others require special conditions, such as completing the game in multiplayer or rescuing a considerable amount of survivors. Come on lions! Sentinel he makes us Technically Voltron: Defender of the Universe is a work in line with the Live Arcade productions, with a discrete polygonal engine in cel shading that faithfully follows the atmospheres of the cartoon. Finally, appreciable stylistic similarities can be seen in a licensed titlethere, such as Zarkon's tanks, demonic logos and spaceships. Even the music is the same used in the anime, including the voice of Peter Cullen. It is therefore evident how the programmers have made a certain effort to satisfy the enthusiasts to whom this product is aimed. Space-set internships are enjoyable but extremely small in quantity, too short and unable to be regarded as more than mere filler. The interactive sequences are fun, but boring in the long run in their repetitiveness, and are excessively easy. The biggest problem is represented by longevity: it won't take more than two hours to complete the game, a really too short duration, even if predictable in relation to the purchase price (about 10 Euros). It is difficult to find a concrete challenge once the game mechanics have been absorbed: the lions are far too strong and the recovery condition considerably facilitates the player, as well as the generosity of available lives and the possibility of continuing from any level. However, it must be admitted that the title manages to entertain, especially by playing five at the same time through Xbox Live (local play is also supported). In this case all participants share the same number of lives, necessitating a more strategic approach. Voltron: Defender of the Universe is available on Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points, or Sony PSN for 9.99. Live Marketplace purchase link.", "date": "2011-12-03", "grade": "6.5"}
