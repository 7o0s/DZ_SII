{"name": "Recensione di Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-di-medal-of-honor-pacific-assault.html", "text": "Points of view If with MOHAA we lived the Second World War through the eyes of an Allied soldier who had to fight against the Nazi war machine, this time we will observe - we will live - the events from the point of view of an American soldier stationed in the Pacific Ocean, fighting on the Japanese front. In the end we know that the winners write history and how could it not be the same for the story told by a video game? Thus the player returns to wear the uniform of the US army to fight against the hateful enemy of the Allies, but on the opposite side of the world. This time the events will begin with the prodotorio assault on the Pearl Harbor base and will immediately take a cinematic turn, in an escalation of events that will take the player up to the final assault on the Tarawa atoll against the Japanese empire. Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault (henceforth, MOHPA) begins by immediately dragging the player into the heart of the action, which will only serve as a prologue to the actual game, which will be experienced as a long flashback. From the very first bars of the tutorial we will get to know our teammates, each characterized in a different but very precise way: as per the script, we will find a skilled leader, a braggart but decisive and charismatic, we will find a courageous doctor, a deadly sniper and so on . After training the protagonist will be transferred to what he believed to be a quiet little corner in the middle of the ocean... needless to say, he will find himself in the midst of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor! A matter of honour If the characteristic that mainly distinguishes the Medal of Honor series is the spectacular action, what is offered to us in this sequel takes the step even further in this direction, proposing situations worthy of a Hollywood film script. The attack on Pearl Harbor is something extraordinary for the eyes, ears and imagination. In a few seconds we see a serene slice of paradise transformed into an infernal scenario, where among the flames of the fires, the bullets of the Japanese, the cries of the wounded asking for help, everything will appear to us simultaneously unreal and dramatically true. This time, the player is offered more possibilities, in addition to fighting, and in fact in the opening bars he will be called above all to help the wounded, repair faults and break down doors. Only further on, finally, will it be possible to participate in the counterattack to repel the attackers, an operation that will provide the culmination of the spectacularity of this initial phase. On board a warship, we will be able to put ourselves in command of a quadruple cannon and shoot down the cursed Zeros that infest the sky of a beautiful tropical sunset. ... we find ourselves in the presence of an adrenaline concentrate of Medal of Honor! A matter of honour The settings are beautiful and very rich in detail: the rooms full of smoke and flames bursting everywhere, the wounded to be recovered and brought to safety, the screams, the other soldiers busy keeping the increasingly critical situation at bay, the sky inflamed by the sunset light, while the Japanese planes intertwine and explode under our blows... we are faced with something that fills us with wonder and quickly makes us forget that we are in front of a monitor screen. In short, we are in the presence of an adrenaline concentrate of Medal of Honor! But I don't want to reveal too much, because I've already said enough. All this makes us forget the usual disquisitions on scripted sequences, freedom of action, AI and the graphics engine, all this puts us in the midst of an incredibly cinematic experience, where the role of actor and protagonist is entrusted only and solely to the player. [C] Squadmates take cover during a nighttime raid on an enemy village Ciccio, I'm about to slip you a confetti of sympathy between the uniform and the helmet! From here you can dominate the whole square, to the great joy of the Japanese who fall like leaves [/C] So is this game a masterpiece? After the first part, the game settles on more traditional canons, in which the player will be engaged in fighting against Japanese opponents in fast and close skirmishes. The support of the team is felt and the presence of the doctor will be the thing the player will resort to most often. It is very realistic that medicinal stocks are limited and every time we use them, the doctor will inform us of how many are still available. Our companions will be immediately recognizable by an icon placed above the head, which has nothing realistic but at least avoids confusionin the most agitated clashes and, perhaps, in the dark. Naturally, weapons can also be picked up on the ground, just as it is possible to use fixed positions and some vehicles, giving a few more degrees of freedom to otherwise too repetitive clashes. The AI of the enemies does not make you cry out for a miracle because, if in conventional situations they can give us a hard time, when the variables take on values that are out of parameter, here comes the flaws. At the top of a tower, for example, in the middle of an enemy village, you can snipe the waves of attackers as you wish, so they won't worry about you at all and will continue to advance towards the rest of your team. The ability to drive vehicles and even fly planes is certainly the extra gear that MOHPA needed to leave behind the heavy legacy of its predecessor, while the implementation of the Havok physics engine mainly serves to fill a gap, otherwise too obvious, in the way to interact with the scenarios. This does not mean that we will be able to stack crates and bins as is done in Half-Life 2, but at least if we bump into an object, this presumably will not remain motionless like a stone. Once again, we will be decorated with medals for our actions on the battlefield, but a significant novelty is represented by the so-called Heroic Moments, which will be recognized to us after completing certain particularly deserving secondary objectives. Therefore, rescuing a wounded officer, sneaking up behind an enemy squad and stealing his machine gun are actions that we will recognize as heroic and of which we will take a souvenir in the trunk to base camp. A matter of space Open spaces are now found in almost all games (except those in John Carmack) and if we were expecting a MOHPA set in the Pacific and forced between four walls crowded together, we were very wrong! The graphics engine of this game manages to spread before our eyes vast and evocative panoramas with a decidedly impressive wealth of detail. We go from the ocean to the mainland, from inside a burning ship to a tropical forest at night, through complex and evocative scenarios. The models are richly detailed while the textures pay the price of such richness of detail, sometimes resulting a bit dull and certainly not defined enough. In reality, the visual impact is certainly remarkable and certain shortcomings are not noticed, unless one necessarily wants to make uncomfortable comparisons with other titles. there's not much to do on the level of detail, because the scalability of the engine is extremely low A matter of space If from a visual point of view the result is undoubtedly very good, from a performance point of view there are several shadows. The used engine does not shine for novelty and certainly there are better and more recent ones, for this reason its limits are soon revealed. First of all, the memory footprint is something frightening, so much so that loading times are extremely long and maps are rather small. Furthermore, the framerate often drops in excited situations and there isn't much to act on the level of detail, because the scalability of the engine is extremely low, allowing you to lower only the textures and choose whether to apply PS 2.0 or 1.1, but nothing that can regulate the geometric complexity. Ultimately, however, it is a heaviness that can be faced without major sacrifices, given that already with an average-sized PC and a Radeon 9500Pro you can enjoy a fascinating visual spectacle and good fluidity. What really weighs a lot, however, are the loads. [C] We will soon learn to become attached to the doctor, who will save us from death. the furthest; of once. Unfortunately stocks are very limited We're sneaking up on a Japanese encampment, we'll be shaking them up soon! Soldiers independently seek shelter, even if it is often not possible. just the best [/C] A matter of time And already, a thorn in the side of a technology that pushes towards ever more detailed and fascinating graphics, the hard disk is increasingly forced to grind mega upon mega of information, sounds, textures, effects and various scripts. Not even MOHPA is an exception to this rule, on the contrary it stands out markedly, and it can be seen from the beginning that the uploads are much longer than the average to which other games have accustomed us. ...sometimes you spend more time loading than playing A matter of time Loading the start menu, fully in 3D, is boring enough, but even worse is loading the rest of the game. Despite good mannersby EA Games, which sweetens the pill with a slideshow of images of in-game snapshots, decolored with a nice sepia effect to give greater prominence to the historical sense, and with a majestic soundtrack worthy of the best orchestra in Hollywood, loading of any level surpasses the patience of any human being. And don't think you blame the 512MB of memory installed, because the problem persists in the same way even on PCs that have twice as much. It's just that sometimes you spend more time loading a new level than playing it. And, as a direct consequence of this elephantine heaviness, we find a design that offers smaller levels and which often end too soon, putting us in front of a new loading. But that's not all, outdoor maps all too often have the terrible problem of 'invisible walls', which force the player to move inside a fixed and strictly delimited corridor. Where is the freedom of action that hinted at the images before the release of the game? The open landscapes are just a scenography, because in reality - sometimes more and sometimes less marked - the action is confined to rather small areas. What is the heavy consequence of this fact? It is that the player will find himself moving in small environments with little freedom of action, among other things putting up with exhausting loads. A matter of coordination In addition to the classic single-player mode, MOHPA offers us a decent range of multiplayer options, from the traditional DeathMatch and Team DM modes, to the funnier Invasion mode. In this mode we find the two opposing sides: the one in attack has to complete a group of objectives, while the one in defense must frustrate the efforts of the opponents. In practice it is the Assault mode of the old UT. Some rather interesting innovations have been introduced, such as tickets and the possibility of exchanging backpacks between players of different classes. This means that some skills of one class can be temporarily used by a soldier of another class. Injured players will remain on the ground waiting for the doctor before being able to rejoin the game, thus avoiding declining the remaining tickets, while it will always be possible to kill the injured players of the opposing team. By installing the 1.1 patch, respawning grants a limited period of invulnerability, provided the server is set to do so, avoiding the irritating spawn-killing phenomenon that ruins many players' games around the web. A negative note is to be given to the QuickMatch system, or Quick Game, which selects a free server and allows you to enter the game with a single click. Unfortunately, the choice seems too random and does not take into account the ping (signal response time between the player's computer and the game server), so more often than not you are on an Australian server with a ping of 800 than those in which you can play well. Manual selection, via the ever-present Gamespy browser, is still the best solution. Too bad for such a good idea wasted. Comment We have reached the end of the article and we can finally draw the necessary conclusions on this important sequel: so, let's put the pros and cons on the plate of a virtual scale and see which side the needle hangs on. On the one hand, we have spectacular graphics and cinematic game sequences, first-rate sound and the possibility of directly piloting vehicles and aircraft. Then there is a minimum of physical simulation and a good tactical component, as well as perfect integration with teammates. From the point of view of involvement there are many good ideas, which unfortunately are penalized by what we find on the other side of the scale. A graphics engine that is not very scalable and very heavy, the rather small maps and linear paths, the omnipresent sensation of moving along a caged path, the corpses that in certain situations look like mannequins, but above all the very long uploads, are things that negatively affect the evaluation global and that make you regret what good this title has to offer. On the multiplayer front, the situation is equally difficult, because if the Invasion mode, on the one hand, is a pleasant surprise, on the other, the uploads are still too long and it may happen that you find yourself grinding with the hard disk for a couple of minutes only to end up in the middle of a map change. Deadly. So, ultimately, how to rate this game? MOHPA is the classic product in which good ideas are penalized by an imperfect realization, which is why we recommend its purchase to those who are sure of succeeding", "date": "2004-12-22", "grade": null}
