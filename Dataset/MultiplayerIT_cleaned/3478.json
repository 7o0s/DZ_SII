{"name": "Kirbys Return to Dream Land Deluxe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-recensione.html", "text": "It would be wrong to review a Kirby title only with the dry eyes of an expert gamer; almost each chapter is designed for the novices of every single generation, whether they are children or users who have never picked up a pad ... and who will probably do it just to play with their children / grandchildren. In addition to this difficulty, common to the whole series, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe presents another: it is an adaptation of a 2011 game released on the Nintendo Wii, also developed by HAL Laboratory, a solid episode but certainly not unforgettable. Was it really necessary to make a Deluxe edition? Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe has several changes from the original version. First of all from a graphic point of view: the resolution has been increased, the lighting has been improved (and consequently the contrast of the shades has been diversified, which in any case remain very saturated), but above all each character, protagonist or enemy, has been wrapped in an evident black border which defines its forms, detaching it from the background at the same time. While it certainly doesn't represent the cutting edge of technology on the console, the overall effect is still pleasant. Other novelties have also been included, such as new mini-games, an extra adventure at the end of the main one, and three new powers; we'll talk about it shortly. The point is: what does this chapter have to offer that wasn't already available with Kirby and the Lost Land and Kirby: Star Allies? The latter in particular dates back to 2018, and is two-dimensional - albeit built with polygons - exactly like Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe; admitted that the recent remake represents a more substantial production, however, it does not seem diversified enough. Also because, as we said earlier, Kirby is a series for novices; no one going from Star Allies to this one is going to have a much more complex, diverse or layered experience. The pacing is similar, the core of the interaction the same, the multiplayer present in both. It is the ~problem~ that has afflicted this last part of the life cycle of the Switch: instead of daring, Nintendo has preferred to be conservative. With already two Kirbys (plus two minor episodes) on the console, HAL still brought another one, rather than committing to an unreleased project; he would have, for the first time in years, the chance. main adventure Kirby's Return to Dream Land: One of Kirby's many powers In this adventure Kirby has to find the missing pieces of the Lor, Astroboat (so called by Nintendo itself, a kind of robotic sailing ship capable of projecting itself into space) owned by Magolor, the enchanter protagonist, together with the rounded pink hero, of the history. A story that in its simplicity, narrated mainly through films without dubbing, even reserves a pleasant twist. Kirby then sets off in search of these pieces within five (and more) worlds, characterized for the most part by the themes we are used to: forest, desert, sea... His main skills for decades are two. The first: Kirby, when he's not on a full stomach, knows how to ~fly~. By pressing the repeat jump button, you can hover vertically at will. The second: the ability to suck in enemies, swallow them and, thanks to the digestion of some of them, steal their abilities. Whether it's wielding a sword, the ability to throw flames or enchant something, each of them does not have a single ~move~, but is exquisitely declined. Some of them will vary by tapping on the action button, others by holding it down, still others by accompanying it with the tilt of the stick up and down. The main problem is that these refinements are not very useful. Often it is enough to attack and admire the results of the effect: as we said, it is a work aimed at children and novices, and from their point of view it will be - we imagine - potentially amusing even just ~observing~ how Kirby varies his attacks, or see how the latter defeat the enemies. Given the care placed in their variation, however, it is a pity that they have not been exploited better: apart from some environmental puzzles, however very simple, the ramifications of the moves, and their peculiarities, are not exploited to make the player ~think~ user. Kirby has always been a slow and rather monotonously paced game. This is no exception: the character can sprint (by sharply tilting the control stick, or with a double tap on the d-pad), but his run is slow, and does not affect his jump. The same ability to levitate is calm: it favors verticality over horizontality. This calm rhythm, which - to a lesser extent - also involves a classic like Yoshi's Island, is not used here, unlike in the latteror, to deepen the experience: there are several secondary items to collect, from three to six gears per level, but they never stimulate exploration or reflection. It is a very pleasant game, but devoid of genius. The stages are quite long, since the first world, and almost all of them hide at least one door to another dimension, where it is possible to collect the aforementioned hidden objects (they are not only there, of course). Many stages have a mini-boss, which tends to be quite easy, and each world is presided over by a ~final monster~; it is all experience, in general, that is simple. However, this does not prevent it from having a progressive increase in difficulty: many of you probably won't even notice it, because the maximum peak is still low, but a novice player will have to work harder as he advances in the adventure. Controls and Magolor-Epilogue Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe: Magolor's Adventure Customizations The control system is precise and responsive, it would allow for many more refinements than those exploited by game design: we particularly appreciated the aquatic sections, very often among the most tedious in a platform. Not only is watching Kirby fun, because he is equipped with a life jacket on the surface and a diving mask underwater, but moving him is really, really satisfying: he can go in any direction, and see him move the water with his little hands (paws? ) to speed up delighted us. Many of Kirby's powers are also present in the ~Super~ version, and in these cases the pre-eminence of spectacularity at the expense of stratification is even more evident; in these phases, however rather short, even the other users will have to limit themselves to observing. Yes, because Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe is playable in multiplayer at any time: just grab a Joy-Con and join the adventure. Again, it's more about having fun seeing your characters act together, rather than real collaboration: it's no small thing, but the game hasn't changed - in its main adventure - to offer something unique in this mode. Despite the refinements of swimming and powers, and in general the excellent control system, the general rhythm of the experience is always too static: the absence of running weighs heavily, and the level of difficulty is low. We could justify these last aspects in relation to the target of the project, but there are some exceptions - such as the amusing shooter phase  la Parodius near the final boss - which allow us to imagine, albeit unchanged in substance and in the ideal recipient, a more creative to vary. One of the most spectacular moments of Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe As anticipated in the introduction, the main mode added in this edition concerns Magolor, the other protagonist of the game. This adventure is also fully playable in multiplayer, this time with three clones of the character, unlike in the story of Kirby. To access this mode, the main one must be completed, so the developers were aware of addressing a slightly more experienced user than usual: we are not dealing with Celeste, but it is certainly a more demanding experience than the previous one. Magolor must recover his magical powers by collecting appropriate objects, and has the ability to enhance them one after the other, adding a minimal - but pleasant - character customization component: his story is divided into normal levels, challenges and bosses . To access the challenges you need to have a certain upgrade (for example, level 2 Levitation), and they are quite demanding: the same could be said for the bosses, decidedly more complicated, from the beginning, than almost all of the ~main~ ones. It is a welcome addition and qualitatively in line with Kirby's adventure, which undoubtedly enriches the experience, but which shares its main limitation: the absence of changes of pace. Magolor is also an extremely slow character, who prefers vertical movements to horizontal ones. Furthermore, on a visual level, this Epilogue recycles more elements than Kirby's adventure does. News and minigames Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe: Magolandia, full of mini-games There are many other small novelties in this Deluxe edition, which however belong more to an instruction booklet than to a review: a myriad of masks applicable to Kirby have been inserted, which only add a visual diversification to the character... therefore we don't feel the need to delve into the subject further. In addition to the Epilogue of Magolor, the other substantial introductions mainly involve the mini-games of Magolandia. The latter are loosely interconnectedssi with the main adventure - from one section you unlock elements for the other, and vice versa - but we would dare to say that, in the best Kirby tradition, they almost represent a game within a game. Most of the sections can be tackled in four-user multiplayer, and some of them are really a lot of fun; each comes in three levels of difficulty, with the first two very similar, and the third - the most difficult - decidedly more challenging and separate from the others, capable of putting even expert users to the test. The minigames are not all at the same height. For example, there is a kind of tennis with pans, and a bomb instead of a felt ball, of an almost embarrassing simplicity, and an involvement that cannot go beyond five minutes; there are some that are just as simple, but certainly more engaging, such as Kirby Samurai in which, once the ~go~ has arrived, you have to hit your opponent before being hit. You don't need to press anything other than the action button, but doing so requires some pretty good reflexes. Another, always with an oriental theme - with online ranking, among other things - asks us to throw shurikens (with a first person view), to hit floating targets, increasingly mobile and insidious, within a classic bamboo forest. Still another is a kind of shooter with four users, inside a square arena and with a top view, where you can shoot in front of you, charge a parabolic shot, jump to avoid some walls. In summary, the offer of these minigames is not comparable to a good Mario Party episode, but it is still pleasant and full-bodied, certainly not a listless appendix to the main adventure.", "date": "2023-02-22", "grade": "7.0"}
