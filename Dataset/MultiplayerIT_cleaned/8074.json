You should, because it is one of the most interesting and valid exclusive games among those released on WiiWare, created by the London-based team Curve Studios, also author of the Buzz! in the PSP versions and the more recent Explodemon. It was a rather original puzzle game in which the main objective was to manage a certain amount of water using the WiiMote, to be moved by tilting the entire game world and then leaving the force of gravity to do the rest. The modest success achieved has evidently allowed us to work on a second chapter, this time entitled Hydroventure: Spin Cycle and published on a 3DS eShop which is finally starting to mesh in a more convincing way than the sluggish start. Fluvius or Fulvius? Hydroventure: Spin Cycle is based substantially on the same concept as its predecessor; perhaps one of the least successful aspects is confirmed to be that of the story and the background which acts as a glue at the various levels, quite fatally (given the game genre) linked to a forced and trivial plot with characters that are anything but incisive. Basically there is a Magician who decides to give life to the drawings of an illustrated book through the Rainbow Drops, but the envious Slime takes advantage of his carelessness to capture the precious Drops in the pages. It will be up to the Fluvius Water Spirit to resolve the situation by collecting them one by one at the end of each level. Easier said than done, of course. The basic mechanics confirm the idea of the first chapter, but this time delegating the management of the inclination of the game world to the gyroscope of the Nintendo laptop; certainly not a revolutionary choice, which will be particularly familiar especially to those who have known the explosion of physics puzzles on smartphones in recent years. From this point of view, the 3DS is not exactly comfortable, indeed, especially in the full rotation levels where, compared to the traditional ones, you have to manage the console in your hands by continuously turning it even 180 degrees. Worse still of course in the case of the 3DS XL, which among the many advantages certainly does not have that of great handling when subjected to this kind of maneuvers. The poor predisposition of the handheld to this type of treatment will soon be clear, even more so in the case of the inevitable, frequent and irritating unwanted pressures on the Select, Home and Start keys. It is an inconvenience certainly not capable of ruining the gaming experience, but at the same time destined to constantly accompany the adventure level after level. However, turning a blind eye to this ~defect~, if you can call it that, is rather easy since Hydroventure: Spin Cycle is in all respects a small pearl certainly capable of making lovers of the genre happy. The difference, the element capable of raising the Curve Studios product from other similar ones, is in fact substantially enclosed in a level design worthy of the best productions of this type. The ability of the game designers is in fact to gradually introduce the various elements and different abilities of Fluvius within always interesting sections, thanks to a particular variety in the elements with which to interact. Whether they are simple switches or complex systems connected to each other, the puzzles of Hydroventure: Spin Cycle almost always manage to position themselves in the ~golden mean~ between excessive simplicity and frustration, providing particularly rewarding stimuli and objectives to reach and overcome. Don't think then that the good Fluvius has the only ability to move following the laws of fluids; continuing along the sixty total levels it will be possible to acquire skills such as that of gathering by recalling the scattered drops, or to give life to a sort of explosion, or even transforming into a solid and gaseous state and so on. For those who are not satisfied with reaching the end of the levels, there is then the possibility of earning the maximum rating of 5 stars provided that each stage has been completed with a certain amount of water and time available. What's more, collecting well-hidden puzzle pieces will unlock a series of even more challenging extra levels. Hydroventure: Spin Cycle therefore demonstrates a truly remarkable care in the gameplay, which is also accompanied by a very pleasant graphic design that perfectly replicates the tones, strokes and colors of children's illustration books, with a particularly pleasant result. Finally, a note on the sale price, slightly too high: 9.99, with for example the recent Fallblox which stops at the more correct 7.99. The 3D effect Completely non-existent. Hydroventure: Spin Cycle is one of the few stocks that has no profits3DS stereoscopy, and the reason is quite understandable: the need to move and rotate the console is an element in direct and definitive contrast with the stability required to guarantee the three-dimensional effect, which would therefore have been impossible to implement.", "date": "2012-12-31", "grade": "8.0"}
