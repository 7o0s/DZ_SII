{"name": "Deathsmiles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91196-deathsmiles-ombrelli-molto-pericolosi.html", "text": "Exchanging the iOS platform as a repository for the revival of old games and past glories is, in the opinion of the writer, conceptually wrong: the desire for retrogaming that inevitably grips the more mature gamers can easily be appeased by the numerous emulators spread on the web (those legal), while one can certainly do without rough conversions created only to extract money from nostalgic enthusiasts. This premise obviously applies not only to a single title, but also to entire genres that have almost fallen into oblivion and re-presented on a regular basis on the App store; this is the case, for example, of scrolling shooters (horizontal or vertical), now almost completely buried by 3D. However, in the great galaxy of developers that revolves around the Apple world, there is a particular team, whose signature in a production usually represents an absolute certainty of quality and capable of bringing the ancient genre of the scrolling shooter back to its most glorious splendor: this is obviously Cave Entertainment. In fact, it is precisely the creators of the beautiful Dodonpachi Resurrection and Espgaluda 2 who gave birth to Deathsmiles, an equally brilliant work that abandons the spatial setting of Dodonpachi to return to the more typically Japanese fantasy style. Mary Poppins got angry Users accustomed (and loyal) to the chaotic shootings of Dodonpachi Resurrection will therefore notice a rather clear change of style and level design in Deathsmiles: do not worry though, because both the terrifying crossfire, typical of the protagonists of every Cave game, and monsters and enemies of all sorts will not fail to delight the various sections of the game. The protagonist of the story is therefore a nice little witch, equipped with a dangerous walking umbrella capable of literally shooting at anyone who stands in front of her. Like Mary Poppins, the parasol also acts as a means of locomotion between the levels, although the combative nature of the bizarre protagonist is ultimately very distant from that of the patient Disney nanny. In the iPhone mode, which is certainly the most accurate (and added in this conversion), the young witch's task is to free the world from a series of monsters summoned by an obscure sorcerer; to do this, in addition to the aforementioned umbrella, he has clothes, shoes and accessories at his disposal that can be bought and sold from a special shop after each mission. The particular type of upgrades available, perfectly contextual to the protagonist of the title, attentive to fashion and details, is certainly not surprising; obviously, however, under the guise of new clothing items, real enhancements are actually hidden, evidenced by the increase in defense, attack, magic, resistance statistics typical of a classic Action RPG. The ~continue~ system to be used once death occurs in the game appears less pleasant: unfortunately, in order to be able to resume the adventure in progress, you have to buy the ~continue~ bonuses from the upgrade shop, essential if you don't want to end the game with a anachronistic and now disturbing Game Over. To facilitate the acquisition of money to spend in the shop (rather slow to accumulate only by playing) microtransactions with real money are envisaged, which on a title worth around 10 euros are at least perplexing. By dragging your finger on the screen it is possible to move and therefore direct the fire of the umbrella, while the lower virtual keys are assigned to the super blow and to change the direction of the attacks (right or left); a last button finally activates the use of the laser. The levels are very short but intense, as are the boss battles (which end with a sort of Quick Time Event), never frustrating except at the hardest level. In addition to the aforementioned iPhone mode, which therefore introduces simple but fundamental role-playing and inventory management elements, it is obviously possible to tackle the various stages in succession thanks to the evergreen Arcade Mode, where, among other things, three other witches are selectable. The beautiful interlude scenes in manga style will surely delight comic fans, a gem that once again shows the purely oriental nature of the title. Then the technical sector is really well done, with fluid and clean graphics even on particularly crowded occasions on the screen, full of above-average details, textures and animations; the quality therefore stands at the levels of other Cave productions, even if the very particular level design certainly contributes to making everything much more fascinating. Finally, the always appreciated double Social support, through the canonical Game Center, is worthy of mentionand the equally popular Open Feint.
