{"name": "Gangstar: Crime City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gangstar-crime-city_a.html", "text": "You leave with a reasonable debt to pay off which it seems possible to get out of only by agreeing to carry out some not exactly legal jobs supported by a GPS radar that constantly informs you about your position and that of your objectives. The first tasks are preparatory for becoming familiar with the three basic elements around which everything else will revolve: walking, shooting, driving. In this way you collect the first (dirty) money to reinvest in the tools of the trade such as steroids, weapons, fake documents in the first place, you can buy them in underground shops or on the street from shady characters marked with a dollar sign. Soon you will come into possession (illegally, ca va sans dire) of cars, stolen stealthily from the parking lots or in hasty ways after having let the legitimate owners get off, and once the training mission is over, choose between the two driving models available, or ~expert~ and ~easy~, the only difference is the control system, vobis. Sometimes you can get by on foot but many jobs require the use of a car, even the police in certain situations. I don't want to spoil the surprise too much, just know that you can shoot or run over pedestrians from the car, but there's not too much to show off, that vehicle can become your grave if damaged, after the first signs of smoke, flee before they develop the flames or it's over for you. It will be better to keep a low profile, the police officers watch over the city supported by colleagues on foot, one shot too many at an innocent person at the wrong time and a manhunt is unleashed in your honour, the criminals instead you have to shoot them as soon as they enter your crosshairs in case they are part of the target, their deaths yield money, cases of drugs and a career. PRO The action is fast-paced The missions are varied and balanced AGAINST Shops are superfluous to finish the game Your mother won't approve", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
