In the first case, don't worry: Transformers 3 won't reveal any surprises to you, it is in fact a prologue to the events of the film that introduces the character of Shockwave into the cinematic universe of the transformers, quite talked about even during the three hours of duration of the film. Michael Bay's cinematographic operation has divided critics, the public and above all the fans of the well-known franchise but whatever the subjective opinions are, the trilogy has had the merit of reviving the toys and characters of our childhood like no animated or comic series ever was successful before. It is only natural that a video game tie-in was developed for this third and final film, a commercial operation that usually leads to the creation of bad and superficial products. However, Hasbro has requested (imposed?) the collaboration of the guys from High Moon Studios, made famous last year by another game based on the Transformers franchise, the excellent War for Cybertron. Will it be enough to make this Transformers 3 more than what you see? Battle for Earth Transformers 3 continues the story based on the prequel, Revenge of the Fallen: if you were lucky enough not to see that terrible film, know that the autobots led by Optimus Prime remained on Earth to track down the decepticons together with a military unit called NEST . As we said, the plot of the game has the function of introducing the decepticon Shockwave in film continuity and Mech Tech technology in the toy line. Yes, that's right, it's a sobbing soup of ideas that connects the long missions to each other. Having abandoned the idea of the two parallel stories of War for Cybertron, High Moon Studios has opted for seven chapters during which the players control the various protagonist robots, good and bad: the aim is generally to destroy everything that moves while try to reach a point on the map. While it is true that most of the levels are decidedly linear, it must also be said that the various transformers are sufficiently differentiated from each other to make each mission at least interesting. Mirage/Dino, the Ferrari autobot, can activate a stealth mode that allows him to avoid enemies undisturbed while playing as Soundwave you will have to use his ultrasonic waves to deactivate some obstacles. In general, High Moon Studios has literally translated the gameplay of War for Cybertron into the new context offered by the universe of Michael Bay, in practice the mechanics are the same: the player controls a robot and pressing the left stick can immediately switch from robotic form vehicular form. There's a twist, though, in that the heavily armed vehicle form is actually a hybrid that offsets destructive power with increased mobility. In case you want to assume a normal vehicular form, decidedly faster than the previous one, just hold down a key and combine it with another to take advantage of a super-acceleration: the idea is pretty good and effectively takes some scenes from the film, but the control system leaves a lot to be desired, proving to be not very intuitive and decidedly cumbersome, which is why most of the time we find ourselves maintaining the robot form to face enemies, more manageable and powerful. Playstation 3 trophies There is also a good amount of Trophies to unlock by playing both the campaign and the multiplayer mode. Whether it's destroying the insignia scattered throughout the levels, winning a certain number of online matches or simply completing the campaign, Transformers 3 offers nineteen Bronze Trophies, thirteen Silver Trophies, four Gold Trophies and the canonical Platinum Trophy. Cyberverse! Whether you like the design of the so-called ~bayformer~ or not, one thing is certain: the programmers of High Moon Studios have managed to transport it to consoles with great fidelity, proposing a video game version of the autobots and decepticons almost identical to the cinematic version. The robots enjoy a very high level of detail and extremely fluid and realistic animations, after all the same care had been placed in the creation of the War for Cybertron models and from that same game Transformers 3 also inherits the elegant and very rapid transformations. Curiously, some characters never seen in the films also appear during the story and in that case real toys were used as a reference, as in the case of Mixmaster. Therefore, if the transposition of the robots and their vehicular forms has been carried out in the best possible way, the same cannot be said of the settings: in Transformers 3 the player goes through exotic places and secret bases, forests and caves, a commendable variety, however undermined by a unsatisfactory level of detail. The various locations appear so empty and inanimate, inhabited only by the numerous enemies all the same that the robot on duty, whether autobot or decepticon, will be able to defeat without too much effort due to the barely sketched artificial intelligence. It is a result that leaves a bad taste in the mouth if we consider the excellent artistic work done with the previous title of High Moon Studios which, paradoxically, had been designed from scratch. It is therefore here that Transformers 3 tumbles, in comparison with War for Cybertron from which it definitely comes out with broken bones, especially if we consider the inevitable multiplayer mode which in this case appears to have been made with extreme superficiality. In the absence of any coop mode, whether it's the campaign or something else, the player just has to dive into a competitive multiplayer that offers only three modes, which are decidedly trivial, and five maps. It is possible to choose a ~class~ among the four available for the transformers, each equipped with specific skills obtainable by gaining experience points during battles, but in the face of the poverty of content offered by the online component it is difficult to be interested in them for no more than a couple of matches.", "date": "2011-07-08", "grade": "6.5"}
