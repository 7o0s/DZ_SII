{"name": "Puzzle Paradise", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/puzzle-paradise.html", "text": "EA Mobile has an already quite large catalog, which in the puzzle game category can count classics such as Tetris (in its various variants), Scrabble, Pictionary and others. With Puzzle Paradise, therefore, the developers wanted to try their hand at something different from the usual, moving away a little from the milestones and well-known brands in favor of a very interesting idea: to create an island (the ~Puzzle Paradise~, precisely) divided into eight different areas, each of which contains two minigames that the player must face and master in order to continue his exploration of the place. A total of sixteen distinct puzzle games, therefore, which challenge us in the most diverse ways, adopting the classic structure with colored blocks or using numbers, but always keeping in mind the concept of simplicity and immediacy. The game modes are also revealed in the composition of the island, in the sense that proceeding in what is a sort of ~story mode~ gradually unlocks all the minigames and you can also decide to try your hand at one in particular, in search of the highest score. In this sense, Puzzle Paradise offers us a very wide and varied choice: in one of the applications we will have to merge spheres of the same color to eliminate them, as in the classics of the genre, while in the next test we will have to try our hand at a sort of memory game, in which to recognize the pairs of identical cards on a board within a time limit. Or we will have to recognize the right object among three that are mixed as in the game of three cards, or stack identical fruits on a stick that stretches, to eliminate them before they all fall on us. The numeric keyboard is also called into question, with some tests involving entering the exact numbers at the right time, or writing long digits to eliminate the birds that carry them. In short, the numbers of this product speak for themselves, and the variety of situations proposed is unique within the puzzle game genre. Clearly, it is not possible that all minigames boast the same quality: there are some very interesting ones, especially those with a classic structure, with the elimination of blocks or spheres. The one with fruits, in particular, requires a strategic approach, not to laugh, given that the stick can carry a limited number of objects and therefore you have to choose very well which row to proceed from. Likewise, there are much less brilliant applications: those in which it is necessary to write long digits prove to be more tests of skill than of reflexes, while in other cases (as in copying the game of three cards) the structure is really too simple. The technical realization of the game is good, in particular for the use of colors: the colors are always lively, and the style in general is rather ~clean~ and precise. The presence of eighteen different applications obviously translates into a quality level that has its ups and downs: in correspondence with a simple structure, we usually have mediocre and approximate graphics; conversely, the most successful minigames on a conceptual level also turn out to be the most well-finished ones from a technical point of view. The sound sector is composed of catchy MIDI music, of good quality, which accompany the action effectively and without disturbing. Furthermore, it is possible to adjust the volume independently of the mobile phone: a great thing for smartphone owners. The control system varies from time to time, but always proves to be very precise and responds to input quickly. PRO Eighteen different minigames Colorful and cute graphics Some games are immediate and engaging... AGAINST ...others boring and frustrating Technical realization between ups and downs Nice idea, but poorly used", "date": "2008-05-15", "grade": "S.V."}
