{"name": "PUBG", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pubg-recensione-ps4.html", "text": "Almost two years after its first release in Early Access on Steam, PUBG also landed on the last of the main home platforms last month. The arrival on PlayStation 4 takes place at the end of the exclusive time period on the rival Microsoft platform. Just a year ago, in fact, we were about to praise the praises and (above all) defects of a conversion that leaked everywhere, despite the power of a machine like the One X. During 2018, the situation certainly improved. solving a good part of the technical flaws that the porting had as a dowry. It has certainly been an important year for the guys at PUBG corp: after the incredible success achieved by the Early Access version of the game, with around thirty million copies sold during development and a current total exceeding fifty million, the game has landed also on mobile in a free to play version, developed by the Chinese giant Tencent. Furthermore, on the export front, as we told you during the summer event in Berlin we were present at, Brendan Greene himself told us how their expansion goals in the world of competitions take the form of a real mission, with a five-year project that will aim at economic self-sufficiency, so as to give the world of electronic competitions a first real league. In light of all these elements and also considering the fierce competition brought on by Fortnite before the others, let's see what players can expect from this PS4 version. The Gameplay: a decidedly clear picture There has been no doubt that battle royale has been the genre of the moment for a couple of years now. The basics of the genre are therefore clear to everyone. In the case of PUBG we do not deviate from the foundations, however going to create uniqueness as regards the approach to gameplay, but we go step by step. One hundred players are parachuted (literally) from a plane flying above one of the maps available in the game; choosing the point in which to launch is certainly important and represents the first big news introduced in the genre by PUBG, then taken up by all the best contenders. Once landed, alone or with your own group of up to four players, you will be asked to choose a place to go to in order to recover, in the shortest possible time, the best equipment that will come to hand. From firearms to blunt weapons, from helmets of various sizes to bulletproof vests, through grenades and means of transport. Keeping the area under control and avoiding exposing yourself too much to enemy fire can change your fate in battle, just as it is essential to follow the progress of the game and the shrinking of the playing area. After a specific interval of time, in fact, a force barrier will incorporate the outermost parts of the map, shrinking more and more, until it delimits an area so small as to insert all the remaining players in an adrenaline free-for-all. Winning the game will give you a number of coins based on your kills and your placement, allowing you to buy chests from which to recover new skins to apply to your alter ego in the game. As if all this weren't already enough, PUBG can also boast an element of further appeal to the public: the variety of maps. In fact, three additional maps have been introduced over the months, bringing the total number to four, each one profoundly different from the others. The rural and post-apocalyptic environment of Erangel has been joined by the desert of Miramar, the forest of Sanhok and the snow-capped peaks of Vikendi. Each with their own peculiarities and styles of play, they represented one of the best-assorted elements of the title, appreciated by a large part of the players. The PlayStation 4 conversion We come to what are the technical characteristics of this conversion. As mentioned at the beginning, the experience accumulated by the team during this year of work on the Xbox has allowed the game to arrive on the Playstation Store in a state of grace. Our test on PlayStation 4 Pro allowed us to highlight the good performance from the point of view of the frame rate and a general cleanliness that does not differ too much from what can be admired on PC. It is easy to understand how a technical aspect that is certainly not exciting even on the most high-sounding configurations comes to the aid of the consoles, which do not risk disfiguring from a visual point of view. Even with regard to netcode and group management, there are no problems, despite some slight loading too much in the transitions from matchmaking to the actual start of the gameta, but nothing that could really undermine the gaming experience. At the same time, the problem that is certainly insurmountable is that of the gaming peripheral. Despite the compatibility of mouse and keyboard on consoles, now an almost completely overcome obstacle, it cannot be denied that the pad remains the main peripheral used on home machines. By its very nature, PUBG is a title that does not marry with this control system and, even if it is possible to get used to the management of aiming and shooting, it remains more difficult to digest the navigability in the menus. This ill harmonizes with the need to be precise and fast in the looting phase, avoiding as much as possible being caught with your pants down. Overall, however, PUBG remains an incredibly enjoyable game even in its console counterpart, without prejudice to its nature absolutely designed for the PC.", "date": "2019-01-07", "grade": "8.0"}
