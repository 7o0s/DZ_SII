A return to the arcade and caciarone atmospheres of DiRT 3 was out of the question, given that by now that type of offer is well represented by GRID; and so here is DiRT 4, a solid and concrete episode that focuses entirely on the goodness of an impeccable driving system, on the variety of contents and on some small but interesting news. Much appreciated by the international press, the game arrived a little late, but we are finally ready to tell you about it in detail. First, however, a fundamental question: for you, should a driving game simply have fun or put you to the test? Sunday pilots The question was not far-fetched, given that the first choice that DiRT 4 confronts us with is the selection of the style of gameplay between ~player~ and ~simulation~. Net of the many fine adjustments that can be used in one case or another, there is a substantial difference between the two settings: in the first case the car, however powerful, behaves mostly predictable and therefore allows to use the brake and accelerator to balance the skid in a very precise way, which remains the main maneuver for tackling any stretch of road that is not a straight line; in the second case, however, many variables come into play, the car can be nervous and often understeer, vehemently expressing the forces at stake and its own weight on the screen, as well as transforming any mistake or lightness into a condemnation without appeal. The approach therefore changes radically, as does the impact of the setup and upgrades on our chances of winning: playing in the arcade style you will find yourself facing a rather trivial first part of the campaign and getting to the end without thinking more than both to the rich side dish, which in DiRT 4 is represented by upgrades, staff management, test laps to check the set-up and so on. By opting instead for the simulation setting, all these elements of the experience will be substantially enhanced and will present themselves as an impossible factor not to be considered in the economy of the race: in addition to learning to steer the car well, we will have to try to smooth out the edges of its behavior on the road by making the necessary changes to the setup, with a view to a progression that in this sense will be much more difficult and complicated, but at the same time heralding a significantly higher degree of satisfaction if our efforts are finally rewarded. Obviously the fact of being able to count on such a highly customizable driving system, with basic styles and many contour adjustments (from driving aids to manual or automatic gearbox, from the sensitivity of the controls to the number of restarts allowed, etc.), makes the DiRT 4 experience usable at many different levels, if we want even within the context of a single, significant progression. Less expert users will therefore be able to start with the ~player~ mode, become familiar with the philosophy of the game and with the structure of the competitions, and then gradually decrease the aids and finally switch to the simulation style, perhaps replaying all the events from scratch to savor the great differences that are revealed in the transition from one setting to another. A similar speech can be made for the level of difficulty and the degree of skill of the opponents, both aspects that can change the cards on the table and give us a relaxing walk on the dirt road or a hell of mud, tears and poop. Speaking of artificial intelligence, we must applaud the developers: the other drivers sometimes leave early, have accidents, cut us off viciously and therefore don't just do their homework. That boy from curve B We come then to the contents, which together with the guide system represent the flagship of DiRT 4. From the home screen it is possible to access the ~events~ section and from there try your hand at a career, with online competitions, with the multiplayer mode, with ~free play~, with the ~Ace of the wheel~ skill challenges or practice in the DiRT Academy, a scenario in which you get familiar with the cars and the gameplay of the Codemasters title. The career stands as the fulcrum of the single player experience: after having completed a few introductory races, a tradition for the racers of the English team, we will be able to create our own team, customize it in various aspects (even the name: we have chosen an explanatory~Stock Hudson~, owned by the pilot T. Spetazzo), accept sponsorship offers and hire engineers and PR who can contribute to its rise. Appreciable novelty elements, albeit barely mentioned, but of course we will have to do the bulk of the work in person, once we get on track. There are four categories available in the career: Rally, the richest, most multifaceted and traditional; Land Rush, between trucks and dune buggies racing in the mud; Rally Cross, the licensed championship, with interesting events on asphalt characterized by a pinch of strategy; and finally Historic Rally, which is the wet dream of all long-time enthusiasts due to the presence of various legendary cars, unforgettable stars of the past. The number of tournaments present within each category varies, as well as naturally the degree of involvement we have felt towards the various disciplines, with a predilection towards the traditional Rally and Rally Cross, but a lower enthusiasm for the sometimes very nervous, sometimes banal Land Rush races. In any case, we are talking about a large number of events and contents, which can be accessed according to the canons of an ~old school~ progression: you need to win a certain number of races to be able to try your hand at historic rallies, for example, and own specific categories of vehicles to access certain events. We will therefore be able to invest the money earned on the track not only in the growth of the aforementioned team, through the hiring of more capable technicians and the construction of advanced systems in which to operate them, but obviously also in the purchase of new cars, whether brand new models or used vehicles, less flashy but equally suitable for the purpose. Playstation 4 trophies Most of DiRT 4's forty-nine Trophies can be obtained simply by completing all the single player events in the game, as certain actions (such as enriching staff, obtaining licenses and pursuing the best upgrades) will be a natural consequence of your progression. However, there are also several achievements based on the multiplayer modes, especially the special events. Handbrake depraved The playful offer of DiRT 4 is completed by a set of fun skill challenges, the aforementioned ~Ace of the wheel~ section, and by the multiplayer modes, which we were able to try without problems as the game is already available in shops. The standard races take place according to the traditional rules of the rally, everyone running parallel on the track, without seeing each other, and fighting to gnaw away precious tenths of a second in sight of the finish line. We are talking about a very simple but effective setting, which during our tests never showed problems or uncertainties, but which at the same time will only be able to exalt those who have already completed everything that can be completed and are desperate for new challenges. confronting the global leaderboard. The timed events are decidedly more interesting, which offer an ever-changing experience and therefore aim to guarantee a certain degree of longevity to the Codemasters product, rewarding users who manage to complete them successfully in a fairly generous way. The much talked about procedural editor also plays a role from an online perspective and can actually change the cards on the table thanks to the unpredictability of its mechanisms. By accessing the ~free play~ mode, we will in fact be able to create entire championships from scratch, selecting their locations and generating more or less long, more or less complex stages from scratch, to then save them and offer them to our opponents in multiplayer. In short, a nice extra, albeit limited in terms of options: not the big news we expected. However, these are only details, in the light of an overall substantial and highly enjoyable system, which is assisted by a pleasant signed soundtrack, excellent sound effects (with the voice of the narrator / navigator in Italian) and graphics that point on performance, ensuring stable sixty frames per second, particularly realistic cars (which are likely to be damaged) and scenarios that move between ups and downs, showing off a colorful style that in some situations brings to mind the Naughty Dog titles but which it doesn't always hit the target, both due to excessively flat surfaces and generic assets, and due to dated polygonal models when it comes to representing the public or the pilot himself, taken during some shots. Finally, the lack of HDR support is perplexing, which with the landscapes of DiRT 4 and its great variety of weather situations would have goneI'm literally getting married.", "date": "2017-06-08", "grade": "8.4"}
