The title, however truncated in a very particular way, says everything there is to know: it is a spin-off of the historic JRPG Square Enix series, but unlike the previous Dragon Quest of the Stars, it is structured as a strategic and all set on combat and character management, rather than on exploration and the narrative substrate, thus distinguishing itself substantially from the classic trend of the franchise. To enrich the whole there is also a Pokmon-style element, which leads us to capture monsters and make them fight alongside us, thus also applying the inevitable gacha component that is well associated with the free-to-play distribution of the game , complete with banners and special events to take part in to get special drops. Everything is represented according to the traditional characterization of Dragon Quest, or with the character design of Akira Toriyama (or whoever for him) and the usual Japanese fantasy setting that recalls a little fairy-tale elements and a little more classic anime style. The result is however a mobile RPG capable of clearly distinguishing itself from the crowd, although it is not technically one of the most advanced, on the contrary. In terms of graphical complexity, resolution, fluidity and loading times, the game has a somewhat ~antique~ feel compared to certain other competitors currently on the market. What is most convincing is the balance that the game achieves in the mix of its various characteristics, placing strategic combat at the center of the gameplay and making all the not exactly secondary elements related to the collection of monsters and fighter management revolve around this. From this point of view, it could be even more convincing than Fire Emblem Heroes, which on the contrary seems to place the emphasis on gacha elements and makes combat a more accessory feature, even if the presence of auto-play risks flattening everything in ruinous manner. Collecting monsters and fighting It is not officially part of the Monsters spin-off series, but it would have all the credentials to do so: Dragon Quest Tact is all projected towards progressive battles and the collection of monsters to train and use in combat, with a decidedly forgettable story to do as a pretext for this continuous collection of creatures. The combat system is developed like that of a real Japanese strategic RPG: the clashes take place on grids divided into squares within which to arrange and move your units (maximum five for each party) according to the possibilities of movement and the characteristics of attack and defense. Being monsters, the different skills and fighting styles can be extravagant, but everything can be traced back to the typical subdivisions between ranged or melee warriors, able to use magic, support and other standard categories, even if presented in peculiar way. The party leader is able to provide assistance by changing the stats of others as needed, but it is still advisable to build several pre-set teams to deal with different situations, as recommended by the game. The monster-fighters can be conquered on the battlefield or through the usual gacha system, which requires the expenditure of gems, a rather rare in-game currency compared to all the others which are instead spread in large quantities and mainly serve to raise level the creatures. The drop rate doesn't seem bad and the game generally allows you to get good level monsters without too many disappointments, although higher-ranking ones may require the use of micro-transactions. The system seems structured in a fairly fair way, but the gems needed to carry out the ~scouting~ (ie the summoning of monsters) are certainly a rare resource, outside the marketplace. The management, i.e. the evolution with raising the level cap which is necessary to face the most demanding battles, instead takes place through a system that can easily ignore in-app purchases, given that materials and currency can be easily conquered by tackling the story mode or dedicating himself to the various alternative adventures. A bit of grinding is required which explains the implementation of auto-battle, an option we don't recommend using but it can actually ease the monotony of the bursts of battles required if you want to reach the higher levels. The RMobile PG with gacha is usually based on charismatic characters and a general characterization that pushes you to discover as many characters as possible and also in this sense Dragon Quest Tact proves to be quite original. Instead of the usual glittering warriors or more or less undressed waifu, in this case we find ourselves dealing with funny monsters, often deriving from designs that seem to push the imagination too far, given the strange results. It may not appeal to everyone but it undoubtedly represents a very interesting and particular choice, embellished by the Toriyama trait which makes everything absolutely unique. Precisely in this regard, it should also be noted that the 3D graphics appear rather crude compared to many other titles of the genre: while all the 2D illustrations are of excellent workmanship, the three-dimensional representation is very simple and comes with a low resolution and frame-rate uncertain even on not quite antiquated devices.", "date": "2021-02-01", "grade": "7.0"}
