In fact, having found themselves short of new ideas, the developers of the most famous blockbusters belonging to this genre took a break for reflection, leaving the task of introducing a minimum of innovation into a formula that is now decidedly inflated to some independent realities. Well, Infiniroom does just that: it starts from the typical gameplay of two-dimensional endless runners, like Monster Dash, and fits its mechanisms into a restricted context, to say the least, that of a single room whose walls change dynamically, presenting obstacles in rapid sequence and traps that have the common denominator of being deadly for our character. In this case, the race therefore takes place along the walls, regardless of the force of gravity, proceeding clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the situation. Only two touch controls at our disposal: by touching the right side of the screen we will allow the character to leap, more or less high depending on the duration of the pressure; by touching the left side, we will activate a special ability that changes according to the ~runner~: a dash from one wall to another, a destructive charge, a powerful hammer blow and so on. Full speed Literally a few minutes are enough to have a rather clear idea of the experience offered by Infiniroom, which stands as a fast and ~synthetic~ title, with games that last even a few seconds if it goes badly, a minute if it goes well, and which therefore they lend themselves perfectly to a quick and impromptu use, when you have little time available but still want to distract yourself a bit. The jump mechanism, especially the short one, is in fact really difficult to assimilate, as it must be performed with absolutely precise timing, under penalty of game over. From this point of view, the approach of Lonebot's mobile game is dangerously close to the atmospheres of Flappy Bird, although the presence of a special ability for each character allows you to get out of the way at least on some occasions, when the path appears a little ' too tortuous and we want to try a workaround. Speaking of characters, the starting one can be used for free without any problem, while the other four are firstly unlocked by completing simple challenges, secondly activated through ~tickets~ which are given with discrete continuity by the game, in particularly by watching commercial trailers. To have infinite ones and completely eliminate the ads, you have to pay 2.99 euros: a figure that we certainly suggest spending if the Infiniroom experience manages to captivate and excite you right from the start. The problem with titles that are so difficult but at the same time so simple, in fact, inevitably lies within the limits of a gameplay which, moreover, in this specific case, starts immediately and therefore does not allow the player to adapt a minimum. Nothing to say as regards the technical sector: the pixel art graphic style works, net of the repetitiveness of the scenario, and the soundtrack manages to involve thanks to its rhythms.", "date": "2017-10-14", "grade": "7.0"}
