It is also and above all for this reason that having launched the clever re-edition of this classic video game on the iPad for the first time has left us particularly surprised. And sadly not in a good way. But let's go in order and start from the story. Yes, because The 7th Guest has a rather complex and convoluted plot: Henry Stauf is a cheap petty thief who spends his time robbing poor travelers until he even commits murder during his criminal actions. Falling asleep as if nothing had happened, he dreams of a doll that becomes his personal obsession and forces him to work day and night in an attempt to build it. In this way Stauf begins a new life as a toy maker: he dreams of them at night and creates them during the day to then sell them. But soon the idyll is interrupted by a strange virus that seems to kill with no way out all the children of the town where Henry sells his works. And, before being pointed out as a possible infector and culprit, the eclectic character invests all the money earned in the construction of a ghostly villa populated with puzzles, pitfalls and strange presences where he takes refuge for the rest of his life, fueling the mystery around his figure. No one hears more about him until six people receive an invitation to spend the night in his home: who among them manages to solve the riddle in his room will see his most hidden and secret wish fulfilled. This narrative canvas is quickly narrated in the long introduction to The 7th Guest and the player will simply be catapulted inside the villa without knowing anything about the character he plays, apart from his name: Ego. Going forward in the gameplay, he will discover who he is, what he is doing in there, what happened to the six guests and above all why the evil voice of Stauf haunts him calling him the seventh guest. Professor Layton in a horror sauce As you have surely already partly understood by reading the lines above, The 7th Guest is a sort of puzzle game, combined with graphic adventure elements with an evident thriller and horror tone where the real protagonists are the full motion video sequences or scenes live footage of real actors then digitized and inserted into static environments designed and rendered in 3D. Precisely these scenes represented the flagship of Trilobyte production when it arrived on the market almost 20 years ago (in 1993 to be precise) stimulating the sales of CD-ROM players which in that period were slowly establishing themselves as the game was distributed exclusively on this medium. And these scenes today are rather unpleasant to the trained eye of the player now accustomed to very different realistic representations. Looking today at these flesh-and-blood figures digitized in a very rudimentary way with clearly evident pieces of blue screen, flickering of the image and more generally an excessive and truly crude detachment from the background of the scenarios, extremely poor and basic, unfortunately leaves us dumbfounded even if wanting to judge too cruelly the graphic aspect of the production deliberately brought to Apple systems in its original version, without any type of retouching or reworking. Even the puzzles are exactly the same as in the past, with a small reduction: from 22 of The 7th Guest of the 90s they have moved on to the current 19 due to the difficulty encountered by the developer in bringing particular puzzles to the small screen of the iPhone 3 without passing months to rethink and design them from scratch. Just like in a sort of Professor Layton for adults, the player will have to move around the house through fixed screens to solve the puzzles scattered according to a pre-existing but not strictly mandatory order and it is precisely in this cornerstone of the experience that lurks one of the two major flaws of The 7th Guest. For most of the puzzles it will never be fully clear what to do. In fact, except for some minimal clues that Stauf will give when the challenge is started and for some reflections made aloud by the protagonist, there will never be a real indication of what the player must do to solve the puzzle. Very little is needed a help book on a table in the library, this too ready to give only incomplete indications in a poetic key or as a nursery rhyme; everything is in the hands of the player in a sort of game within the game: even before solving the puzzle it is essential to understand in what coThe challenge persists. And as if this were not enough, the difficulty of the puzzles also seems to be completely random: there is no real progression thanks to the non-linear sequence of the puzzles and you will often find yourself spending hours on a puzzle just to understand how it works, to then meet immediately after another one that you will solve in less than 5 minutes. If nothing else, give Trilobyte credit for the great work they've done on puzzle variety. Although they do not reach 20 in numerical terms, we find them able to range on every front: from logical ones to those based on the composition of sentences, up to geometric ones or those related to chess. The interface, this unknown And so let's talk about the second crucial flaw of The 7th Guest: its game interface. What has been said for the graphic aspect also applies to Trilobyte's precise decision to leave the control method practically unchanged, once managed with the use of the mouse (and we don't want to mention the anachronistic saving, loading and settings menus). The touch screen is therefore used ~in reverse~: the action is performed when you remove your finger from the screen, not when you select something with a touch, as would normally suggest. However, it must be said that you practice the interface right away (although a tutorial to guide the player at the beginning would not have hurt), unfortunately, however, some systemic problems remain for the duration of the game: walking around all the time using your finger on the screen to find the point of interaction is not particularly intuitive and it will happen many times to activate the action of moving from one environment to another by mistake simply because you have removed your index finger from the screen due to tiredness. Among other things, to avoid having the user cover the sensitive area of the scenario with his own fingers, the game uses a trick that is as useful as it is annoying: the actually selected point is always several pixels higher than where the phalanx rests with unpleasant consequences especially in precision puzzles. A note of merit must instead be spent on the audio of the game even with the necessary precautions. First of all, the soundtrack is particularly pleasant, despite a certain basic repetitiveness and the evident MIDI-style sampling of the instruments, but it is the dubbing that amazes positively thanks to an excellent acting by the actors and numerous slow-motion effects and pitch modification for instill the thrilling atmosphere into the scenery. Mind you though, The 7th Guest is entirely in English and does not offer any kind of subtitles. This could be an important deterrent for those who do not know the idiom of Albion seen and considered that the plot will be narrated only by voice and a handful of puzzles will be based on puns and on the reconstruction of sentences.
