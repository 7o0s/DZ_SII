{"name": "Moscow To Berlin - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moscow-to-berlin-recensione.html", "text": "This Cursed War will never end Moscow To Berlin covers the entire time frame of the Second World War, starting from 1941 when Hitler believes that the time has come to break through the westernmost border of Great Mother Russia and launches the attack called ~Barbarossa~, up to 1945 when The Soviet Union is planted by the Red Army on the Reichstag in Berlin. In between there are 20 complex missions to be completed divided into 3 campaigns (operation Barbarossa, the War in Russia, the battle for Berlin) which in the first two sections will see us in command of the forces of the reich while in the final battle we will have the troops of the red army. Moscow To Berlin covers the entire time frame of the Second World War, starting from 1941 when Hitler believes the time has come to break through the westernmost border of Great Mother Russia Real Time Paused In the previous paragraph I purposely used the term ~complex~ in reference to the 20 missions of the single-player game: Moscow to Berlin in fact is not exactly the immediate and ~user friendly~ RTS that can be easily managed even by the most neophyte of players. The title of Montecristo, like and more than its predecessors, requires a lot of strategy and planning of the attack, otherwise the writing ~mission failed~ will very easily appear on your monitor. To understand each other, in MtB, as in the previous chapters, we will be able to block the action at any moment and thus have the opportunity to better study the scenario (the maps are of excellent workmanship and also quite varied) full of obstacles for the means or of elements favorable to our strategy such as dense vegetation for hiding or heights essential for the control of a certain area of the map. We will also have to study (it's not a figure of speech: the characteristics of each mechanical vehicle and weapon are present in the game's internal encyclopedia) the strengths and weaknesses of the vehicles and weapons (both of which have greatly increased compared to the other titles in the series ) of our army and that of the opponents to be able to bring home the victory as well as making the best use of all the possibilities in our possession such as for example air attacks or reinforcements (no minerals to collect: the arrival of new means takes place in completely automatically at predetermined time intervals). But how beautiful that crawler is! Like and perhaps more than its predecessors, Moscow to Berlin presents itself to RTS lovers with truly superlative graphics. Not only have the designers meticulously reconstructed each element such as scenarios, uniforms, vehicles and weapons of the period but also from a purely technological point of view, the three-dimensional graphics engine reaches truly high quality peaks that only very few other titles have reached in this particular genre (among these Act of War, also from Atari). Shadows in real time, light and weather effects of the finest quality, textures capable of remaining pleasing to the eye even when zooming in at close range and what's more, all this good seeing does not require particularly expensive hardware requirements: we are undoubtedly facing one of the best strategic real time from a technical point of view and it is a pity that praise is not wasted among the specialized critics towards the programmers of Montecristo, guilty only of not having a noble name like other studios... Even the sound component is well made, not presenting smudges of sorts both in the sound effects and in the mission briefing dialogues (remained in English but with Italian subtitles) and in the accompanying music. Like and perhaps more than its predecessors, Moscow to Berlin presents itself to RTS lovers with truly superlative graphics Multiplayer is to RTS like cheese to macaroni Clearly the multiplayer game possibilities could not be missing: there are 3 game modes available (deathmatch, capture the flag, and conquest of the headquarters) for up to 4 players. The small number of participants and the few maps available (only 10 and some reserved only for one-on-one battles) are perhaps the only not too convincing elements of this title but as regards the number of players this is probably due to the nature game specific. Final comment Moscow to Berlin is the last (in chronological terms) and best exponent of the long series of Montecristo Games dedicated to the Second World War. Like and better than its predecessors, MtB confirms all the excellent features of Afrika Korps, D-Day and Battle of The Bulge starting from the three-dimensional graphics engine that is not expensive in terms of hardware requests but capable of proposingand good textures even zooming as close as possible to units, shadows in real time, light effects and weather of excellent workmanship. Even the gameplay confirms its rather complex nature so as to require a lot of strategy and attack planning work (if the game can be paused when we want, there will be a reason), otherwise the writing ~mission failed~ will do very easily peek at your monitor. If we add to this three decidedly demanding and long campaigns in which, at the head of the Germans first and then the Russians, we will have to win 20 battles and a decidedly faithful historical reconstruction of each element, it is easy to understand why we definitely recommend the purchase of Moscow to Berlin as long as you love these decidedly non-immediate and ~arcade~ coordinates in terms of real-time strategy. The only drawback concerns the multiplayer in which perhaps there are few maps available (10) but if we also think that the title is distributed in Italy by Atari at a budget price ( 29.90), Moscow To Berlin undoubtedly deserves a good promotion. Pros Engine Light and valuable graphics Very demanding single campaign Price budget Cons Gameplay definitely not for everyone Only 10 maps for multiplayer It improves but does not innovate compared to its predecessors This Cursed War will never end Moscow to Berlin (the precise title is actually Mockba to Berlin) is the fourth product that Montecristo dedicates to the Second World War. After Desert Rats vs Afrika Corps, after D-Day and after 1944: Battle of The Bulge, the French programmers decide to shift their attention and their gameplay which moves on the coordinates of the strategy in real time, on the eastern front, what saw the forces of the Reich as protagonists against those of the Russian Army, in incredibly dramatic battles especially for the many dead among both civilians and soldiers.", "date": "2005-12-12", "grade": null}
