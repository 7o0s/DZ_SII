When talent, creative ability and technological innovation were combined to give us pearls, with the thrill and the ~jaw on the ground~ effect always around the corner. A period that gave birth to universally recognized masterpieces, capable of realizing previously only sketchy ideas (due to the inadequacy of the systems of the 80s) and of laying the foundations for the videogame trends that we know well today. The Bitmap Brothers were great protagonists of this era, thanks to an evident and immediately recognizable stylistic signature, and their productions have been a wonderful crescendo of quality and atmosphere, starting with Speedball and then continuing with Gods, reaching a climax with titles such as the strategic Z and the shooter The Chaos Engine (also known as Soldiers of Fortune). The latter celebrates its twentieth anniversary this year and Mastertronic has decided to celebrate the event by releasing a ~remastered~ version of the game for PC, adding to the original structure an online cooperative multiplayer mode, a save function for the game (in place of the password system used in 1993) and, finally, a graphic filter that scales screens to 320 x 240 pixels to make them look decent on current displays. In short, an evident nostalgia operation, which however moves between lights and shadows. Lots of shadows. Remastered... but not too much Not even the time to recover from the disappointment for the recent remake of Flashback, another of the gems released in the early 90s, which The Chaos Engine arrives on Steam at the ~modest~ price of 7.99 euros. Let's be clear, it would certainly be modest if what was released by Mastertronic had the connotations of a remastered classic, but this is not the case and what we have faced is nothing more than a mere re-proposition of the original, with characteristics slightly superior to what any emulator could offer. We had complained about the remake of Delphine Software's masterpiece, accusing the developers of having taken some liberties but above all noting that a game from twenty years ago, however beautiful, can hardly be re-proposed today as it is and count on the support of a large group of users who are not nostalgic for the era. Well, the question is very valid for The Chaos Engine, which beyond the features mentioned at the beginning (online cooperative multiplayer, save function and graphic filter) does not change the work of the Bitmap Brothers one iota. We therefore have the same graphics of 1993, but with the colors of the ~advanced~ version for AGA chipsets, judged by the majority of fans as too bright and out of context with respect to the spirit of the game; the same sound, but without additional options; the exact same gameplay, with all the rough edges of the case that clearly haven't been smoothed; and finally a timid support for the Xbox 360 controller. It must also be said that the few games we were able to play in online cooperative multiplayer mode were marred by a rather evident lag. The Chaos Engine comes to Steam with virtually no changes from the 1993 original There is gold under the mud Although there are people enthusiastic about this ~new version~ of The Chaos Engine and clamoring for the release of more classics for the Amiga, our feeling is that Mastertronic's proposal does not go beyond the confines of a mere commercial operation, considering also an inappropriate selling price compared to the (little) work done. It is clearly a pity, because even a simple technical remastering of the Bitmap Brothers shooter would have been able to conquer us from the first moment, obviously provided that the style was in line with that (we reiterate: very recognizable) of the original and perhaps with some slight optimization of the gameplay. The game has in fact aged fairly well, still has a powerful degree of challenge compared to what we are currently used to, an excellent level design and an excellent upgrade system for the four characters, who must try to destroy a device (the Chaos Engine , in fact) which seems to have acquired its own will after its creation, projecting monsters and abominable creatures into the world, in the scenario of an alternative Victorian era, in which history and technology merge.", "date": "2013-09-11", "grade": "4.5"}
