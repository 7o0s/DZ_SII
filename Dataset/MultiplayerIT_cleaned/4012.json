Which is then titled Bardock: Alone Against Fate, but the Italian localization respects our historical adaptation, therefore we will find Bardock, Goku's father, in a short campaign that adapts the 1990 OAV, Dragon Ball Z: The origins of the myth, in the spectacular way of CyberConnect2. This means that we are dealing with a Bardock more ... bad, let's put it that way, than the one shown in the flashbacks of the recent Dragon Ball Super: Broly feature film. The news of the DLC The fights of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Bardock - Alone Against Fate are super spectacular The campaign, accessible from the usual special screen, begins with Bardak and his team of Saiyans who have just conquered another world on behalf of Freeza, while little Goku is born on planet Vegeta. Back at the base, Bardak and his men receive a new assignment: to exterminate the population of the planet Kanassa. The mission will set in motion a chain of events that will lead Bardak to make dramatic choices, but those who know Dragon Ball well should know this. First, however, there is a DLC to play, and in fact CyberConnect2, while telling an already known story, has extended it with gameplay moments that allow the player a minimum of freedom. It must be said that the DLC is decidedly well-designed: also offers some new maps of decent size, including that of the planet Vegeta. This is not a particularly vast or interactive scenario, on the contrary it is rather dull, but it does have some gems - such as the pub where the Saiyans gather - and the secondary activities to which the base game has accustomed us, such as fishing or training points . In this sense, Bardock - Alone Against Fate is a real miniature campaign, complete with side missions that bestow new Soul Emblems, consumables and resources, and which above all tell us something more about the protagonist's companions, who are more characterized here than in the animated short. The main story is completed in about an hour and a half, although it takes a little more to see everything and unlock every possible content, including a short but tasty mission after the credits. CyberConnect2 also tried an unusual approach, in terms of gameplay. The combat system remains the same as the base game with Bardak who, of course, has his own skills, to learn and enhance on the appropriate screen. In Alone Against Fate you can explore planet Vegeta A defining moment of this DLC are the hordes. It might seem like a dynamic designed only to lengthen the broth, but in reality there are two ways to make life easier. The first is to look for secondary objectives on the map: by participating in smaller engagements, it is possible to reduce the number of enemies to be taken down in the main combat of the campaign. The player can choose whether to test himself, and face an infinite number of enemies in a very long and also quite tedious battle, or get around the problem with this alternative solution. The Z Strike is also an unprecedented maneuver, available at various power levels, with which a fair amount of opponents can be annihilated in an instant: obviously it is designed to shorten battles that would end up being too long, but once again the player can choose whether to use it or not. In the end, these mechanics do not dramatically change the combat system and we begin to feel the need to rejuvenate the gameplay at least a little. The next gen version Bardock and his team of Saiyans in the Alone Against Fate DLC We played Alone Against Fate on PlayStation 5, taking advantage of the free upgrade from PlayStation 4. Apparently there were various problems with the same updates to the other next-gen platforms, but we have to admit we haven't encountered any: we simply re-downloaded the PlayStation 5 version of the game and agreed to transfer saves from the PlayStation 4 version. That said, it's not like the update radically changes the experience. We chose to play in Performance mode to enjoy the promised fluidity at 60 frames per second which makes fights much more engaging and spectacular, but in terms of performance we did notice some slowdowns in the most frenetic moments. Resolution is imperceptibly better; at most, you noteto a wider field of view and more environmental detail when flying high and fast. In this sense, in addition to the greater fluidity, the most substantial improvement certainly concerns the loadings, much faster.Update: a previous version of the article listed the hordes among the unpublished elements of the DLC.
