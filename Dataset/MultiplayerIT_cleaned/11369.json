{"name": "Iron Man - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/iron-man-recensione_a.html", "text": "Iron Man, who has always been the leading character of Marvel (playing a central role for at least a year now, just read the events narrated in ~Civil War~), now enjoys disproportionate popularity even among those who do not know the comic , thanks to the enormous success that his film is enjoying in cinemas around the world. Like many other superheroes, he has been the protagonist of a large number of video games (unfortunately not always of excellent quality), the first of which is probably the coin-op Captain America and the Avengers, a nice scrolling fighting game made by Data East in 1991 and converted for the consoles of the time. In 1996 it was the turn of Iron Man / X-O Manowar, a mediocre action game by Acclaim and released for PSone, while in 2002 Activision made The Invincible Iron Man for Game Boy Advance, a good platformer with shoot'em-up elements. The rest is recent history, with Marvel Nemesis: The Rise of the Imperfects and Marvel: The Great Alliance, both titles in which it was possible to control Iron Man in conjunction with other characters. From the movie to the Nintendo DS Anyone who has tried this Iron Man tie-in for any system will have realized that the underlying story is different from that of the film; in particular, characters and organizations that belong to the comic are mentioned and have not been translated to the big screen in any way. So the group of the Ten Rings does not appear, but the Maggia, and among its ranks we find some ~super criminals~ such as the Controller, Whiplash, etc. On Nintendo DS we find this same plot, which is told through images taken on the set of the film and speeches by Robert Downey Jr. himself, who participated in the making of the game and which we can hear on the Nintendo portable console in his original voice, subtitled in Italian. The similarities with the other versions of Iron Man stop here: the developers of the A2M team have thought of a completely different structure and gameplay for the DS version, which in fact presents itself as a shoot'em-up enriched by some sections Earth. The seven stages that we will face see us first escape from the captivity of the Afghan caves aboard the first prototype of the armor, then return home and build the definitive model, to then launch ourselves into a series of missions aimed at defeating the Maggia. The control system uses the touch screen to activate and direct the attack: by tapping the stylus in the desired direction, Iron Man will fire the repulsor beams accordingly. From the movie to the Nintendo DS The control system (which is not customizable, at most provides for the setting for left-handed people) uses the touch screen to activate and direct the attack: tapping the stylus in the desired direction, Iron Man will fire accordingly with the repulsor rays. You can also act on a numerical indicator located in the lower part of the lower screen, which starts the automatic sight of the homing missiles (when available), on the ~button~ assigned to loading the uniray or on the one that activates the electrical impulses of disturbance. Otherwise, the character moves using the d-pad and can accelerate his flight by holding down the left back button. The layout of the commands appears well organized and rational, the problem is that it is very inconvenient to operate the d-pad and the L back key at the same time, with the result that after a few tens of minutes you find yourself with stiff hands. At the end of each stage it is possible to upgrade different parts of the armor (with a ~drag & drop~ system), spending the points earned according to the number of enemies eliminated. You can therefore improve the repulsors (for power and speed), upgrade the missiles and unibeam, make the propulsion systems more efficient (to move faster while firing) or increase the resistance of the armor. Technical realization Graphically, Iron Man for Nintendo DS does not make a miracle cry. The character is quite spartan and devoid of details, it does not have a large set of animations and the visual effect of the reactors leaves something to be desired. The same can be said for the scenarios, which never shine for the quality of the design or for the quantity of interactable objects, which in the vast majority of cases are precisely the enemies we have to destroy. These are helicopters and armored vehicles of various kinds, or sometimes foot soldiers who, absurdly, prove to be more resistant than a battleship (we are referring to the ground sections). As far as the sound is concerned, there are voices that raise the average a bit but the rest is mediocre: anonymous and repetitive music, effects of frightening simplicity. The SThe control system, as already mentioned, appears to be organized with a certain rationality but does not lend itself to prolonged sessions nor does it guarantee who knows what precision: to hit enemies, it will always be necessary to combine movement with the d-pad with the touch of the stylus. Comment We are dealing with a different product compared to the other Iron Man tie-ins, but again not very well done: an uninspired shoot'em-up, in which we find ourselves extricating ourselves from dozens of volleys of bullets , colliding with an almost supernatural resistance of the enemies to our attacks. The situation improves a lot thanks to the good upgrade system, which can be accessed at the end of each stage, but the substance does not change much: the action is too repetitive, and the (bad) sections on the ground are not enough to revive it. It must also be said that to complete the game it is enough to dedicate a few hours to it, and that the ~Armed Man~ mode (organized, in this case, as a sort of ~survival~) has little or no effect on longevity. In short, a product devoid of bite, technically barely discreet and recommended only to fans of the character. Pros Rather ~strategic~ approach Good power-up system Well organized control system... Cons ...but far from comfortable, in the long run Too short and lacking depth Technically disappointing", "date": "2008-06-12", "grade": null}
