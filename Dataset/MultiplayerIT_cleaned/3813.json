{"name": "Far Cry: New Dawn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-new-dawn-recensione-sequel-far-cry-5.html", "text": "The review of Far Cry: New Dawn, a stand-alone expansion, a spin-off, a narrative sequel to Far Cry 5: let's say that all these definitions appear to be somewhat appropriate for the new Ubisoft production, which finally tells us what 'happened after the clash with Joseph Seed, when the insane charismatic leader of the Eden's Gate sect reduced Montana to a wasteland, poisoned by radiation, which only after seventeen years begins to breathe again. The survivors, led by Mr and Mrs Rye, emerge from the shelters and build new settlements, sharing resources and living in harmony, until violence breaks out again, brought this time by the terrible twins Mickey and Lou: supported by a real army, the Road Warriors. They will be our nemeses in the game's campaign. However, the character we will control is not the novice agent of the fifth chapter, but an unpublished protagonist (to be created using a simple editor at the beginning of the adventure), among Thomas Rush's most trusted men. A former military man, Rush travels around the United States on a train to bring aid to those in need, and is called to Hope County by Carmina Rye, the daughter of Nick and Kim, a smart girl who knows how to look after herself . However, the shipment is intercepted, recalling the incipit now traditional for the Far Cry series, in which we are forced to flee and get back on our feet and then organize the counterattack, free our fellow prisoners and eliminate the threat of the terrible sisters. Waiting for us, however, we will find a drastically changed scenario compared to what we remembered. The new Hope County The first steps in the eerie new Hope County are characterized by a sense of familiarity; after all, the gameplay mechanisms are the same that we appreciated in Far Cry 5, as well as weapon management, swimming, the use of the grappling hook and the collection of resources. Tackling the Road Warriors therefore appears to be an almost trivial undertaking at first, but the situation changes after some time, as soon as you become aware of the role-playing elements that the developers have introduced in New Dawn to differentiate the experience from the previous ones chapters, probably experiencing what the series will become in the future, following the same path taken by Assassin's Creed. The numbers therefore begin to appear that indicate the damage done with each blow, the vital energy bars of the enemies (which change according to their level, also marked by the type of opponent) and of course the statistics of the weapons, divided into four categories that are unlocked by growing our headquarters, Prosperity. It's a settlement that Kim Rye built almost on her own, attracting other survivors, but it needs our help to grow further. Therefore we will have to explore the map in search of components, ethanol and characters who can settle in this place to make it develop, gradually unlocking new sections and upgrading them. It is in this way that we will be able to access more powerful weapons, faster and more solid vehicles, disruptive explosives, more effective medical kits, maps for finding resources and the novelty represented by Expeditions. These are extra missions that go beyond the Hope County map and therefore take place within different scenarios, where we are transported by a helicopter with the task of recovering a special package and then fleeing. Relatively short but characterized by an increasingly higher degree of difficulty, these assignments are useful for collecting extra loot and it is possible to face them alone or in online cooperative with a friend, exactly like the main campaign. In a very similar way to the aforementioned Far Cry 5 however, the management of the game will not offer the same advantages to both participants: the host will progress, while his companion will provide his help for glory and little else. Map, characters, missions Far Cry: New Dawn's map measures roughly a third of that of the fifth chapter, but it also appears more empty and desolate, with less things to do and see. The dimensions are narratively justified by the presence of toxic clouds that permanently delimit the boundaries of the scenario, preventing us from crossing them. In any case, we are talking about a vast setting, capable of offering at least twenty hours of entertainment if one undertakes to complete both the main and secondary missions, for example by going in search of characters who can become part of our roster and therefore accompany and support us (only one at a time, however) during the expeditions.There is the aforementioned Carmina Rye, skilled with rifles and explosives, but also the dog Timber, who identifies and attacks her opponents, creating excellent diversions; or the shepherd Jerome with his shotgun, the mysterious and silent Judge with his infallible bow, the boar Horatio who can defeat enemies and the elderly but lethal sniper Nana. The group is completed by Gina Guerra (in the original ~War Gina~, yes), a fighter armed to the teeth, and Hurk, the latter crazy and foul-mouthed as always: in history the two form a couple and also had a son. Together with them we will have to deal with the main missions of a campaign in which our goal will be to eliminate the twins Mickey and Lou, unfortunately nemeses of little depth if we think of the four charismatic villains of the last episode. Without neglecting various secondary tasks, which include the conquest of ten outposts. These are bases controlled by the Road Warriors, which we will have to clean up from the hostile presence, thus also unlocking the fast travel to these destinations. However, to obtain a greater amount of ethanol and be able to upgrade Prosperity, we will be able to choose to loot them and make them fall under the control of the enemies again, and then try to win them back by overcoming higher level guards, therefore more difficult to eliminate. The gimmick of conquering and re-conquering outposts is useful for speeding up progression a bit, but a quick approach becomes impossible when the resources required for upgrades increase and therefore you have to spend some time exploring the map in search of treasures and anything else to be able to move forward. In these situations, Far Cry: New Dawn highlights a basic structural fragility which has consequences on the progress in the campaign: in fact, we will find ourselves in the presence of the final boss fight without having the skills to be able to overcome it, thus forcing us to carry out a little grinding and turn a blind eye to the many small distortions of a game design that is not perfectly focused. This aspect becomes evident in some missions that try to experiment with unprecedented situations, however colliding with the limits of a product born with different needs: the whole part of the arena highlights a melee combat system that is mediocre to say the least, the demolition derby is the paradise of approximation (just get out of the car and bazookate everyone to win), the stealth phases seem completely out of place compared to everything else. The RPG elements Far Cry: New Dawn uses an RPG approach that is found, as mentioned, in weapon management and gunplay in general. When we try to open fire against an opponent of a higher level than the tools in our possession, we will immediately discover that the shots are less effective and the battle will therefore be uphill. This is an understandable solution from a practical point of view, but one that requires a certain suspension of disbelief when, for example, we shoot a shotgun point-blank in the face of an elite-class enemy and tickle him. On the artificial intelligence front, the situation appears identical to that of Far Cry 5, with the Road Warriors adopting different behaviors also depending on the class: some charge with their heads down, others move, lurk, change position to catch us from surprise or even run away. Some issues with the hitboxes, especially against animals, end up debasing a setting that otherwise boasts aspects of consistency, such as the fact that it deals more damage when hitting the enemy's head. Unfortunately this type of interpretation does not enhance the combat system, on the contrary it makes it less satisfying than that of Far Cry 5, and this could cause some concern if we consider that it is in that direction that the series is inevitably moving. In this sense, the management of the traits, the skills that can be unlocked through the use of experience points earned in action, which appear all too traditional and not very multifaceted in their connotation, is emblematic. Once again, it is possible to increase the slots for weapons and ammunition, improve your breath to run longer, equip the wingsuit and the grappling hook, make the inventory for medical kits more capacious. At a certain point in the story, references to the tribal atmospheres to which fans of the series are accustomed appear, and which translate into additional skills that we do not want to reveal to you but which, in the end, do not change the scenario that much. Playstation 4 trophies Far Cry: New Dawn includes a total of 51 Trophies. Many of them can be obtained ssimply by completing the campaign, thus carrying out obligatory actions in terms of progression, but there are also more particular achievements, linked to the secondary missions and to the numerical factor: the creation of a certain number of medical kits, the discovery of some collectibles, the completing a certain amount of Expeditions, and so on. Graphics and sound Visually, Far Cry: New Dawn definitely has its place. Post-apocalyptic Hope County has turned pink, at night it is dominated by a sort of aurora borealis and by day caressed by winds that continuously raise dust from the streets. There are very suggestive panoramas and it is fascinating to find places and buildings that we had visited in the fifth chapter, discovering them in ruins, full of grass and vines which in the meantime have proliferated on the walls. Even the fauna has been influenced by the nuclear apocalypse, although without displaying disturbing hybridisations, while the look of the Road Warriors clearly refers to the imagery of Mad Max, between red-crested punks and protections for motorcyclists used as armor: yes it ranges from simple soldiers with pistols and bandanas to units with machine guns and light armor, passing through fighters equipped with a shield and those in full armor, very difficult to take down. The design of the weapons follows the same philosophy, with makeshift tools, assembled somewhat at random, which however provide the usual, wide variety of choices between clubs, rifles, bows, rocket launchers, machine guns and so on. The support for HDR contributes once again to enhancing the daytime sequences, rendering the effects of sunlight well, but in the evening the glance loses something and flying in a helicopter there are still pop-up problems over the distance it concerns the shaders that cover the surfaces. The cutscenes use higher quality polygonal models as usual, really very beautiful, and the detachment from the in-game action is inevitably marked. On PlayStation 4 Pro the game seems to run better than Far Cry 5 did in its debut, with a frame rate more steadily close to 30 frames and few uncertainties. The music of the original soundtrack accompanies the phases of the campaign in an effective but essential way; there are traditional radios in the vehicles (fortunately, however, they can be deactivated) and the Italian dubbing seemed excellent to us, well interpreted, net of some moments of excessive emphasis in combat.", "date": "2019-02-14", "grade": "7.8"}
