{"name": "Beam Breakers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beam-breakers.html", "text": "Be respected in New York. Set in the futuristic city of Neo York (oh my God, what a name... ), the game offers us a good amount of missions, grouped under various ~chapters~ and which can only be unlocked in sequence. In the first part, we will have to distribute pizzas at home, but in the usual, inevitable, obnoxious time limit. Once the first tasks, necessary for our apprenticeship, have been carried out, we will be able to begin tackling already more demanding missions and make our name known in the criminal circles of the city. Clearly inspired by titles such as Mafia and GTA, this game mode present in Beam Breakers combines a minimum of plot with a certain variety of action and the possibility of making a certain career in criminal environments certainly makes the gameplay more varied and interesting. Naturally, we will soon get to know the local police, which will be one of the biggest obstacles we will find along our raids. Obviously we will be able to get help from the inevitable power ups, that is the classic Turbo, the Repair Kit and so on, not to mention the possibility of adding upgrades to our car as we continue on our adventures. Look before you strike. An interesting game mode (even if it's not a real game) is the one called ~Observation~ which allows us to move around the various game areas and observe them to get a clearer idea of how they are made. Going on a crazy run or a reckless mission without knowing the streets of the neighborhood is one of the surest ways to lose the game. Naturally, this is a good opportunity to admire the level of detail with which the various parts of the city have been built. Certainly New York does not shine for variety of scenarios, given that the tower blocks are all the same and little more than simple colored boxes, however it is teeming with a primitive form of digital life, enlivened by the lively splashes of color that wink from signs and billboards. In short, taking a walk around the streets of New York in observation mode is a relaxing alternative to the usual game modes based on racing, fighting and looting. Super Truzzo Grand Prix As already mentioned, in addition to the ~Mission~ mode, there is the more classic one, namely the Championship. Here we will have to win a series of races to get increasingly consistent prizes and unlock new cars and new circuits. In short, nothing new under the sun. But being able to compete suspended from the ground and darting between vehicles that walk in the opposite direction offers a good dose of adrenaline and an exciting high-speed pastime. At the end of each race we will get a score and it won't be necessary to finish first to be able to continue the championship, as victory is calculated on points. Certainly, this is an interesting game mode, but in my opinion secondary to the mission mode, where there is a real career to go. In the gravitational suspension car of the future, the truzzone on duty cannot be missing with the music blasting at all times and in fact the music of the game is clearly inspired by the city tamarro model with the rigged car and will pump rhythmic pounding into our speakers electronic music to be listened strictly with the window down. The Engine of the Future is Slow. The game's 3D engine manages to display a large amount of polygons and textures on our monitors, as well as handling the numerous light sources and reflection effects quite well, however, at maximum detail, it also proved to be heavy on a PC equipped with AthlonXP 1700 with 512MB of Ram and a nice GeForce 3. The fluidity has never dropped below disastrous levels, still allowing a good playability, but the feeling of speed has gone to hell together with the frame rate. The end result is comparable to a quiet Sunday stroll in the city. In order to enjoy greater fluidity we will be forced to drastically reduce the detail, but even with all the parameters at a minimum, the sensation of speed is always rather weak. Comment Beam Breakers uses an innovative idea, effectively offering two games in one, which is undoubtedly worthy of praise. The problem, however, is that there is always the clear feeling that both modes are rather incomplete, in the sense that something is missing, missing more details, more options or perhaps greater homogeneity within the whole game. Fortunately, this is not a major flaw and therefore the gIoco is not markedly affected. What disturbs the most, however, is a kind of monotony in the style of play, also aggravated by the repetitiveness of the urban scenarios, which all seem the same in the end. Playing the missions, however, gives a certain amount of challenge and will certainly stimulate us more to move forward, especially by virtue of the story present. Making a career and becoming the new boss of the city is certainly the winning idea of the whole game, while the championship fades into the background, becoming a pleasant diversion. Unfortunately, this does not mean that the longevity of the product is increased, since the major limits of the game are precisely its repetitiveness and the poor sensation of speed in the race, two things that certainly penalize the player's interest curve. Comment Pros Two complementary game modes It is undoubtedly fun to throw yourself against the direction of a very busy street and make evolutions between the buildings and the suspended pedestrian crossings The championship is a good pastime, once the missions are over The urban scenarios are rich in detail , colors and effects Cons Both game modes seem a little superficial The missions and races get boring after a while The scenarios are very detailed but lack variety and in the end you get bored wandering around neighborhoods that are practically similar a bit of all Fluidity is always low and the sensation of speed is almost absent A world in the clouds. In the world of Beam Breakers we live at high altitudes, the buildings are connected by scaffolding and suspended structures for the usual pedestrian traffic, and the cars fly in orderly rows at different heights. Do you remember The Fifth Element? Well, air traffic is directly inspired by that model. But the game soon distances itself from it, otherwise it would be just a clone of that New York Race derived directly from the film, and thus combines elements of different games. Surely Beam Breakers is not the usual racing game, because if, on the one hand, we will be able to choose to face the Championship mode, on the other we will have to complete real missions, in the pay of unscrupulous little criminals and powerful bosses of the underworld. But let's proceed with the usual order...", "date": "2003-02-10", "grade": null}
