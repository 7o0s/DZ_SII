A question with a difficult answer, brought into vogue by the return of Dragon's Dogma which, after more than five years from its launch on the old generation of consoles and a re-release on PC, is making a comeback on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, ready to be appreciated by all those players who missed it or, even worse, underestimated it in the past. Dragon's Dogma is in fact a peculiar game with a thousand interesting facets and with mechanics that defining innovative and stimulating is at least an understatement. Our review had awarded it with a nice 8.5, underlining its many merits and few defects, however suggesting that at the time compromises had been made that affected its overall enjoyment. Today we return to these pages to talk about Dark Arisen, the most complete version of Dragon's Dogma polished for landing on next gen consoles. Endless dragons A small summary of the previous episodes for those who do not want to click on the link we have provided: Dragon's Dogma puts you in the shoes of a valiant fighter whose heart was literally torn from his chest by an evil dragon. Instead of dying, however, you will become a powerful Arisen, you will swear to recover the stolen goods and to end the life of the lizard by launching yourself into a new adventure. A story that mixes western fantasy with an oriental narrative, with characters born from Japanese ink intent on fighting the most imposing creatures you can imagine. The story of Dragon's Dogma is quite interesting even if not exactly the strong point of the entire gaming experience. Capcom's epic transports you across the realm as you slay monsters left and right literally filling you with things to do. The open world is managed very well and even the old mobility problems (when the game was released the teleporters basically didn't exist) were then filed with the Dark Arisen expansion, which you will find included in the package. In case you decide to buy or re-purchase this edition too, you will have a title in your hands that will be able to keep you busy for dozens and dozens of hours without ever getting bored and which - unlike similar games - will be able to reward you with highly adrenaline-pumping and exciting battles. In fact, we told you that combat is the true soul of Dragon's Dogma and in this version (unfortunately still stopped at thirty frames per second) you will come across some of the most interesting fantasy duels of recent years, perhaps not as technical as those of Dark Souls but certainly spectacular to see. Weapons in hand and a new way to play If the melee classes behave in a very similar way to those seen in most action RPGs, it is the combinations between the various members of the group that make things more profound. In fact, your Arisen will be able to recruit pawns to join the party, non-player characters of different classes and levels who will help the player by blindly carrying out the orders given. You can thus ask the mages to target a specific target or provide you with elemental shields or, why not, to merge your attacks with theirs to create devastating combos. This is how a fire mage can ignite the blades of an assassin ready to leap from a warrior's shield, so as to land on the back of a swooping griffin and strike savagely as it tries to hang on. Elemental damage is not only aesthetic but also actively affects the physics of the fights. Set fire to a beast's feathered wings and it will plummet to the ground, giving your melee combatants time to wound it, or blind a cyclops with an arrow to make it fight furiously without it being able to see you. The Capcom developers have put many such features into this title and only by playing and deepening your knowledge with the production can you really understand how much work is behind it. Dark Arisen also adds new sets of weapons and armor, new types of monsters and even a collaboration with Kentaro Miura thanks to which some iconic elements of the Berserk series have been implemented, such as the White Hawk set and many other goodies that we do not want to reveal to you . The pawns we were talking about before are not simple dazed non-player characters but real sponges of information. Take a warrior with you frequently and he will learn how to fight certain enemies, what elements to use and even suggest the perfect tactics for you.to get the better of it quickly. Yes, because while you're offline your pawns can be recruited online by your friends or other players and thus continue to accumulate experience: it's just a pity that in all this there is no cooperative mode, which would have made the players happy and exponentially increased the value of the production. Playstation 4 trophies Compared to the basic version, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen comes with a higher amount of trophies and achievements. Some will be completed by following the main campaign while others will force you to complete the expansion's additional content and kill the most dangerous enemies. The trophies linked to the secondary quests are also various and challenging, with the return of the objective dedicated to the speed run designed only for the most experienced players. Level Up We will not go further into the detail of the game mechanics, given that Dragon's Dogma has already been carrying five years on his shoulders and we have discussed it extensively previously, but we can easily go into the technical details, partly inherited from the PC version. The first, huge positive element is the complete removal of the annoying black bars that dampened the beauty of the image on the older generation of consoles, now leaving us to enjoy a well-crafted and very pleasant to admire game world. The day / night cycle is improved, embellished as it is by a completely revisited and much more credible lighting system. Obviously, the textures also return to high resolution and we are a little sorry that the 60 FPS were not achieved in a context like this, where the action is always frenetic. Of course, we prefer stability to speed, but it must be said that with other remasters the work has been much more generous and given the resolution and the general quality of the production, in our opinion, we could have gotten there with a little further effort. In short, the 30 frames per second were justified and justifiable on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but today it would have been reasonable to expect an extra step in this case. Instead, the tearing, a big problem of the old editions, has been definitively eliminated. Finally, we close with a consideration on the graphic work carried out on this remaster which did not touch the animations and expressiveness of the faces, leaving them several steps below the movements and the undisputed quality of the enormous monsters that you will find in front of you and thus maintaining that difference in level also present in the previous versions.", "date": "2017-10-02", "grade": "8.0"}
