We saw it with Spyro the Dragon and with the Crash Bandicoot collection, perhaps just to refresh the affection before the arrival of the new chapter, and now it's up to THQ Nordic to dust off the best platformer starring Spongebob. Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom is perhaps not one of the most memorable titles to bring back, but it is certainly one of those productions made with love and determined to demonstrate that even licensed games can be able to show off so much quality. The original game was distinguished by the classic humor of the cartoon, for a truly huge world to explore and for a not exactly easy challenge to complete. We therefore expected these elements from this new version called Rehydrated, but there were also some additional surprises. Are you ready guys? Yes, Mr. Captain! So here is our review of SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated. Back to Bikini Bottom! The story slavishly retraces that of the previous version and sees Plankton inadvertently creating an army of disobedient robots, ready to set Bikini Bottom on fire. Spongebob and Patrick, with the help of Sandy, will have the task of fixing things by defeating enemies and trying to return the situation to the peaceful normality of always. A trivial story but which hides funny jokes and sketches as usual, in perfect line with what was seen in the animated series. The addition of the original voice actors, also in Italian, makes everything even more interesting for a loyalty to be promoted from all points of view. One could perhaps turn up one's nose at the graphic rendering, veering more towards the 3D of Spongebob film productions in stark contrast to the cel shading cartoon often used by similar products, but here we are merely talking about personal tastes. What cannot be put on the level of personal evaluation is obviously the gameplay, from which we expected a lot given the excellent work done on the first version of the game. Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom is a three-dimensional platformer where exploration and combat are mixed in equal measure with a difficulty curve capable of quickly climbing to unexpected heights. Unfortunately in this remake the fluidity of the controls and the management of the camera are not up to the memories, often making the underlying platforms lose sight of or making it difficult to walk close to the walls, with the view going crazy behind the protagonists' backs. It rarely happens but they are problems that shouldn't really exist in a game like this, especially given the quality achieved by the other competing titles. In general, the speed of action has increased both for what concerns the movements and for some slide sections, now even more complex and adrenaline-pumping. In any case, the game works very well and could still be easily appreciated by all the old fans of the original Bikini Bottom, perhaps able to overlook the small inaccuracies. To increase the value of the package we then think about the addition of some cut levels and also a multiplayer mode with hordes that is not particularly original but which can easily give you a few moments of extra fun. What if I've never played it before? Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated brings a good variety and while it does not represent the non plus ultra of three-dimensional platformers it is still a title to consider if you love the genre, even if the original is right off your radar. The colors are vibrant and bright and the game mechanics will often require you to use gray matter to get to the bottom of the more complex stages. The triptych of characters that you are going to use also plays a fundamental role for the exploration of the levels with particular abilities linked to the individual protagonists thanks to which you can unlock new secret areas and collect additional golden spatulas and Patrick's socks, the main collectibles and engine of this production. In fact, defeating the numerous end-of-level bosses is only the tip of the iceberg since it is precisely the discovery of every single hidden ravine that brings the greatest joys and satisfactions. You can spend dozens of hours on it before feeling full, for an overall longevity that is therefore more than good. Being torn from the past, however,Rehydrated brings with it some features that have now disappeared such as checkpoint saves for levels and respawn points that are not always properly calibrated, will you be able to get over it?", "date": "2020-06-22", "grade": "7.0"}
