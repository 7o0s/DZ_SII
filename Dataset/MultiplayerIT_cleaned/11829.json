The answer is ~no~, at least for the moment, even if it is undeniable that the world of wireless gaming has made great strides in recent years, realizing things that were previously considered unfeasible. The genre of football simulations is precisely part of that type of product that we would never have expected to see on our phone, but which is already experiencing a period of experimentation that will lead to the inevitable refinement of the technical solutions used. The biggest challenge, in this sense, is not so much convincingly representing twelve players on a field while they play football, because by now we are used to even more important achievements. No, the challenge is to make football on mobile phones playable and fun despite the fact that the various terminals are mostly equipped with input systems that don't lend themselves well to playful applications. When starting up, 2007 World Soccer offers us the possibility of following an essential tutorial to familiarize ourselves with its particular control system. We will therefore learn to move the players on the pitch, to make quick shots, to pass the ball, to win it back and to shoot on goal. Once ready, we will be able to try our hand at the classic quick game or access a large number of cups, tournaments and various competitions for a total of five game modes. The squads at our disposal range from sixty-four national teams, but we are also given the possibility of creating a team from scratch and we will have a fair amount of control over how the players will be deployed on the pitch. In any case, after the kick-off we won't be able to distinguish between one module and another, it will be so challenging to take possession of the ball and be able to avoid the markings to get to the conclusion. It is precisely during the action, in fact, that the game shows what is its greatest limitation, namely the setting of the three-quarter view and the obligation to use the diagonals to run ~straight~. Even if you are the lucky owner of a phone equipped with a good quality joystick, in fact, you will know that setting the diagonals is still a big problem, which is usually solved using the numeric pad and pressing two keys simultaneously. Choosing this solution, however, how can you press the FIRE (or 5) button to shoot or pass? So the only way to play is by using the joystick in the four main directions, thus proceeding ~ladder~ towards the opposing area. To pass a marking we will necessarily have to resort to dribbling (asterisk key), which we will also end up abusing: without resorting to it, we won't go more than a few meters with the ball at our feet. Once you are close to the goal, a bar will appear with an indicator swinging inside, which determines the direction of the shot as soon as we press the relevant button: guessing the right side can result in a goal, even if goalkeepers in general are not crooks. The technical realization of 2007 World Soccer is quite good: the players boast a certain number of animations and a good fluidity in their movements, furthermore the speed of the run is well related to the distance covered on the field, therefore without annoying ~slide~ effects. There is no characterization that makes them similar to their real counterparts, but it is generally difficult to distinguish one player from another while the action is taking place and therefore the problem does not arise. Instead, the problem of the isometric view arises, which on an aesthetic level produces good results but which does absolutely nothing to meet a control system that cannot ignore its obvious limitations. As for the sound, we have a good quality MIDI theme music and a series of sampled effects that accompany the progress of the game. PRO Technically well done A good number of modes Some guessed solutions AGAINST It can be very cumbersome Limited gameplay Multiplayer is missing", "date": "2007-11-15", "grade": "S.V."}
