{"name": "Wild ARMs 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wild-arms-3.html", "text": "Wild Wild West As with the prequels, Wild ARMs 3 also begins in a rather bizarre way, and the protagonists of our adventure experience four separate prologues which, however, intertwine in the actual explosive incipit of the plot. Virginia Maxwell is a young and fierce Drifter (a kind of mercenary) with a great desire for freedom and adventure, hoping to meet her father again, who left as a Drifter shortly after her mother's death; also Jet Enduro is a cynical and serious Drifter specialized in the recovery of ancient treasures, and mysteriously does not remember anything of his childhood; Clive Winslet is a bounty hunter, wise and calculating, reckless and selfless; Gallows Carradine, on the other hand, is a sort of priest of the Baskar clan, a tribe that venerates the cult of the Guardians, legendary entities with enormous powers. The four meet practically by chance on a running train where an ancient artifact seems to be kept... And from that moment an incredible journey begins that will lead our ~heroes~ to discover incredible secrets about the world of Filgaia. Why did the planet, once green and luxuriant (Wild ARMs) slowly decay, turning into a conglomeration of rocks and arid grasslands, divided by the Sea of Sands, a boundless desert that took the place of water? And why doesn't anyone remember exactly when this all started? Why did the Guardians entrust Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows with the mission of discovering the origin of the evils afflicting Filgaia, and what does this diverse group have in common? And who are the Prophets, the three shady individuals plotting in the shadows for the rebirth of Filgaia? Many questions to find an answer, in a breathtaking plot, between shootings, escapes on horseback, flying dragons, incandescent sands, ancient temples and existential crises, Virginia and associates will have to face an adventure that will put themselves and the fate of the world... and if old enemies like the Metal Demons get in the way, the trouble couldn't be more serious! High Noon Wild ARMs 3 brings together the best of the entire series, turning into a constant self-quotation of the 32bit prequels. The predominant feature of the entire series has always been the intelligent structuring of the dungeons, linked to the skills possessed by the characters: each of them, in fact, will obtain from time to time during the game some ~tools, for a maximum of three each , with various functions, indispensable for solving the ingenious puzzles devised by Sony. For example, one of Virginia's tools allows her to throw incendiary cards to light torches; Jet, on the other hand, can use her boomerang to hit distant objects; Gallows has his is a doll capable of firing a freezing ray with opposite functions compared to the aforementioned tool of the beautiful team leader; and again, Clive can deposit time bombs, with devastating effects. These are just the main tools with which the characters begin the adventure, and we leave you the pleasure of discovering the others and their functions.The fact is that knowing the tools in your possession and knowing how to use them at the right time is necessary for the game, given that the dungeons are literally covered with puzzles to resolve to proceed with the exploration. The exploration of the dungeons, however, is linked to the innovative management of the evil routine of random fights, also present in Wild ARMs 3, to the great chagrin of experienced RPG players, who by now will have fought tens of thousands; however, Sony has created the Encounter Gage: in essence, if a random fight occurs, an exclamation point will appear over the player's head and at that point, by pressing a button, it will be possible to avoid the fight. This action, however, will consume part of the Encounter Gage, which will be recharged by collecting special crystals scattered around the dungeons or by fighting; Needless to say, as you progress through the game your Encounter Gage will increase as will the amount of points needed to avoid stronger enemies. This system adds a strong strategic factor to the tedious routine of random fights, which is very welcome and functional. Speaking of which, we might as well talk about the fights right away. First, the first difference from the prequels is the presence of four characters on the battlefield instead of three; and as if that weren't enough, Sony has totally revolutionized the team of protagonists itself: whoever played the prequels will remember the explicit difference between the characters, as both in the first and second trio of protagonists of the two Wild ARMs for PSX there was a warrior, a sorceress and a manipulator of ARMs. Now, however, all peCharacters can use the ARMs, acronym of Ancient Relic Machines... that is, very powerful firearms; Virginia uses a pair of colts, Jet a machine gun, Gallows uses a shotgun and Clive a sniper rifle: the difference between the weapons is also linked to their power and combat quality, so while Clive's rifle is extremely accurate powerful, Jet's machine gun instead causes frightening damage but hits with less precision, and to make matters worse, while the first has a limited number of bullets by default, the second instead has many more (yes, in Wild ARMs 3 weapons must be reloaded in combat by simply selecting the pose in defense). It is however possible, in special rooms, to upgrade the characteristics of the weapons for a fee, in order to personalize one's war strategy as much as possible. And not only does the possibility of customizing the Wild ARMs 3 team stop at this. In fact, from the early stages of the game, the four protagonists will come into possession of the Mediums, magical relics that preserve the arcane essence of the guardians; each Medium can be assigned to a character of your choice with the possibility of changing it at any time, and consequently each Medium guarantees an ever-changing series of numerical advantages and disadvantages on the characteristics of the character to whom it is entrusted; moreover, each Medium enables a series of personal skills, from immunity to certain anomalous statuses to automatic reloading of ammunition, and which can be activated and possibly enhanced by using the appropriate Skill Points (note that, here too, it is possible to customize the Mediums you were applying up to five extra skills each); moreover, the possession of a Medium gives the characters the possibility of casting spells, called Arcana. It goes without saying that each Medium has a set of different spells, and it is up to the player to decide which character is more suited to using one Medium or another (which, moreover, can be equipped in a maximum of three each, for a total of twelve Medium). Okay, so we have ARMs and Arcana but how, exactly, do you use these options in battle? It's actually very simple. First of all, it must be said that the combat system of Wild ARMs 3, following that of the prequels, is far from the real-time of Star Ocean 3 or from the ATB of Final Fantasy, and much closer to that of Suikoden 3: in other words , at the beginning of a turn, you assign the various actions for each character, and then you become a spectator of the sequence in which our heroes and enemies attack each other. At this point, the Force Gauge comes into play, an indicator whose value increases during combat, by attacking and defending oneself: each Arcana, in fact, requires a certain amount of Force to be launched; moreover, the Force Gauge is divided into four levels, each of which corresponds to a sort of super-attack, for a total of four Force Abilities per character (among which the possibility of summoning one of the Guardians of which one has the medium). In short, Wild ARMs 3 presents a battle system that perfectly reconciles a hackneyed clash management system with several innovations and touches of class, which make each fight decidedly engaging, whether you fight ~on foot~ (in most cases) and on board the two vehicles that you will acquire during the game, where instead the combat will take on the strategic setting already appreciated in the naval battles of Skies of Arcadia, and of which nothing is anticipated so as not to spoil some pleasant surprises... For a handful of polygons Now let's move on to the technical aspect of Sony's JRPG. It is right to start talking about the graphic aspect by quoting one of the nicest ideas conceived by the developers: every time the game is loaded, in fact, it will be possible to admire a very high quality cartoon sequence which, accompanied by a splendid song, shows a roundup of characters and events in the game... and which changes, in part, every time a new ~chapter~ of the long plot opens: a simple but highly effective idea. The game itself, on the other hand, features the now much abused cel-shaded graphics, but it does so with great class: the three-dimensional models are extremely defined and composed of a generous amount of polygons, both in the case of the protagonists and the enemies, animated both excellently. Similarly, the creative team has created a series of environments of the highest quality: varied, detailed and extremely convincing, full of touches of class, be they dungeons or cities, and rotatable iaround an imaginary vertical axis to allow the player to keep an eye on any indispensable element for playful purposes and to admire them in detail; less convincing, however, the textures: in an attempt to give the idea of a coloring by hand (with a pencil, to be precise) Sony has managed to bring the aesthetics of Wild ARMs 3 closer to that of a cartoon, however producing a inconsistent and sometimes mediocre texturing. Visually, however, Wild ARMs gives its best in combat, between extremely spectacular light effects, particles and dynamic rotations of the camera, especially in cases where the combat takes place, for example, on horseback, when the fight takes place running and at full speed. speed. To embellish the exceptional technical sector of Wild ARMs 3 there is a soundtrack which, as per tradition, proves to be nothing short of superlative: most of the musical tracks imitate the classic western songs by Sergio Leone, occasionally moving away from this trend to delight the player's ears with a capella choirs or vaguely horrorific songs (especially in moments of high emotional tension); the quality of the sung main theme ~Advance Wind~ is also exceptional, a remix of the introductory music of the prequels, which for once is more in English than in Japanese, and which in the whistled alternative version, a classic of the Wild ARMs series, is a small artwork. In such a complete and high quality sound background, however, the absence of vocalizations of any kind clashes, a real shame. Comment Wild ARMs 3, in a certain sense, makes up for the now confirmed absence of the exceptional Suikoden III in the PAL toy library of PlayStation2. The plot, although not entirely original, is compelling and intriguing; the game system, despite being proposed for the third time now, is still engaging and profound; and the combat system, despite knowing that it has already been seen, is varied and fun. It is therefore clear that Wild ARMs 3 has strengths and weaknesses on its side, condensed in the eternal struggle between the ~old~ and the ~new~: Wild ARMs 3 is in a certain sense an ~old~ game, but which Sony has seasoned with so many innovations, especially at a structural level (such as the very deep customization of characters and weapons), as to make it a must-buy for fans of the genre and an excellent title for those who, on the other hand, do not particularly like JRPGs. After all, even the technical quality is, as the Yankees would say, ~top-notch~, very high, in short, if it weren't for those unstable textures... But Wild ARMs 3 deserves another important consideration, relating to its longevity . The main plot can be completed in about forty hours, a fair duration after all for a JRPG, but the playful experience is enhanced by a truly exceptional quantity and variety of subquests and mini-games: after the half-hearted disappointment represented by the secret bonuses of Final Fantasy X (which eventually condense into an endless series of very unbalanced bosses), Wild ARMs 3 offers everything and more, from a puzzle-game divided into twenty parts and scattered around the world to a gardening mini-game , from a secret quest unrelated to the main plot concerning the alien invasion of the Kontons (!!!) in search of some hidden items and so on. The classic hundred-storey dungeon and the hidden bosses of immense power are also not missing. Fortunately, these extras are not ends in themselves, as they reward the player with a series of ~keys~ necessary to unlock some secret options at the end of the game... In short, Wild ARMs 3 has the advantage of committing the player to a very long time, and in the best way: having fun. And that's enough. Pros Extremely deep game system Great play variety Excellent soundtrack Lots of extras Cons Graphics ups and downs It's all a bit already seen Nowadays, PlayStation has become synonymous with Role Playing Game, especially of the Japanese type. Years ago it was SNES that dominated unchallenged in this field, and it is no coincidence that the most famous sagas were born and found greater prosperity on the 16bit Nintendo (Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, to name two). For a strange twist of fate now, however, the word JRPG immediately brings to mind the Sony console, which can boast in its toy library among the best exponents of the genre. Still, it might surprise the fact that the first years of life of the PlayStation (at least until the boom generated by Final Fantasy VII) weren't so ~pink and flowery~ in the JRPG field: in addition to Arc the Lad II, destined to remain confined in Japan alongside the prequel and sequel for another six years, the only title worth playing in the West (oh well,", "date": "2003-02-28", "grade": null}
