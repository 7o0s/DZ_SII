{"name": "Indycar Series", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/indycar-series.html", "text": "But do you need a driving license to run? And to run in circles? The game has all the official licenses of the case, from those of the league that manages the Indianapolis (IRL) events to the brand of the actual Motor Speedway of the city of the same name. This doesn't mean we're faced with a perfect game, but if nothing else it's a good start (if someone invests us in sponsors maybe there's a reason, it's as good as my grandmother's universal inferences, but let that be enough). From the first moment, however, the game gave me the impression of being a bit botched at best, trivial and vaguely sparse fmv intro, usual very tight pseudo-trash soundtrack and stands crowded with people who rejoice to see crazy splinters whipping at 230mph going round and round. The first options you are faced with as soon as you browse the game menu are the most traditional for any self-respecting driving game. In fact, we are given the possibility of doing an independent lap on a track of our choice, taking part in a race complete with initial qualifiers and all the rest, or doing it for the whole racing season, up to the last lap. One of the options that I found most interesting, as a total ignoramus of Indy Formula which I am, is the so-called Masterclass: an option that allows us to follow a series of well-crafted tutorials that explain how to drive and how to respect the rules imposed by the Indianapolis Racing League. in order to then avoid nasty surprises in the race (like the black flags, which I am getting full throttle now). ~Easy left!~... hey they're all like that! Obviously, as expected, it is possible to create one's own identity which will be associated with ~skillcards~, these cards will be filled in automatically in case of qualification in the various races and can then be used to unlock special features in the game, needless to say that I am Wrong person to tell you what bonuses you might get, I don't think I'll be able to qualify decently in a million years, but maybe I should stop running the wrong way? Otherwise, in some types of competition, you can step into the sweaty shoes of some famous oval racer and try to see how a great driver would drive if they suddenly gave him a surprise frontal lobotomy at least in my case it happens like this. ~Easy left!~... hey they're all like that! Entering the track in ~easy~ mode is nice but not for everyone: the car practically drives itself, enters and exits the pits when it wants and basically you just have to hold down the arrow to the left of the cursors all the time. From ~normal~ mode upwards, the simulation begins to shine through, with tires that need to be changed as needed, fuel that is not infinite, and aerodynamics compromised since the last time you set out to plow the lawn with your single-seater. With the keyboard it is not the best, it should be played with a steering wheel, this is obvious, but it seemed to me, all in all, quite balanced between ease (read: ~arcade~) and simulation depth (read: ~I plow the lawn~) and therefore also with the old ~centoduetasti~ it is possible to obtain some appreciable results and the breakthrough of the left cursor. There's a moschino on my windshield. Graphically, the product looks pretty good apart from the meager and difficult to navigate menus at times. The tracks are all a bit the same and the public is made up of shapeless colored shapes that jump in the stands of the grandstands. The animated scenes are ugly and tend to click here and there, but the cars on the other hand are rendered extremely well in detail, furthermore on the track the sensation of speed is rendered absolutely effectively by the graphics engine, thanks also to the frame rate which is always on medium-high values even in agitated situations. The soundtrack of the game is decidedly heavy, it is very comfortable and sounds very ~Days of Thunder~, but in the long run and hard-core pilots they will immediately deactivate it because it will prevent them from hearing the engine variations and the useful comments in Italian of the staff trackside, who often warns us of accidents on the track and informs us of any problems with our car, not counting the comments on our laps (in my case I didn't hear anything... why?). For the rest, the audio is all a hum of the engine and screeching tires, in short, nothing more or less than what one could ask for from a game like this, so thumbs up for this sector too. There's a moschino on my windshield. SiteTo be honest, I was amazed at the complete lack of a replay mode. In short, one of the things that made the Papyrus game great fourteen years ago was precisely the possibility of seeing the disastrous accidents produced by the player in the usual counter-hand kamikaze maneuver, against the leading group (don't be indignant, I know you did all over and over again). Maybe it's among the optionals that can be unlocked by winning competitions and therefore I'll never see, but I wouldn't be so sure... a real shame. Also another big absent is the multiplayer mode, which is not unusual for a simulator, but given the times definitely a step backwards in any case. Conclusion And we have come to the advice for purchases as expected, I tested the game on my trusty AMD 2200+ with 512 mb of ram 2100, ati radeon 9700 and first generation audigy and I must say I had no problem setting everything the detail to the maximum and adding anti-aliasing filter at 4x and anisotropic always at 4x. Consequently, I believe that any mid-range PC should be able to handle this game without too many problems. It runs smoothly and lets you play fairly well, in my opinion it could fit perfectly for Indy formula lovers and for all those who can't help but collect every single racing game on the market (in fact not many, lately ). The others know what it is: a decent simulator, with several elements of healthy arcade made more than discreetly, but perhaps, here in Italy, penalized by a subject that is not too popular. If you don't suffer from motion sickness and traveling two hundred laps on a track shaped like an Easter egg doesn't scare you, know that this is a good Formula Indy game. Pros: Playable at any level Not expensive in hardware requirements Variety of game modes Cons: Runs in circles ... always ... Some ~professionals~ of the guide may not find it exhaustive No replays or multiplayer Round ovoids. Sometimes I still think about how life can be exciting and full of surprises, other times I think about how flat and mundane it is, and still other times how mockingly cruel and sarcastic it is. Putting a man in front of his worst nightmare is an act of vile cruelty, putting a poor editor in front of his most remote and buried fears in the subconscious, for the pure sadistic taste of seeing him writhe in excruciating suffering is pure heinous violence. Well yes: they gave me a driving game to review... it's a Formula Indy game... only by now half of you should have already passed out from fear like I did. Formula Indy was born from the famous race that was held since before the Second World War in the charming industrial city of Indianapolis, the race that bore the name of ~The Indianapolis 500~ consisted of an infinite series of laps around an oval circuit : a criminal attempt by the organization to make the pilots pass out from nausea in order to procure the spectacular accidents that have always distinguished this category of racing and which create, for the American public, the only actual interesting detail. Just to name a famous name, but in truth a driver who has now won everything there was to win, Mario Andretti has a bulletin board full of trophies and figurines won on the Indy 500. And then how can we forget the guys from Papyrus and their Indianapolis 500, which came out for PC way back in 1989 and which at the time amazed everyone with its graphics, simulation depth and playability. Those were good times and doing 200 laps on an oval could even seem like fun, at least until you found yourself downing a whole box of antiemetics. Today, after a series of experiments ended up in the closet for having sold two copies despite the significant increase in the sale of anti-nausea drugs, Codemasters tries again with this Indycar Series, developed by BraininaJar and we'll see how it went.", "date": "2003-10-20", "grade": null}
