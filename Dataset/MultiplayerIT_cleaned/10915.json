In short, if you can have characters who already enjoy their own popularity, why not take advantage of it? It is clear that behind such an idea the mere need to monetize can be hidden, yet there are pleasant surprises: so far Sonic has performed fairly well on Java-compatible devices, offering glimpses of gameplay capable of surviving the terrible ergonomics of most of the d-pads and joysticks that modern cell phones are equipped with. The spin-off Sonic Jump has even offered a welcome variation on the theme, shifting the emphasis of the action from running to mere jumping, organizing the stages a bit as if they were puzzles to be solved. Well, what can we expect from Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Crash!...? The first impact with the game, needless to deny it, is not the best: the start menu offers us the possibility to select the ~scene~ with which we want to try our hand among the six available, which include a boss fight session with Dr. Robotnik . Once the choice has been made, we will have to complete the stages in the classic style of the series, that is, proceeding from left to right until we reach the ~finish line~. However, being able to cover this distance has never been so complicated: given the paucity and brevity of the levels, the developers have thought of placing traps everywhere, with the result of systematically breaking up the action and considerably increasing the episodes of frustration that Sonic fans have always been used to. The most surprising thing, however, is that these maneuvers have practically completely eliminated the ~course~ component that has always represented the fulcrum of the series, making the experience much slower and more exciting than usual. The control system does its utmost to make jumping easier for the player, with the d-pad for character movement and the * or # keys used to jump, while 5 and 8 let you look up or down. It is not possible to make the famous ~shot~, which in any case would be of little use given the presence of very few enemies (and those present are really bad) who still manage to put us in great difficulty due to a completely different collision management how perfect. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, the various mobile reductions of Sonic have always been characterized by a general ~recycling~ of the graphics used in the Mega Drive versions, and this latest product is no exception. The problem is that to ~reduce~ this factor, perhaps for fear of repeating itself excessively compared to the titles already published, Rockpool Games has decided to ~handle~ the stages that we all know, transforming them into something unwatchable from every point of view : general design, choice of colors, attention to detail, arrangement of elements, etc. Honestly, it could have been hard to do worse than that. And the situation certainly does not improve thanks to the sound sector, composed of the usual MIDI music taken from the classic episodes of Sonic and without an independent volume control.
