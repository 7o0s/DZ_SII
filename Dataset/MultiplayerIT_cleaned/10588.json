With equal firmness, however, it can be said that not all the desired results have been achieved: Nintendo was the first to hide (whether it did it or not to make room for other companies, it doesn't matter), and the experimental titles that many expected they were less than expected, proving that the iron pincers of the market are also very strong in services which, at least in theory, should help creatives to loosen them. Exkee is one of those software houses, for resources and training, that could not have published on consoles without Wiiware, just as ColorZ probably would never have been released in a retail version. RGB In ColorZ you control three aliens equipped with a spaceship, charged with cleaning up various planets from a lethal virus with ~color~ shots: in a way not unlike Ikaruga, to defeat the enemies you have to attack them (in this case in a less sci-fi and more rugby-like way , i.e. crashing into them) when the ship is the same shade as them. Exkee has created an excellent game, the play system is more than satisfactory, as are the changes of pace, which we will talk about shortly: what leaves you stunned is the way in which they managed to ruin it, at least in part, through at least questionable choices; the first of which, reconnecting to the discourse interrupted a moment ago, is related to the methods of altering the colors of the ship. Yellow is created by mixing blue and green, every child knows it: yet not all children (and not only) know that yellow is formed by combining green with red, despite being a primary color (accepting the concept of primary color in its popular meaning, given the purpose of the article). Although it may appear contradictory, the previous sentence does not express wrong concepts: in the first case the fusion of colors takes place by subtractive synthesis, in the second by additive synthesis, and there is no doubt that the subtractive one is the best known, known and most intuitive mixture. Considering that, despite the title, the fulcrum of the game does not lie in the intersection of colors, it is surprising that Exkee has decided to adopt additive synthesis for its UFOs: creating cyan by combining green and blue confuses anyone, let alone hypothetical novices, and raises rather unnecessary difficulties. HardcorZ As anticipated before, there is no doubt that the supporting structure of ColorZ is done well: the levels flow automatically towards the conclusion, but they do it in a rather characteristic way, often varying direction and, above all, rhythm. Abrupt accelerations and sudden changes of shot force the player to always be attentive and concentrated, and contribute to making the flow of the stages less flat. The enemies (no more than more or less mobile viruses settled in different parts of the level) are annihilated if touched with the right color, but cause damage, on the contrary, if hit with a different shade from their own. The first Ufo is controlled with the pointer of the Wiimote, so moving it around the level requires a fair amount of sensitivity, although it is possible, to simplify things, to hold down a nunchuk button to immobilize the ship (temporary solution anyway, since, unlike you, the level will continue to move). We didn't write ~first~ Ufo casually: most of the stages will force you to pilot more than one ship simultaneously, through (in addition to the pointer) the control stick of the nunchuk and, in the case of a third alien, the d-pad of the Wiimote; this, as you may have guessed, is the second compromising choice made by Exkee. ColorZ is a very demanding game, the game design implies a certain experience with video games, to finish it it is not enough to complete the internships, they must also be completed by accumulating many points: the additional obstacle caused by the simultaneous control of three spaceships adds nothing but frustration, and , rather than challenged by the game, one almost feels cheated. It would have been easier to architect the levels contemplating the possibility that they could be tackled with one, two or three ships based on the number of players, rather than forcing a single mind to guide three characters at the same time. Multiplayer Played in two (or three) ColorZ is very fun and challenging, a bit like the single-player levels with a single ship; despite this, the one we have recently defined as the unfortunate second choice of Exkeand, it also backfires in the multiplayer mode. Of the approximately twenty levels available, fourteen are ~approved~ for more than one ship, of which only nine are for three UFOs; not only that, the stages designed for three spaceships force a player, if faced in two, to control two of the three flying saucers, originating, albeit to a lesser extent, the same confusion of the single-player mode. Summarizing everything, the ideal approach to enjoy ColorZ would be to face the stages with as many users as Ufos on screen; however, you will agree that the game should be declined in relation to the players, and not the other way around. To further simplify things, and here we come to the third questionable choice made by Exkee, each user, to enter the game, must be in possession of a Wiimote with a Nunchuk attached, even though only two keys are needed and the ship is managed with the pointer of the remote control.", "date": "2009-08-06", "grade": "6.0"}
