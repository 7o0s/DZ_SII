There is nothing topical in such titles, if not a childish expression of a conflict that lives more in the imagination than in major confrontations, despite recent news events having brought it back to the center of the media square with a certain force. The currently playable version has improved from the first released To understand such games imagine a game designer who has to decide the role of the hostages in the gameplay. Active, passive or completely absent? Pure sadism, but only apparent. The reality is that there is no real drama, no reliable reconstruction of the crucial moments of a break-in or shootout, only the recorded sound of real weapons instead of the ~bang bang~ shouted with the mouth when looking out from a makeshift cover by gripping a plastic pistol or, in the most desperately romantic cases, with the thumb and forefinger placed perpendicularly to ape one of the fascinating weapons seen in the movies, imagining that on the other side there was the ~enemy~, any shape it had. Counter Strike, the Half-Life mod, was born from the desire to bring the tactic online, i.e. to slow down the action, shifting its fulcrum from the individual player's ability magnified or frustrated by ruthless arenas (Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament ), to the ability to team up in semi-realistic scenarios. It was always a question of skill, because shortcuts were not acceptable and there were two possibilities: either you learned to play by showing patience (even patience is part of skill), or you left the virtual field disconsolate due to the pitiless amount of fragments suffered. Undoubtedly Highway is the best mission of all Tactical Intervention Minh ~Gooseman~ Le and Jess Cliffe were the creator gods of Counter Strike. All online gamers worth their salt knew and admired their names. Perhaps it was the cult for the two and their work that fueled the bitter disappointment for the sale to Valve and the slow and inexorable transformation of Counter Strike into a brand with increasingly uncovered commercial objectives, i.e. with constant winks at the mass and a slow but inexorable disowning of the series' ultra-hardcore origins. As often happens in similar situations, the couple started to break out. Cliffe accepted his new role and remained faithful to the Valve line, finally managing to transform Counter Strike into a title playable by anyone, while Gooseman never accepted the new step and at the height of endurance he decided to try an alternative route: founded development studio FIX Korea, created Tactical Intervention, free-to-play online shooter and number one candidate to be the spiritual sequel to the Counter Strike mod. Let's see if such ambition has paid off. Ups and downs Tactical Intervention is hard to judge. Launched months ago in disastrous conditions, it is slowly taking a more defined shape. Some of the issues from the first few weeks, such as the terrifying netcode, lack of content, and large amount of bugs, are still being fixed, but there's still a lot of work to do. The maps are not very large The game is made up of two modes: team deathmatch, which is just what it claims to be (two teams shooting at each other and accumulating frags), and missions, which is a series of objective maps (rescue or hold hostages; escort a car to to the point of extraction or stop it by destroying it; plant or defuse bombs), both to be faced as terrorists or anti-terrorists. There is no shortage of items to buy with the points accumulated in the game or with real money, as the prevailing economic model wants. For the rest we are in the standards. For now, FIX Korea has managed to squeeze seven dissonant quality maps into the game. They range from the exceptional Highway, galvanizing scenario for the Vip Escort mission, which alone is worth the download of the client thanks to the ferocious action capable of producing, to the flat and soporific Dynasty for team deathmatches, probably more suitable for quick fights of another genre of shooters, than to the slow and theoretically more reasoned ones of Tactical Intervention (actually there are those who like it a lot because of its simplicity, but in general spending thirty minutes in a row on it can be lethal). In between are maps set in the iconic locations of the war on terrorism, such as Construction Site, Flash Metro or Shopping Mall (a construction site, subway station and shopping mall) three good maps for dribbling hostages, and Morning Calm and Uprising, the first set in Japan, the second a tipico urban scenario, both dedicated to bombs in all their forms. The rest is a continuous qualitative up and down, with some falls into the ridiculous such as some action sequences that would like to mimic major productions, but which betray the poverty of the entire technical realization. From Counter Strike to Tactical Intervention the step is short... or very long, as you will be able to read Works in progress However, if compared to the first public version the improvements in terms of content have been clear, what hasn't changed is the obsessiveness of the economic model, with the best weapons that expire a few days after purchase and that must be repurchased continuously (even if the times have been slightly lengthened). Obviously the system aims to make the player spend money, as indeed it is right that it should be seen that access is free for everyone, but some imbalance is truly inevitable, despite the efforts made to limit them. Combined with the level growth, which is also unavoidable since it is linked to the sale of dedicated items and better equipment, the usual vicious circle is created which leads to wasting more time with equipment and insignia than with the actual game. In terms of weapons, there is nothing original to report But this is the present (and future) of most online video games, so there's little to complain about. Also because it is certain that if he hadn't embraced the free-to-play model, Tactical Intervention wouldn't even exist. The technical side deserves a separate discussion, which shows major limitations. The engine used is the Source from Valve, with which Gooseman is particularly at ease, but which really shows its age. The first maps released were frankly ugly, worse in appearance than those of similar titles (a comparison with another random free-to-play, such as Ghost Recon Online, would be really merciless). The two released later have relieved the situation a bit, even if they really have nothing exceptional. The visual style is bland and everything smells basic, which corresponds to mediocre in this case. Even the soundtrack just does its dirty work and only serves to remind the player what he decided to start to pass some time. In short, something more could have been done, at least in order not to disfigure with the merciless and vast competition.", "date": "2013-09-24", "grade": "6.2"}
