{"name": "Avanti a tutta forza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80445-ship-simulator-extreme-avanti-a-tutta-forza.html", "text": "Ship Simulator Extreme, as the name suggests, is a maritime simulator that puts us in front of the choice of routes, navigation times, the most daring maneuvers but also allows us to walk on our ship and even drive tenders and lifeboats for a truly complete nautical experience. In this installation of the series, the introduction of the GreenPeace missions is interesting, which can surely spice up the experience and arouse interest even in those who are not exactly accustomed to virtual boat driving. In addition to three campaigns, the title offers the possibility of playing in free roaming by roaming the seas using one of the 30 vessels available. There is also multiplayer support that allows 24 players to compete with the dangers and emergencies of the sea or simply live together in the same server as if it were a small MMO. Coordination between players obviously allows you to better manage dangerous situations but apparently a specifically cooperative mode should even be available in the future. The latency of the multiplayer servers from Italy appears excellent. Maximum 80 milliseconds even with a standard ADSL and that is enough not to notice a significant response delay in commands. A sea of opportunities The variety of situations is quite high. Rescues in rough seas, whalers to stop, naval fires to suppress and situations with naval traffic that would make a Milanese taxi driver pale. And of course there is the right ship for every situation. They range from tugs to cruise ships and there is no shortage of various nautical rescue vehicles. Each ship of course has its own specific controls which can be handled both via the keyboard and visually with the mouse pointer and often it is necessary to use both. Indeed, it is not uncommon to find yourself in command of ships with twin engines, directional fire hoses and cranes. Furthermore, to avoid the dangers of naval traffic and warn other vessels of our intentions, it is good to get to know the signal lights which can be selected via an icon menu. Docking and disembarking, on the other hand, are extremely intuitive with some colored spheres showing us where to click to drop anchor or to moor using the ropes. One of the toughest challenges is obviously bad weather which forces us to navigate using radar and complicates seemingly very simple things like docking. Of course, very simple once you get the hang of it because juxtaposing a hundreds of tons beast with an equally heavy concrete slab is not easy at all. In fact, water involves a certain inertia and the rotations of a boat that exceeds 200 meters in length can be quite difficult to tame. Furthermore, Ship Simulator Extreme seems to apply too heavy physics to some boats which often risks making us feel more like meteorites in space than ships at sea. Once the control system has been tamed, we still have all the cards in the rules to face the story mode. There are three campaigns available and they take us through the vicissitudes of GreenPeace, place us at the helm of an eventful cruise bound for Bora Bora and finally put us in the shoes of a real commander who has to face the toughest situations that the sea can offer . The duration of the missions is highly variable. Sometimes these are brief emergencies while sometimes navigation forces us to cross half the planet, Antarctica included. If nothing else, the different timing of the missions and the vicissitudes that force us to often change boats and ~guide~ models manage to liven up the experience to a minimum even if there are no interludes and the written introduction is rather short. A look towards the horizon Remarkable visual distance. Detailed ships. Low-res but immersive environmental effects. The scaling of the detail based on the distance is unfortunately jerky and ugly and the coasts and islands, thanks to the dense but rather rough vegetation, are pleasant only if observed from afar. On the contrary, water, including physics, and the effects of refraction, visible from a huge distance, are pleasant but weigh exaggeratedly on performance, bringing the title below 30 FPS even with a respectable configuration. If nothing else in Ship Simulator Extreme we find faithfully reproduced the largest and most beautiful ports in the world but unfortunately not all enjoy the same care. Some look like they came out of a simulation a few years older while others, like Rotterdam and San Francisco, are really a pleasure to watch as long as you don't zoom in too much on the washed-out textures and some details that aren'ttoo neat. Basically, with some improvements in terms of textures and light effects, visual strengths and weaknesses are the same as the last Ship Simulator.", "date": "2010-09-21", "grade": "5.5"}
