The download is available free of charge for anyone who has purchased a season pass, in this case, in fact, the DLC must not be purchased individually from the marketplace. Free purchase for all the others, however, for 800 Microsoft points. Where the release of the Spartan Ops episodes strengthens the cooperative sector of the game for free, here we also start thinking about the competitive part, adding meat to the fire also with regard to matchmaking. After this necessary premise, let's start talking in detail about what has been released by the developer 343 Industries. Get ready for the draw! The multiplayer side of Halo 4 is certainly what made the fortune of the series, where, unlike other famous shooters, skill always counts more and more rather than the experience and growth of one's character. The multiple game modes of Halo 4, taken individually, however, can count on not many maps suitable for each of them precisely by virtue of the great variety of multiplayer options that the game enjoys. Microsoft has begun its campaign to expand the online world with the first three maps (unpublished) downloadable from the marketplace that will delight all Halo 4 players: they are called Wreckage, Harvest and Shatter. Let's start from the first. Wreckage is an asymmetrical map suitable for various game modes, first of all the classic capture the flag but also King of the hill. It is a very suggestive location formed by a landscape devastated by war, full of debris, carcasses, elements behind which to shelter and hide. It can be tackled with vehicles such as the Warthog or Ghost and supports up to 16 players in Infinity Slayer mode and up to 12 players in the others. Visually it is perhaps the map that gives the strongest impact: the sun on the horizon, mixed with the sand that rises and blurs the view, creates a truly suggestive and twilight effect, perhaps decadent just like war actually is. Crashed alien ships, abandoned installations and half-destroyed bases fill this truly challenging map. The second, called Harvest, is on the contrary a more contained and small, symmetrical map, which sees at its center a base on the planet Harvest which was one of the most remote External Colonies of the UNSC mainly dedicated to agriculture. Located in the Epsilon Indi system, the colony had the misfortune of being the first UNSC planet to be discovered by the Covenant. The planet was destroyed by the Covenant in the Battle of Harvest where almost all of its population was exterminated. We can still find the signs of those battles in this map which, although not as visually inspired as the previous one, retains a certain charm especially when looking at its ~external~ panoramas which give a beautiful view of the planet. Looking instead ~inside~ the map, this does not appear so inspired and particularly new as it re-proposes a human base with all its series of corridors, entrances and external roads that can be traveled by means of transport. The latest map in the Crimson pack is called Shatter, and it is the largest and most suitable for any game mode thanks to its variety: it is made up of large open spaces but also of multiple closed bases scattered across the territory in a symmetrical way. Its vastness, interrupted by closed spaces, makes it perfect for playing 16 vs 16 modes, capture the flag, dominion, king of the hill but above all the new Extraction mode. Shatter is therefore a very versatile map in which one can exalt oneself both for clashes on vehicles and in combat from long distances (snipers and so on), but also with close-up clashes in closed environments where lovers of shotguns or sword they will be able to find bread for their teeth. This map is much more articulated than the previous ones and even if there are no particular geniuses in the level design, it is perhaps the most pleasant to play with a large number of participants. Visually almost ~oppressive~ given the very dark colors tending towards emerald green, due to the setting designed around one of the largest mines in the UNSC. In addition to these three unpublished maps, 343 Industries has also included a completely new mode in the multiplayer called Extraction, a variant of King of the Hill in which we have to complete objectives (called ~extraction~) on the territory that will appear from time to time. As soon as the objective to be achieved appears on the map, the two teams must rush to the spot to place a radio beacon which, depending onAfter a few seconds, he will start communicating and in doing so he will give a point to the team that managed to plant him and defend him for the necessary time. In the activation time of the station it is obviously possible to ~steal~ the goal from the opposing team and indeed, the beauty of this mode is precisely the dichotomy between defense and attack that exists at the precise moment that a base is conquered. The game ends once you get to five points. This is not an innovative or particularly ingenious mode, but it certainly represents a good alternative to the many already available and how many a welcome addition. However, it is evident that the heart of this DLC is represented by the three new maps and, regardless of the Extraction mode and the price, we recommend the download to all Halo 4 lovers only for the beauty of having three new locations where you can fight against friends (and enemies).", "date": "2012-12-21", "grade": null}
