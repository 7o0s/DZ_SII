{"name": "IL2 - Sturmovik", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il2-sturmovik.html", "text": "The Simulation L2 is above all a simulator with all capital letters and already here we need to make some observations. Often realism is sacrificed in favor of entertainment but there are some cases where too much realism can be counterproductive. IL2 is extremely realistic in terms of simulation experience (although it doesn't go to certain extremes as happened in Battle of Britain, where at the maximum level of realism there was an entire sequence of commands to just be able to start the engine), and this is a good or bad? The answer to this question can only be provided by those who play it. The typical day of any Nikolai Popov engaged in a generic mission probably went like this: after taking off, he flew in formation towards the target to be reached (and formation flying is a really difficult thing to achieve), without meeting anyone, and then maybe you would have been able to see something similar to an airplane in the distance. In the dogfight phase, no radar, no targeting system helps us: it's just us and our machine guns. Clearly the novice player could find himself extremely disoriented in front of a Soviet squadron leader who, speaking in Russian, tells us the route to follow and the height at which to position himself, or as soon as he discovers how easy it is to screw around and why an X-Wing is an IL-2 are a little different to fly. Although the difficulty in IL-2 is perfectly configurable (we will be able to disable the take-off and departure phases, stall effects, etc. etc..) there are very few ~helpers~ for flight simulator ~newbies~ but also for those who has some experience. Finding yourself in a ~melee~ involving a dozen planes without even knowing who the enemies are due to the difficulty in distinguishing them from afar is not a good experience. There are those who will appreciate this level of realism but there are those who might object, in fact there is no doubt that a pilot in his cockpit certainly has the situation a little more under control than someone playing from behind a monitor. It's one thing to distinguish the ~pixels~ forming Soviet aircraft from those forming German aircraft, it's quite another to see them with your own eyes. The ~aids~ that IL-2 offers concern the possibility of displaying superimposed writings that indicate what type of aircraft it is, and the famous ~padlock~. The padlock simulates the ability to follow a particular aircraft with your eyes; this mode has been created in an extremely realistic way, in fact you will lose the ~lock~ if the enemy aircraft should remain out of your direct view for a long time (for example if it moves behind you) or if it should pass behind some clouds... Countryside Here we come to what is, in my opinion, the biggest flaw of the whole game, and that is the lack of a dynamic campaign. The career mode is nothing more than a succession of independent missions, in which the results of one mission will not affect the next ones. In fact, there is not the slightest semblance of something in the game that could resemble a dynamic campaign, whose missions are not ~scripted~ (already decided at the start) but which are generated by the real distribution of forces in the field and by the evolution of the battle . The beautifully dynamic campaign seen in Battle of Britain is but a dream here. Despite this, the missions are still varied and exciting and even a little atypical: in fact, the air war on the Soviet front was above all supportive and consequently in the role of the Russians there will be many missions that will require ground attacks (both bombing and ~strafing~). . In this regard, you can also take on the duties of the ~gunner~ in aircraft equipped with this position and help the pilot (who will be replaced by the computer which will continue to follow the route). One thing that must certainly be said is the fact that land vehicles will continue to fight their war and will not be simple static targets. There will be clashes between ships, tanks... and you can well imagine how decisive your contribution can be in these situations! The technical equipment To play IL-2 to its full potential you will need to have a good joystick, especially if it has Force Feedback. In fact, it is very useful to ~feel~ progressively progressive power vibrations as soon as you get dangerously close to a stall point. A positional audio system is also highly indicated to be able to fully enjoy the wonderful sound creation, however the version I tried was not very good.deal with my SB Live! forcing me to have to play without surround (after a while the audible sounds from the cockpit were no longer heard). Everything was tested on an AMD 1.2 GHz with 512 MB of Ram and GeForce 3, where naturally at maximum detail in 1024*768*32bpp it didn't show the slightest hesitation. In conclusion IL2 is undoubtedly one of the best flight simulators of the 2nd World War but it is not a game intended for everyone due to its level of realism. What to some may seem extremely funny to others could be a source of extreme frustration. As already mentioned, the only real flaw is the absence of the dynamic campaign, the lack of which should not be underestimated. So, examine your conscience and if you have a lot of experience in this field you won't be disappointed, otherwise... you will need a lot of patience, which will however be reciprocated by a rich gaming experience! IL2 - Sturmovik After years and years of clashes over the skies of tormented Europe, the battle scene moves to the boundless Soviet territory and this could only come from a Russian software house! Let me tell you that the result is truly revolutionary! Never had a game been seen that combined such attention to detail with a truly impeccable technical realization, albeit with its flaws. But let's proceed in order... The game offers the possibility of tackling the campaign, or rather, the ~pilot's career~ as defined by the game, from both sides. For the Russians (the good ones!) there will be two modes available, one as a fighter pilot, and the other as a bomber pilot, while for the Axis forces (among other things, the database of aircraft in the game also shows an Italian aircraft, of the infamous Italian contingent in Russia) there is only a career as a pilot. Although the game is named after one of the most versatile aircraft of the Soviet Air Force, IL2 offers the possibility to fly a large number of aircraft from both sides (including even the first models of Mig). As you can see from the images, the game features a truly exceptional graphics engine and, if played in maximum detail, one can only be impressed. But it is not only the intrinsic beauty of the models that amazes, but the obsessive attention to detail. For example, the terrain is not desolate as often happens in this genre of games, but full of details! In fact, flying over the cities we will be able to distinguish buildings (of course, they won't have many polygons, but there are!), factories, bridges over rivers, roads, etc. etc .. As if this were not enough there are many other details such as tracer bullets and the ~shells~ of the shots fired by Max Payne-style machine guns. A curious addition concerns the possibility of making ~smoke~ come out of the wings in order to be able to draw your acrobatic evolutions in the sky!", "date": "2001-12-19", "grade": null}
