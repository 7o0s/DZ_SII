Are you crazy? You can't write certain things here!~ ~I think you didn't understand Umb, the birds belong to the other students!~ ~But is it for pedophiles?~ ~But no, it's a dating simulator with birds...~ ~Are we talking about frankfurters?~ ~No Perri, no, those after, at lunch~. ~But is it a hentai game?~ It's not a joke... it's the game! ~No Umb, wait, let me finish talking! I'll explain. The protagonist is a student admitted to a prestigious school in a dystopian world, the St. PigeoNation's Institute, where students and teachers are birds and...~ ~The I understand that she likes birds, but we can't review this stuff, not even if Povia sponsors it.~ ~See what you don't understand? The birds are the students!~ ~But is she a bird too?~ ~No~ ~Is she an ornithologist?~ ~No~ ~Human?~ ~Yes...~ ~Then what are you doing with all these birds?~ ~Try to pick them up...we're talking about a dating simulator after all.~ ~...~ ~You got it right this time, it's a classic dating simulator, more veering towards the visual novel in truth, in which the protagonist can have love affairs with pigeons of different races instead of the usual handsome boys~. ~But it's madness.~ ~Console yourself, because when pigeons are presented they also have human portraits.~ ~Come on, but who would ever play such a thing? Apart from Povia, of course~. ~A lot, since there's also a sequel and an official online store full of gadgets to buy, including sexy stuff.~ ~Guys, but since we're talking about birds, how about a nice frankfurter?~ Hatoful Boyfriend is about a girl passionate about birds... And we reviewed it! Crazy feathers Amazed? Yet Hatoful Boyfriend, net of frankfurters, is exactly the game described in the previous dialogue, i.e. a very classic dating simulator in which the boys to be conquered are pigeons. We know it sounds silly, but it really is. However, don't worry, because otherwise there is nothing original to tell. The game system is not even too advanced, to be honest. But let's go in order that otherwise we risk creating only confusion (we know that many of you are looking at the screen dumbfounded). Povia has nothing to do with it, don't worry As expected from any visual novel, Hatoful Boyfriend offers a large amount of text to read. These are descriptions and dialogues that accompany the alternation in the foreground of the portraits of the birds. We won't tell you the main plot and subplots because they are the fulcrum of the adventure, but we can underline the excellent quality of the English translation (unfortunately there is no Italian translation, be warned) and the surreality of some situations, given the subjects involved. Let's say that the entire writing revolves around the nature of the protagonists and, although it doesn't take itself too seriously, it manages to create an atmosphere in which, paradoxically, one ends up immersed without too much difficulty. It is a strange mix between participation in possible love stories and a strong sense of amused estrangement, due to the awareness of the fact that the protagonist is towing pigeons. Thus, between a reference to feathers and another to the scholastic activities of birds, one remains enmeshed more than one thought possible in a well-described and characterized world. Indeed, to be honest to the end, Hatoful Boyfriend manages to capture much more than canonical visual novels, above all thanks to the ability of Moa Hato, the author, to wisely modulate situations, without ever falling into bad taste and maintaining a consistent quality throughout the adventure. Thus, alongside the romantic events, there are thriller and other comedy moments, always described with great skill. Curiosity Hatoful Boyfriend isn't actually a very recent title. In fact, the Japanese were able to play the work of the mangaka Moa Hato, created as a sequel to a flash game, already way back in 2011, while the first western version, available only in digital download for the US market (actually also purchasable here in Europe) dates back to 2012. The version used for this review is the international remake of Mediatronic distributed by Devolver Digital, a publisher specializing in borderline titles that allowed it to reach more important and relevant distribution channels such as Steam. Visual novel or dating simulator? In reality, despite having defined Hatoful Boyfriend as a dating simulator, we have to admit that the categorization in the genre is not one hundred percent correct. Just as it is not to call it a pure visual novel. In fact we could best describe it as a visual novel with multiple choiceswhich structurally follows the dating simulators, but does not have the same complexity. The quality of the drawings is very high The game system is really simple: you read the dialogues and make choices based on the pigeon you want to conquer. The choices are reflected in the three characteristics visible at the top of the screen which determine the relationships with the other characters. Based on the decisions made, one of the possible endings is reached, which in turn unlocks some illustrations and some documents in the extra section of the main menu. Above all, the latter are very useful for having some additional information on the scenario (much deeper than it may seem at first glance). If desired, the dialogues can be carried on at super speed, a useful option for replaying several times without having to re-read everything, but otherwise there isn't much else to say about the mechanics. The protagonist, who can be given any name at the beginning of the adventure, carries out the normal activities of any student throughout the school year (the current date is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen). For example, he can go to help in the school library, he can choose which subject to follow, he can participate in different activities and so on. Basically, the purpose of the player is to understand what the right choices are to conquer the chosen character and then get lost in the reading. It seems superfluous to add that if you don't like reading you can stay away from Hatoful Boyfriend (like any other visual novel) and that it is a title designed for a niche of players, at least here in the West. Leave him alone even if some nice bird has just filled your car with faeces... which is never nice!", "date": "2014-09-04", "grade": "8.5"}
