{"name": "Rise of the Argonauts - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rise-of-the-argonauts-recensione.html", "text": "~Prometheus and Epimetheus, two brothers belonging to the Titan race, were commissioned by Zeus to distribute gifts to living species: Epimetheus gave beauty to peacocks, speed to horses, strength to bears, the ability to fly to birds; Prometheus, for his part, he gave men the upright stature, in the image of the gods, and fire.Envious of his brother's work, Epimetheus decided to take back the gifts and give life to a creature that possessed them all: a golden goat. When this beautiful animal approached man, however, he attracted him and killed him, obtaining from his skin an ornament with extraordinary powers: the Golden Fleece.~ These are more or less the words spoken by the satyr Pan to tell Jason the story of the object he is looking for. The two are in a temple on the island of Citra, and weeks have now passed since their departure aboard the Argo: the king of Jolco, after consulting the Oracle of Delphi, knows that there is only one way to bring back to life his bride, slain on her wedding day at the hands of the Blacktongues (a race of warriors and sorcerers loyal to the goddess Hecate).The Fleece will grant him the power to bring back the woman he loves, and if to have it he will even have to visit Tartarus, so be it. Private God Rise of the Argonauts immediately presents itself as a truly ambitious project, which in some ways refers to Mass Effect: the progress of the dialogues is determined by the player through choices that can be ~aligned~ with the four gods who protect Jason ( Ares, Athena, Apollo and Hermes). Following the path of violence, justice, wisdom or shrewdness therefore translates into ~achievements~ which, together with more concrete deeds (the killing of a certain number of opponents, the recruitment of specific travel companions, the completion of missions primary or secondary, etc.) go to crowd the screen dedicated to the ~gifts~, accessible via the pause menu or whenever we come across a votive altar. From there we will be able to ~dedicate~ our businesses to the four gods, earning gods in exchange ~enchantment points~ to spend to buy skills or special powers: Athena's gifts enhance our spear and make us able to attack from afar; those of Ares improve the effectiveness of the mallet and give us the power to cause explosions; the gifts of Hermes make our sword sharper and faster, while giving us the ability to evade enemy attacks; finally, those of Apollo make our shield more resistant and improve our defense skills. There are therefore three weapons that are part of Jason's equipment, and which can be replaced with similar tools but gradually more powerful or equipped with peculiar characteristics: they will be given to us during the adventure and we will be able to admire their splendor at any time, as the character places them behind him. At the same time, during our journey we will find ourselves interacting with a large number of characters that we will eventually be able to recruit and who will help us in a concrete way, accompanying us during the exploration phases and fighting alongside us in the presence of enemies. The first of our allies will be the huge Hercules, but at the end of the story the Argo will indeed be full of legendary heroes, each with different abilities. Whether or not all this is related to the mythological ~reality~, it doesn't matter: the plot created by Liquid Entertainment manages on the one hand to exploit the charisma of the characters, on the other it intertwines the stories by taking ample liberties but obtaining an extraordinary final result. You are passionate about the story and the dialogues from the beginning, and you end up literally devouring the ten hours and little more that it takes to complete the game. Too little? For such a product, probably yes. Adventure... There are six places we will visit during the adventure: the city of Jolco, the kingdom of Jason, where it all began; the island of Delphi, a legendary place that does not exist on maps, where the Oracle of Apollo dwells; the city of Mycenae, ruled by kings Lycomedes and protected by Ares; the island of Saria, inhabited by centaurs and protected by Hermes; the island of Citra, whose inhabitants act according to the laws of Athena; Tartarus, antechamber of Hades where Zeus confined the Titans for eternal damnation. Within each of these scenarios we will be called to carry out a series of missions. In Mycenae we will have to win the forgiveness of King Lycomedes and convince him to follow us on our expedition, even facing the powerful Achilles and averting the threat of infiltrated Black Tongue. This is the most articulated phase of the adventure, which involves the greatest number of side missions and will see us pe even fight in the arena like a gladiator. The island of Saria probably appears as the ~poorest~ location, structured like a large forest full of threats, while on the island of Citra we will find several surprises waiting for us. We will be able to interact with a large number of characters, and each dialogue can lead to the activation of a secondary quest, with relative reporting on the map. Accessing it is not an immediate operation, given that you must first enter the pause screen and then select it, while it would have been possible to assign its display directly to a controller button. The fact of having to resort to it very often, to orient yourself within the locations, makes this lack rather annoying. ...and action The exploration and combat phases share the same control system, with the difference that in the first case Jason cannot use weapons, since they are drawn only in the presence of enemies. Using the spear, the sword or the mace it is possible to carry out a series of more or less effective combos, and often the nature of the opponents suggests the tool to use to counter them. The three weapons have profoundly different characteristics, where the spear increases our range of action (it can also be thrown from afar), the sword acts very quickly and the mace it represents brute power, often the absolute favorite for the speed with which it can end clashes. The game uses an automatic targeting system that works well, and the developers have inserted ~slow~ sequences that emphasize the sensation of impact when we blow enemies' heads off or cut them in two: in such situations, Rise of the Argonauts knows be quite spectacular. The downside is represented by a far from perfect visual management, to be corrected manually using the right analog stick, and by a general repetitiveness of the action: the difference compared to pure action games like Devil May Cry 4 is abysmal, at this juncture. It is not clear why, moreover, the character's health level is not displayed on the screen and depends a bit on our interpretation: when the blows suffered begin to be too many, we will begin to hear the songs of the underworld and we will have to try to resume breath, possibly exploiting Jason's ability to use his shield and roll on the ground to avoid attacks. Each location involves a fight with one or more ~bosses~, sometimes really huge and impressive (see Medusa in her gorgon form). The most difficult to beat undoubtedly remains the one on the island of Saria, which we will then have to face again (together with the other most important enemies) in Tartarus, towards the end of the adventure, respecting one of the clichs of classic scrolling fighting games. Technical realization Among the strengths of the game there is certainly the excellent characterization of the characters: Jason and the Argonauts boast an apt design, full of details, and the creation of weapons and armor is truly extraordinary. The scenarios often manage to be evocative, and as already mentioned, the city of Mycenae is the richest and most beautiful place to see. The enemies are quite varied and boast different abilities, while the bosses are sometimes huge and spectacular. Unfortunately, these advantages are accompanied by a series of defects far from negligible: although the game uses the powerful Unreal Engine 3, the results leave much to be desired as regards the solidity of the frame rate, which suffers from very frequent drops, in every situation. This general jerkiness is accompanied by practically no interaction with the environment: Jason can only walk and converse with the inhabitants of the various cities, and his explorations are often marred by the presence of numerous invisible barriers. The animation of the characters leaves something to be desired, in this case it is good during the action phases but mediocre when it comes to moving. The work on the textures in general is not fantastic, indeed the textures used are often lacking in definition or used badly. Moving on to the sound sector, we must recognize the gigantic work done for the dialogues, which have been exceptionally localized in Italian by Binari Sonori, using a cast of first-class voice actors. The level of acting is excellent, and it's a shame that some of the vocals are marred by lower volume levels or lower sampling quality, making it difficult to hear the lyrics unless you tinker with the audio options. The music is splendid and creates a great atmosphere, while the effects remain average.", "date": "2008-12-31", "grade": "6.7"}
