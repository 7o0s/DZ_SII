{"name": "West of Dead", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/west-of-dead-recensione.html", "text": "The West of Dead review takes us to explore the fascinating roguelite experience packaged by Upstream Arcade, available at no additional cost to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on PC and Xbox One, or purchasable for  19.99. Purgatory, Wyoming , 1888: the ranger William Mason awakens after being killed, but the afterlife is not as he expected: transformed into a sort of specter with his skull perpetually burning, the gunslinger discovers he can die again and again and again, starting over each time his search for truth and a possible redemption. Greeted at each resurrection by the bartender of a saloon who makes a few jokes about the fact that there are bad thugs out there, Mason collects two randomly selected weapons and enters scenarios that are also randomly generated, through a procedural system which makes each attempt different from the other but which at the same time inevitably removes personality from the level design, which often proposes improbable architectures and ends in themselves. Progression naturally lives within the single run, allowing us to obtain upgrades for vital energy, effectiveness of shots and reload speed, as well as new and more powerful weapons, but resetting when we are killed ... unless you have managed to overcome a sufficient number of stages to guarantee us the confrontation with a boss and the consequent unlock of a new chapter of the story, from which to start in the next game. Gameplay The gameplay of West of Dead is closely linked to the roguelite nature of the experience and to the procedural settings, which take the form of corridors with various branches, which lead from time to time to rooms besieged by enemies. To eliminate them we will have to use the weapons we have, for a maximum of two guns and two special objects (passive perks, active skills or tools to be used in battle, such as knives, axes or explosives) to be assigned respectively to the triggers and back buttons of the controllers. The shooter mechanics of the game are inspired by the twin stick shooter genre, but with some interesting twists. The first is that the aim is not free but depends on an automatic lock-on system that works only when the opponents are illuminated by the light of one of the oil lamps present in the rooms: turning them on represents a strategic element of combat, given that in at this juncture the enemies are stunned for a few moments. The second is that you cannot shoot freely and without limitations, but you have to deal with very slow reload times and variable ranges of effectiveness, which lead you to pay more attention to the planning of attacks and to remain hidden behind cover (the maneuver is automatic) until it is destroyed by bullets, in that case resorting to jumping to avoid being riddled and suffering massive damage. Speaking of damage, these are represented numerically, complete with critical hits and sensational occasions in which we miss the target: a typical aspect of RPGs, which is also reflected in the access to new and more powerful guns while we explore the settings or access the merchant's desk on duty, which in exchange for a few pieces of iron will allow us to buy a gun equipped with a better reach and a larger magazine, or a devastating sawed-off shotgun from very close range. Permanent death Permanent death is one of the typical elements of roguelikes, even if in the case of West of Dead there are elements that can be maintained after game over and which bring the title back into the roguelite subgenre. At the end of each level it is in fact possible to visit a disturbing witch and give her the sins extracted from the corpse of the killed enemies, using them to unlock objects or upgrades which are precisely kept regardless of everything and which make us more competitive in the long run. Problems Sadly, the rig put together by Upstream Arcade suffers from some fairly glaring issues. The first is that the aiming system often ~jams~ in the most agitated phases, when perhaps a couple of enemies are chasing us in the corridors after we have put them on alert, or it locks onto the wrong target making us waste a few precious shots: the ammunition is infinite, it is true, but as mentioned the reload times force us to use them sparingly. It is clear and evident that in a roguelike-style context this type of shortcomings weigh a lot, because they can easily lead to undeserved game overs and force us to repeat the entire chapter over again, perhaps a few steps from its conclusion. In this senso the banality of the boss fights is almost welcome: after dozens of standard opponents perfectly capable of making us eat our dust, who get much stronger as we go on, focusing on a single enemy that is far from invincible helps to loosen the tension a bit. Then there is the inevitable repetitiveness of the settings, which are re-proposed from chapter to chapter (although with the possible addition of new scenarios, from time to time) and which due to the procedural nature not only cannot boast the personality that would expect from the level design of a title with a linear progression, but they also end up giving life to improbable architectures and ends in themselves, with passages that lead to nothing. Fortunately, obtaining the ability to teleport substantially limits, almost immediately , the need to carry out backtracking: just reach one of the ~intersections~ present on the map and select another one where you can appear immediately, speeding things up and at least slightly smoothing out the frustration of having to do it all over again in case of defeat. Technical realization There is no doubt that the stylistic idea behind West of Dead is very precise and with clear literary references. The graphics in cel shading and the angular characters, full of shadows and contrasts, in fact clearly recall the classic Mike Mignola, father of Hellboy, and Ron Perlman's voice for the protagonist only further emphasizes this combination. Of course, it is a pity that the other characters do not actually speak and therefore the dialogues interpreted by the American actor are the only ones we will hear in the game. However, the sound sector has other aces up its sleeve, above all the musical accompaniment guitar-based, with fascinating and surprisingly varied riffs that keep us company as we explore the settings in search of enemies or treasures. The aforementioned cel shading naturally simplifies the work of the GPU, and it is probably for this reason that West of Dead runs without any problem at 4K and 60 fps with all effects maxed out, without however offering advanced adjustments: the scalability of the graphics rests almost exclusively on changes to the resolution.", "date": "2020-06-24", "grade": "7.6"}
