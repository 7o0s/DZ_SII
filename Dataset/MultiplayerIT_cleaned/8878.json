Yes, this is tough here, at least that's what they once said, and Aloy is happy to play along. But not everything is perfect, it never is, especially during the introductory hours, but in this case it was also a bit of our fault... We no longer trust open worlds, and when we choose one we tend to be more and more watch out, distrust. It happens because in recent years the developers have gone to great lengths in iterating game structures, putting more and more effort into creating stunning worlds, and less and less into filling them with interesting things to do. Too many times we have been amazed in front of these splendid valleys, these luxuriant scenarios made a little by hand and a little automatically, promising ourselves millions of hours of pure dedication and cascades of trophies up to the most coveted platinum, only to then give up all after five days and not even half done, once again betrayed by the superficial beauty of yet another interactive Eden where you can do everything, but deep down you never really do anything. Different than usual? The remains of our world in Horizon We didn't trust Horizon Forbidden West that much either. The Guerrilla game is the latest in the long series of open worlds with which PlayStation Studios have largely marked the life cycle of PlayStation 4, titles with extraordinary production values but to be played increasingly dangerously similar to each other. We can't deny that when we bent down to get the first medical shrub, hid in the tall grass for the first time, grabbed the first drone and, brace yourselves, scaled the first tower to get its unique treasure at the top, we feared the worst. It didn't help the running introduction to the character and plot with which Guerrilla chose to open this sequel, the hatchet-edged first few minutes, Zero Dawn's disastrous recap of events and characters. After ten hours of gameplay, you might mistakenly think you have a clear idea of what Forbidden West will offer until the end credits. But the further it goes, the more Horizon Forbidden West grows exponentially. Shoot the love Horizon Forbidden West: we expected more freedom in the photo mode, but for the moment we can be satisfied... The first area of Horizon Forbidden West, the usual nursery for budding adventurers, is an extraordinary red herring. Continuing in the adventure you don't even realize how much the game begins to capture, the psychological defenses we have told you about are in fact lowered very slowly until, in the inevitable moment in which real life calls to its duties, you realize that I have absolutely no desire to turn off the TV and give up the role of the hunter Aloy. The merit is not only of the exceptional graphics, which everyone expected and which is actually frightening; it's not just about grandiose battles against an even richer and more impressive biomechanical bestiary. Where the game shines is above all in the quality of the missions, and it is in them that you will probably find the same motivation to play that overwhelmed us in the first place. Quests rule! Horizon Forbidden West: This is the average quality of NPC faces related to side quests The open worlds are not all the same, and get it in your head: they are not a genre, but the stage where the artist performs, the scenography of the adventure. Forbidden West's open world feels like it's all built around questing, which is usually an approach you'd expect more from a full-fledged RPG and not a hybrid that favors action over words. But this is only one of the aspects that make Horizon Forbidden West the maximum that an action game can indulge in before becoming a real RPG. Before continuing, do you want a little anecdote that makes us understand how badly the last five years of the open world have accustomed us? During the first secondary missions of Forbidden West, every time we arrived at the first passage of the quest we thought it was also the last one, in short we thought it ended there in the usual sadness. Instead... Stories from the frontier Horizon Forbidden West: The game map is large enough to offer a large number of different environments Instead, the adventures offered by Forbidden West often continue and continue, dragging you to the top of a mountain and then throwing you into the depths of a flooded cave that with its currents takes you to the gates of a rusty titan. Taking it easy and with taste, some quests easily reach an hour in duration. The charm of the missions secondaries of this game start even earlier, from whoever offers them to you. They are mainly frontier stories but very personal, with unique faces, voices and animations that characterize each step of the story. Different stories that lead to different adventures that don't need to recycle ideas to make content because they are content themselves. It is what with the necessary differences happened in the games of the past where there were the main missions, the secondary ones and then the side activities; then someone realized that he could pass off the latter as a secondary mission, and we found ourselves inundated with crap. This is not the case with Forbidden West. A solid background is always presented in Aloy's new adventure, as well as several passages that give body and variety to the tasks, and it is undoubtedly the greatest achievement of Horizon Forbidden West. Furthermore, these adventures are not just placed there, they coexist harmoniously with the map while remaining consistent in all their branches. The landslide of a rock face can have unexpected effects, while mission after mission you can witness an evolution of characters or entire villages. Dangerous climbs Horizon Forbidden West: Much better down than up, especially after unlocking Aloy's energy sail Where Horizon Forbidden West slips is in climbing, any type of climbing: the one on natural walls and the one between artificial platforms. It's undoubtedly improved over the basic one from the first game, but the fix introduced in this sequel feels more like a way to hide a problem than to fix it. It is now possible to scale a huge number of objects, rocks and of course mountains, you are almost free to do it anywhere except when suddenly you can't do it anymore. One moment you're allowed to hop to the top of a steep hill, and the next Aloy fails to grab the last and final ledge a meter away. It is a mix between technical imprecision, which in rare cases also involves very normal ladders, and indecision on the game design side, because making a totally free system would have broken other balances. In addition, climbing mountains as we've been doing for too long is a big pain: it doesn't require anything, tactics or anything else, you just have to wait until you reach the top with very little satisfaction. Armed to the teeth Horizon Forbidden West: When you start a mission you never know where it will lead you Weapon in hand, Horizon Forbidden West is sublime but not complex, therefore the simplicity of the first game remains on which, however, several layers of depth have been added. There are new types of weapons, and one of the five skill trees in the game is dedicated to melee, through which we will also be able to unlock special powers to be activated when needed during fights. Even if it seems like it, Horizon is not an RPG and you cannot build the character from scratch, so it is important to understand and accept that Aloy fights mainly in the medium and long range. The melee options are mainly used against humans who we will now meet even outside their inevitable forts. Stealth has also been improved, like the AI of the enemies which however remains deliberately permissive, naive to the right point so as not to steal the show from the absolute protagonist, the heroic and iconic Aloy. Difficulty on command Horizon Forbidden West: ... the main missions have the task of showing us even more spectacular events, and we can say that the goal has been achieved! Much will naturally change based on the level of difficulty chosen, which can be calibrated according to our needs thanks to a rich offer of options, also designed to offer the highest possible accessibility. However, if you want to enjoy the game to the fullest, among those offered, the advice is to start at a slightly higher difficulty level. You can of course enjoy Horizon Forbidden West as you see fit, but on the difficult level it all adds up, everything makes sense, and a very well calibrated progression also emerges. Of course, the fights will be more challenging, but the side missions and their rewards, in experience points and rare equipment, also serve to bridge the great gap with the enemies. You are forced to understand well how each weapon works, to exploit every trap or uneven ground available, in short, to put your head in it as well as your fingers on the pad. If you're in trouble you want better equipment, but to get it you still need to take the rarest pieces from each beast in truly exciting hunts. Future hackers Horizon Zero Dawn: Sometimes it's best to avoid fighting by trying to outflank nearby enemies As in pfirst chapter it is possible, catching them by surprise and after having stolen the schematics from the cauldrons/dungeons, electronically subduing the creatures to ride them, if possible, or to hurl them against the enemies in the surroundings. Each creature is made up of different parts, some sensitive to certain elemental attacks and others weaker against impact damage, still others can be made to explode causing massive damage to the targeted beast and those in the vicinity. The approach to battle changes according to our preferences, the pieces we want to recover and the equipment at hand. In addition, great care has been taken to let players understand how battles are going, with the larger and tougher creatures staggering in exhaustion, distance themselves if in difficulty or go all out with lethal attacks before finally collapsing at Earth. New threats Horizon Forbidden West: This sequel offers one of the best starry skies ever Backbone of Horizon Forbidden West is a storyline that further expands on the events narrated in the first game, adding a couple of decidedly effective twists. What limits its charm is the need to explain everything in detail, which may make some happy but which leaves very little room for the imagination. If it weren't for the beauty of the main missions, the characters you meet, the new mechanics that are unlocked and above all the surprising settings we have no intention of telling you anything about, we would have gladly continued to immerse ourselves in the daily life of the tribes of this Forbidden West , with their strange customs and urgent needs, instead of committing ourselves to completing the adventure. The more he explains and tells about the origins of his world, and the more Horizon Forbidden West damages itself, loses that mystery that would have made everything more interesting . Fortunately, much of the plot of this sequel focuses on the future of humanity and a surprising new threat. As you may have noticed we have tried to keep any type of spoiler to a minimum, it is good that you enjoy a world like this in first person since part of its strength is in that initial amazement that will emerge at each new glimpse, at each new surprise of gameplay that you would not have expected. Horizon Forbidden West is a great adventure to be challenged straight to the point, or to sip mission after mission (after the end credits you can continue playing without problems on the same save). Nextgen software Horizon Forbidden West: No, this is not a cutscene Horizon Forbidden West is so pleasant to play also thanks to Aloy who is always generous with good advice: she informs you verbally if there is no hope of opening the door that we have before us because we still do not have the right tool, or that there is no there is nothing left to pick up nearby, totally eliminating dead times. And then there is of course the graphics, impressive in the PlayStation 5 version but not to be underestimated on the past generation, where Guerrilla has cut the resolution and the effects to try to keep the 30 fps as much as possible, although miracles don't exist and the dear old PS4 Pro struggles tremendously to handle such scenarios. On PS5 it is possible to choose between performance and quality, as often happens: at first we preferred the highest resolution, but after the patch that fixed the frame pacing and which you will find already available at launch, we switched to 60 fps without ever going back backwards. On the chosen style, however, we can make some notes. Aloy is beautiful, deliberately more natural and believable, with imperfections and less charming expressions than one would expect from the typical video game character. Aloy is a virtual but increasingly human actress who stands out in the world of Horizon thanks to a long series of armors that still give her super heroic traits. When you eliminate the armor, but keep the realism of the features, it can happen to slip dangerously into an episode of the classic Star Trek, where the aliens have bangs and are dressed in wicker. And this is a bit the effect of certain tribes in the game that would have deserved a greater effort on the part of the costume designers, who instead have done great things with other peoples and characters. Mechanical thumps Horizon Forbidden West: in the game there are several entertainments, one of the most challenging and fun is the mechanical Batosta minigame While Horizon doesn't use physics for gameplay and exploration, physics does make its presence felt in battles with the larger creatures, capable of wiping out even quite large structures with their killer charges. The effect is extremely convincing, almost", "date": "2022-02-14", "grade": "9.0"}
