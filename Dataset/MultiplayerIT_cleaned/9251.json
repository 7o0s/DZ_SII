Unfortunately, however, the road ahead is fraught with obstacles of various kinds, and it is up to the player to ensure that the outing of the two lovebirds does not literally end up at the bottom of an abyss... Along the way Bumpy Road is developed by the microscopic Swedish team of Simogo, made up of only two people and author so far of another title for Apple devices, that Kosmo Spin which has not really remained in the annals of the video game. An objectively meager curriculum, but which miraculously transforms into added value once the undoubted qualities of the title subject of this review have been ascertained. The game is based on a structure that is quite familiar to the mobile world: instead of proposing a succession of levels with a beginning and an end, the main mode of Bumpy Road offers a single stage of potentially infinite duration which ends with the proverbial game over only and only when you make a fatal mistake. Applied to the case in question, all this translates into an objectively very simple mechanic: the aim of the game is to drive the car with the two elderly protagonists on board along a two-dimensional plane, collecting bonuses, activating switches with various functions and carefully avoiding the chasms which the route is littered with. The innovative element, however, lies in what you actually control: not the car of the two spouses, but the land below it. With the scenery automatically scrolling from left to right, the user's task is to manipulate the terrain, tapping anywhere on the road to create and move a hillock that affects the direction of travel and speed of the on-screen car, while one press exercised directly under the car allows it to jump. Despite appearances, being able to survive for a long time in Bumpy Road is by no means an easy undertaking: first of all, we must take into account the indicator placed at the top left, which gradually empties and which must be fleshed out by collecting the so-called gizmos, colorful bonuses that along the way, usually in positions that are not exactly easy to reach. It must also be said that the same itinerary structure is randomly generated every time a session is started, therefore the rule of memorizing the route and its pitfalls does not even apply; which, moreover, become more and more elaborate as you continue, including platforms that shrink, switches that make entire pieces of road disappear, trampolines that make the car treacherously jump, and so on. For all these reasons, Bumpy Road is a decidedly immediate and enjoyable arcade, even if it suffers from the tendency, common to all products that use similar mechanics, to become repetitive in a rather short time for anyone who doesn't care about achieving the best score. The two secondary modes are of little use: the first, called Gita Fuoriporta requires to reach the goal of an internship free of holes and pitfalls in the shortest possible time, an undertaking that can hardly take more than a minute and a half; the second, Strada della Nostalgia, is instead a trivial slideshow of the images collected in the main section that tell the love story of the two tender protagonists. It's a shame that Bumpy Road takes the hit in terms of content, because from the point of view of audiovisual design it is a real gem: the talented Simon Flesser has in fact endowed his work with absolutely delightful graphics and a compartment very pleasant sound, which seemed to us to wink (or rather, the ear) to the Super Mario saga as regards some effects and the mood of the musical accompaniment.
