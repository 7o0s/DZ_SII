Hero of Sparta, the original title, made its appearance on the Apple home terminal during one of the first stages of its life; it was a valid action/adventure and enjoyed all the strengths and weaknesses of the first video game productions for the apple mobile phone, including the fact that it was rather crude. In the meantime, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, a couple of new iPhone models have come out and the development on this device has certainly matured, leading to several titles that do not disfigure at all compared to those present on dedicated portable consoles and at the same time to ruthless competition, made up of aggressive prices, productions that ~pose~ to great and also marketing aimed at bringing out the title within the ~jungle~ of the App Store. Hero of Sparta II therefore arrives with the aim of heavily improving the prequel and largely succeeds thanks to a work of finishing and ~strengthening~ used by Gameloft to make the product an action / adventure with all the trappings of the case. The title to which it can be compared is certainly God of War and, partly because it is easier to explain its characteristics, partly because we are lazy, it is enough to report the distinctive elements of the masterpiece developed by Santa Monica to also frame the foundations of Hero of Sparta II: high spectacularity, huge end-of-level bosses, automatic camera movement that follows the main protagonist, mini-games to defeat dying enemies and to operate devices, even the background setting. Argos or Kratos? The protagonist is once again Argos, who has just escaped from Hades with the intention of recovering Sparta, cursed by the Gods following his insubordination and the mistakes he made. To atone for his sins he will therefore have to find the favor of some deities and face the classic thousand dangers, seasoned by some particularly angry boss, to prove that he is a worthy and valiant leader. At the command of Argo and through different chapters and three levels of difficulty, it is therefore necessary to visit a multitude of settings related to Greek mythology, where the fights and magical abilities in the possession of the main protagonist are obviously the masters. As far as the interface is concerned, on the top left of the screen we have the two energy and magic bars, on the opposite side the key for quick weapon changes, while in the lower part, control of the character is delegated to the classic configuration which provides virtual analog stick for movement and in this specific case three keys for jump (even double), attack and parry, which in conjunction with the analog stick allows you to dodge. By holding down the attack button it is possible to unleash the magic in one's possession while the system used by programmers is very intelligent to allow different types of magic including piercing, lateral or that throws the enemy into the air to perform some combos: in fact, just press the button and at the same time lightly ~swipe~ your finger towards one of the four cardinal directions, in order to carry out the desired attack. This solution works quite well and certainly adds a minimum of different strategy to be adopted based on the type of opponent, such as those equipped with a shield, which must first be unhinged thanks to a direct and powerful attack. There are also the classic interactive events that are activated when the opponent has little energy; in this case you have to immediately press some skulls that appear in different points of the screen, while Argo at the same time performs a series of spectacular slashing blows against the victim on duty. The same thing obviously happens for the bosses that await the main protagonist at different points in the adventure, and which also represent the most interesting and strategic battles. Like the one against the Manticore, where you must first use its tusk to destroy a metal structure that hides soft ground, then wait for it to get entangled in the next attack, to then deliver the decisive blow. In this regard, there is no lack of various energy spheres released by enemies and the related mini-games to take possession of them, which also apply to gears and derivatives. In this case, for example, you need to press highsome indicators placed on the sides of the screen within the indicated time limit, represented by a special bar. The gameplay of Hero of Sparta II therefore works quite well, between the good progression in the acquired skills acquired by Argo and the variety of enemies and clashes, which make the title much less crude than its predecessor. On the other hand, we have some reservations towards the lack of truly striking moments and some uncertainty in the control system when more attacks need to be ringed consecutively. This obviously also depends on the intrinsic characteristics of the touchscreen, which tends to lose precision following the continuous and frantic pressure of several keys at the same time. The technical sector also contributes to making Hero of Sparta II a high-profile production, thanks to the creation of the environments, animations and in general thanks to the overall impact, certainly above average for iPhone productions. However, on the 3GS, where we tested the game, frame rate drops are frequent when there are more effects on the screen and especially in the cut scenes made with the game engine, drops that undermine their impact which would also have been very satisfying. The soundtrack does its duty well and goes perfectly with the type of setting - albeit without giving away memorable pieces - while the dubbing, only in English with Italian subtitles, does its duty well without being synchronized with the lips. Finally, we conclude by pointing out that Hero of Sparta II is obviously part of Gameloft Live!, a social network created by the French software house that provides gamertags, objectives and a friends list, along the lines of the ever-growing array of similar services present on the Apple home terminal .
