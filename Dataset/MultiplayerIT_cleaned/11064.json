{"name": "MySims Kingdom - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mysims-kingdom-recensione_a.html", "text": "Batonmaker profession Aware that a slavish reproduction of the famous Sims brand born on PC would have had very little sense - and success - on a console like Wii, the US giant has well thought of taking an alternative route with the MySims series, created exclusively for the Nintendo platform . The facts seem to have proved EA definitely right: with over three million copies sold, the first chapter has certainly met the tastes of the public, who have rewarded a simple but effective play structure based on a weighted mix of elements taken from Animal Crossing and some happy original intuition. With this MySims Kingdom - despite the fame that often accompanies it - EA has not limited itself to resting on its laurels, but has decided to continue on the path of exploration, offering gameplay this time more oriented to the world of RPGs. Set in a pure fantasy-style kingdom, MySims Kingdom puts the user in the role of a young batonman, commissioned by King Rolando to wander around the various islands that make up the game world and solve the small and big problems of the inhabitants. As the name suggests, our hero's qualification allows him to exploit the powers of a magic wand to create objects, move them and arrange them at will on the scenario: mechanics already known in the prequel, but which here are relocated to a completely new context. Accompanied by trusted friends Linsday and Pino, the user must therefore go exploring in search of raw materials and essences, talk to NPCs, build or repair objects and occasionally amuse themselves with some nice minigames. The action in MySims Kingdom takes place following a plot that is basically repeated throughout the adventure, with slight variations here and there: it is therefore a question of talking to a character, obtaining a quest, going in search of the necessary resources and finally build the desired object. An undoubtedly repetitive process in the long run, but still quite pleasant: the essences are obtained by shaking trees, probing the ground with a metal detector, extracting minerals from the walls and so on, all activities that require a different movement to be carried out via Remote or Nunchuck. The construction part, on the other hand, is a good combination of simplicity and completeness, since it allows you to create and customize a vast series of structures with just the use of the pointer and a few keys. Sims room bin The first MySims had been the subject of some criticism for its almost total extraneousness to the brand from which it started: beyond the part concerning the choice and allocation of objects and furniture, very little was in fact left of the original structure of The Sims, especially when it comes to the social aspect. Unfortunately, it is sad to note that in MySims Kingdom the situation has not improved at all: interacting with NPCs - when you are not obliged to do so to obtain quests - is practically useless, just as completely inconclusive are practices such as washing, eating or sleeping, which really puzzles why the developers have actually decided to keep them within the play structure. Other flaws of the EA title are then to be found in the awkward management of the camera (moreover set by default to a zoom that is really too close) and in a control system that proves to be inaccurate in some cases and stubborn in refusing the commands imposed by the user, especially when it comes to rotating an object to position it correctly. On the other hand, one cannot properly speak of a defect as regards the level of challenge offered by MySims Kingdom, null in the eyes of a hardcore gamer and in any case decidedly affordable even by the most casual users: for sure, however, the game would have benefited from some more than it went beyond the simple discovery of new settings and objects. From a technical point of view, however, MySims Kingdom shows off good qualities, especially from a stylistic point of view: the super-deformed characters are nice and often draw a smile thanks to their funny facial animations, while the scenarios are varied and colourful, even if extremely simple from a structural point of view. The sound is also good, with the usual Sims-style grumbling to mark the various dialogues and effects and music in tune with the mood of the game. Comment MySims Kingdom adds a little adventure to the structure of the previous chapter, gaining us in involvement and longevity, but basically it always remains a product suitable for casual users, who are not scandalized by problems related to the control system and virtual camera and which above all does not particularly research gameplay pdeep. Taken as a rosewater RPG, MySims Kingdom is therefore a well-made product, but any other cataloging would mercilessly highlight its considerable limitations. Pros Technically pleasing RPG elements spot on Expanded gameplay since the prequel... Cons ...but still quite limited Retains little of the Sims brand Severely repetitive", "date": "2008-11-12", "grade": null}
