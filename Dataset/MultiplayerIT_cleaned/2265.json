{"name": "Freestyle Scooter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freestyle-scooter.html", "text": "My first Razor Technically speaking, the GBA title has many flaws. In fact, the colors appear very thin and the animations are of mediocre quality. Even the realization of the main character (only one, for the record) does not excel from any point of view. I would add that it closely resembles some snotty children mentioned above Another negative note is addressed to the graphics engine which suffers and even slows down in the most agitated and frenetic phases of the game. The only words favorable to the product distributed by UbiSoft are spent on the design of the levels, which have a good variety. The places available are now a park, now an airport, a stadium and a circus, for a total of four stages (I won't let anything leak out about the secret ones...). As for the framing, it must be emphasized that it follows the action from too close a distance. This is not that it's a big flaw, but it still affects the final evaluation of the game. Then let's not forget that the Nintendo portable is a console that carries its beautiful 32 bits of power on its back, and that for this reason we demand a lot more. Just think for example of the cosmetic quality of the aforementioned ~THPS~. Jump the ramp, grind on the sidewalks This ~FS~, structurally speaking, has many points in common with Activision's skateboard game. The main difference lies in the fact that here you drive a scooter and not a quad board. Obviously the title dedicated to Mr. Hawk is superior in many aspects, let's not forget that. The aim of the game is to pass various tests in certain locations, e.g. pass a particular minimum score, recover ten coins scattered in the locations, etc. As a reward for our effort, we will receive sums of money to spend on the purchase of new items or bonus points that will be used to enhance the characteristics of our character. Unfortunately, the list of available skaters is without petals, in the sense that the player is not given the option to choose other characters as they do not exist. This is a big flaw that deeply undermines the longevity of the title. Alongside this, it must be kept in mind that no type of physical personalization of the virtual alter-ego is possible. The layout of the keys on the small GBA is good but cannot be changed, and the response to the commands is also immediate. Keeping the B key pressed, you perform the prewind and then jump, while with A you perform particular flying tricks. The back R and L keys are dedicated to grabs and grind respectively. As in ~THPS~ also here it is possible to combine different series of tricks to reach otherwise impossible scores. The only flaw found in the gameplay of ~FS~ is the reduced variety of executable evolutions and exciting situations that recall replayability. Another mediocre aspect is the sound sector of the game, really reduced to the bone from the point of view of sound effects and improper from that of the choice of songs. The latter are very repetitive and fail to convey to the player those adrenaline-pumping emotions that characterize this type of production. Think of the music of the Activision title and you will immediately understand what I mean. In conclusion, the Crave Entertainment branded product stands at medium-low quality levels, offering a rather limited dose of fun. Only the great fans of the Razor and games of the genre can seriously consider its purchase. Otherwise I advise against it. Pros: The scooter is trendy. If that's your thing Cons: Limited enjoyment. Technically mediocre. A popular sport Anyone who hasn't noticed the enormous success achieved by the scooter in recent years should boast. It is now a reality; commercials in newspapers, on television and so on bombard our minds trying to convince us to buy a ~very comfortable and fast~ scooter (Razor in English). But how many people do we see, apart from a few little brats, who go around the city on board this vehicle? Very few. Starting from this assumption, Crave Entertainment decides to challenge the laws of the market with this ~Freestyle Scooter~, a game inspired by the legendary Razor with which to perform spectacular evolutions. To be honest, it reminds me a lot of ~Tony Hawk's Pro Skater~, but maybe it's just an impression...", "date": "2002-01-22", "grade": null}
