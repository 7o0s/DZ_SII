Battlefield 3 could not avoid this new golden rule of the gaming world by giving Return to Karkand a rather substantial package to those who had chosen the Limited Edition or made a pre-order, a rather substantial package, including four maps taken from Battlefield 2 , ten new weapons (with related achievement unlocking system), new vehicles and a new game mode. A free DLC therefore for spendthrifts and super confident in DICE, while all the others will have to spend the usual hard cash, or 15 or 1200 Microsoft Points. In short, a savory package, in any case nothing new and for which to tear one's clothes off, the world goes like this, fortunately or unfortunately it's up to you. Like nothing new is the usual discourse that plagues the scaling of the number of players in the console versions of the package. Twenty-four players instead of sixty-four makes the larger (albeit revised and corrected) maps a bit too dispersive. Islands on fire Four maps for a return to the past that will make longtime fans happy. Assault from the sea to control the Sharqi peninsula, taking the beach or passing the long way above. Once you arrive at the three focal points of this urban map, the TV station, the observation point and the construction site, you find yourself in the midst of furious clashes between narrow spaces and sudden openings, at the mercy of tanks and helicopters alike. Gulf of Oman is one of those maps that everyone remembers, even if you haven't played Battlefied 2 to death. The departure from the aircraft carrier is always exciting, once on the ground the typical gameplay of the series explodes between urban and desert areas where they dominate jets, wagons, dune buggies, but also snipers given the wide and almost always flat orography of the map. Attack on Karkand is just as we left it, a true prodigy of level design graced by the visual delicacies of Frostbyte 2. Exemplary in the distribution of over-elevated spaces, more intricate lower areas and secluded access routes, therefore a map in which it is, we could say, always in the open, to play hide-and-seek between attackers and defenders, where tanks and APCs are ready to massacre light-hearted infantrymen who do not take into account the level design. Wake Island is one of the maps that has seen more changes than ever before. It is enough simply to say that the two edges of the horseshoe of the island are no longer points to be conquered but simple respawn areas, consequently the tussle is all in the ~u~ area of the map. These are the maps, DICE however, as written at the beginning, was not limited only to the homework. Undoubtedly the juiciest novelty of this nostalgia package are the firearms and the related unlocking path for assignments, or in other words for objectives. The list of guns is extensive, we find assault rifles such as the FAMAS, compact machine guns of the MP5 caliber or the PP-19, but also sniper rifles, the L 96 or light machine guns such as the German MG 36. in short, for each class, to be obtained through particular actions that can vary from the simple conquest of flags to killing with the repair tool, passing through five laser designations or two killings with a mortar. The ~things to do~ list is quite extensive and varied and manages to mess up the cards on the table, to refresh a little routine routines. Playstation 3 trophies Return to Karkand awards the player with five trophies, two silver and three bronze. The former commit us to making a kill in a single life with the tank, with the jet and with the assault rifle or using the mini excavator. The bronze ones are obtained by stacking kills with the new means, by performing ten kills with each new weapon or by taking a swim in the Oman Hotel. Attack! In terms of new vehicles, the most interesting is the F35, the Marines' vertical take-off fighter, slower and more maneuverable than the F-18, which can be used in the Gulf of Oman and Wake Island. In addition to this we find the BTR-90 armed troop transport and the fast dune buggy equipped with 50 caliber. Nothing exceptional then. The other notable introduction is instead the Conquest Assault mode, which as the name implies is a mix of the two types of game peculiar to the DICE franchise. The concept is simple one team attacks and one defends. The attacker has more re-entry tickets and the goal of conquering all enemy positions immediately in control of the defenders. Division of tasks and defilade, these are the watchwords to better enjoy this interesting diversion. Here too we are faced with an appreciable destabilization of mechanisms and meccasconsolidated features of the title and which is certainly a good start by DICE for an expansion of the game offer.", "date": "2011-12-14", "grade": "8.5"}
