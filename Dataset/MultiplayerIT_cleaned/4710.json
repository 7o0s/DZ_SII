Strengthened by a partnership with DC Comics which also sees the presence in the game of some of the most representative heroes of the American publishing house, from Batman to Superman, the title brings into play classic mechanisms as regards the multiplayer online battle arena genre, with a large scenario with three different lanes (one main and two secondary), various ~shortcuts~ all to explore (watch out for hidden pitfalls, though!) and the inevitable set of towers to be destroyed before reaching the enemy base (strictly supported from a group of minions), the destruction of which will end the match. The introduction to the gameplay has been treated very well: after a simpler first tutorial and a couple of test games, you move on to training aimed at more advanced mechanics, where you can discover tricks and strategies for a better approach to the game. 'experience. The initial screen allows you to access normal or ranked matches, with human or bot opponents, to then select the type of match between Grand Battle, Skirmish, weekly events, Abyssal Clash, Single Battle and Deathmatch. We are therefore talking about a rather rich range of possibilities, ranging from the traditional structure with teams of five components to variations with three or single characters. The value of a warrior The developers of Arena of Valor have taken particular care of the progression in the game, allowing you to earn rich rewards through challenges and activities, especially those classified, in order to unlock a good part of the characters that currently make up the roster, made up of over forty warriors. The classes into which the fighters are divided see the presence of the traditional tanks, strong warriors with a certain degree of resistance, ideal for melee; ranged, equipped with weapons or spells that strike from a distance, but in clear difficulty in close combat; rogues, fast and skilled in retreats, capable of inflicting substantial damage for the same attack time; and finally the support units, which provide help to the other team members in a simplified perspective compared to PC MOBAs. In general, the experience was immediately conceived specifically for use on the move, thanks to limited timing and solutions that allow certain tasks to be completed more quickly, such as, for example, the purchase of new weapons and equipment: as the time our coffers fill up and it is possible to access a shop to pursue the construction of the character, obviously limited to the single game, but if you want you can rely on an automatic system that suggests the most appropriate objects and which therefore requires a single touch, even in the middle of the action, to take advantage of the boost. Even on the combat system front, there are clear inspirations from well-established productions, such as the League of Legends itself owned by Tencent Games, while there are few aspects that take up other MOBA experiences for iOS and Android. Certainly there is a feeling of care and solidity that is difficult to find in the mobile sector, a clear sign of a major investment by the publisher, which aims to establish itself on the App Store and Google Play also thanks to a valuable technical sector, which adds an engaging soundtrack signed by the famous Hans Zimmer to the fluid and well-designed graphics.", "date": "2017-08-29", "grade": "8.0"}
