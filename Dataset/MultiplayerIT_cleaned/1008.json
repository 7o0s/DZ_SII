{"name": "Project: Snowblind", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-snowblind.html", "text": "Cold as a cyborg Project: Snowblind puts the user in the shoes of Nathan Frost (one of the most generic and least inspired protagonists we've seen in recent times), a super-soldier tasked with putting an end to the destructive plans of a Chinese armed group in the fascinating scenario of a Hong Kong of 2065. As mentioned, the body of the brave Frost has been enhanced by cybernetic implants capable of providing him with peculiar abilities on the battlefield, an aspect that constitutes in all respects the focal point of the entire Eidos production . There are five powers that can be acquired progressively during the adventure, the use of which involves the absorption of a certain amount of bioenergy, which can be replenished following the collection of specific items. The player therefore has the possibility of adding some special abilities to the more classic half blasters that allow him to see enemies through walls, to slow down time in bullet-time style, to create an impenetrable shield around himself, to become invisible or even to unleash an electrical attack. Although undoubtedly intriguing, Nathan Frost's special abilities ultimately turn out to be too little incisive in the game economy: except for some (rare) occasions in which one is essentially forced to use them, they tend in fact to be outclassed during the adventure from the simple deployment of conventional firearms. In the same way as secondary weapons (grenades, flashbangs, temporary shields and the like), therefore, the use of these offensive options is simply too slow and cumbersome to be preferred to a few well-aimed rifle shots. The biggest limitation of Project: Snowblind can already be glimpsed from this single element, represented by a lack of balance that pervades the entire Eidos production. In addition to the aforementioned aspect, the low utility of a substantial part of the equipment supplied to the user (above all a sort of pale replica of the Gravity Gun of Half-Life 2) and the decisive superiority in terms of efficacy of one pair of weapons over all others, whose inevitable fate is to lie unused; it should also be noted the presence of inappropriate stealth sections (which, moreover, can be easily faced with weapons deployed without changing little or nothing), and the wasted opportunity regarding the possibility of piloting vehicles or controlling turrets, a digression exploited very little during the game . In short, Project: Snowblind is a title that lacks balance as some elements of the gameplay clearly overshadow others, reducing the spectrum of playful opportunities granted to the user. This does not mean that the Crystal Dynamics title is a bad game, on the contrary: simply, with greater care it could have gone much higher. Joint projects Strangely, the Playstation2 and Xbox versions of Project: Snowblind do not differ except in an absolutely negligible way in terms of graphics, highlighting how the developers' work has been oriented mainly in favor of the Sony platform. Therefore, if we exclude a few more frame rate drops on Xbox and a significant difference in loading times, the two incarnations of the Eidos product appear technically almost identical. A few more differences can be seen in terms of the control system and above all with regard to the online multiplayer aspect of the title, which enjoys the best shape on the Microsoft console, relying on the undoubtedly superior infrastructure of the Live system. Comment Projcet: Snowblind is a decent FPS, whose main limitations are related to the lack of balancing of various aspects regarding graphics, the level of difficulty and some characteristics of the game structure. Referring to the Eidos production, one can therefore safely speak of potential not fully expressed, as well as a certain lack of attention to detail that often makes the difference between a must-buy and a ~simple~ good game. Project: Snowblind is, in conclusion, just that: a well-crafted and in some ways original FPS, but one that struggles to keep up with the major exponents of the genre. Pros: Fairly successful gameplay Technical realization at the height Captivating both in single and multiplayer Cons: Unbalanced game mechanics Longevity and level of difficulty rather low Lack of care for certain aspects Fight hard without fear Despite everything, the single-player adventure of Project: Snowblind flows smoothly, offering the player a series of well-differentiated and decidedly captivating stages, capable of involving even the most experienced FPS users. Also thanks to a medium difficulty levelmind down, however, completing the main mode of the Eidos product requires only a few game sessions. Fortunately, the online multiplayer intervenes to partially compensate for this lack, thanks to a series of modes based on Deathmatch, Capture The Flag and respective variations on the theme, as well as a set of large and well-structured arenas. It certainly won't be the best FPS available on the net, but in any case Project: Snowblind plays its cards well in this area. On the other hand, the discourse relating to the poor balance of the Crystal Dynamics title as regards the graphic creation of the game, which presents a rather strident contrast between the quality of the settings and that of the human polygonal models, comes back into play. Under the first aspect, nothing to complain about: the scenarios that host the shootings appear detailed and cared for, characterized by a tasty style that cleverly combines elements of the Chinese landscape tradition with futuristic hi-tech structures. The modeling of the protagonist and of enemies and allies instead arouses more than a few perplexities, not only in terms of design (as mentioned, among the most insipid in recent history) but also with regard to the animations, rather woody and repetitive especially on the occasion of the killings of enemies. Note of merit instead for the special effects that signal the activation of a special ability or that accompany the use of some weapons, really well done. On the sound front, Project Snowblind finally presents a good choice of audio tracks and a decent dubbing, while the sound effects do their job without surprising. Summing up, it certainly cannot be said that the Crystal Dynamics title is an unsuccessful FPS: on the contrary, especially in the initial bars it is difficult to deny it an undoubted ability to involve the player and a discreet overall presentation. Nonetheless, Project: Snowblind fails in the attempt to present itself as a different playful experience than usual, peppering its gameplay with interesting but all too fragile elements, which inevitably end up falling and making room for a rather conventional game structure. Originally born from a rib of Deus Ex, Project: Snowblind then became, in the course of its development, a title with its own personality, moving away from the uncomfortable reputation of a mere spin-off. Nonetheless, the Eidos product does not hide some points of contact with its illustrious inspiration, such as the futuristic setting, the urban guerrilla scenario and above all the presence of a ~cybernetically modified~ protagonist. Similarities which, however, are limited to a substantially outline plan, given that this Project: Snowblind is in all respects a decidedly action-oriented FPS. Let's now see if the developers of Crystal Dynamics have been able to give light to a title capable of standing out within a highly competitive genre.", "date": "2005-03-10", "grade": null}
