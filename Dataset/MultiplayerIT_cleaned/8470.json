Presenting itself as a colorful action game whose protagonist is a delicious pink alien creature with feline features and two big green eyes, the Fabrication Games title seems to do its best to blend in with the boundless panorama of similar titles that crowd the App Store and Google Play. Once you put your hand to the touchscreen, however, Project 83113 punches the user in the face by pouring on him a frenetic shooter matrix gameplay and a level of difficulty that has few equals in the sector. And that's not necessarily a good thing. Nu piezz' 'e (hard)core Starting from a rather obvious plot - which in fact is liquidated by a few static images - the title puts the player in the role of Belle, destined from birth to free her people from the slavery imposed on them by an evil army of machines. A mere narrative device to justify the progress through four worlds divided into nine stages each and all characterized by a high rate of shooter action. The play structure is the classic one of the genre, with the user having to bring the protagonist to the end of each two-dimensional scenario by shooting everything that stands in front of her and occasionally indulging in some platform drift. There is no shortage of smart bombs, special shots, combo counters and equipment that can be upgraded by spending some special orbs collected on the battlefield, for an offer that, although far from being original, is undoubtedly complete. Instead, what is completely different compared to other representatives of the category is the control system adopted by the developers Fabrication Games, who evidently are not big fans of virtual sticks and on-screen keys. Once these elements have been abolished, the title rests entirely on swipes and taps to be performed on the screen: swiping your finger in one direction allows Belle to run, jump or duck, a long tap causes her to stop in place while a quick tap towards a group of enemies unleashes a powerful attack that consumes some life energy. Normal fire, on the other hand, is managed automatically, with the CPU arbitrarily deciding the objective, cadence and range: a solution that ultimately leaves us perplexed, and which above all leads to some frustration in the most agitated phases. Which, incidentally, are not long in coming: after the first acclimatization stages, Project 83113 becomes a veritable hell of bullets reminiscent of the great Treasure classics, unfortunately only from a formal point of view. In terms of gameplay, in fact, there are several things that don't work properly. To begin with, the control system is too little reactive to be able to be an effective tool in dealing with the considerable pitfalls with which the levels are peppered. Secondly, the stages themselves don't shine particularly in terms of design, with situations and enemies that end up becoming repetitive long before the end of the adventure. But the most penalizing aspect of Project 83113 is undoubtedly made up of a truly unbalanced level of challenge: if in fact completing the game is an all in all affordable (and rather short) undertaking despite more than a few frustrating peaks of difficulty, aiming for all 'getting the best ratings becomes basically impossible, unless you are willing to spend real money on a series of in-app purchases capable of making the journey easier. And it is a pity that Fabrication Games has slipped on these fundamentals, by virtue of the undoubted quality of the product, above all a frenetic pace of play and a very pleasant technical realization that shines above all in the animations of the protagonist and in the quantity of explosions, bullets and special effects that follow each other on the screen.", "date": "2012-06-27", "grade": "7.0"}
