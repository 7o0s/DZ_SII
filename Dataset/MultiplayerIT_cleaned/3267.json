{"name": "Figment 2: Creed Valley", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/figment-2-creed-valley-recensione.html", "text": "Among the many themes dealt with in videogames, introspection is making more and more headway in recent months, a journey inside the psyche divided between memories, fears, nightmares and hopes. Creating a story that leads to empathizing with the characters is not easy at all, but many developers have taken this path to bring the player ever more original stories that focus on solving even those problems that sometimes appear insurmountable. For Bedtime Digital Games it was certainly simpler, thanks to the success of the first chapter of what is now to all intents and purposes a saga, which returns to the spotlight with Figment 2: Creed Valley. In this adventure we once again took on the role of Dusty, the embodiment of the courage of the Mind, accompanied once again by the likeable Piper, a trusted companion in the dangerous missions between nightmares and worries. In this review of Figment 2: Creed Valley we will tell you about how we returned to explore the Mind, once again gripped by anguish and torment capable of creating real monsters to fight to restore serenity. But don't worry if you haven't played the first Figment; this chapter is independent and welcomes new players with open arms while offering some goodies to the most loyal fans. Open or closed mind? In Figment 2: Creed Valley we return to take on the role of Dusty, accompanied by the faithful Piper In this adventure we took on the role of Dusty, the one who represents courage, ready to fight the nightmares that grip the Mind, accompanied once again by Piper. The latter, in Figment 2: Creed Valley, does not limit itself to offering emotional support to our character but becomes a playable character through the introduction of local co-op, one of the most important innovations for the title. As with the previous chapter, we found ourselves in Creed Valley, a fantasy representation of the human mind inhabited by Opinions, funny puppets to interact with, and unfortunately a soil in which nightmares and fears also lurk in the form of monsters to fight. As we have already anticipated, Figment 2: Creed Valley is an independent chapter and the story told is not linked to that of the first game by Bedtime Digital Games; in this way you can embark on this adventure without fear of missing something important. Although the Mind in which we find ourselves belongs to a different man, this time grappling with too much work and with family discussions about economic capabilities, the gameplay remains faithful to Figment, putting us in front of melee fights with the nightmares and his henchmen and from environmental puzzles to solve in order to overcome the different game areas. To bring a breath of fresh air, in Figment 2: Creed Valley we were able to play with the possibility of making the Mind open or closed at will, a mechanic capable of reviving the game world. This mechanism is the fulcrum of the whole experience, capable of changing the scenario by unlocking blocked roads and capable of changing the Opinions, who will change their opinion by helping us to continue towards the bosses. To keep the pace of the game tight, the change between open or closed mentality can be operated via specific buttons scattered throughout the game map, which we have been able to activate at will without having to resort to complicated command schemes. Furthermore, this change of perspective does not affect the story in any way but rather it is an opportunity to interact with the Opinions and discover the different changes of opinion on the themes present in the game, such as social media or music for example. In time with the music The bosses of Figment 2: Creed Valley return to sing during the fights In addition to maintaining the resolution of puzzles, even the fights with nightmares at the end of each level remain unchanged in structure and only the creature to fight changes. The peculiarity of the boss fights in Figment 2: Creed Valley lies in the music, and by music we are not referring only to the background during the fight. The attacks of the nightmares are in fact timed to the rhythm of the song they sing, which offers another method to predict their moves. Also in this second chapter, the clashes with the nightmares are excellently made without ever falling into extreme difficulty but which only require a good quickness of reflexes to dodge the attacks and deliver blows with our wooden sword at the right time. This evaluation can also be extended to puzzles and rebuses, even more complex than Figment, but never able to make us fall into frustration to solve them. In these two aspects they are most noticeablethe progress made by the developers, capable of making the progression of the adventure more stimulating without raising the difficulty bar too much. In fact, the flow of the game flows fluidly, letting us enjoy the narrative and our path to restore peace to the mind clouded by the small and large problems that life sometimes throws before us. A fantasy brain In Figment 2: Creed Valley progression is determined by Open or Closed Mind Creed Valley essentially represents the human brain, more elegantly called Mind, but obviously designed in a fantasy and cartoonish key. The style of the game maps strongly recalls what was seen in the first chapter, but thanks to a greater presence of puzzles, the areas that we found ourselves crossing were artistically more complex and full of details, creating a delightful frame between pastel colors and objects imaginative. Although appreciable in their originality, the color pattern and the settings in general are sometimes repetitive, and the real change of scenery occurs only at the end of the key levels of the game. This does not affect its pleasantness on the screen but only determines a lack of variety that clashes with the great work done on the many types of puzzles that Figment 2: Creed Valley is able to offer. Once familiar with the environment, it becomes rather intuitive how to proceed towards the end of the area; unfortunately this did not offer great surprises in the presence of rebuses even in the most advanced stages but only a faster resolution given the mastery absorbed in the previous levels. Free your mind Between a rebus and a fight, Figment 2: Creed Valley finds the space to deal with important issues The purpose of Dusty and Piper is to fix the Moral Compass of the man protagonist of this story, and in doing so we found ourselves reflecting on the themes that this game has decided to bring to the screen. It is very easy to be deceived by the playful aspect of Figment 2: Creed Valley, so full of colors, cute puppets and singing bosses, but under this cartoonish patina there is much more than it may seem. Through the memories, which can be unlocked by continuing in the adventure, the difficulties that the man is facing are shown, from family quarrels to absence due to too much work, real situations that could afflict any person. In Figment 2: Creed Valley, in addition to showing how problems can turn into nightmares that cloud our mood and judgment, there is also the courage to know how to face them and restore peace and tranquility in one's life. Bedtime Digital Games has therefore also found in this second chapter the right balance on how to deal with particular issues without sinking into something extremely serious and always keeping in the foreground the lightness of the gameplay with which it was created.", "date": "2023-03-09", "grade": "7.5"}
