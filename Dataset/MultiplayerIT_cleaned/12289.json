After all, already from the second episode it was easy to see which path Activision would follow for the next chapter dedicated to the Marvel hero, and the expansion of the game world we witnessed in 2004 could only make us hope for the wonderful fate and progressive of the brand on the platforms still to come. In fact, what would it have been like to sway with Spidy on the spider webs from skyscraper to skyscraper, inside a polygonal Manhattan reproduced word for word with a great expenditure of polygons? Would have been nice. And in part it's nice to roam the island of New York as it was reproduced by Treyarch, actually more than satisfactory (remarkable at times), but the problems of Spider-Man 3 are evident in other aspects of the game, as we shall see. However, it would be excessive to catalog this title within the classic soulless blockbusters of which the videogame market is full, since interesting potential can be glimpsed within it, and perhaps for this reason the regret for the occasion is even greater partly nuanced: that of making, thanks to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and the most powerful PCs, finally, the definitive Spider-Man game, the one in which the thrill of exploring the city without limits is also combined with solid dynamics gameplay, with satisfying controls and level design worthy of Spider-Man's adventures. In these last three aspects Spider-Man 3 fails the goal. A virtual Manhattan The game structure designed for this Spider-Man 3 (already partially present in the previous chapter) is decidedly interesting. Instead of a standard approach, with a plot that faithfully follows that of the film and the classic scan in progressive levels, Treyarch has decided to leave a wide freedom of choice to the player: here, therefore, after the short introductory mission-tutorial, we find ourselves directly in the shoes of Spider-Man on the roofs of the skyscrapers of Manhattan, with the city that extends at our feet and the possibility of exploring it at will in its entirety. As a kind of Crackdown, Spider-Man 3 allows us to choose between various missions opened on the streets of the city, carrying them out with a certain freedom. In addition to marginally following the plot of the film, therefore, fighting against the Sandman, New Goblin and Venom, we will be able to lend a hand to the police in the fight against metropolitan crime, carrying out various sub-missions aimed at bringing peace to the streets, or fixing some other historian villains from Stan Lee's comic such as Scorpion, Lizard, Kingpin and other minor villains for a total of 42 different missions. At any moment of the game (obviously outside the missions themselves), we will be able to call up the map of Manhattan (displayed with a pleasant zoom directly from the position we are in) and choose which ~case~ to follow: once selected, a pointer will indicate the place to reach within the city, and once you arrive, a new story section will start with some objectives to complete. The stages outside undoubtedly represent the best moment of the game, with the possibility of wandering freely in a virtual Manhattan reproduced with excellent care: it is possible to distinguish the various districts of the city, the most important skyscrapers, all faithfully reproduced. A sandbox-style system reproduces life on the streets, with passers-by, congested traffic and the transition from day to night, even if in truth the swarm of streets seen up close appears decidedly artificial, with cars and pedestrians largely equal between their intent to do more or less always the same things, but from the top of the roofs the glance works properly. As we explore the city it is also possible to deal with random events, and witness some crime live on which we can decide to intervene, and which if foiled will increase Spider-Man's reputation in a given neighborhood, but it is quite evident how these situations are in any case studied ad hoc and scripted, without involving particular unexpected consequences. Here Comes the Spider-Man Once we have selected the mission to follow, and performed our exhilarating ride among the skyscrapers to reach the hot zone in question, we realize that Spider-Man 3's problems begin right when we get to the heart of the action. The game is essentially a third-person action in which the mastery of the various motor techniques of the protagonist and the fights are fundamental. There are fromvverly an infinite number of different moves and executable combos, constantly increasing as we continue in the game, but the way in which we find ourselves facing enemies is anything but technical and creative: in fact, we are faced with a button masher, and of the more chaotic category, too. The sloppy opponent management routines and the poor camera management make the action confusing, and the fights are reduced for the most part to a nefarious beating of the attack buttons, with the only minimal tactical component given by the dosage of the slow-motion, activated by pressing the left backbone, which by slowing down the action allows dodges and counterattacks, but which requires a recharge period. Now, if such a chaotic execution of the fights can also be understandable in a street fight, it becomes tedious and frustrating in one-on-one battles in the presence of the bosses, in which case, in addition to the problems of shots and response to commands we also find the game's tendency to make some of these enemies practically invulnerable, lengthening the times of the clashes too much and forcing us to attack without precise patterns, hoping for a random lowering of the guard by the villain in question. Here Comes the Spider-Man The fights, unfortunately, are obviously the basis on which the various missions of the game are based. These generally take place indoors and impose a very limited exploration phase on the player and many clashes. Considering that the exploration of the interiors is strongly undermined by the management of the shots (among other things, it is not possible to ~center~ the camera or recall it by pressing a button), as well as by a general inadequacy in the technical realization of the environments, and that the fights involve all the negative sides described above, it is clear that the missions are the weak side of the game. In several cases, we will be faced with interactive cut-scenes, or rather quick time events, in which we will have to follow the instructions that appear on the screen and press the right keys at the right time to complete the most spectacular actions, inserted often to add pathos to the clashes (such as the aerial combat against the New Goblin, very similar to the cinematographic counterpart) and to avoid tension drops during the interlude scenes, of which we feel involved in this way. Scattered around Manhattan we will also find secondary missions, in which rather than eradicating criminals we will have to demonstrate the ability to use spider super-powers by jumping, falling from the roofs, swinging as fast as possible among the cobwebs and so on. Among these are the thrill rides based on Mary Jane, in which we will have to entertain her by performing the most daring and spectacular maneuvers with her in her arms, following her instructions, in a very similar way to what happened in certain missions of Out Run 2. An original way to insert the love story between Peter and Mary into the game. Graphics and sound Speaking of graphics, the same argument made so far remains valid: Spider-Man 3 shows its best in the city exploration phase. Even with some easily identifiable problems, such as pop-ups and a not exactly solid framerate, the polygonal Manhattan is sincerely a good thing to see. Reflection effects have been applied to the surfaces of the skyscrapers, in order to render well the effect of the huge glass and concrete surfaces of the giants of the city, and the transition from day to night creates a remarkable change of atmosphere, with the light effects that change the whole environment when the sun goes down and when the thousand artificial lights of the city come on. So far, so good, but as previously stated, it is enough to approach the ground, or enter an interior to carry out a mission for the magic to break. Once you enter one of the structures, which act as levels in criminal-hunting quests, looking around it is difficult to realize that you are dealing with a graphics engine specifically designed to take advantage of next-gen platforms. Beyond the problems of the camera, it is the anonymity of the scenarios, and the paucity of the elements present on the screen that make everything disappointing, so much so that we hope to soon end the mission to return to wandering the skyscrapers of Manhattan. The polygonal model of Spider-Man is really well done, and animated properly, in stark contrast to the secondary characters. Some of the bosses have been made with greater care, but in general it is precisely the modeling of the faces, and the movements of ~normal~ people that are not convincing. It is clear how much work has been donero to make the most of the protagonist's costume, and his characteristic movements, but it is enough to also see Peter Parker himself in normal clothes to notice how the same care has not been placed in depicting all the other characters outside of Spider-Man . As for the sound accompaniment, the whole sector was mediated by the film, with which the game shares the voices of the characters. The dubbing in Italian is good, with the inevitable jokes of Spider-Man and his friendly voice to accompany the player in the adventures. And the exchanges between the protagonist and the supporting actors, if nothing else, help to create the right atmosphere for comics, rather than for film production, and this is not necessarily a negative thing. For the rest, the music does its job well as well as the sound effects. Spider senses In a video game based on a superhero, it is necessary that the player has access to an extensive repertoire of moves and abilities, directly drawn from the character's lore, to increase involvement and make the experience satisfying. In this, it cannot be said that Spider-Man 3 is not well structured, with a really huge amount of controls and movements. The fundamental keys allow you to jump (A), sprint (LT), throw cobwebs (RT). A fundamental key during fights is the left backbone, which allows you to activate the slow-motion: when a signal appears on the enemies' heads, if we activate the slow-motion we have the possibility of dodging the incoming attack, and consequently of counterattacking with a quick response move. With B it is possible to grab objects and enemies from a distance, make them rotate and throw them thanks to the cobwebs. The X, Y and B keys are dedicated to the various attacks, which when chained together create an infinite number of combos, the number and power of which grows exponentially as the game progresses, and in particular once the famous ~black costume~ has been acquired, or symbiote. The special attacks can be performed by also combining the use of cobwebs, involving practically all the keys on the pad, or almost. Finally, pressing the right analog stick activates the ~spider senses~, with the scene turning to black and white with the exception of enemies, or points of interest, highlighted in various colors, to indicate the way or place. action to be taken at any time. Goals 360 There are 43 unlockable achievements in the game, for a total of 1000 Gamerpoints. The way these are arranged within the game follows the classic structure of single player action games. Essentially, achievements are achieved by completing the various series of missions, and consequently by defeating the various bosses, or by completing the fight against the various gangs of criminals. Other objectives, with a lower value in terms of points, are obtained by collecting particular secret objects hidden among the skyscrapers of Manhattan, or by achieving certain results in the exploration phase, such as traveling a certain number of miles whirling with cobwebs, taking photographs or ~crashing down 25 times. In general, for an average player intending to complete the game, reaching almost all of the score is not too difficult an undertaking. Comment Beyond the easy criticisms that can normally be leveled at a tie-in, one cannot fail to notice that there is still an interesting concept at the basis of Spider-Man 3, which however would have needed more time to be developed. The open structure proves to be the best approach for a Spider-Man video game, although a greater depth in the various stories, or a more defined thread that can hold them together, would be desirable. The aspect on which Treyarch should focus more is the design of the missions, which cannot be overshadowed. Had there been greater care in the structure of the quests and more satisfying fights (especially as regards the bosses) we would have found ourselves in front of an excellent title. As it is, of Spider-Man 3 the city exploration phase stands out, which really makes the player identify with the protagonist, and the indisputable charisma of Spider-Man, whose mere presence can be enough to satisfy fans. Everyone else will probably stop due to mission fatigue or camera problems. Pros A whole Manhattan to explore Spider-Man is charismatic, and well done Cons Crunchy missions Poor camera handling Too chaotic and unsatisfying fights This version of Spider-Man 3 is out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. The tested version is the one for Xbox 360.", "date": "2007-05-11", "grade": null}
