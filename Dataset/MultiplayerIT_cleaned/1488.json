From Burma covered in rainy and humid jungles to the scorching heat of the Sahara to the Norwegian fjords, it certainly cannot be said that the setting of HD2 is monotonous. Twenty levels divided into nine campaigns to be tackled in different game modes. From the various solo bonus modes (which, however, are honestly not worth a lot) to the traditional mode that allows you to choose the four men who will make up our assault dream team and the equipment that we will consider most suitable. The choice of the team is very important, each soldier is presented in detail and has a statistics system that is very close to that used in role-playing games. For each campaign we will therefore have to decide which weapons to bring, which equipment will be more useful and which men will be able to serve best to complete the missions. Concept intelligence. These will vary a lot, but the main prerogative will be your eternal and Fantozzian numerical inferiority, so very often you will be forced to act stealthily trying to get around the enemy or take him by surprise. Not bad, in this specific case, the behavior of the enemy AI: it can happen, right at the beginning, that you have to infiltrate an enemy base by yourself. Try to capture a guard and swap clothes (don't kill him or you won't be able to use blood-stained clothes): having said that, you can walk around undisturbed, but be alert because if you spend too much time near some Germans, he might realize he doesn't recognize your face, or you could also make the mistake of having an impeccable uniform but holding a non-German-made weapon in short, experiment to be amazed. The completion of the missions will increase the skills of our warriors and will give them numerous medals, in this way you will be forced to keep your head down: losing your veterans will become prohibitive as you progress through history and those cursed Kar98 will always be in your hands better, so watch out for non-regulatory air holes and squash yourself on your belly to the ground. Artful fights. If you are not very careful how you move on the field, in fact, you risk losing face in the literal sense within about two seconds. A 7.62 caliber facelift is not advisable and will drastically compromise subsequent collagen treatments, so move slowly and stay indoors. The artificial intelligence does its best to obey your orders, try to survive and kill you, in case of the enemy. The result is not always guaranteed and you can sometimes notice serious pathfinding problems, due to which your men could get lost in the middle of a stadium. Nonetheless, the clashes are exciting and lethal, the enemy seems aware of the environment around him and reacts realistically to your attacks. One of the strengths of the environment-AI interaction should be audio. The enemy and your men should react adequately to the auditory stimuli perceived from the surrounding environment: well this sometimes happens, other times less so. If firing a shotgun at night isn't the best way to secretly penetrate an enemy camp, it may happen that the closest sentries react, while the men encamped 20 meters away blissfully ignore it buck buck? Not stupid. So let's say that the most uncomfortable problems belong, for obvious reasons, to your men. As long as the enemy doesn't orient himself in his garden, never mind. If one of yours were to start spinning during a fight, the matter would be a little more serious, fortunately with your little intervention everything should be fixed. Graphic scooters. These design flaws, coupled with some AI bugs and some bad clipping, can give a hard time at times, but they certainly don't spoil the great atmosphere of each mission and the satisfaction of completing it. In my opinion, the most obvious problem with Hidden and Dangerous 2 is its age. The game should have hit the market a year ago by now. Instead it was postponed several times, probably due to strategic choices. All this can be seen from the technical implementation of the title, which takes advantage of the city action engine that made GTA tremble, Mafia, but the fact that that technology is old today is undeniable. 15 HD2 isn't ugly to look at, indeed, but it certainly doesn't keep up with rivals of the caliber of Call of Duty, at least from an aesthetic point of view. At times a bit dull textures, modelsoversimplified weapons, generally flat landscapes and brutal 2d vegetation tend to put the atmosphere, in itself fantastic, a hair subdued. The character models also implement a sort of ~rag doll~ physics to create realistic movements especially in dramatic situations, it works sometimes; others you will see the corpses curling up like dry leaves and whirling for half an hour before deciding the right position to die, a horrid little show. A significant detail is the presence of vehicles: tanks, trucks and various jeeps are all controllable in HD2, by you or by your men. Obviously they are also present in multiplayer where we notice a pleasant change compared to similar titles: the possibility of shooting from the passengers' seats, something that was generally denied both in OFP and in BF1942 and which instead enriches the game a lot. especially online. HD usability If HD2 at first glance may seem like a normal military FPS to a novice with the addition of the third person view, you should know that in reality the game is much more substantial. The tactical interface of the old first chapter has been eliminated and rebuilt from scratch: so you can command your men in real time or by choosing to pause the game. You no longer have to do abstruse calculations to synchronize their maneuvers, but you can simply create waypoints on the fly and then synchronize them via specific signals. Easier to see than to explain, the tactical action in this way does not weigh on the playability and thanks to a discreet in-game menu on the model of Operation Flashpoint or Swat3, you could even forego tactical management and issue commands to your men on the fly . In this way, each player should find the right approach, more or less tactical, more or less reflective: definitely a big step forward from the first title in the series. If the command interface is good, the one reserved for inventory management is a little less so. Cumbersome and not very intuitive, it often earns the player a free ball in the forehead, forcing him to fiddle with the controls in an attempt to pull the cursed gun out of his pockets, while the enemy laughs it off. They could have found a little simpler system, in singleplayer it can be a hindrance, but in multy dealing with the inventory becomes half a tragedy. Two words to conclude. Ultimately a good title, it would have been better to have it a year ago, but still it's a great game. In truth, at the beginning I was tempted to give it one point less, both for the slightly dated aspect (in exchange it will run on less cutting-edge systems), and for the numerous bugs (which they are already correcting via patches). But I'm an old nostalgic of the series and this episode was born as the first WWII tactician to implement vehicles, even in multiplayer ( don't say Battlefield, that's arcade rubbish! ). In short, I admit there is an emotional component in my judgment, I also admit that I haven't played it all and have to resort to multiplayer sessions to show you a few more screenshots, but the game must be enjoyed slowly and it would have taken too much to write this review. If you're bored with Raven Shield and want to change the historical period, take a look at it, but even if you're just curious to see how a good deep and playable title is built, think of him. Call of Duty may dazzle you, HD2 may take your heart. Pros: Great depth Variety of vehicles and weapons Sound at excellent levels Cons: It needs to be patched immediately Dated graphics Sometimes not very usable interface The war begins. In 1999 Hidden and Dangerous was one of the first titles to appear on the market offering a 1940s setting, giving us command of a handful of men belonging to the S.A.S. English (Special Air Service, the first commandos in history) to carry out devastating actions behind the lines of the Wermacht. He was also one of the few tactical shooters to use a tactical team management method to coordinate their actions, copying and improving the system previously introduced by the Rainbow Six series. However, where in RS it was necessary to prepare a detailed mission plan before jumping into the fray, in HD a complex sequence of orders could be created directly during the game. The title was successful despite the numerous bugs present and allowed Illusion Softwork to continue its path towards Mafia and Vietcong, which tWe all know well (ok Vietcong is actually from the Pterodon team, but we don't do tax). Now, building on the success of Mafia, these Eastern European kids have taken the opportunity to recycle the graphics engine of last fall's hit to revive the saga of the deadliest raiding team military history has ever seen. Hidden and Dangerous 2, a title without imagination to connect directly to the illustrious predecessor and show the world that you don't live on bread and Call of Duty, let's wait and see.", "date": "2003-11-12", "grade": null}
