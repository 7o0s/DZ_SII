{"name": "Metroid Zero Mission", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metroid-zero-mission-3.html", "text": "Mission Zero As easily understood from the subtitle of this new chapter in the Metroid saga, we are dealing with a leap into the past, a sort of flashback, which tells of the first meeting between Samus and the Metroids. But what are Metroids? Parasitic organisms of unknown origin, capable of absorbing the vital energy of living beings, the so-called Metroids were in all probability the cause of the extinction of the population of the planet SR 388, and now some specimens have been captured by the fearsome Space Pirates led by the entity known as the Mother Brain. Another lethal characteristic of the Metroids is that they multiply without brake when exposed to beta rays, which is why the Pirates have founded a secret base on the planet Zebes to prepare the Metroids to be exploited as biological weapons of unprecedented power. After several unsuccessful attacks on the planet Zebes, the Federation decides to send a single warrior to the Pirates' hideout, and the choice falls on the largest and most famous bounty-hunter in space, Samus Aran who, moreover, was raised right on Zebes . Our heroine accepts the assignment and it will be up to us, in her shoes, to come to terms with the Metroids, the Space Pirates and her mysterious past... If so far the nostalgics have had a certain feeling of deja-vue, we can them to ensure that Zero Mission is worth playing not only to relive Samus' original adventure, but also to discover a new slice of story and adventure that Nintendo has cleverly combined in this remake after the fateful confrontation with Mother Brain and of which nothing can be said, as an explosive twist: just know that anyone who has played Metroid Prime will have something to indulge themselves with the new revelations about the story of Samus and her childhood on Zebes... Metroid Sweet Metroid Despite the bewildering revolutions of Metroid Prime, it seems that Nintendo wants to maintain the tradition on Game Boy Advance with a title that presents almost nothing new compared to the previous Fusion: everything you are looking for in an episode of Metroid you will find in Zero Mission without too many problems. The mechanics have always remained the same: Samus begins with only her laser pistol, her space suit and modest gymnastic skills; proceeding in the adventure, however, it is possible to recover various upgrades that will allow it to come forward on the game map (divided into ~rooms~ connected to each other), opening new gates and reaching previously inaccessible places. Then the famous Morph Ball is back, which allows Samus to curl up and proceed in narrow spaces, the super-jump, the charge run and the vast collection of weapons and armor upgrades: freezing energy shots, missiles, bombs, heat shields and so on and so forth; in short, the usual Metroid upgrades and nothing new under the sun. On the other hand, the fun seems unchanged: traveling through this new/old Zebes map means embracing pure action, dodging monsters and shooting like crazy by jumping from one platform to another and solving very simple puzzles, mostly connected to Samus' war skills (the blue doors open with the blaster, red doors with missiles and so on, for example). Instead, it is the player's mnemonic skills that are heavily underestimated: a feature of Metroid is that of continually stumbling into apparently unreachable places to which one will have to return after having recovered the right upgrade to overcome the obstacle; if once this search was one of the predominant features of the game, with the user busy remembering in which place a certain upgrade would have been the solver or retracing the entire game area in search of the rogue spot, now everything is annoyingly guided by a hint-system that continuously indicates on the map which is the next area to reach in order to continue in the game. Such a system was ingenious and functional for the most lazy players in the very large world of Metroid Prime and it was also possible to deactivate it to guarantee a more demanding experience, but in Zero Mission the hint-system is forcibly imposed on the player through the map, impossible to block and therefore guilty of reducing the already low difficulty of the game. And yes, because Zero Mission is incredibly easy. Not only do the enemies represent little more than a simple system for recharging ammunition and energy, but the few bosses present during the adventure are as lethal as they are simple to defeat and even the deadly Ridley, once the best strategy to knock him down, will not take more than a minute to become a memory. Otherwise, Zero Mission follows the Metroi traditiond with the many optional power-ups to collect, for which players will actually have to scour every corner of the map if they want to complete the game 100% and unlock the various extras. Metroidian Beauty Once again, the Game Boy Advance proves to be able to handle two-dimensional graphics in an excellent way if used by expert hands: Zero Mission presents sprites of generous dimensions (and monstrous, in the case of the bosses) animated impeccably, especially in the case of Samus, the whose feminine grace and agility is reproduced in its gritty but always elegant movements. The game flows smoothly, without slowdowns of any kind (present only in the most chaotic situations or in the presence of some particularly large enemies), and the passages from one area to another are quick and painless, unable to dampen or slow down the action in any way . Even the various environments are finely made, even if some appear unquestionably dull compared to others that are much more detailed and cared for, especially from a chromatic point of view. Sonically, Nintendo has done a great job remixing the soundtrack from the original Metroid, adding brand new songs here and there, and generally making a great accompaniment throughout the game, never annoying, monotonous or repetitive. Although with Zero Mission we are not faced with an exponential leap in quality compared to the previous and already excellent Fusion, we certainly cannot complain about the care reserved by Nintendo for the technical sector of this little programming jewel. Comment Metroid Zero Mission is... Metroid. And this with all the pros and cons, first of all a play structure that has already been seen and revised, but which still remains a cornerstone of videogame programming (and entertainment) in terms of variety and general complexity. Despite the fusion of the plot between the recent Prime and the original Metroid (in a certain sense, this Zero Mission can be considered a new starting point for the entire saga) and the game system that inevitably winks at Super Metroid as Fusion itself did, Zero Mission has a flaw that already afflicted Fusion and that for some arcane reason Nintendo hasn't been able to ~correct~: the duration. Like Fusion, Zero Mission is an extremely simple title to complete, facilitated even more by rather unfortunate choices (the forced hint-system) and by a very short overall duration: just over 4 hours are needed to finish the game a first time and, by now knowing the structure of the adventure, just 5 or 6 will be enough to be able to finish it 100% a second time. To balance this aspect we think a modest dose of extras, which includes a gallery of artwork and even the original Metroid for the NES to savor for the nostalgic and experience for all new Samus fans. Nothing to say on the technical aspect which, although not amazing, remains one of the best audiovisual programs created for the Game Boy Advance. Pros: It's Metroid It's not a simple remake of the original Technically excellent Cons: Overwhelmed play structure Too easy Too short Needless to deny that last year Metroid was a small ~journalistic~ case for the world of video games: Nintendo has churned out two brand new episodes dedicated to the charming Samus Aran, whose feminine features, always hidden by her heavy armor , are known only to the daring and skilled players who completed the previous chapters of Metroid, a saga that began way back in 1986 on the NES and continued on the Game Boy four years later with Metroid II and then on the SNES with one of the most important and beautiful games of history, the outstanding Super Metroid. From that 1994 it took nine years of upheavals and new consoles for Nintendo to churn out a sequel worthy of the name, and the result exceeded the wildest expectations: Metroid Prime on the GameCube partly revolutionized the genre, becoming a masterpiece of programming; Metroid Fusion on Game Boy Advance has brought two-dimensional action adventures back to their former glory, giving the GBA toy library a little pearl. However, Fusion was not a full-fledged masterpiece, devoid of any flaw: the playful experience was in fact undermined by excessive simplicity and brevity, so much so that a handful of hours and a little patience were enough to finish the game. Now, while there are rumors of a Metroid Prime II for GameCube or for the infamous new Nintendo console, the house of Mario embraces its new and most annoying craze, that of unbridled remaking, to give the chance to all Game Boy Advance owners that if they missed it in the past to relive the first, historic adventure of Samus ... and notAlone.", "date": "2004-05-04", "grade": null}
