I feel hurt, I admit it, and probably you too. We were ready to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of GTA III together, to rub our hands at the idea of replaying together with Claude, Tommy and J.C., perhaps with shiny graphics. Instead we had to settle for the Wish version of our dreams and their promises. Big Trouble in Liberty City The new lighting in GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition performs very well in some ways, but in some cases the image is simply too dark to remain legible It happens to get a remastered wrong, not to believe it enough. How many have we seen worse than the original? The difference is that in this case we are not talking about any game, GTA is a cultural phenomenon, nor any occasion, given the very important anniversary. With the due differences, playing with these new versions was like seeing a work of art defaced, ridiculing the Mona Lisa with a mustache. We cannot know what went wrong, but the modest result is now before everyone's eyes. However, we don't want to call it a disaster, because in reality there is something good in GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, but perhaps this is precisely the thing that makes you most angry. Half of the work done is even very good: we see that we have not limited ourselves to stealing what has already been done by the modders, we note the presence of an apparent cure that at least in GTA III improves, and a lot, the original product. The third GTA is undoubtedly the one that comes out best from this remastered, after all it was also the one that had the least to lose in terms of graphic detail. Layers of imprecision The main avenue of Vice City has definitely improved, like the general look of the city, a pity for a series of ingenuities that heavily undermine its atmosphere It is by continuing to play that more and more smudges emerge, a sloppiness that we certainly would not have expected from one of the richest and most talented software houses ever, which has made a name for itself for its maniacal attention to detail. The three games are plagued by rather big problems that are unlikely to be solved in a couple of updates: overlapping textures, a new lighting system that gives as much, but takes away equally, badly written signs and polygonal models that tend to pose unnatural if not even formless. Added to these are a lot of bugs which, in the best cases, made us smile and in the worst cases prevented us from playing: with Vice City on PS5 it was a continuous crash, in GTA III we crashed with the car inside the map a dozen times, and countless NPC weirdness we've witnessed. Fortunately, these types of problems are easier to solve and once they are out of the way they should at least give us back the pleasure of continuing to play. A half job We love the new design of GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, it's a pity that it is not consistent with itself and many NPCs have been literally destroyed for this, totally stripped of their charisma The feeling is that everything has been done halfway. Graphically at first glance the improvements are fantastic, but then you start to run into shortcomings that make your arms fall, such as the absence of a fog that hides part of the map, so we don't see the beginning and the end of the open world revealing its perspective tricks. Even the work done in rejuvenating the graphic style seems to have been left unfinished: the idea of maintaining a more abstract and gaudy aspect is to be rewarded, as well as being in line with the wishes of Rockstar Games, and what has been done with certain characters is commendable, while others have been totally defaced of their original features, annihilated by unacceptable texture work. Claude and Tommy Vercetti for example are wonderful, behind Claude's new face there is a beautiful studio for example; to C.J. like many other secondary characters, it went much worse. The best of the past, the worst of the present Images you can hear It's as if the work on this GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition started like a rocket and then along the way all the parties slowly realized that it wouldn't have been a walk in the park at all, especially for the small software house which had been entrusted with the task . This is the only possible explanation for such fluctuating quality, for a product that gets as many right as it does wrong. Damage for everyone, for those who couldn't wait to relive the three adventures at the top of their shape and for those who hgot to know Rockstar and its games later, and they were waiting for an opportunity like this to discover the origin of a blockbuster like GTA for the first time. An inconsiderate operation since replaying it is like a sort of history lesson on game design applied to open worlds, therefore interesting regardless. Furthermore, not without a certain surprise, we must admit that the three games remain extremely entertaining, as well as bringing to light a gameplay that pushes on interaction and creativity and has not yet had to give anything up to the cinematic ambitions of the subsequent titles. It is in these three games that the sandbox nature is most prominent, where for each mission you can come up with your own unique solution, to proudly show off to your friends. Masterpieces that have made history, nothing less, treated here as video games of little consequence.", "date": "2021-11-18", "grade": "6.5"}
