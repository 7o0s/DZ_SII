The chaos of mobile productions demonstrates how it is relatively easy to put together a captivating product starting from a good stylistic intuition and an up-to-date technical realization, but if the ingredients are not amalgamated in the best way the result can lack verve or go join the numerous titles with artistic ambitions that now crowd the digital school, also because the way out of this mannerism is not clearly visible: you have a good idea, a beautiful style, a technical realization, even excellent, but you are unable to grasp that volatile alchemy that distinguishes a good game from a nice one to look at. Nintendo's approach to this prt--porter indie environment, which has clearly emerged with the new wave of digital titles announced for Switch, opens up a scenario that will be interesting to keep an eye on in the coming months: the home of Kyoto has opened the doors of its ~domestic~ console (if we want to adopt the old official categories) to productions of even very small dimensions, but it is safe to bet that accessing these to the eShop does not happen without a criterion. It is not yet clear what the internal policies are and obviously it will be difficult to precisely follow any quality standards imposed, but if one were to think of a fusion between the Nintendo spirit and the typical style of indie productions for the mobile market, the result would be quite similar to Kamiko. A game that at first glance may seem too spartan, but from which it is difficult to break away. Three girls and many problems to solve: here is the hard world of Kamiko Portals, switches and trouble The story is extremely simple, as befits a pretext to slash around and put the demons back in their place. In short, there is a multi-dimensional chaos to fix that has generated an invasion of hostile creatures and the only possibility of salvation lies in the fighting skills of three different priestesses, called to purify the portals capable of keeping the various dimensions at bay and restore universal order. There is something Shintoist in all of this, even if to tell the truth it is touched in a rather superficial way, visible just in the characterization of the three girls and in the style with which some elements of the scenario are represented, with an interesting mix of technological elements , natural and imaginative. At first glance Kamiko may seem like an emulator of the old pixel art Zelda, but it's actually more of a hack and slash style action game with adventure elements connected to the solution of various rather basic environmental puzzles. The progression by levels gradually introduces the different puzzles present, which usually focus on the activation of mechanisms, portals and switches or on the movement of elementary objects and combinations. The difficulty lies above all in extricating oneself within the maps and understanding the connections between the elements of the puzzles and the passages that open within the scenarios, all while also keeping at bay the myriad of enemies who continue to appear every few steps due of a wild and relentless respawn, which nevertheless fits perfectly into the mechanics of the game. The basic structure provides, in any case, the purification of four portals scattered within the levels and then the teleportation to the boss fight, which represent the most exciting moments in terms of combat. In addition to the energy of the protagonist, which can be expanded by finding the ~heart holders~ hidden around the levels, there is also a second energy bar to take into account which determines the possibility of activating switches, opening chests and using moves special, with the latter recharging by eliminating enemies and ringing combos. Three girls against all The choice of the protagonist among the three girls present has not only an aesthetic value, because each of these has a weapon and a unique fighting style that significantly changes the style of play, even if the general structure remains unchanged. Yamato owns a gigantic sword and prefers short-range combat, also equipped with two bizarre horns; Uzume is armed with a bow, which allows her to shoot arrows from a distance and with various effects, finally Hinome places herself in a sort of middle ground, with the possibility of throwing her shield from a distance and delivering quick sword strokes waiting for this returns to destination. Each priestess has da unique approach to the enemy and differentiated combos, elements that partially but significantly modify the experience. The differences are not abysmal but marked enough to push you to replay using all three characters to try out the various fighting styles, and given the brevity of the game this represents an excellent way to lengthen its duration. Quite frankly, already from the first game it is possible to conclude Kamiko in (much) less than two hours, and even multiplying this figure by three does not reach a sufficient amount of hours of play to meet the current standards of the traditional videogame market. It should be taken with a different spirit, always keeping in mind that it is a title that can be purchased for 5.99 euros, therefore closer to the standards of the mobile market than to those of the consoles. It must also be said that the Skipmore developers seem to have wanted to play particularly on this aspect, timing the conclusion of each level and thus stimulating competition focused on execution speed complete with rankings, to the delight of speedrunners. The joy of the pixel There's not much left to say that hasn't already been said millions of times about pixelated graphics, so much so that it's now more impressive to see a classic 2D game with ultra-sharp graphics. However, a particular mention must be made for Kamiko's appearance, above all for the compactness and general coherence of the technical realization. The team is Japanese, and this is reflected in the non-obvious use of Shinto and typically Japanese culture elements that are perfectly integrated as aesthetic factors within the strange world outlined for this game. Sprites and animations are quite simple compared to even indie productions but of a higher level, however the overall effect is very positive, thanks to the originality with which scenarios and enemies have been represented and the excellent quality of the animations, elements also underlined from the large amount of characters on the screen that give a great sense of movement to the composition. The few levels that make up the story are very characterized and diversified from each other, and the style with which the elements of the scenario are represented well underline the mysterious tone of the strange ruined civilization to which they refer. The musical accompaniment lends itself well to the semi-nostalgic operation to which Kamiko seems to tend at first glance, however, as for the graphic sector, the music is also characterized by a somewhat original touch while falling within the canons of the classic ~chiptunes~. The surrounding story is not particularly thorough, and perhaps the whole extra-game sector could have been better exploited, also considering how the excellent characterization of the three protagonists would have lent itself to a greater number of interlude scenes.", "date": "2017-05-05", "grade": "8.0"}
