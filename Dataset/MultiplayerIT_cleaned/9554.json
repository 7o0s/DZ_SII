{"name": "Il tempo di un'attesa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82516-dinner-date-il-tempo-di-unattesa.html", "text": "Julian Luxemburg sits in his kitchen, in front of a table set for two people. Later, with a quick glance out the window, we discover that he lives in a city in England. Perhaps an outlying area of London. Julian is seated, waiting for a girl. We don't know anything about her yet, only that she's late. Over time, the suspicion that the long-awaited guest will never arrive will creep into Julian's mind (and ours). Like Godot. But Julian's is not a metaphysical expectation. On the contrary: it is very likely, and it is easy to believe it right away. Also because we occupy a privileged position during that wait; we are in fact inside his mind. We are his subconscious. Id, ego, and superego Dinner Date is not a video game. It's an experience. And as such it must be considered, above all in order to be able to give it the right value, even monetary. Everything happens from Julian's point of view. We see through his eyes, and we can neither interrupt nor interact with the stream of consciousness that is unstoppable in his mind. As in everyone's. Twenty-five minutes of recorded voice introduce us to this character who ends up becoming a person. We discover his weaknesses, petty thoughts immediately followed by a sense of guilt, the relationship with his boss in the office, with Jerry, the friend who prompted him to invite the girl he's waiting for. And we also discover his desires, as well, as they appear seemingly random to the conscience of each of us: sexual desire, the expectation of a night together, and then frustration, when the plan seems to fade definitively. But also the reasoning made to convince yourself that what you want is not that important after all. And finally the suspicion that behind the sexual desire there is also the need for warmth, the will to establish a relationship with that girl yet to meet. Maybe Julian really likes that girl. And then there's his relationship with poetry, his delicacy. Because Julian is an intelligent, multifaceted person who enters us as we enter him. You may ask yourself: what role does the subconscious play? To know the answer, reflect on what you did without thinking as you read these lines. Have you moved a hand ~casually~, or have you been distracted by looking at your cell phone ~without thinking about it~? That is the subconscious, operating within each of us. And Jeroen D. Stout, the creator of Dinner Date, has devised a sublime technique for us to experience it. The unbearable lightness of being The dinner time is marked by sips of Otra Vida, a fine and refreshing Argentine Merlot, which Stout advises us to sip while listening to Julian's thoughts. But how can we act? From the beginning to the end of this solitary dinner, spheres appear before our eyes with a letter inside, each associated with an element external to Julian. By simply pressing the corresponding letter on the keyboard, we will make Julian perform an unconscious action, such as looking at the clock, moving his hand, or dipping a slice of bread in the sauce and then biting it. The bread, the soup, the wine, will soon become the object of his mechanical, neurotic gestures, and we will be the ones to mark the rhythm. As the stream of consciousness envelops us, we end up ~feeling~ what Alexander feels and consequently behaving, as if we were him, without even realizing our gestures. Is your frustration and blood alcohol level rising? And so we eat bread with renewed frenzy and greed. Nervous chewers. Does Julian suddenly lose his temper? That's when we let the spoon go into the soup. When we reach this degree of automatism we have achieved our goal perfectly. We have become the subconscious of Julian Luxemburg.", "date": "2010-12-22", "grade": "S.V."}
