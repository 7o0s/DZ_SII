{"name": "Devotion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devotion-recensione.html", "text": "Devotion is a first-person horror story developed by RedCandleGames, the same independent Taiwanese software house to which we owe the splendid Detention. We are talking about horror stories because in reality the genre is just an excuse to tell a story whose main theme is religion and the relationships of a Taiwanese family of the 80s, made up of a former actress, a screenwriter and a child in poor health . Almost the entire adventure takes place inside their home, with some quick sorties through the corridors of the apartment building where they live. There are also sequences that take place in other places, but let's avoid describing them so as not to commit the crime of spoilers. The point of view of the player is that of the screenwriter, through whose memories the whole story is reconstructed. The player's objective is to explore the house in different moments in time, indicated precisely by the calendars hanging on the walls and by other objects scattered around the rooms (it is important to keep track of the various time jumps to reconstruct the precise succession of events) and solve some simple puzzles, all related to the story we are living. Devotion never clarifies what we are doing and why we are doing it, but, while opening up to many interpretations, it never hides plot holes behind ambiguities of manner. Proceeding in the story it is possible to assume that our goal is to remember, but also to come to terms with reality. In any case, we are forced to follow a precise path in which religion (we speak of Taoism and Buddhism), always present even when latent, is contextualized within a precise social framework, made up of worn-out relationships, personal failures and expectations excessive that end up becoming a real mental illness. Everything is introduced into the game and told with incredible delicacy, leaving the player time to look around and get familiar with the scenario, telling him a lot without revealing anything about what he is about to experience. Devotion does not allow loopholes and does not require the viewer to determine anything, but only to take note of what has been, especially in the brutal ending where one is caught up in the illusion of being able to really resolve the situation and then be faced with a chilling truth that is a mirror of human misery represented by the characters in the game. There is no escape for either the protagonist or the player, forced as he is to come to terms with his impotence. The Winnie the Pooh meme and bad reviews A few days after its launch, Devotion was the subject of a minor political incident, resulting in a flood of negative reviews from Chinese Steam users. Basically, a meme was discovered in the game that mocked the Chinese president Xi Jinping for the Winnie the Pooh case. Some of you may remember that the latest Winnie the Pooh film was censored in China because in some poses the cute little bear was considered too similar to Xi Jinping. Obviously the absurdity of the case became the subject of strong satire, of which the Devotion meme is simply a sequel. However, the presence of the meme was seen as an attempt to divide China and its government. The protests became so vehement, making Devotion go from very positive to partially negative reviews, that Red Candle was forced to remove the meme and apologize publicly. Horror adventure Speaking of game mechanics, Devotion is a title of incredible simplicity. The player can only walk, examine and collect objects and documents by placing them in the inventory, then when needed he can use them with other objects in the scenario or he can simply review them to clarify his ideas a bit. Although set within multiple timelines of the same space, transitions between them are handled as if they were placed on a continuous linear structure, with only one sequence allowing for freer exploration, where actions performed in a certain timeline can affect others. During the entire adventure you can die in a single juncture: for other games it would be a defect, but here you don't pay too much attention once you get carried away by the story, unless you are specifically looking for a horror focused on jumps on the chair. Indeed, paradoxically the story is so engaging that having to constantly worry about staying alive could have been counterproductive, distracting the player from observing the scenario and breathing in the very sickly atmosphere of the house, which becomes more and more oppressive as the game progresses. The puzzles of them are mvery simple - the only more complicated section requires you to move between multiple timelines of the house, but it's nothing insurmountable. Here if we want comes the only real flaw of the game, namely the small duration (it takes three hours to finish it the first time). Mind you: in our opinion it is the perfect time for the story being told, which also allows you to replay the whole adventure at least a second time, to re-evaluate some details that take on a very different meaning when you know the whole story. After all, we know that this is a sensitive topic and therefore it is right to warn you. From a technical point of view Devotion is an excellent independent title. Completely 3D, it does not offer who knows what quality in the individual resources, but the developers were able to use what they had available in a creative and effective way, managing to create high-impact sequences with little effort, those that remain in memory for years (especially the final one is really creepy). Industry rhetoric would have us say we'd like to see Red Candle grapple with more production, but the truth is we'd like to see more major development studios making such inspired and uncompromising titles, however small.", "date": "2019-02-25", "grade": "9.0"}
