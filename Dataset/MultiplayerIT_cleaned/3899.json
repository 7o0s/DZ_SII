Over the years and the exponential growth of the team, CD Projekt Red has aimed higher and higher and if the main chapters have seen constant improvements, there have been even parallel experiments such as, precisely, the Gwent. Thronebreaker is a rib of this idea, a production that captures its essence and transports it to a better constructed context, giving a meeting point between the card game and a beautifully narrated visual novel. After landing on PC, Thronebreaker also arrives in the console version and today we tell you whether or not it may be worth throwing your head down and starting a new adventure in the valleys of Lyria. Playstation 4 trophies Many trophies for this console version. In addition to the classic goals to be achieved through the completion of the Thronebreaker campaign, many will require you to carefully explore the game map. There are treasures and decorations to collect, weapons and special cards, as well as you are required to collect wood, gold and soldiers in large quantities. Approximately thirty hours to reach full platinum. A successful mix of genres and mechanics This Thronebreaker, the Witcher Tales arrives a few weeks later than its PC counterpart and many, to date, have not yet managed to get a good picture of the production of CD Projekt Red. The title is obviously aimed at fans of the card game but even those who are not accustomed to the genre should take it into consideration, especially given the setting and the refined care in the narration and dialogues. Thronebreaker, as we said earlier, is an explosive mixture of different genres and from the beginning it tries to address a heterogeneous audience by showing three difficulties that are well suited to the different spirits of the players it wants to involve. For example, easy difficulty not only limits how complex fights and puzzles will be, but also adds the possibility of skipping battles completely to enjoy Meve's story only. However, we do not want to go too deeply into the game mechanics since in our previous review we analyzed the title in its most intimate detail. With this article we therefore want to reiterate what was said then: the production is certainly a winner and the arrival on consoles does nothing but open the doors to new players. Control-wise, the lack of a mouse isn't overly felt, with the card selection and dialogue menus adapted perfectly to simple analog stick use. Rummaging through the different options, choosing the cards to play and opening the tooltips to read the effects of the cards is the simplest and most intuitive thing there can be, for a perfectly successful conversion from this point of view. The slowness of the gameplay and its intrinsic calm obviously favor everything but the fluidity of the game action should still be underlined. The animations of the cards are well done and go beyond the usual effects added to the usual artwork for this genre but it should be noted that a good care is taken for the whole artistic sector, which even on consoles manages to raise Thronebreaker above the standard. The only negative element found, at least for the moment, lies in the slowness and frequency of some uploads and in some micro freezes within the main camp, nothing that in any case affects the good performance of the title, especially if you are from just passed on the ashes of Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden. Over twenty hours of gameplay When not dueling bandits, monsters and mad cows, the title offers an isometric view and a map to be discovered. There are secrets to locate, collectibles to collect and over twenty hours of gameplay to fully complete the production. Even in the most open sections the console version of Thronebreaker remains fascinating, with bright and vivid colors that mirror what The Witcher 3 has shown in its main series. The only real sin therefore remains the low frequency of battles to be fought with our built deck and for which we have collected resources and studied strategies. Unfortunately, Thronebreaker in fact presents many duels based on unique puzzle-like mechanics, requiring the use of gray matter with the cards made available rather than deckbuilder skills, a positive factor for many undoubtedly but also a limitationfor those who have already had to do with Gwent.", "date": "2018-12-12", "grade": "8.0"}
