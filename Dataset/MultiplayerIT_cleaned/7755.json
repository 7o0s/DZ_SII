Curiously, we often forget another brand signed by Naughty Dog which perhaps has always gone a little quiet due to the resounding success of its brothers: the Jak and Daxter trilogy for PlayStation 2 is however one of those unexpected sleeper hits on which no one would ever bet just by looking at the cover, without being able to detach from the joypad after a few minutes of play. After being proposed in high definition for PlayStation 3, the Jack and Daxter series now lands on PlayStation Vita, offering the desolate playground of the Sony console a new source of pride. However, not everything went smoothly... The trilogy that takes you away In terms of content, the PlayStation Vita version of Jak and Daxter Trilogy is absolutely identical to the PlayStation 3 one: we therefore refer you to our review of the previous port for an exhaustive and detailed study of each game. Here we will limit ourselves to discussing the highlights of each title with a look at the evolution of the brand. You see, when Jak and Daxter came out way back in 2001, it was received very coldly: it seemed like yet another platformer with a somewhat anonymous artistic direction in a period in which the genre was decidedly overabundant. It only took one game to realize that you were in for something different: a third-person adventure with a decidedly cinematic cut full of action, puzzles and platforming sequences. Undisputed protagonists Jak, the boy with the impossible hair, and Daxter, his friend transformed into a weasel. It is precisely to restore Daxter to his original appearance that the two heroes set off on a journey, face countless enemies and save the world in their own way. Critically acclaimed, Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy spawned a sequel just two years later, titled Jak II: Renegade. Even today, opinions about Jak II are mixed to say the least. It was clear, already at the time, that Naughty Dog was experimenting, because the atmospheres and tones of the game were practically unrecognizable: in Jak II, Jak was captured, tortured and transformed into a hybrid with exceptional powers. Saved in extremis by Daxter, the two heroes become fugitives with the aim of making the bad guys pay for it; a decidedly distant picture from the more light-hearted one of the prequel. Easier said that done: Jak II is still a decidedly difficult title today, it is no coincidence that Jak can count on a wide range of aircraft and unprecedented firearms to take out the enemies who will block his way. The structure becomes that of a ~proto free-roaming~ and the scene is often stolen by the sequences of a real third-person shooter. Halfway between The Precursor Legacy and Renegade, both in terms of atmospheres and in terms of design, is the third and last title in the series, Jak 3. At this point we could say that the die has been cast: the platform component is practically abandoned in favor of many more firearms that transform the game into a real hybrid between an action game and a shooter. Jak has even more special powers than before, and has to deal with the exile imposed on him by Haven City for fomenting the riot in the previous episode. The narration is even more insistent, but there is a pleasant return to the light-hearted and ironic tones of the first episode. Nonetheless, Jak 3 is also the least innovative of the three; derivative, indeed, in every respect. PSVita trophies Each title that makes up this compilation has its Trophies, therefore, in total, you will be able to unlock 82 bronze, 31 silver, 11 gold and 3 platinum Trophies. Completing the three adventures, of course, is essential, as well as collecting every secret object, overcoming every mini-game and performing some particular actions. If you are a collector of Trophies, Jak and Daxter Trilogy will really be bread for your teeth. To each his own That of Jak and Daxter is a trilogy that affects each of us in a different way, an already evident sign of the great variety and particularities that distinguish each episode. If it is true that Jak II: Renegade had divided the opinion of the players, it is equally true that some liked it even more than the first of Jak 3, above all for the free-roaming component on which Naughty Dog had then made a bit of gear back to the next title. Jak 3, the most balanced of the trilogy, is also the least daring and surprising, yeshowever, crushing the first two episodes from a purely technical point of view: released in 2004, it is still today a visual splendor even embellished by its new high resolution and further gratified by the splendid PlayStation Vita screen. In this sense, we can only suggest that you play the three episodes in chronological order, also to appreciate the evolution of the series and, at the same time, of the developer. That said, the PlayStation Vita port of Jack and Daxter Trilogy suffers from quite a few shortcomings that penalize its final evaluation, despite the contents being almost identical to the PlayStation 3 ones. The problems are mostly of a technical nature: unlike the PlayStation 3 version, anchored to 60 frames per second, this port barely exceeds 30 and it is not uncommon to see the frames drop visibly, especially in the most agitated situations or when the camera gives numbers. Situation, the latter, painfully frequent. The control system has also been penalized in the conversion: the idea of using the touch screen to manage some mini-games is good; very bad that of relegating the function performed by the R2 and L2 keys on the PlayStation 3 to the rear touch pad. Not only is this a decidedly inconvenient solution, but also not too functional given that it often happens to detect a significant delay between the input of a command and its consequence, especially when using touch controls. The total absence of exclusive extra content for the portable console closes the circle: a real shame, if you think that a year has passed since the original release. Jak and Daxter Trilogy remains an unmissable compilation, but the Vita conversion could have been better.", "date": "2013-07-04", "grade": "7.0"}
