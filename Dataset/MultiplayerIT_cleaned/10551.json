The player's task will be to ~impersonate~ the president of any nation in the world (there are both campaigns with objectives aimed at individual states as well as the free mode in which you simply have to bring your country to dominate the others) and guide your people through the very serious economic crisis, between arms races, international intrigues, disgruntled trade unions and corrupt & corruptible ministers. The tools of power are quite simple: a game screen with a satellite shot of the globe and the mouse pointer will give you access to control all the nation's infrastructure, from the railway network to the salaries of social classes: you can choose a game speed suitable for you, as the title is in real time, and making whole days go by in a few seconds or making a single day of your mandate last several minutes, based on whichever is more convenient for you: given the amount of activity, the board what we give is to play very calmly. Someone could speak of a simplistic interface and graphics reduced to the minimum terms (the zoom function of google earth sometimes allows greater levels of detail), but to tell the truth, the general aspect is quite engaging, and, if played alongside a glass of brandy and without anyone to remind you that your room is not exactly oval and that it is not true that by clicking ~ok~ you can order the nuclear bombing of Paris from your PC, you might be able to identify yourself quite a bit in the part. I wonder what President Ford would do... Supreme Ruler is, as already mentioned, a strategic simulator. In addition, it is a very high level strategic simulator, of which the neophyte or not very patient player will tire a lot before reaching the end of the thirty chapters that make up the tutorial alone. Despite the apparent simplicity of the screen, in fact, the priorities on which you will have to base your nation are endless, starting with the raw materials. There is no self-sufficient nation, which means that you will have to respect the treaties that bind you to the supply of raw materials, otherwise you will no longer even have the gas for the latte (and it is not a joke: try to have supplies disconnected from Ukraine) . At the same time we must think of the relationships with the enemies of all time, which it would be better to avoid resulting from the first minutes of the game in total war with anyone. And what about the unions? With associations? With tax revenue? With armaments? With factories? The supplies? The infrastructure, the floods, the grasshoppers! History teaches that there is no dictator who has not had at least advisers: in fact, it is true, assuming that you decide (and that the people concede without revolting) to transform your government into a dictatorship, just to have less problems with the press and opposition, there will still be precious ministers controlled by the PC to whom you can easily assign a list of urgent measures which they can address on their own, without you having to personally check the budget every quarter of an hour. However, you will have to keep an eye on the minister himself, either by viewing the famous registers, or simply by giving a maximum ceiling to the expenses he can make, in order to avoid problems such as military coups by the defense minister or escapes abroad of that to the economy, perhaps in the company of your latest financial report. Too bad that in reality the rather approximate AI of the ministers means that they rarely follow your priorities and more often they just eat your salary undeservedly. Domestic policy settled? Redone the Salerno-Reggio Calabria? Does the TAV finally work? Superb, then you can take care of foreign countries: concessions, treaties, divisions of airspace, trespassing of military units in international waters without permission, horns in group photos, alliances to respect, others to break, maybe wars to carry on. You understand for yourself what it means to have to take care of all this: if you are passionate about patient, reasoned, meticulous gaming, in which a single misunderstanding with the PC can lead to the end of your privileges, in Supreme Ruler you will find the game that's right for you (of the series in comparison Empire Total War has the tactical depth of Metal Slug), otherwise, it will be just boredom and frustration. Now I can't: I amtripped with the duck! The military sector of Supreme Ruler deserves a separate paragraph, although its control is the same (no strategic map to understand): once you have produced and armed your military corps (aviation, navy, infantry, artillery) it will be possible to declare war on another country and then either invade it by land or annihilate it by aerial bombardment. The AI will generally react badly to assaults, and even your allies could end up turning their backs on you if you were to demonstrate unheard-of ferocity (Saudi Arabia was able to cancel the energy treaty immediately after dropping an atomic bomb on Paris, who knows why...). It is up to you to decide the actual logic of this behavior: if on the one hand it seems imaginable that in the event of a government's proven folly the world will turn its back on it, it is not clear why countries inferior to you, which perhaps depend on the money you give them for oil or electricity, immediately cancel supplies if you invade a nation making you stronger, and therefore more economically sound, than before. It seems illogical, otherwise it would not explain why certain nations boast of their alliances with bloodthirsty dictators. Also the tacticity in war management is quite reduced: in essence, the more men you send and the more solid the supply chain is, the more likely the enemy will capitulate giving you access to its resources, infrastructures (remaining), manpower and grievances in the population, we are not to the levels of a mere statistical calculation but we cannot even speak of strategic simulation.", "date": "2009-09-07", "grade": "6.5"}
