{"name": "Real Football 2009", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-football-2009_a.html", "text": "Until recently it was difficult to imagine a great soccer game for mobile phones: Java-compatible devices had too many and such limitations, both technical and practical, to nip any enthusiasm from the development teams in the bud. Even today, terminals are often made without any regard for their playful component, otherwise the presence of thin d-pads or practically devoid of diagonals could not be explained. In any case, the progress made from a technical point of view has made it possible to at least smooth out the other shortcomings, and it is in particular the genre of football simulations that enjoys these benefits. The Real Football series was the first to define an approach to controls that has since been imitated by its major competitors, and which sees the 5 key for passing, the 0 key for shooting and the * and # keys for dribbling and crossing. The role of the d-pad has been significantly lightened, given that it is no longer necessary to direct the passes as it is the game itself that determines which member of the team will receive the ball, using visual indicators. Similarly, holding down the 5 key results in a continuous maneuver aimed at stealing the ball from the opponent, a maneuver in which the d-pad is not used at all. From the Real Football 2009 start screen, you can try your hand at a friendly match, play a cup, participate in an entire league or just try the penalty lottery. You can also access the RF League, which is one of the innovations introduced by the Gameloft title: after choosing our team among those available, we will find ourselves facing all the other teams in sequence (and we are talking about three-digit numbers) to then transmit the results on the game site and appear in the online leaderboard. This 2009 edition also offers us the possibility of using a team created with Real Football Manager Edition 2009, or of challenging a friend via an interesting multiplayer mode via bluetooth. Once in the field, the differences between the standard and the HD version are felt, and not a little: beyond a much more spectacular aesthetic aspect, in its three-dimensional incarnation RF2009 also manages to be more playable, thanks to the different visuals available and the fact that the starting setting does not see the field represented in three quarters diagonally. This is no small factor, but it takes on a more or less marked value depending on the mobile phone used: if we have a comfortable and well-made joystick, no problem in any case; otherwise, playing games ~horizontally~ will be much, much better. In short, the playability is really good, even if there are elements on which the developers should concentrate for future editions: the goalkeepers are generally too strong, and to score goals we will often have to produce a triangulation with a first shot; the AI of companions and opponents sometimes leaves something to be desired; the teams have a ~long~ squad (unlike PES2009, where there are very few reserves) and the players are in a more or less good condition, but they don't feel tired and therefore substitutions are purely optional . The game is technically very good, both in terms of graphics and sound. The latter boasts decent music and excellent sampled effects, which for once don't cause slowdowns or blocks when played. As far as graphics are concerned, there are no revolutions compared to the 2008 edition, but the results are still excellent for the bitmap version, or even extraordinary for the HD one, which boasts a really good polygonal environment: the animations are very fluid and the it's well done, with the only flaw of having players that are too ~angular~ and lacking in detail (which is only noticeable in close-up shots, anyway). PRO Technically excellent, especially in 3D Many modes available Playable and fun... AGAINST ...although a lot depends on your mobile phone Some AI uncertainty Goalkeepers perhaps too strong", "date": "2008-11-04", "grade": "S.V."}
