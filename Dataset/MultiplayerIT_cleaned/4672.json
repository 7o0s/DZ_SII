Capcom was not the utmost delicacy. In recent months, the clash between Capcom and Arc System Works has become simply epic. All eyes are on the new Dragon Ball tie-in because it looks really great, but in the meantime it seems to have become a fashion to discredit the new Marvel Vs. Capcom without even giving it the benefit of the doubt. It must be said that Capcom also has a lot to make up for, let's face it. Despite its very high quality, Street Fighter V did not catch on with the audience as it did with the prequel, and the strange metamorphosis of its quintessential crossover series, which in its latest incarnation dominated tournaments around the world, has aroused more than some suspicions. Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite didn't look great, and that's undeniable, but by now we should have learned that looks can be deceiving. In short, looking at it... it's ugly, yes. To play it instead? It's bloody funny. All's well that ends well, then? No, not really. You call it, if you want, artistic direction Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite has one major problem, and that is that it takes itself seriously. Look at Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3: visually it was super dynamic, colorful, full of energy. The cel shading fit perfectly, the animations were exaggerated, the sharp edges evoked the atmosphere of cartoons and comics because, in short, this is Marvel Vs. Capcom. A cartoon. That is, half the roster belongs to Marvel Comics, the plot is nonsense, and there's Ryu beating up Iron Man with his bare hands while Arthur and Rocket Raccoon play trumps. It's a ~pastiche~, a soup of different ideas and styles that has worked so far because the Japanese developer had developed a visual style that bridged the two universes, playing on the fact that none exists. Abandoning the MT Framework engine of Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, Capcom moved to the Unreal Engine 4 and tried a new stylistic approach. The reasons for this choice are not clear, although many think it has to do with the success of Marvel films, now one step away from being more famous than the comics that inspired them. Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite is not a bad game, technically speaking. The frame rate is very solid, the polygonal modeling is precise and proportionate, the animations are fluid, the details are wasted. The thing is, it has no personality. The new realistic style adopted has ended up making a multiverse dull that had to bet everything on eccentricity. This problem is reflected on the roster, especially on the Marvel side. No more X-Men: the Marvel universe focuses entirely on the sphere of the Avengers with some new entries such as Captain Marvel or Gamora who try to make up for the departure of Wolverine and Doctor Doom. On the Capcom side, however, we have a highly anticipated Mega Man X and a charismatic Jedah who join the usual Ryu, Chun-Li, Dante, Chris and so on. Yes, some very famous heroes are missing and yes, go figure why there is Gamora instead of the Black Widow or Firebrand instead of Viewtiful Joe, but the question is another: to put together such different characters using a realistic style that belongs to no one of them was really stupid. Despite this, once you get used to the appearance of the various characters, the merits of the new course also begin to become more evident. The action, to begin with, is much more understandable. The full-screen explosions and cataclysmic energy waves are still there, but everything is a little more contained than in the past and every combo or special move is visible and precise. The camera follows the characters without trudging and the rhythm, always sustained but less schizophrenic, guarantees a clear and punctual reading of what is happening on the screen. Unfortunately we don't feel like saying that the stages, sparse and not very animated, were so designed in favor of visual clarity: no, probably the artists were just not very inspired and some backgrounds are actually so poor as to seem static. Reboot or reboot? The roster that discouraged us so much is anything but lacking. Some old wrestlers have had a good overhaul and have become, if possible, much more interesting than in the past. We greatly appreciated, in particular, the new dynamics of Zero, Chun-Li and Dante, but also the special attacks added to the repertoire of Captain America, Iron Man and Spider-Man which finally, after many years, have been soundly rejuvenated. In some cases it will be necessary to commit to finding a dimension for them in the so-called meta. The new characters also fill the void left by the departita of mutants, as in the case of Gamora who replaces the agile X-23. Every change, from the smallest to the most evident, has been designed with a view to the new two-on-two formula. Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite abandons the historic three-on-three approach to return to the roots of Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom and Tekken x Street Fighter. Call it a reboot, if you want, we're talking about comics anyway. We have to admit that the first few hours were dramatic, as we were used to the tag team of Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 and the frantic exchanges in flight during the combos, but once we got over the initial mistrust and learned the new mechanics, it was like discovering a new world made of even more dynamic but, above all, manageable fights. The instant swap is probably the best thing that could have happened to Marvel Vs. Capcom as a series. Precisely intending to break the meta wheel that in the last entry dominated the choice of team characters only by virtue of their characteristic incoming attacks, Capcom has simply eliminated the incoming attacks. The recovery time of the exchange has drastically decreased, so now just press the appropriate key to recall our partner in the middle of a combo or any attack. Practically a kind of cancel, the switch determines an infinite number of different options without binding the player to choose one partner over another. We can start a combo, then continue it with our partner and if we manage to prolong it long enough we will be able to swap characters again. We can start a super move, call our partner and beat the opponent while still taking the slaps from our first fighter. When executed correctly, the exchange allows you to catch the enemy in the middle or interrupt particularly damaging special attacks. The new damage scaling system also reduces the chances that a long combo will disintegrate an opponent in a matter of moments. Perhaps someone will remember the matches of Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 and the combos that left no way out: spectacular yes, but where was the fun? Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite, on the other hand, is a more reasoned and balanced combat system. In this sense, the comeback mechanics related to the Infinity Stones were a real revelation. That superhuman crap of the X-Factor is just a distant memory: now the player, before the match, chooses the Infinity Stone which he can draw at will during the fight. The Gems are six and each one gives a different themed ability. The Space one, for example, attracts enemies to the player, while the Power one grants an attack that pushes the opponent back. Once the appropriate indicator is charged, a sort of ~super move~ can be used which amplifies the power of the Gem and so, going back to the example above, the Space Gem traps the opponent while the Power Gem simply increases the damage of the attacks. Gems are actually more subtle comeback mechanics, all of which revolve around the player's intelligence and ability to recognize possible synergies between their powers and the fighters they've selected. The Time Stone, which grants rapid movement, is a great choice if you select fighters like the extremely slow but powerful Hulk or Nemesis. Playstation 4 trophies Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite offers 47 trophies. In addition to the platinum on top, we're talking 34 bronze, 9 silver and 3 gold trophies. Figuring out how to unlock them is easy, doing it is another matter. Start by completing the story mode, the arcade, missions and so on, many will unlock almost automatically, while others will make you sweat a lot. Mom, I got convergence! Beyond the excellent gameplay, one thing that amazed us about Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite was the story mode. It is perhaps the moment in which the dissonance between the aspect of the game and the topics covered appears most evident, because what they feared to be a lackluster pretext for us to fight turned out to be quite the opposite. In the sense that the fights are a pretext to remind us that we have bought a fighting game. In fact, the Story mode consists of a long series of cinematics interspersed with short clashes in which we will be forced to control one or two characters against various enemies who can be Ultron Sigma's anonymous henchmen, the various villains or our own battlemates. Don't expect a work of great narrative impact, mind you: in the approximately two hours that the campaign lasts you will witness some of the most unlikely scenes in the history of the franchise. Maybe you thought you saw it all when you slapped Magneto with Arthur, but nothing can ever prepare you for the Ryu / Hulk team-up against Monster Hunter's Jhen Mohran. Why yes, by the way, some characters already appear in the story mode that we will see in the form of DLC, such as an anonymous monster hunter and the better known Black Panther, guardians of the new city of Valkanda. Ultron Sigma has in fact used the Reality and Space Gems to merge the multiverse into a new dimension and our heroes must stop him at all costs, even that of relying on the Mad Titan who once killed half the universe for a crush. The plot of the campaign is surreal, but fun and full of bizarre quotes (A.I.M.brella wins everything, in our opinion) even if in the end it doesn't leave much. In addition to the Story mode, Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite offers the inevitable training mode (which can be played online with a sparring partner) and missions that force the player to complete long and intricate strings of combos. The Arcade mode unveils a series of matches without major surprises, while the multiplayer mode is the usual, divided between ranked and non-ranked matches. Finally, a small page dedicated to the illustrations and movies unlocked by beating up heroes and villains here and there closes the circle.", "date": "2017-09-18", "grade": "8.0"}
