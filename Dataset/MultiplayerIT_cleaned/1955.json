{"name": "The Terminator Dawn of Fate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-terminator-dawn-of-fate.html", "text": "More than a soldier a walking rack..... Let's go back to talking about the video game in a stricter sense: Terminator is a classic action game, in which the only really important thing is the number of magazines still available to us: we proceed in the game, through miniquests, relying only on our skill in dodging and firing shots at the hundreds of endoskeletons that block our way, leaving out the aforementioned stealth approach; here we just shoot, the only ~puzzles~ to face are those that allow us to identify the weak points of the mid- and end-of-level bosses. To reach the final half of the game we will have a large and very well thought out arsenal available, starting from a pair of automatic pistols that is so John Woo, to arrive at a sensational electromagnetic wave generator: in the middle a vast choice of various lasers , machine guns, rocket launchers, shotguns and nukes. In addition, as if that were not enough in case we were left dry, as an extreme ratio we can also rely on a practical plasma mace, as well as some inevitable and highly inflated kung fu moves. The game is structured in 10 macro-missions (which we will be able to replay by varying the difficulty coefficient), each of which in turn divided into several levels during which our destructive fury will be implemented not only through the aforementioned firearms, but also thanks to the intensive use of fixed positions such as laser turrets and heavy machine guns. The levels, actually all quite the same, will make us visit the Los Angeles of the future as it appears in Cameron's films, we will act inside a hotel, a mental hospital, in the subway and to the delight of the film's fans we will have the privilege of seeing the ~primary heart of Skynet~. The direction is lacking Now let's talk about the check, cross and delight method of the Paradigm title. Let's start by saying that the Terminator uses practically all the keys on the pad, except for L2, including the analog sticks. The performable actions are many, and apart from shooting, jumping, changing weapons and reloading, we are allowed to vary the target mode: we can rely on a convenient lock-on (exceptional in hitting enemies practically in the dark) and on a very useful first person view type fps (which however leaves us motionless), as the endoskeletons can be shot down by aiming at more or less armored areas, with consequent saving of bullets, a solution that recalls the ghoul implemented on Soldier of Fortune. However, problems arise when in the middle of a particularly animated scrum, the lock-on mechanism conflicts with the movements of the camera, and above all with the choice by the programmers to inexplicably alternate control of the protagonist by oscillating between relative screen and relative character modes. It practically happens that out of the blue the camera rotates, impaling the enemies and sensationally inverting the axes of the pad to say the least. There is the right analog stick to correct the view but it is a fix that only works when an enemy is locked on. Here too, with practice, it is possible to overcome the papacchio in a short time, however the first few times the problem occurs, the player will experience a pleasant feeling of helplessness and disorientation Technical evaluations Graphically speaking, Terminator is very well done, even if it doesn't scream an aesthetic miracle: textures, animations, frame rates and polygonal models are fully satisfactory, while the design of the various endoskeletal models and their animations is absolutely out of parameters : seeing them shoot at random in the throes of convulsions, as decapitated by a well-aimed burst, is absolutely comical and gratifying. More generally, we can say that all the polygonal models of the machines are very detailed and excellently animated, and seeing an H/K aerial flying over your head, surrounded by the flashes of lasers, throws us directly into the film. Rarely has a video game been able to recreate the emotions and atmosphere of a film so perfectly, and part of the credit must also be distributed among the authors of the soundtrack, who have been able to perfectly combine the sounds of the two films with very fast and adrenaline-pumping metal pieces, worthy comment on the epic nature and drama of the action ~told~ on the screen. In addition, always remaining in the audio field, the excellent localization in Italian should be mentioned with dialogues excellently translated and above all well interpreted by the actorsbulls, which is extremely rare in the video game industry. Other positive notes come from the longevity sector: thanks to an excellently balanced level of difficulty, the possibility of running into moments in which the game becomes frustrating is practically reduced to zero. The playability of the title, even if partially undermined by the aforementioned non-optimal camera, stands at excellent levels. In spite of a certain repetitiveness of the action, we can ~terminate~ the machines in a myriad of ways, demolishing them piece by piece, immobilizing them, blowing their heads off, landing them with a precise sweep complete with a final fatality; practically a variety of attacks that has nothing to envy to the scrolling fighting games typical of the early nineties. Conclusions Ultimately Terminator Dawn of Fate represents a pleasant novelty, a beautiful, fun, rewarding, long-lived and above all difficult and tough game, sanguine and tough as a Carpenter film can be. A beautiful gaming experience which, supported by a license behind it which guarantees a strong impact plot, guarantees healthy entertainment which in its total destructive ecstasy takes on almost cathartic tones. Too bad about the camera problem, otherwise the Paradigm title would have been perfect: an absolutely fun, engaging arcade with good graphics and excellent audio, in short, a definitely recommendable title. Pros: Lots of fun Longevity (lots of extras) Great graphics Cons: Obscure camera handling Tie-ins? Spin off? Or Sequels? Terminator Dawn of Fate is a rather particular videogame for several reasons: first of all it is a strange cross between a tie-in and a spin-off, it is not a bad game, which is at least singular given that it belongs to the two previous categories and, last but not least , it is very difficult and rewarding to complete. To begin, it seems right to me to place the events of the game in time: the Paradigm title makes us take part in the events immediately preceding the sending of the first Terminator back in 1984, in how and why Kyle Reese had to face time travel. So for all intents and purposes we have a prequel on our hands. Tien-ins, spin-offs, prequels, the confusion generated by these statements of mine can be a lot but, reducing everything to a minimum, I can say without any doubt that Terminator is a solid action game, long, tough, difficult, of the kind that they don't make them anymore today. Here the enemy faces off, shooting like crazy at dozens of endoskeletons that don't want to go down, there are no stealth missions to tackle, every meter conquered (perhaps in the heart of Skynet...) is like a battle won. The first impact with the title completely betrays the cinematographic origin of the game: the menus and the transitions between them are clearly DVD-style, clean, essential and which perfectly convey the atmosphere of the film. And just to clarify one's origins, once the game is over we can unlock many extra sections: such as enemy review, bonus material, graphic design and music gallery. Basically, browsing The Terminator Dawn of Fate disc is organized like a real DVD, one of those ~limited editions~ though: in addition to the game/film, we have a large section of extra materials and insights. Going back to the beginning, it would be better to try to justify some of my statements: I spoke of tie-in as it is a video game based on a film (Terminator 3 maybe), but in this case the most suitable term seems to be prequel/spin-off : in fact, several characters are played, involved in events not present and only hinted at in Cameron's two films.", "date": "2002-11-05", "grade": null}
