{"name": "Blokus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76944-blokus-non-solo-tetris.html", "text": "Gameloft has recently released the dizzying figures of its successes and, thanks to a range of almost 63 titles in the App Store, one can guess how much the company has chosen to invest in this platform. Now the King Midas software house is back with a new title, and this time the intent is to involve the vast audience of iPhone users with a decidedly intriguing puzzle game. Everyone knows Tetris. From the older ones who tried it on a Game Boy almost twenty years ago to those who bring it back to life on a mobile phone or on a web game; no one can say he hasn't been enchanted trying to fit the tetrams to form a row. The idea of Aleksej Paitnov, creator of the game, was the source of inspiration (read bursts in many cases) for more or less successful productions ranging from the ancient Dr. Mario to the more successful Puzzle Fighter, just to name a couple. However, Blokus does not copy the genre, he only exploits the protagonists, with a truly successful result. The title in question refers to a board game of about ten years ago, proposing it again in a digital version for all palates. There is also an exhaustive tutorial, thanks to which you can immediately get into the spirit of the game, even if the rules, luckily for us, are quite immediate and simple to learn. One piece at a time Blokus gives the player the possibility to choose from the initial menu whether to start with a tournament, a quick game or jump into multiplayer. The tournament has been divided into several cups, each of which offers different challenges and gradually increasing difficulties. The quick game is aimed at those who have the classic ~five minutes free~ at their disposal and want to dive into the game in which they themselves establish the rules, which we will explore later. The challenge takes place on a large chessboard where each of the four protagonists starts at the end of a corner marked with a colour. At our disposal we have a rather large number of ~tetrominoes~ each of a different shape and formed by a variable number of cubes. Each piece has a different value and it is our duty to try to place as many as possible, thus being able to observe the increase in our score. In each round, each contender for victory has the opportunity to bring one of them into play: the rule states that the latter must be linked to the others only at the corners. Winning is therefore a strategic operation in which stopping your opponents, blocking their way, is exactly as good as expanding your ~territory~. In the classic mode there are some nice variations on the theme: for example, you have to reach a certain score or control more colors. Ample space has been given to multiplayer with the possibility of challenging another opponent or three others (both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth or via 3G). It should be remembered that even the records achieved in local matches can contribute to climbing the world ranking. If from the point of view of the audio effects the latter fall within the standard canons, the music can instead be replaced by those from your MP3 archive (a feature that is always welcome). The only drawback that can be highlighted by this Gameloft production is inherent in an AI that does not always do its part flawlessly; in fact, if most of the time artificial intelligence will make its move right where you would not want it, it will rarely happen that it leans towards truly absurd locations. Blokus is also one of the very first games also available for the iPad, even if the two younger brothers won't make you regret the smaller screen size. The tested version is 1.0.0 Apple Store Links", "date": "2010-05-24", "grade": "S.V."}
