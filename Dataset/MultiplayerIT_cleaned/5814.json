At that time, magic consisted of a few pixels capable of generating a fantastic world and the player's imagination was required, without too many problems, to color an inexorably gray world. Into the Dim clearly leverages these nostalgic feelings to carve out a space for itself in the mobile chaos, but it does so with a particular grace, the result of an artistic direction endowed with great taste and attention to detail. Looking at the animations and the general characterization it is easy to realize how the pixellated graphics in this case is not a mere convenient solution to save energy and attract a certain audience: there is a precise study behind the design of Into the Dim which is also reflected in a non-trivial structure, presenting itself as a dungeon crawler-style RPG with a mechanic that is in fact turn-based, although it may not seem like it at first glance. Then there's the fact that it looks like a sort of updated version of a Game Boy cartridge, and herein lies HappyMagenta's ingenious and perhaps a bit pimping gimmick, but it almost takes second place to the overall coherence of the game, which has from his side also a not too invasive management of micro-transactions and advertising. The small size of the production is probably reflected in the rather poor longevity and in a certain lack of variation in the scenarios and enemies, but as long as Into the Dim lasts it is able to offer a truly particular gaming experience, full of classic suggestions but also perfectly placed in the mobile context. In search of the lost dog, in Into the Dim we find ourselves immersed in an adventure from another era Between classic and modern The control system is a good compromise between the use of the touch screen interface and the typical turn-based RPG mechanics: in the lower part of the screen we find the typical directional arrows that allow you to move inside the dungeon, with arranged movements gridded on the map. Every three movements the turn is consumed and the initiative passes to the enemies, even if this transfer of initiative takes place in such a fast and fluid way that it does not even seem like a division between turns. Particularly important is the possibility of closing the turn in advance by forcing the opponent to make the first move and thus gaining a greater margin of movement. A mechanic of this kind transforms the action into a sort of chess game, with the need to precisely calculate the passable space and the possibility of carrying out attacks within the three rounds, considering that the enemies must be hit more than once . The attacks take place in contact, with fists, or using a sort of gun that allows you to strike from a distance, another element that allows different approaches to combat, also considering the different attack and movement patterns of the enemies. Collecting coins assumes particular importance for the evolution of the character, who by spending the money can increase his vital energy, the amount of movements per turn and ammunition. The progression is quite slow and demanding and this is where microtransactions come into play, with the possibility of speeding up the process through the purchase of packs of coins, but it is in any case possible, with a little effort, to conclude Into the Dim without actually spending a euro. The voluntary viewing of advertising films also corresponds to the possibility of obtaining Contine after a KO, while purists can easily spend 1.99 euros to completely eliminate the presence of advertising and therefore obtain the game in the ~Premium~ version.", "date": "2015-12-22", "grade": "8.0"}
