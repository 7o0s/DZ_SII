Perhaps this is also why Neptune Interactive has decided to develop The Castle Game , the first project of the Canadian house to land on a home console. In the past, the Toronto team has in fact dealt exclusively with mobile video games aimed at Apple devices, including the tower defense 7 Cities. We won't be scandalized if you've never heard of it, don't worry. Jokes aside, it seems that this genre is particularly dear to developers, to the point of having convinced them to debut on the Sony flagship with a new title belonging to this niche, which, moreover, in the last generation console scene had good luck above all thanks to products like PixelJunk Monsters and the first Plants Vs. Zombies. For the realization of this unprecedented project, the now famous Unity engine was used, which has long been a favorite platform in independent development circles and has been used successfully for multiple genres. The Castle Game leaves a fair amount of freedom in the strategies associated with building your own base Until the last bulwark The world in which The Castle Game takes place is Eastlands, a small continent that is shown to us through a map placed in the center of the game's main screen. Overall, the campaign mode consists of fifteen maps, divided into three distinct territorial areas. Each of these segments can be tackled by choosing between two different degrees of difficulty and, at the end of each sequence, there is an end-of-level boss that must be eliminated before accessing the next territory. The first mission begins after the forces of an imaginary dark lord have knocked out the commander of the player-controlled troops and left the fort completely defenseless. It is up to us to enter the right dimension immediately, learn the first basic mechanics and fend off the new waves of minions of evil, with the specific purpose of protecting the main building of that area before it can be razed to the ground. If necessary, other points of interest will also require protection in the phases of their first construction and among these there is for example the Forge, useful for equipping a larger number of soldiers among one's ranks. Among its peculiarities this title includes above all the mechanism of building structures, which works through the management of particular crystals. Each equipable object has a cost that is deducted from the total calculation of the precious stones available, so much so that in the early stages of the game the material to choose from is rather limited. Once the work is finished, it is time to launch the wave of attack and verify whether the planned strategy is actually effective or not. Each wave allows you to forfeit a certain amount of additional crystals, useful for reinforcing your troops in the following turn, therefore the positive outcome of each segment does not turn out to be purely an end in itself, but on the contrary proves to be fundamental in the continuation of the siege : the surviving structures - with the exception of the main building, which cannot be repaired in any way - can be repaired and reused in the next battle, making the area being guarded more and more secure. Another important variable is made up of food: it is in fact necessary to build farms to increase production and guarantee a greater contribution of militias, once again receiving in exchange a consideration in currency. The amount of structures that can be adopted in the game is progressive: you start having only the surrounding walls, the defense turrets and the possibility of calling for the help of reinforcements from peasants armed with improbable rakes. Only later will more reliable support structures be unlocked, such as soldiers' tents, which will allow targeted attacks to be deployed on individual areas of the map, as well as allowing the respawn of the fallen after a limited amount of time. Then there are the traps, capable of damaging enemies as they pass, or the catapults, also positioned on top of the towers. There is no shortage of solutions and during each wave it is also possible to command all sides to focus attacks on a single unit, obviously provided that this is within the range entrusted to each class. Nonetheless, the planning mechanics, dispiManagement and management of your small army in real time are not the only component of the game. In fact, there are also special magical powers that allow, once unlocked, to manage various types of attacks independently of the rest of the action. The first of these support tools is the lightning bolt, but there are others as well that can be activated in dedicated campaign levels. This tool is essential for the success of the missions and represents another of the main variables of the game, also considering the fact that the assault waves very often come from several different directions and it is not possible to keep them under control with the same efficiency. It will thus be possible to strengthen a weak point with troops controlled by artificial intelligence, leaving the side that you intend to monitor better in the first person more open, or even take into account the type of enemy that will present itself from a certain direction and plan accordingly. The amount of opponents you have to deal with is quite vast: they range from simple hoplites to wizards, from trolls to kamikazes armed with bombs on their backs and in most cases the units are mixed, requiring a specific approach based on the situation. Contrary to what happens in other exponents of the genre, where the enemies follow rigidly calculated paths, one of the points in favor of The Castle Game is the functioning of the enemy artificial intelligence, which allows the opposing faction to choose the most congenial route based on to a number of variables. If there is a breach, all the forces in the field will move in that direction, while they will try to circumvent the problem when they encounter vehement resistance on a particular side of the map. This mechanic seemed to work quite well, even if there are some flaws that contribute to making the experience less enjoyable than it could have been. Playstation 4 trophies In The Castle Game there are 26 unlockable trophies, almost all of which are silver. A dozen of them are closely related to the campaign and the Sandbox and Survival modes, while the rest concern the killing of a certain amount of enemies or the execution of kills using specific attack techniques. What didn't convince us The question marks that arose during our game sessions are many. The first concerns the functioning of the checkpoints and is also closely connected to the balancing of the bosses present at the end of each area compared to the normal siege phases. In fact, a certain imbalance between the difficulty experienced in facing simple troops and the moments in which a leader is faced is evident. What does checkpoints have to do with it? Simple, in case of defeat you will have to restart from the previous wave to the boss itself, while in case you decide to quit the game, perhaps to try again at a later time, it will be necessary to restart the siege from the beginning (and in at best we are talking about eight, ten waves). This factor in the long run generates boredom and annoyance, especially if we go to consider another element of the game that could have been managed better: the skill tree. By accessing the appropriate Armory section it is in fact possible to use the gems collected in each level to enhance one's resources. You can improve the skills of the soldiers, the resistance of the structures, the effectiveness of magical powers and so on. Too bad you can't do it during the course of the game, but only by accessing the main menu. Now, think back to what we just said about checkpoints and you will understand why this choice also seemed quite unfortunate to us. The other weak link of this title is inherent in the object control system, especially when you have to eliminate them from the map to change strategy. In the long run, the method adopted is slow, not to mention that it is not allowed to move existing objects elsewhere, nor to copy and paste them at will to make the operation more immediate. Surely the use of the pad, from this point of view, has not proved effective enough. Then there are also obvious doubts about the quantity of situations that occur within the game: it is true, the maps change, but the activity that takes place is always identical and, apart from a few exceptions, the variety is really limited, even after having acquired more resources. A not particularly high longevity closes the round, even if at the end of the main campaign two other additional game modes can be unlocked. We have Survival, in which si must resist at least eight waves of enemies in order to win the game, while Sandbox requires the player to resist a mighty siege for more than eight minutes. Thanks to them, you have access to a few extra hours of entertainment and to a slight variation on the theme compared to traditional assignments. It's better than nothing, but it's equally true that something more could have been done.", "date": "2015-08-20", "grade": "6.5"}
