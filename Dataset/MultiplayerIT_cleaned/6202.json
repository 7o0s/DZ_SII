After the long partnership with the very famous golfer, Electronic Arts was not too visionary for the choice of the replacement and has simply inserted the current absolute excellence, or the young Rory McIlRoy, already in the register of the greats. The market had been orphaned of this franchise for two years, the last chapter is in fact Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14, a time that however was necessary due to the complex work imposed by the production. Rory McIlRoy PGA Tour is in all respects a new beginning for the series, built from scratch using the Frostbite 3, the famous graphics engine responsible for titles such as Battlefield 4 and Star Wars: Battlefront. We have been playing the new EA Sports title for a long time and our judgment is a ~progress with reservations~. Rory McIlRoy PGA Tour is a new beginning for the historic EA Sports golf series Tell me how you play and I'll tell you who you are The title opens in full EA Sports style, putting us in close contact with the golfer, who gives us valuable advice for playing at our best, but above all puts us in his shoes for an 18-hole session at the US Open, in order to practice with the various control systems proposed. Compared to the past chapters, the possibility of changing the shooting system on the fly disappears, but we must always refer to the game menu to choose a new one. And there is no shortage of choice. The classic system with analog swing (Tour) is joined by a new alternative, called ~Arcade~, which further simplifies things. In this case, in fact, the effect applied to the ball is not taken into consideration, but only power and direction, allowing the player to make the shot significantly reducing the margins of error. Also returns - to our amazement - the three-key system, one of the oldest and recently removed from the franchise, but always beloved by the public. The operation is extremely simple: you press a single key three times to face as many phases that determine the shot. The aim is to stop the movement of the cursor in certain areas of a dial, in order to establish power, effect and precision. In our opinion it is a system that never loses its charm and is certainly able to appeal to the hearts of nostalgics, even if unfortunately it does not make money from the low reactivity of the product; but that's something we'll talk about later. If all this were not enough, a last custom system closes the picture where the player himself decides the parameters, in this way it is possible to obtain a hybrid between the Arcade and Tour system. EA Sports has certainly not saved on the variety therefore, reiterating the identity of the series to adapt to everyone's needs. My PGA Obviously the soul of the game also returns, or the professional career, where we can create our virtual golfer of dreams and bring him to glory by facing the various competitions. Once created, the custom player becomes part of the roster of athletes, and can therefore also be used in the quick match. Precisely on this occasion, however, the first flaws of the new graphics engine emerge, the player's editor is much more limited than in the past, let's even say to the minimum wage with a touch of embarrassment. It is not even possible to change our character's beard (there is no model at all), just to give an idea of the limitation of this mode. Even for facial features we have to rely on a pre-set set of faces. It is absolutely out of the question to churn out a model even remotely resembling reality, let alone the absence of tools to exploit Kinect or PlayStation 4 for facial mapping, which would not have been out of place in such a context. With our very approximate golfer we are preparing to choose which course to tackle, including another unwelcome surprise, even if less bitter than the previous one. There are only nine official courses, which are flanked by four fantasy courses, one of which is taken directly from Battlefield 4. Among the official ones, an asterisk should then be put on TPC Scottsdale, available only for pre-orders, but fortunately not missing icons like TPC Sawgrass. On the other hand, the absence of the famous Pebble Beach is disconcerting, replaced with the imaginary path Lighthouse Pointe. Thirteen paths are not very few, true, but in the previous chapters sImpressive peaks had been reached in this regard, which in this case can hopefully be compensated for through some additional post-launch content. It will therefore be interesting to find out how the Canadian company will be able to support the product once it is released on the market. For now we can say that we are faced with a work that slightly exceeds the essentials. As usual completely absent licensed music; the sound accompaniment is produced internally through a series of anonymous instrumental pieces, which replicate different musical genres in a rather listless and derivative way. Xbox One goals Rory McIlRoy PGA Tour features the classic 1000 player points, divided across 28 goals. Earn 30 points immediately by presenting yourself to an online competition, or even better by creating your own player. Other objectives are more complex, such as the one that requires you to hit the flag. Good luck! The show begins The presentation is undoubtedly the flagship of Rory McIlRoy PGA Tour. EA Sports had promised great things and so it was: it really seems to be attending a great sporting event thanks to the television cut made of cut scenes, strategic sound interludes and the splendid two-voice commentary by Rich Lerner and Frank Nobilo. The sequence shots and panoramic shots show the beauty of the sceneries, often lingering over the abundant animal presence, from killer whales emerging from the seas to deer in evident mating season, at least considering their curious proximity to the public. But the spectators are the icing on the cake; in previous golf simulations the absence of bystanders or a crowd capable of generating the right atmosphere has always been more or less criticized. All this is part of the past, Rory McIlRoy PGA Tour is invaded in every hectare by an excited public, ready to explode for every shot, perhaps with a few too many excesses, given that even just touching the ball is enough to start some hysterical screams and various comments. You can imagine what happens after scoring an eagle. The variety is incredible and also the general quality of the sound effects sector marks new technical goals. In short, it seems to be really on the fairway. Switching to Frostbyte 3 gives instantly perceptible advantages, such as the fact of loading the entire course, in order to completely cancel the breaks between holes, as well as giving - especially at sunset - glimpses of undoubted beauty. The models of the golfers are also good: obviously McIlRoy is perfect, but in the roster we also find Jordan Spieth, Martin Kaymer and Ian Poulter. Unfortunately, however, women are absent. On the other hand, we have detected a certain delay in the response of the commands, or input-lag, noticeable right from the menus, which ends up weighing particularly heavily on the three-button shooting system where timing is fundamental. We also encountered some small bugs probably attributable to the fact that our version was not yet updated to the day one patch. In short, it seems to us that the developers had to make compromises in adapting the engine to the dynamics of a golf simulation. For example, there is no trace of an overcast sky or rain and the clouds themselves are devoid of animation, giving an unrealistic effect. Among other things, some parts of the scenario are less convincing than others. The night, on the other hand, deserves a separate discussion, as it is represented in the game through an imaginative mode called Night Club Challenge. The Xbox One version we tested didn't seem particularly defined to us also due to some unfortunate choices regarding the post processing filters, but frankly the game seems blurry, so much so as to raise some doubts that it runs at native 1080p (the resolution however was never announced). Finally, it was hoped for the implementation of the sixty frames per second, but the title undoubtedly runs at 30 frames, with some sporadic uncertainty. The online mode means you can challenge other players' rankings by taking on selected stroke play.", "date": "2015-07-14", "grade": "8.0"}
