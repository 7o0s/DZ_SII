{"name": "Onore allo stealth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/176297-dishonored-2-onore-allo-stealth.html", "text": "It really seems like an eternity since the first Dishonored appeared on the PC market and on that of previous generations of consoles, offering a decidedly peculiar gaming experience. The title was clearly inspired by the very first chapters of Thief, never forgotten masterpieces of reasoned and tactically studied action, but above all it finally brought to the screen the first-person version of those stealth mechanics seen in numerous games with an external camera to the protagonist such as the various Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, Hitman. However, the game did not only focus on a gameplay that was sometimes even innovative, but also concentrated on important but often considered accessory elements such as a well-told story with some twists, a very high quality level design with huge and very vertical maps with a clear sandbox style, but above all it boasted a truly personal artistic cut capable of properly compensating for a rather backward technical sector. The stroke adopted, the color palette, a precise modeling of the characters and above all a credible and fascinating game world helped to package a product that we had promoted with flying colors despite some obvious rigidities and superficialities that affected some aspects of the game. With a truly enormous load of expectations, the Arkane Studios guys led by Harvey Smith - whom we interviewed just recently while we were waiting to get our hands on this sequel - immediately set to work in an attempt to give players a worthy successor of note. Running like crazy due to the recent decision by Bethesda, the publisher, not to deliver a review code to the press in advance, we played the title with the right depth trying to evaluate its smallest facets and what we can already tell you, before to go into detail, is that this Dishonored 2 is in all respects a ~more of the same~ than its predecessor. Not a revolution, not even an evolution, but an enhanced version, albeit extremely similar, of every mechanic and feature of the first chapter, including problematic aspects. Dishonored 2 is an excellent stealth title but it doesn't fix the flaws of its predecessor But hadn't that already happened? On a narrative level, the game is set fifteen years after its predecessor but even those who have not been able to experience this pearl of the past will have no problem immediately getting to the heart of the story given that the introduction opens with a very brief summary of what happened previously. Emily is now grown up and perfectly fulfills her function as Empress of Dunwall with Corvo Attano, the protagonist of the first Dishonored, by her side. Within a few moments everything that the beautiful empress has managed to build in a decade of activity will fall apart due to a lightning coup that will force her to flee her hometown, leaving the throne and the empire in the hands of Delilah Kaldwin, alleged sister of Jessamine Kaldwin, his mother, and the one who was dethroned and killed in the previous game. In the long prologue we will therefore find out who the new antagonists are, we will get to know Meagan Foster, a new supporting character to whom the hub will be linked where your avatar will prepare and chat with allies before tackling a new mission, but above all we will face that which is probably the only real novelty of this sequel: the need to choose who to control in the very first minutes of the game. In fact, at our disposal we will have both the old and ruthless Corvo Attano and the agile and cynical Emily Kaldwin. This choice which, with a narrative artifice will be irreversible and will accompany us throughout the plot, will have an important consequence: access to specific magical powers for each of the two protagonists. In fact, the Outsider also returns to the game, a key figure shrouded in mystery who will give you the ability to manage the special abilities granted by Oblivion and who will be linked to the new antagonist. Choosing to play Emily rather than Corvo will offer slightly different lines of dialogue and interactions with the characters but the narrative arc will be the exact same and the different epilogues will only unlock based on the chaos generated by your actions and not according to who is at the our commands. Exactly as happened in the first Dishonored in fact, based on how lethal we will be in our attacks, how many corpses we will leave in our wake and above all according to the style adopted to neutralize the objective of each mission, we will change the amount of chaos in the game world with consequences on its inhabitants, on the spread ofblood fly infection that afflicts Carnaca, the new region that forms the backdrop to the events of this sequel, and especially on the different endings that we will be able to unlock. If we combine all this with the possibility of playing entire games without killing any enemy, of even giving up the powers of the Stranger with obvious repercussions on the difficulty and we consider the question of the double protagonist with specific specific special powers attached, it is easy to imagine how the replayability of this Dishonored 2 is very high. The (almost) definitive stealth That dualism that characterized the original title and that made its assessment quite complex is also present unchanged in this sequel. Dishonored 2 is in fact a title that favors, almost rewards the stealth style, but as a first-person shooter it does not in any way prevent an attitude entirely aimed at action and impetuosity. And here the first problem arises: that chronic shortage of weapons that characterized the predecessor has been mitigated here to a minimum. There are only a couple of ranged weapons, although made more varied by the use of various types of ammunition, a handful of throwing weapons including grenades and mines with the most varied effects and then the sword for melee combat. Something more has been done on the powers front due to the differences between the two protagonists but we are still talking about six special abilities for each one, most of which are dedicated to a stealth style of play, without taking into account the fact that the Crow are almost the same as the previous chapter as far as retouched. To all this we add the combat with the white weapon, which returns in Dishonored 2 almost unchanged from the past. Emily (or Corvo) constantly wield the iconic folding sword in their right hand while the left is dedicated to the rest of the paraphernalia and powers. The use of the blade is really basic: light or charged blow and parry, with the latter which, if used at the right time, allows you to unbalance the enemy and then finish him off with a super bloody ~slow motion~ or to take the opponent at mo' of human shield to suffocate it or throw it at other enemies. This last possibility is then the same that is also granted to us when we surprise an enemy from behind. The problem is that the melee mechanics become repetitive too soon and completely unbalanced on timeliness alone, thanks to the fact that almost all opponents, once they enter combat, will tend to run towards us even in the rare cases in which they are armed with a pistol. These furious fencing matches also show the side of an obvious hitbox management problem that seems to afflict Arkane Studios' product: it doesn't rarely happen to get hit even when the opponent's jab is clearly too far away, or while we are on parry simply because the enemy's shot entered our flank despite the fact that he was clearly in front of us. And obviously if the clash is with two or even three enemies it's really a matter of moments before dying inexorably. What has been said should make it even better to understand what we have already repeated in the rest of the article: Dishonored 2 is a stealth title dedicated heart and soul to those who love to operate in the shadows, want to study patrols, never show up and are ready to reload the rescue if he accidentally ~turns on~ a guard for a poorly thought-out move. This type of player can only viscerally appreciate the title published by Bethesda but those looking for more ruthless or immediate action will have to be ready to deal with the limitations just described. Playing with sand There is a precise element of the game that strongly highlights the quality of the developer's work: the level design. Dishonored 2 does not contain ~simple~ levels but real sandboxes often of immense size, full of verticality and hundreds of secret or secondary passages that the player can discover as long as he decides to devote himself body and soul to the exploration of each crevice or ingenuity to find a way to open that door or window closed from the inside. The care taken in the geometry of the maps and in their structure is truly incredible and will not cease to surprise you for the entire duration of the game which presumably stands at 20, 25 hours as long as you want to dedicate the right time to the exploratory component. If you intend to run at full speed towards the goal of each level it is likely that you can take just over half this time but it won't take long to instead take an additional 10, 15 hours if your exploration is manic. Each level contains iIn fact, a target that we can eliminate with the simple use of brute force or we can knock out by adopting a non-lethal style. To do this we will have to wander around collecting the dozens of collectibles scattered around the map, analyze clues, listen to guards and often complete the side missions that will be given to us as a result of our desire to explore the game environment. In doing so we will access real ancillary activities that often lead to truly imaginative and original epilogues of the mission. However, there is an important side of the coin and it is all poured into artificial intelligence. We are sorry to repeat it once again but even on this front Dishonored 2 does not seem to have advanced one iota compared to its predecessor. The guards and dogs follow very precise patrols that can be interrupted by our intervention or by the presence of corpses that we have forgotten to hide. This reactivity is based on two alert states indicated by a small lightning-shaped icon that fills up when the disturbing element enters the opponent's visual cone. Filling it the first time we will cause the enemy to enter a state of alert and begin to actively control the surrounding environment; with the second filling we will have been discovered and from that moment on the guard will start to attack us, sound alarms or call for reinforcements, ~waking up~ the whole district. First of all, the visual cone of the guards does not take verticality into account in the slightest: just position yourself on a bookcase, a chandelier or a shelf slightly higher than the opponents and we will be completely invisible with a forcing that is sometimes very unrealistic. At the same time the reactivity of the adversaries seems to be governed by a strange randomness: even if in most cases they will limit themselves to running towards us, it will not rarely happen to see them dazed or extremely slow in reacting, sometimes instead they will start running in confusion, ~waking up~ the mid-level population and it is not so rare to see them run into the traps that we have prepared earlier as animated by a masochistic spirit. And sometimes the same randomness also seems to afflict the civilians who populate some parts of the levels who tend to be uninterested in our passage even if we take up arms or fight, other times instead they go into a rage if we limit ourselves to dropping a piece of furniture or they see us being transported I turn a knocked out ally. And it's a shame because this unpredictability of the enemy's reaction often blurs complex tactics adopted to get around them or to try in every way to complete a level without killing anyone or being caught red-handed and actually ruining that stealth experience that otherwise is the real spearhead of the entire production. Once upon a time there was optimization Dishonored 2 departs from its previous title in regards to the technical element. Putting aside the Unreal Engine, this time the guys from Arkane Studios have decided to play at home using the id Tech to pack their own engine: the Void. The result is quite evident with extremely broader and more detailed scenarios, more vivid colors and above all characters with a higher polygonal count and with excellent animations, especially body animations. Something changes also in artistic terms with an aesthetic trait that is closer to a watercolor style that partially softens the broken and sharp lines of the previous chapter. However, not everything turned out well: although the game still remains far from the visual wonders seen in the most recent large productions, it manifests a considerable heaviness and in the test configuration it has never managed to reach 60 frames per second with the Ultra preset and the maximum level of anti-aliasing possible. But it's not so much a matter of maximum rendering as the substantial frame-rate drops that are experienced in outdoor scenes and when the visual horizon can range. Furthermore, although it is part of an evidently fortunate configuration given that the title has always been perfectly stable from start to finish, it must be pointed out that in the presence of certain hardware components that have not yet been identified, Dishonored 2 becomes practically unusable with frequent crashes, freezes, stuttering and a number of images per second so low as to make it unplayable. It is therefore evident that Arkane Studios has not worked properly on the PC conversion, probably favoring the console which, however, we have not yet had the opportunity to try. While not making it weigh excessively on the final vote because we are convinced that the t", "date": "2016-11-11", "grade": "8.5"}
