We will therefore find ourselves driving the latest invention of futuristic war technology: the BattleMech, a gigantic war exoskeleton, heavily armed and extremely versatile. The year is 3134, and after 60 years of peace and prosperity, the Republic of the Spere is going through a dark time, attacked by an unidentified threat. In particular, a virus has tampered with all the Hyperpulse Generators, indispensable transmission towers, to keep communications between all the planets in the system active. With these vital tools out of action, the Republic is unable to know exactly what is happening on the various planets, and virtually blind to constant attacks from enemies. The only hope is to send someone who can personally act on the Hyperpulse Generators and transform them into instruments of war. How to fly a pocket mech In essence, the game is a third-person action game, in which we will be able to drive a total of about 20 different mechs, with different characteristics, within 24 levels, as far as the single player campaign is concerned. The upper screen of the console frames the game action: the mech (or the character) seen from behind, within the various settings, all made in 3D. The lower screen is instead dedicated to the interface and the radar. There are different configurations regarding the commands: by default the game allows you to drive the mech using the directional cross, while the aim is moved through the four keys. However, it is strongly recommended to use the configuration that includes the use of the touch screen to move the crosshair: in this case, we will find ourselves using the controls in a similar way to what we saw in Metroid Prime Hunters, with the directional cross still dedicated to the movement of the vehicle and the touch screen usable as an analog controller. The rest of the lower screen is dedicated to various keys: one that allows you to get on and off the mech, one to change weapons, one to view information on the various mechs and one to access advice on how to approach the level, plus some specific the particular abilities of the various types of vehicles. The interface represents a rather weak point in the creation of the game: discarding the default setting a priori, which is really impractical, even the one that uses the touch screen, although more intuitive, is not without problems. How to fly a pocket mech Instead of having a direct relationship to the movement of the stylus, as happens for example in Metroid Prime, the camera moves as controlled by a sort of tactile analog, similar to the type of touch screen control used in Super Mario 64 DS. This thing, combined with a certain latency that afflicts the commands, determines a wavy movement of the camera that needs continuous correction and in general never allows fast and precise control of the viewfinder. Of course, having to do with heavy combat mechs, it can also have a logical explanation, but for gameplay purposes it is still a shortage. Another unacceptable choice is the arrangement and choice of fixed keys on the touch screen: two of these (the one that recalls the advice in the game and the one that shows the characteristics of the mechs), which occupy a large part of the screen, are absolutely useless, or at least not so important as to justify their positioning so visible and close at hand. On the contrary, a fundamental action such as changing the weapon is entrusted to a single key, to be pressed several times to select the right object: it would have been decidedly preferable to have a key for each weapon, eliminating the two described above, or in any case organizing the interface in a more practical way. Furious clashes The fights are the backbone of the game, which most of the time takes on the aspect of a full-blown shooter, but the various missions also include diversionary actions that break up the rhythm well, providing interesting variations to the gameplay. The missions have various objectives, which often focus on reaching a certain point on the map, recovering some vehicles or protecting certain areas. Often, it will be necessary to get off the mech and move the pilot on foot to reach new vehicles to drive or to connect to terminals on which to implement real hacker actions. In these cases, we will have to undertake real mini-games, which mostly consist of the reconstruction of a certain sequence of symbols, which can be implemented by selecting them from a rapid cascadeMatrix-style, and dragging them to the indicated points on the upper screen. The fights, as it is logical to expect from a mech-based game, are not exactly frenetic and very fast, but are rather based on the right use of the weapons and on the timing of the attacks (avoiding harmful overheating), giving a certain strategic tone to the simple ~point and shoot of a canonical shooter. Each mech is, in principle, equipped with three different types of weapon: a ~beam~ one (laser, or something like that), a projectile one (machine guns of various types) and a heavy one (mortar, homing missiles) , and it will be necessary to choose carefully and quickly between one and the other to take down the various enemy types. In addition to these, the approximately 20 mechs present differ in appearance and basic characteristics: some are faster and less resistant, others are armored assault vehicles, still others are light and have powerful rockets that allow them to remain in flight for a longer time, or to cling to the walls with the use of a hook (all mechs, in general, can take considerable leaps with the pressure of the L key, which activates the retro-rockets). Furious clashes At the time of its first appearance on Xbox, Mechassault was one of those games that carried the ~Live Enabled~ stamp as a flag, and in fact it was a title heavily based on multiplayer gaming, finally possible online too. Being practically the same structure, this too Mechassault: Phantom War is a game that fully expresses its potential in multiplayer firefights, and therefore it is with some disappointment that we note that Backbone/Majesco not only have not included an online mode via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, but also how there isn't even a multiplayer mode in game sharing. The only possible mode for multiple players is the LAN mode with multiple cartridges, which in the current panorama of the video game offer on Nintendo DS appears somewhat backward and castrating, given the possibilities that such a game would have entailed with the possibility of connecting to other online players. And in multiplayer the game gains a lot in terms of fun, also because the single player campaign, while beautiful and interesting from a narrative point of view, doesn't last that long: an average player can complete the 24 missions that make up the story in about 5 hours. Matte metal The game's graphics are entirely 3D, with the mech viewed from behind and the game world modeled with a fair amount of polygons in front of it. A courageous and dignified choice, although it is not exactly one of the peaks reached by Nintendo DS, as far as graphic quality is concerned. Almost monochromatic canyons and plains are dotted with simple polygonal structures and bitmapped trees, under a decidedly alien colored sky, forming the vast battlefields in which we will find ourselves moving the mech during the various missions: a functional representation, but not exactly a feast for the eyes. The mechs have fluctuating aspects: some are well made and give a good idea of the powerful combat vehicles they should be, others are more sketchy and less pleasant to see. In general, the polygonal models are convincing, although they suffer from animations that are not excellent. The audio sector, on the other hand, is excellently made: the story is narrated by a large amount of dialogues and digitized speech of excellent workmanship, the rocking music accompanies the action well and the effects give the idea of disruptive explosions and futuristic weapons in action. There are also various full motion video footage which, although they are always pleasing on Nintendo DS and are functional to the narrative, are a bit rough as regards the rendered models. Comment Mechs always exert a certain fascination on videogame users, there is little that can be done. Mechassault: Phantom War has on its side the fact that it is one of the few games that allows you to drive such mighty vehicles on the Nintendo DS, although it is not a title in itself excellent. The tactical shooter / mech simulator gameplay works well in the first hours of the game, but unfortunately it does not contain incentives such as to make the title lasting and attractive to everyone, beyond fans of the genre and the series in question. The single player campaign, while interesting as a story, is decidedly short, and the absence of any multiplayer mode, if not in LAN with multiple cartridges, is in effect a major limitation, considering that by now the Wi-Fi Connection is increasingly supported by third party games. However, playability is the strong point of this Mechassault, a title for the resto be affected by imperfect controls and a slightly more than mediocre technical realization. Pros: Fun gameplay like that of the Xbox version Good variety of vehicles to drive and situations In Multiplayer, when possible, earn points Cons: Technical realization not fully satisfactory Only Multiplayer possible in LAN with multiple cartridges Cumbersome controls Short single player campaign A Microsoft franchise, so far linked to the PC world and Xbox, arrives on Nintendo DS: this could already be enough to make a big question mark in the style of a Metal-Gear-Solid guard appear on the head (complete with a ~huh!?~ ). Seeing then that this franchise is based on large and powerful mechs, which makes action spectacularity its fulcrum, seems even more strange, thinking of its conversion for the small Nintendo portable, and finally the fact that Majesco is in charge of conversion, complete the mystery behind this title. On closer inspection, however, this is not the first Microsoft brand to go from the parts of Nintendo DS, which already includes the good conversion of Age of Empires within the category. Precisely, to mitigate the doubts about this game comes the name of the development team that dealt with Mechassault, also author of the same Age of Empires: Backbone Entertainment, to which Majesco has entrusted the burden of this adaptation not just trivial.", "date": "2007-08-27", "grade": null}
