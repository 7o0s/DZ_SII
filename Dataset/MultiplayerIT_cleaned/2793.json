{"name": "Observer: System Redux", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/observer-system-redux-recensione.html", "text": "There are only a few days left for the total advent of the new videogame generation, at least from the point of view of the consoles, and it cannot be denied that the generational passage in terms of games is a bit lukewarm: of course, Spiderman: Miles Morales can be a good starter and the remake of Demon's Souls remains a feast for the eyes but it is clear that the true potential of all this we will see over time on both sides. Nonetheless, in this panorama that takes its first steps between ray tracing, haptic feedback, quick resume and flash uploads, another title peeps out proposing itself not as a restyling but as a real remake: we are talking about Observer: System Redux, the next gen version of the dystopian thriller developed by Bloober Team (from which we are waiting for The Medium, postponed to next year) as well as theater for the late Rutger Hauer's first experience in a video game. In this regard, we refer you to the behind the scenes of three years ago, which is always worth watching. In itself, the title has not undergone major structural changes, thus going to tell the same story of 2017 with the right addition of three secondary missions that further explore the game world and its chiaroscuro a little. The real revolution lies in the technical sector, which is the reason why Observer: System Redux can be considered a full-fledged remake: there is the beloved ray tracing, the animations and polygonal models have been completely redesigned, work has been done a lot on a visual level to return more realistic settings ... in short, it is not the classic homework and this review is here to highlight the improvements. We played it on Xbox Series X, so we reserve ourselves as regards impressions on the haptic feedback of the PS5 DualSense, but in the end it would only be a (welcome) added value to a game that shows its new muscles from the very first minutes of the investigation. The plot As mentioned, Observer: System Redux does not revisit the original plot, which remains unchanged in spite of the three unpublished secondary missions: we are in the year 2084, a future still far from ours which however is equally far from being rosy. Technology has made great strides, allowing the usual evolutions that any cyberpunk enthusiast knows well but bringing with it a horrendous digital plague known as nanophagy. It is the consequence of a glitch that can occur in the technological grafts, leading the infected to experience fever, delirium, sickness and loss of self-control, which is followed by the certain death of the host and of whoever may have come into contact with it ( let's think for example of condominiums) to prevent it from spreading. When it is said that the cure is - perhaps - worse than the disease. In any case, there are thousands of victims of this cybernetic disease and if we consider that in this dystopian future there are few people who do not have at least one graft, the seriousness of the situation goes without saying. As if this were not enough, a war has raged which has decimated and broken both East and West, leading to the complete collapse of all forms of power, reducing everything to self-managed societies that have founded their domination solely on corruption. People have nothing left and the survivors have abandoned themselves to drugs, virtual reality in which to live in a better world and the loss of identity, no longer being able to distinguish the line between human beings, machines, in some cases even animals. Everyone belongs to the social class assigned to them a priori (it goes without saying that climbing the ranks is really challenging), while the corporations dabble with power by making good and bad weather over the cities; in our case, Krakow. In this panorama full of hope and positivity, we are yet another piece of the rot that corrupts what remains of society: we are the personification of people's fears, because they know that they cannot hide from us. Whatever secret they may have, we take it and lay it bare, ready to use it against them should it serve in our elite neural detective investigations: we are an Observer and there is no memory or thought that can escape us. Played by Rutger Hauer, Daniel Lazarski will find himself grappling with a mysterious assassin after receiving an alarming call from his son Adam, who has not heard for some time. The plot itself is engaging, although the phases of the Dream Eater (we will summarize shortly) are at times too visionary and dreamlike, often prompting us to grope with the hope that they will end soon or bear fruit. Nonetheless, like any game that puts the cyberpunk universe on the plate, it opens up to ethical questions on which it is validIt is always worth asking yourself: the line between man and machine, the possible benefits that grafts can bring, the addiction that comes from overcoming one's limits and so on, in a whirlwind of nuances that gives the work of Bloober Team that boost more than the markedly horror titles that preceded Observer: System Redux. Although even in this case the horror is around the corner. The gameplay Nothing has changed since 2017 but for those who haven't played it, or don't know it at all, Observer: System Redux follows the trend already traced by the previous Bloober Team titles: it's a first-person experience between thriller and horror, during which the interaction with the environment will be for the sole purpose of looking for clues for our investigation by alternating the two types of vision available to the protagonist: scanner and biological, used respectively to analyze electronic devices and biological traces such as blood or injuries on the corpses we will come across. In some cases we will instead be prompted to use the Dream Eater, a device that hacks into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their last moments of life and probe their fears, their obsessions, in search of the clue that will bring us one step closer. more to the killer. It is not a system without risks for our own sanity and in the course of the game we will have to face stealth sessions to escape the sinister creature that haunts Daniel's nightmares. If you remember the original, it was undoubtedly the most frustrating part due to a rigidity in the gameplay and mechanics, which too often resulted in a game over screen: in Observer: System Redux you perceive a more elastic leeway and permissive, no longer based on the obsessive search for perfect execution. Furthermore, the hacking phases themselves have been lightened, depriving them of the necessary knowledge of the game world and rather reducing them to simple mini-games in which it is necessary to memorize the immovable numbers in a pattern in constant motion. For those who have already played it, it could be less satisfying, perhaps even unfair after having worked so hard to solve them in the original, but it must be said that the general level of challenge has never been excessive and this change made by virtue of the fluidity can be forgiven of texture. In the same way, the various neural interrogations are shorter and less intrusive, always with the aim of keeping the player focused on the game world and not letting him get lost in an overly visionary gameplay loop. In short, it is true that as we have written, the experience remains structurally unchanged but there have been some small tweaks that undoubtedly go in favor of the remake. Only note, we would have liked that the interaction with the game world was in turn more natural since it is still awkward as in the original and, very often, we found ourselves moving forward, backward, left and right before finding the right position to examine an object. It is not a red light defect but in short, it is surprising that in the care implemented in some respects the developers have forgotten this. The best part though, we wrote it, is the technical one. Next gen air The first thing you will notice as soon as the opening sequence is over is the extraordinary work done in terms of lighting: in no uncertain terms, and you may have noticed it in the comparative videos, the remake makes the original look almost at the age of stone. We don't want to belittle the work of 2017 but one of the defects found in the then review was precisely the technical ups and downs. Here they are swept away starting with the lights, which restore the atmosphere of a typical dystopian cybperunk city in the best way ever for a title that is in any case the remake of a very recent one. No more hardware limitations, we are now faced with a Krakow which, despite its contained settings, is shown to us for what it is: a city decimated by disease, by war, where people have lost hope and often cling desperately to a not a life made up of illusions and drugs, where the chiaroscuro of a bad alley seems to crawl under our skin to give us the same feeling of decadence. After looking at the reflection of the tattoo artist's sign in a puddle in front of the studio, we turned around several times in your hands the metalized IDs found during the game, fascinated by the reflections and the perfect play of light in the rendering of the material - it may seem like a trivial detail, a trivial identification card compared to the rest of the setting but it is often said that the devil is in the details. Observer: System Redux does a great lI work to reflect the atmosphere of his Krakow, from the squalor of the darkest recesses of the apartment building to the pockmarked and time-ravaged faces of the character models. Rutger Hauer himself, for example, now seems like a restless, tired man, wasted by the world in which his alter ego lives, valuing even more decisively an acting that alone builds more than half of the game. In short, we are faced with tangible improvements that perhaps do not fully fill the gaze of the much-vaunted next gen but do more than well in restoring prestige to a game whose main flaws were precisely these.", "date": "2020-11-15", "grade": "8.0"}
