And so, after the tie-in dedicated to ~Ribelle - The Brave~, here is one for ~Oz the Great and Powerful~, a film that has just been released in Italian cinemas which reinterprets the story of ~The Wizard of Oz~ from the point of view of visionary director Sam Raimi, author of the unforgettable ~Army of Darkness~ as well as the best film adaptation of Spider-Man. In Temple Run: Oz we take on the role of Oscar Diggs, an illusionist who, following a tornado, finds himself projected into an incredible world inhabited by witches and very special characters, but also full of pitfalls. As in the various episodes of the series developed by Imangi Studios, in fact, the gameplay is based on the race and therefore on Oscar's escape from a group of demonic-looking winged creatures who want to capture him. Temple Run 2 is still setting the pace for the endless run genre, so this new tie-in starts from that experience to give us a product that is in many ways more refined than in the past, with great attention to the technical sector and peculiarities of the scenario. The ride starts from a sort of forest in which yellow and green tones are mixed, and then we pass over stone floors or thin sections, suspended in the air. There is also a variation on the theme, made up in this case not by a ride aboard trolleys on rails but by a flight on a hot air balloon which has to make its way along an also impervious aerial path. Quick shots but no red shoes The initial impact with Temple Run: Oz is clearly not one of amazement: we all know the feeling of the game very well and almost nothing has changed compared to the recent Temple Run 2, if not the technical aspect. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since Imangi Studios' very successful debut on mobile devices, and the times when the immediate and compelling action of the series was supported by barely passable graphics seem long gone. As mentioned, in this case we move within evocative landscapes, which scroll across the screen without hesitation, keeping the sixty frames per second stable and thus offering us decidedly reactive touch controls, capable of holding up even when the speed rises dramatically and you have to alternate quickly slides, jumps and side jumps, the latter controlled as usual via accelerometer. The indicator located in the upper left part of the screen, which fills up as we collect coins along the way, allows once it is full to activate a barrier that momentarily protects us from impact with obstacles but not from chasms. while the selection of power-ups and items appears unchanged, with the usual magnets, rocket launches, barriers and so on. In short, we are faced with a tie-in with no concrete novelties, which understandably rides the popularity of the film that has just been released in theaters and mixes it with that of a blockbuster like Temple Run to obtain the maximum possible result on iOS and Android terminals, however, faced with a price (albeit popular) of 89 cents which in no way excludes the presence of abundant in-app purchases.", "date": "2013-03-13", "grade": "7.0"}
