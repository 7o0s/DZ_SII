Not just any work, but the one par excellence, which immediately comes to mind when you think of the character. With the first season dedicated to the post-apocalyptic world of Robert Kirkman, Telltale has become to all intents and purposes a well-known software house, one that is dedicated to the production of a specific type of game: a sort of interactive film, graphic adventures completely focused on narration, with a gameplay sector at an all-time low. Yet they continue to work, so much so that in recent years there have been agreements to make seasons on Guardians of the Galaxy, Batman, even Minecraft. But the highlight is the fourth and final season of The Walking Dead, in which Clementine's narrative arc will finally end. Waiting for this 2018, in the absence of a shred of date, The Walking Dead Collection arrives in stores, which contains everything that has been created by Telltale Games on the series in the last five years. In a remastered version, by the way. Because not even zombies refuse a facelift in high definition. An unforgettable story The writer assumes all responsibility for what he is about to tell you. The first season of The Walking Dead (and partially the following ones) is a masterpiece. The demonstration that video games are art, and that art can easily become a video game. Of course, a masterpiece of its kind: that of interactive adventures that almost become movies, in which the player presses a few keys and makes the characters move around the game environment. But art is art: and the adventures of Lee and Clementine offer mature themes, psychological implications, a compelling story that holds the player in a grip of mixed feelings, until it brings him to sincere tears at the end. Not to mention the moral implications: would you be able to cut off your best friend's leg, so as not to end up eaten by the undead? Because in The Walking Dead you will find yourself grappling with similar decisions, every two by three. And you will have to decide for yourself. The characters evolve according to your directive, on the boundaries of good and evil, never so blurred as in this case, thanks to a world where everything has changed. The first season of the series earned some ninety awards, ending up in the rankings of the best video games of all time. The genre may or may not like it, the narrative may or may not appeal to you, but this should still say something about the quality of the product. The direction, then, all in all remains good even in the following seasons, which, although not presenting the ~novelty effect~ of the first episodes, remain highly enjoyable, almost never predictable, pressing adventures. Like a real television series of which you have to keep watching the episodes until three in the morning, to find out how it ends. The Walking Dead should be thanked not only for having reinvigorated the world of comics, relaunching a genre, that of the zombie-apocalypse, which had by now gone mouldy. We owe him the maturity of having confronted the player with aspects of reality that hurt, with which one does not want to deal. Friendship, trust, death, pity, betrayal: everything is there, and much more. We have deliberately not told you anything about the plot of the game, because it would be a crime to deprive you of the thrill of discovery. Just know that the first season focuses on the relationship between a grown man and a little girl he chooses to take care of, while all around is the end of the world. The other seasons follow the evolution of various characters (main and otherwise), in a context of violence, oppression and struggle for survival. Playstation 4 trophies The trophy list of The Walking Dead Collection seems to be made a bit randomly, mixing the various objectives of the previous seasons. To get platinum it will still be enough to play all the seasons and the DLC at least once, only a matter of time, in the face of a non-existent difficulty. A couple of objectives are missable, all contained in the DLC 400 Days, but it will be enough to reload the save to recover them in a few minutes.  and an (almost) definitive collection The Walking Dead Collection includes everything fans of the series could wish for: the first three official seasons of the video game (Season 1, Season 2 and New Frontier), the first season DLC (previously sold individually) and the three-episode mini-series dedicated to Michonne. In short, everything that has been created by Telltale on The Walking Dead theme, you can find it here. Of course, the season scheduled for 2018 is missing, which according to the developers will end once and for allthe plot, writing the final word on this experience. Why then release a collection before everything is available? First of all, and Square Enix taught us with Kingdom Hearts, fans buy. You can also randomize the content, but they'll still buy. It is therefore welcome that, as in this case, the proposed contents make sense and are treated with dignity: at the same time, The Walking Dead Collection is the perfect edition both for enthusiasts and for those who have never had the opportunity to try the adventures zombie themed graphics, survivors and tension galore. Sure, the fans may have already played all the seasons, otherwise they wouldn't be fans. Here then is that Telltale Games has seen fit to do something that not only makes them happy, but at the same time justifies an otherwise absolutely crazy price (we're talking about 50 euros): remaster everything. Not only from a graphic point of view, which has been significantly enhanced, but above all from a technical point of view. Compare any image taken from the first season with its namesake from the collection: the difference immediately catches the eye, with accentuated finishes, cleaning of the faces and environments, improved lighting effects and above all a skilful balance of colours. The dark and lifeless tones of the old editions have been revisited, but without losing anything in terms of immersion: the general glance has simply been enhanced. The comic art style of the Telltale Games engine has always been appreciated as inspired and fitting, for a product that winked above all at the works of Kirkman, but it certainly could not be denied that in terms of details and visual rendering it left desire. Now, rejuvenated, it can be enjoyed without necessarily looking like a diamond in the rough. If we then add that every two by three the first season (and the second) suffered from slow loading and synchronization problems between audio and images, you will surely be happy to know that everything has been resolved. Finally, in the transition from one scene to another, between internal and external environments, it won't take three days for the game engine to load all the elements on the scene. It must be said that for the first two seasons (and for the DLC of the first) the leap in quality is evident and justifies the remastering work, but the same cannot be said for The New Frontier and for the episodes of Michonne. Being relatively recent, and with the new engine available immediately, their offer seemed to us simply the same as what we already saw last year. Let me be clear, we are talking about titles that were already pleasant to look at and fast on the technical front, with no problems of any kind to report, but perhaps something could have been improved for them too. Not to mention that the whole package is offered for 50 euros, a significant sum for a collection that doesn't offer any bonus content, not even a shred of gallery with sketches, artwork or sound tracks. Some bonuses would have been not only welcome, but perhaps dutiful: the first two seasons of The Walking Dead are easily recovered for negligible sums, even on consoles, and remain pleasant to play even in the absence of a remastering.", "date": "2017-12-10", "grade": "8.8"}
