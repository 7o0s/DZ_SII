{"name": "Il ritorno dell'armadillo del West", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121181-dillons-rolling-western-the-last-ranger-il-ritorno-dellarmadillo-del-west.html", "text": "After the moderate success of the first episode, marred by undeniable balance problems, the rude armadillo Dillon and his talkative sidekick Scott the squirrel are forced back into action due to a new, devastating attack by the infamous Grocks. Greedy for ~mangiolini~, a species of albino pigs that feed on mangiolie, these creatures from the bowels of the earth attack without apparent criteria villages and farms scattered throughout the game world. Already after the first level, however, in Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger it will be discovered that this time a criterion exists, and it is particularly annoying: the objective of the monsters is in fact the railway that crosses the main villages, carrying supplies. Blocking that train therefore means, in fact, starving entire populations. Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger is a sequel that doesn't fix the flaws of its predecessor To the gates! The game structure of this sequel therefore remains substantially unchanged, based on the tested mechanics of a tower defense with an action soul; in fact, the Grocks only move along pre-established paths and therefore, in theory, it would be possible to organize and plan the defense well. In practice, however, the speed and number of monsters will force the brave armadillo to roll furiously across the game map, looking for the enemy closest to the village gates. Just like in the first episode, the exploratory phase before the battle is used to accumulate resources (essentially minerals from the mines and mangiolie to increase the mangiolini); at the end of the collection, a quick return to the village allows you to convert the materials or sell them. At a strategic level, the first, fundamental work to be carried out is the reinforcement for the gates, given that once the monsters arrive at the entrance, it will take very little time to break through them; the detection towers are equally important, not equipped with weapons but useful for immediately locating the Grocks. Unfortunately, the armed turrets are not very functional, placed in places that are not always useful and whose management is at least questionable: the rifles in fact serve only for the defense of the tower itself, the machine guns have an average range but are not particularly effective while the devastating cannons they are slow to reload. The melee is therefore the main method for the fight and Dillon, thanks to the money obtained from the sales of the objects found and from the fees for the missions passed, can buy upgrades and weapons to wear directly. The spikes on the ~armor~ for example add destructive power to the spin attack, just as the higher level gloves make the ~claws~ more and more effective (but, from level 2 onwards, the upgrades are subject to wear and tear) . The explosive and freezing crystals instead act as bombs and ~slows~ for the Grocks present in the area of influence. However, the actual battle does not take place with the whole Grock but with many small clones inside an arena, to be attacked by rolling and using the stylus as a sort of virtual rubber band. Although the general level of difficulty remains rather high, the system allows, after the first ~Game Over~, to increase the resources available right from the start, facilitating purchases and upgrades. The 3D effect Quietly avoidable, the three-dimensional effect does not add anything interesting to the visual impact but above all, during the clashes, it could cause great annoyances; the advice is to deactivate it, at least in the most agitated scenes. Better badly accompanied than alone! Perhaps the only real novelty present in Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger is therefore the possibility, in some levels, of facing the battle not alone but with a companion, recruited in the village saloon (which serves as a base and shelter). In the first phase, the ~new purchase~ (three will be encountered during the adventure: Gallow, Bearboom and Nomad) proves to be really useful, given that it is possible to order him to carry out the most boring actions, such as collecting minerals or eaters. Once the actual aggression has begun, the partner will actively participate in the fight, in some cases recovering the match. However, not always what seems positive at the beginning remains so forever and the reader, if interested, will be able to discover some twists that we prefer not to reveal here. The first small battles against the bosses also appear, structured like the old duels of the far west, beautiful to look at but not well optimized, at least in our case, with the resistive touchscreen of 3DS. From a technical point of view nothing new under the sun: the result is always pleasant, free of approxhigh frame rates but also light years away from ultra-definite details and HD textures. What works well, however, is the atmosphere, a mix between the seriousness of some dialogues and the humor of anthropomorphic animals, inspired by Clint Eastwood's films of the first hour.", "date": "2013-07-17", "grade": "6.8"}
