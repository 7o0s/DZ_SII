{"name": "The Sims 2: Island - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-island-recensione.html", "text": "The idea of finding oneself on an unknown island, lost and far from civilization, perhaps after a shipwreck, has fascinated human beings since ancient times: from the wanderings of Ulysses up to a recent by-product of popular culture such as ~L'isola dei famous, similar narrative programs have characterized works that are distant in time, form and quality. However, it is undeniable that in recent years we have witnessed a paroxysmal proliferation of scenarios of this type: from Tom Hanks and Wilson in Cast Away to the excellent television series Lost, the fascination exerted on the public by similar productions has even increased with the arrival of the new century. EA throws itself into the fray with its ~survival game~, trying to exploit the wave, possibly without being shipwrecked. Lost in Sims Naturally, although it is a ~survival game~, The Sims 2: Island is first and foremost a title belonging to the famous Will Wright saga. The developers have tried to amalgamate these two different essences, giving life to a game that in its final form is very similar to a graphic adventure. The journey naturally begins with the creation of one's alter-ego, which according to tradition is fairly customizable: one is free to choose gender, clothing, hair color and some other details, including the concentration of melanin in the skin and , of course, the name. This phase is followed by the narration of the boat trip, shown through a few vignettes on the lower screen, to which, unfortunately, little importance has been given: the drama of the shipwreck is not explored in the slightest, so much so that this short section turns out to be nothing more than a little managed to deliver your character to the island. This is where the real game begins, characterized in the first moments by a rather pedantic tutorial, but which fortunately soon leaves you free to act: you immediately realize that obtaining food is not such a difficult undertaking, but, on the contrary, you immediately find food in abundance in the areas adjacent to the starting point. Your Sim's needs (~Hunger~, ~Energy~, ~Sociality~, ~Comfort~, ~Hygiene~ and ~Bladder~, the latter a noble allusion to the protagonist's physiological needs) are indicated by some bars on the upper display of the DS, and it will be your job to ensure that they never reach zero, providing the character with what he needs to not pass out, whether it is a sleep or a blueberry binge, otherwise he will reappear, after being robbed by native primates at the starting point. Shipwreck in company Survival is therefore not the main feature of the experience offered by the game, which however does not even focus on interpersonal relationships, nor on building one's own ~nest~ on the island. All these elements have been included in the title, being historically associated with the Sims, but they are sketchy and don't leave much room for individual creation: it is possible  indeed, necessary  to build a shelter, but you cannot expand it to your liking, just as it is not allowed to establish strong ties with the other castaways. The latter are important, but they are mainly so as catalysts of the main quest, mere actants rather than actors: the stories of the individuals (which nevertheless exist), as well as the dialogues (shown through an iconographic language), assume little relevance, as opposed to the tasks they will give you, necessary to escape the island and complete the adventure. You will therefore spend most of your time exploring the unknown territory, divided into three parts, a large island and two smaller peripherals, in search of objects, insects, food and treasures: the main quest is completed in just over ten hours, but the length of the game is enormously linked to your desire to discover the secrets of the island, on which you could also remain forever without incurring any kind of ~Game Over~, or situations associated with it. However, it is necessary to specify that the tasks and missions to be carried out are quite repetitive, therefore, although there are many things to collect, the incentives to complete such a feat are not many. The main activities of the Sim, i.e. fishing, both with the harpoon and with the rod, catching insects and lighting the fire, are managed through minigames based on the use of the touch screen, which however are so well integrated within the game that do not generate an abrupt detachment from the exploratory phase. Each part of the island is divided into many other small sections, independent areas connected to each other by some bottlenecks: undoubtedly a similar layout, although it facilitates exploration, limits the feeling of being inside a territory unitary, instead favoring a percepiecemeal tion. Every movement of the character, including interaction with objects, is managed through the stylus: touching a certain portion of the screen will induce your Sim to move to that position. The control system works well, as the action is practically absent from the game, and the only defect, however not slight, lies in the impossibility of canceling a command: in practice it is not allowed to change direction while walking, the character goes ineluctably at every point touched with the pen. ambient music Graphically, the work done is good, and in this area the division of the scenario into restricted areas has certainly increased the possibilities of the developers. No element taken individually is astonishing, but the overall picture adequately conveys the feeling of being on an island abandoned to itself, although some details sometimes appear even comical: it is not uncommon to observe, for example, one's character washing himself with sand rather than with sea water. The only real sore point are the animations, woody and unnatural. On the musical level, however, a courageous choice was made, since the sound accompaniment was almost completely canceled, present, as well as with the SFX, only when you are near a radio. The Sims 2: Island is a graphic adventure set on a desert island, enriched by some elements extrapolated from management games. Unfortunately, the combination of these different souls did not give life to a completely successful work, having been cut off both the part linked to survival, which does not represent an obstacle, and that relating to social relations, inserted with purely functional and poorly enunciative purposes. The exploration itself, although it is pleasant and supported by the minigames, is undermined by the fragmentation of the island's territory, just as the collection of objects is by the repetitiveness of the missions. Definitively recommended for those who love this type of setting, especially if they are looking for a less extreme experience than the one offered by Lost in Blue.Pro Good graphics Lots of objects to collect Valuable and well-contextualized minigames Cons Excessively fragmented territory Repetitive missions Woody animations", "date": "2007-11-27", "grade": null}
