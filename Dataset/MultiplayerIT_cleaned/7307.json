As if to build a bridge between the old and new generation of consoles (or more likely, to try to give a boost to sales so far lower than expected), Ubisoft has now decided to release Rayman Legends also for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, taking advantage of the greater computing power of the hardware to make some light filings of a technical nature. As per tradition in these cases, we refer you to the review of the Wii U version to find out all the details of the title, while here we will focus on the characteristics of this next gen port. An aubergine is forever Playing Rayman Legends on any platform other than a Wii U brings out some details that clearly testify how the project was initially conceived as an exclusive for the Nintendo console: the reference is in particular aimed at the role of Murfy, a nice creature winged that in certain levels of the Wii U version was controlled by acting on the Gamepad touch screen while a second user (or artificial intelligence in case you were playing alone) continued by controlling the main character on the TV screen. It was a gameplay element obviously designed to take advantage of the characteristics of the Nintendo hardware, and which was necessarily heavily scaled down when Rayman Legends passed on the other home consoles, including the last two to arrive at Sony and Microsoft. The solution adopted by the developers in order not to completely sacrifice the sections in Murfy's company still appears functional and far more than acceptable: therefore, even on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the player maintains control of the protagonist, with Murfy moving independently in the its areas of competence and which can be given the order to perform a context-sensitive action by pressing a key at the right moment. Although the matter is inevitably less stimulating than an interaction via touch screen, it must be admitted that the excellent design work of Ancel and associates does not make us regret the Wii U Gamepad too much, guaranteeing Rayman Legends an exciting and fluid gameplay even in these particular levels. It must be said that there are some real cuts, and they concern a handful of situations (they can really be counted on the fingers of one hand) in which it would have been impossible to find a valid alternative to tactile controls, even considering the presence of the touchpad of PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One Kinect: fortunately we are really talking about a few drops in the ocean of contents of absolute value that Rayman Legends reconfirms itself capable of dispensing to the user with impressive continuity. The levels follow each other at a rapid pace, always offering new and fun situations, with the constant guarantee of a gameplay capable of giving great satisfaction both to those who want to face it in single player and to those who have the opportunity to involve some friends. Even on the new consoles, Rayman Legends is confirmed as one of the best exponents of its genre Playstation 4 trophies On PlayStation 4, Rayman Legends offers the exact same Trophies as the PlayStation 3 version: we are therefore talking about 51 trophies, of which 38 are bronze, 10 silver, 2 gold and one platinum (that is, the one that can be unlocked after having obtained all other). Among these specimens, seven are related to online challenges and one to the Kung Foot minigame, for which the presence of a friend to play online or locally is required. All the others can also be obtained alone during the adventure, and especially those reserved for the Invasion levels will test even the most experienced platform players. What do we care about tredd We mentioned at the beginning of the slight technical improvements made by Ubisoft on the occasion of this launch of Rayman Legends on the new consoles, changes that can be recognized mainly in two aspects. The first is that of the loads, which have been completely eliminated here: in the previous versions of the game, in fact, the dead times between one level and another had been disguised with screens in which you could move the silhouette of your character on an empty scenario, which on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have not found a reason to exist. The second card that the developers francehave been able to play on the new generation consoles is that of a greater definition of the image, made possible by the generous memory of the hardware: in essence, it has been possible to propose textures that have not required any compression process, and which consequently they can be shown in all their detail. It is clear that we are not talking about the difference between day and night, but it is equally undoubted that these last two versions represent the best possible showcase for the exceptional graphics of Rayman Legends, which after months still continues to fascinate for its qualities ranging from the use of colors to the beautiful animations of the characters. With the exception of the details just mentioned, the differences with the previous versions of the title are very minimal: as a sop, Ubisoft has included a couple of exclusive features for each of the two consoles, but nothing to shout about. On Xbox One you can therefore count on three new costumes for the characters (Splinter Ray, Ray Vaas and Globox Vaas) and on ten additional Challenge stages that help unlock some extra objectives; on PlayStation 4, however, the choice fell on a single new skin (Assassin Ray), while it is possible to use the touch pad of the controller to rub the scratch cards that are given out at the end of each level and above all to stop the action game at any time and zoom in or out to take a screenshot to share on social networks.", "date": "2014-02-18", "grade": "9.0"}
