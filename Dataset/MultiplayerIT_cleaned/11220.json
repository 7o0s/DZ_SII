{"name": "Europa Universalis: Rome - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/europa-universalis-rome-recensione.html", "text": "Summary of the previous installments (i.e. the first rudiments on the Europa Universalis series) Built on the foundations of Europa Universalis III, Europa Universalis: Rome - unlike the last two expansions released so far - is a real new chapter in the Europa Universalis series that wants to add a further piece to the now impressive historical-playful mosaic composed from other Paradox titles such as Crusader Kings, Victoria or Hearts of Iron. every action, even the seemingly most innocuous one, leads to a reaction Summary of the previous installments (i.e. the first rudiments on the Europa Universalis series) Unlike the vast majority of other wide-ranging strategy games, the titles of the Europa Universalis series take place in real time and not turn-based  even if with the possibility of pausing, the player is still given the opportunity to better plan his choices. However, the use of real time as the default method of approach must not mislead: the variables and characteristics of the elements involved are such and so many that every action, even the apparently most harmless one, leads to a reaction and - above all - not there is a unique way of doing things. For example, in Rome the recruitment time of a cohort is not fixed, but depends on the province and the resources available, both native and those acquired through trade. Alea iacta est (enthusiasts, at least start reading from here) Rome offers the possibility to start the game between 278 and 25 BC. - i.e. between 474 and 727 A.V.C. according to Roman usage. The most attentive will have immediately noticed that the historical period concerned is that of Republican Rome and that period of time between the Punic Wars and the real birth of the Empire. This particular choice of the developers immediately wants to highlight the desire to focus the player's attention on the problems relating to the rise of Rome's military power and not so much on the management and maintenance of the Roman Empire - an aspect that presumably will be dealt with in a separate expansion. This intent highlights what represents the original sin of this title and which, beyond its undeniable merits, severely limits its potential to the point of highlighting the inadequacy of the game structure in the face of the proposed concept. Along this time frame, the player is given free choice on when to leave and with which people to face him. As per tradition, depending on the chosen historical sub-period, the game will offer the user a shortlist of candidate nations to maximize the gaming experience and, for each of them, the associated degree of difficulty will also be shown. Paradoxically, but not too much, by selecting Rome things, however complex, will often turn out to be quite simple or - at least - will lead to obligatory game tactics. After all, with few exceptions (Carthage, rather than the provinces under the control of the Roman rebels) using other populations, in most cases, is, albeit amusing, rather simplistic and - above all - limiting. To make the most of the setting of ancient Rome, the programmers have given particular emphasis to the dynamics between the various Roman families as well as the possibility of establishing friendships and alliances between the most eminent characters of the various families. Every single character in the game is characterized by a wide range of characteristics and distinctive traits that greatly help to immerse yourself even more in the historical period and give the game a considerable touch of personality. For example, when selecting governors for your provinces, you may find yourself having to choose between a candidate who is disloyal and prone to corruption but also able to collect more taxes and profits, rather than an old and faithful general who has lost his use of an arm during a battle that brought honor and glory to Rome. Likewise, the game is dotted with more or less random events which, in addition to giving us an idea of what the customs and traditions of the time were, will put us in front of a wide range of choices, each with different effects. As per the tradition of the series, the fights are resolved without requiring direct intervention by the player but are based on factors depending on the composition of the troops, the characteristics of the battlefield and the generals involved... as well as a minimum random variable, of course . A battle ends when all the soldiers of one of the two armies die or morale drops enough to cause a retreat. As usual, although size (of armies) does matter, wear and tear will often need to be kept under controlor war or the tiredness of their legions, forcing the player to a careful planning and analysis phase, made more difficult by the real-time nature of the movements and clashes. In Rome, this component is even more cumbersome and takes on even more importance than in the other titles in the Europa Universalis series. Although the path of diplomacy is not precluded, the latter is not an alternative as much as a simple adjuvant to the use of force. Especially playing in certain historical moments, a few hours of gameplay will be enough to make RTS terminology seem more appropriate than ever. After the war aspect, trade - and the exchange of resources and raw materials - contends with diplomacy for the role of the second most important element in the game. In addition to replenishing the always too empty state coffers through the establishment of trade routes, it will allow you to make the most of your provinces and unlock new possibilities. Similarly, a careful analysis of the Mediterranean economy could lead you, for example, to block all trade routes to a country to cut off timber supplies and thus make it impossible for it to build new boats. An approach of the latter type, combined with the naval blockade of the major ports of the same nation, would inevitably lead to an overwhelming naval supremacy in the stretch of sea concerned. De Technicorum Even for all those who have not forgiven Paradox following the introduction of the three-dimensional graphics engine, Rome is the first title to exploit (and try to justify) this innovation by offering the possibility of freely rotating the camera and thus moving around the scenario. Even after many hours of play, the usefulness of the feature remains rather marginal and most of the time you will still find yourself using the default view by simply changing the zoom level. More generally, graphically Rome appears more refined and pleasant than Europa Universalis III. On the sound side, apart from some sparse and sporadic effects in conjunction with battles or little else, the soundtrack stands out for the fact that you will soon prefer to use your favorite multimedia player in the background: not so much for the poor quality of the soundtrack, but due to the small number of tracks available. Fortunately, the game is so sparing of hardware requests that you won't be forced to use minimal players in order not to affect performance. graphically Rome appears more refined and pleasant than Europa Universalis III De Technicorum The multiplayer provides up to a maximum of 32 participants, both in cooperative and competitive mode, with the indisputable advantage of being able to interrupt game sessions and then resume them at a later time. In addition to being able to replace any players who are no longer available. The game interface, albeit partially revised, presumably mainly in favor of newcomers, on the one hand manages to displace all the faithful of the saga - forcing them to review their mental automatisms - and on the other it does not seem to succeed in its simplification and accessibility improvement. In addition to a series of intrinsic problems related to the type of game and the amount of data to read and sometimes manage, the Paradox developers still seem to be unaware of the usefulness of the right mouse button (are they diehard Steve Jobs fans?) and therefore have obviated the total lack of the classic contextual menus with a series of fixed icons and menu items on the edge of the screen that become usable depending on the selected object: province, rather than army or fleet. To conclude the not exactly rosy picture, at least in this respect, using high game resolutions some elements of the interface are then difficult to identify and therefore selectable. In addition to a really well done package (complete with a giant map), we point out the complete translation into Italian (not free from some defects) and a really complete and well written game manual capable of introducing you to the game world in a direct and immediate as well as exhaustively deepening a series of features necessary to enjoy the game to the fullest. We would like this to be the standard, not the exception. Comment We are sorry to write it but it is useless to go around too much, Europa Universalis: Rome leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Not so much because it is not well-finished or profound as per the tradition of the series, but simply because the setting given to the title seems to go in the opposite direction to that expressed by the individual game components. Playing Europa Universalis: Rome, Rome: T cannot but come to mindotal War and having made the due comparisons, one is repeatedly tempted to quit the game and reinstall Creative Assembly's masterpiece. Ultimately, a title that maintains the high quality of the series and is appreciated for the great care in reproducing the historical period but which paradoxically fails to offer varied and compelling gameplay like its predecessors. Despite this, fans of historical ~what-ifs~ and history lovers in general will find bread for their teeth and will be able to turn a blind eye to the purely playful aspects.
