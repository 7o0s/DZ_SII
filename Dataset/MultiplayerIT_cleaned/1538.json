{"name": "Conflict Desert Storm II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conflict-desert-storm-ii.html", "text": "Persian Gulf, 1991 year Twelve years have passed quickly, the writer at the time was just over nine years old, just a little boy, but such events remain in the memory for many years. It was the first time that, with the illusion of giving war from the front row, the TVs broadcast for hours and hours the same inexpressive images of tracers that cut the sky leaving behind the characteristic greenish trail against the unreal background of past skies to infrared rays. While an antiquated anti-aircraft aircraft of Soviet origin was trying to shoot down airplanes that were even invisible to conventional instruments, and in any case beyond their reach, whoever was sitting at home in front of the television set was in turn bombarded with a series of information which, all in all, they did not reveal any substantial news. Now whoever lived those moments of inexplicable tension with vivid participation will rarely have had the opportunity to understand how that war unfolded its plots. If it was still not clear to anyone, it should be remembered that the 1991 war in Iraq was wanted not only by President Bush Sr. but by the UN itself which wanted to guarantee the defense of Kuwait with this act, illegitimately invaded by Saddam Hussein's armed troops . The protagonists of that conflict were professionals and specialists. Anyone who believed they were then grappling with the start of a new world war was wrong, since the matter, taken with due seriousness, was treated with surgical precision and effectiveness. Everything about the new conflict is probably another story. Nonetheless, it is clear that the figures of those who completed this work and the highly eventful context full of ideas must have tickled the programmers of Sci Games several times, before the official decision to develop such a game. FPS, Tactical FPS, Arcade Tactical FPS... The last few years have seen the birth of a genre which, inspired by the potential of FPS (First Person Shooter) has finally given shape to real war simulations, giving the player the point of view of the soldier who carries out the action in battle and no longer the more classic and less involving view from above, certainly with less impact. Tactical FPS or Strategic, Stealth FPS, if you prefer, are exactly the kind of game I'm referring to to introduce you to CDSII. The single-character mode typical of the classic FPS, extended to involve an entire team, combined with the development of more refined AI, have allowed over time to obtain a good level of reliability and not burden the player's task too much. At first, with titles such as Hidden & Dangerous or Rainbow Six, remote team management was all too unreliable and there was too often the risk of having to jump from one character to another often to ensure a minimum of control over the mission. In CDSII we will step into the shoes of a formidable task force of allied commandos (those who have played the first chapter may be interested to know that they are the same characters: Bradley, Foley, Connors and Jones) and with whom we will retrace the most sensational deeds of the first gulf war. The game opens with a frantic recovery action, in the ~arrive, clean the area and leave~ series. Everything is functional to frame from the very first moments what was the real intention of the SCI Games guys in terms of game setting. The marked arcade vein soon shows itself in all its bright and pleasant clarity. The action is fast, the enemies are many and the weapons supplied more than adequate to start a carnage. Although this is the first mission and not having set the difficulty of the game at the highest levels, one immediately realizes that what the developer was most interested in was certainly not the exaggerated simulation, but rather the involvement at the expense of even the same fidelity towards the reality of similar acts of war. And this is a good thing in many ways, since very often there is a lack on the PC platform of a game that knows how to worthily blend the Tactical FPS genre with the natural fluency of an arcade. With one to four characters in play, you have the ability to switch between them to gain overall control of the situation. The commands for managing the team are simple, direct and precise. FPS, Tactical FPS, Arcade Tactical FPS... The team is perfectly heterogeneous and has four very balanced characters, of which hardlyyou will be able to do without during the duration of the game. Everyone has their own specialty, everyone is able to do their job. There is the sharpshooter (the most suitable for sniper actions), the explosives expert, the group commander expert in communications and assault weapons and obviously the heavy weapons officer. At the end of each mission, some summary cards collect the statistics of your characters, rewarding them if you have performed noteworthy actions during the level. The choice to add even a small RPG streak to the game is very appreciable. In fact, if your characters are controlled with criteria, they will be able to increase their ability in some combat characteristics. For example, in the event that one of your soldiers proves to be particularly skilled in the use of weapons, and actually hits many of the shots fired, with a good probability at the end of the level he will receive a score increase for the aimed shot characteristic. Also, anyone who proves to be particularly prodigal in rescuing an injured comrade with their medipacks in action will receive a bonus in medication. And so on for the various characteristics of each character. Storm in the Desert... The capacity for action is total despite the fact that the maps, while presenting entire districts, even very large ones, are not navigable in their entirety. Freedom of movement, while being sufficiently large, must in any case follow the pre-established route, even if the possibility remains of making small detours along the way and exploring, for example, entire buildings, discovering their secrets and even some weapons forgotten by enemy militias. As is obvious, our four heroes will have to face entire platoons of opposing soldiers alone. Although the difference in preparation and armaments of the two factions is clearly evident, the question remains how so few men can bring dozens and sometimes hundreds of enemies to their knees. Obviously all this is functional to the attempt to make a title that could otherwise be extremely complicated and not very engaging as playable as possible. Dying on the battlefield, at least on conventional difficulty levels, is quite difficult and not even the close blast of a hand grenade or an RPG rocket (the Soviet model bazooka, supplied to the Iraqi army) will be able to completely kill a of your men. This is because in CDSII when the life level reaches the minimum level the character, despite being practically useless, seriously injured and lying on the ground, does not really die, but remains in this state until someone comes to his rescue with a medipack. Death occurs only when the character in this specific state receives no immediate healing. The extraordinary endowment of usable weapons and vehicles makes the game actions even more exciting and frenetic. For example, it is possible to take possession of a military off-road vehicle equipped with a belt machine gun and assign various tasks to the passengers, thus managing to proceed on a route automatically while in the first person it is possible to control the weapon on board. Storm in the Desert... During the course of the mission you will often encounter setbacks and receive new orders based on the progress of the battle. Although everything is already foreseen by the scripts, leaving no room for digressions on the subject, this particularity does not fail to give a good dose of spice to the game, making it even more interesting and enjoyable. Thanks to these changes of plans it will sometimes be possible to even receive cover for an aviation intervention, which is truly spectacular. Imagine the situation: as you turn the corner of a seemingly deserted street you find yourself face to face with a menacing enemy tank. Not having a portable rocket launcher, you should only rely on the skill of your explosives expert, who could try to place some anti-tank mines under the vehicle's tracks. But the situation gets complicated because the tank is very far away from you. At this point divine providence materializes and a voice on the radio announces that the intervention of helicopters is available to clear the road. You just have to use the satellite pointer, center the viewfinder on the target for about ten seconds and, without being seen, press the activation button. Fleeing to avoid being hit by one last deadly heavy artillery blast, you will only have time to notice theprofile of an approaching Apache, intent on unloading all its destructive fury on the crawler. But the difficulties are hard to die and you will also have to shoot down dangerous enemy helicopters and take possession, with grenades, bunkers and positions equipped with heavy artillery; sabotage skills and speed of action will be required of you. Hopes are placed in you for the success of the most important missions of the Gulf War, and as guardian angels you will have to give up sleep to make sure that everything runs smoothly. Magnifying glass The game interface contains all the functions in just a few keys, allowing total control of the team using only the left hand on the keyboard, and reserving the most common actions such as aiming the target and firing, to the mouse. While confessing an initial difficulty in controlling the situation, after a bit of training (and here it wouldn't hurt to try the tutorial before jumping into the real game) it's easy to learn the fine art that makes all video players real own pc keyboard pianists. The only thing I could argue with in this respect is the choice made by the programmers for weapon selection in the player you are controlling. The computer-controlled team characters use the weapons in their possession wisely, choosing them and switching from one to another depending on the occasion (mythical is the voice of the teammates who warn that they have just thrown a grenade shouting ~Bomb in bucaaa!~) . While the interface chosen for the character you are using can be uncomfortable, even if it can actually in a certain sense simulate the difficulty that a soldier can try to switch from one weapon to another during a fight. It is a scrolling menu, which can cause many problems when choosing the weapon to use, not showing the entire inventory in a single solution (only a few objects are seen at a time). A note of merit goes instead to the really well done and cared for soundtrack, the same thing goes for the sound effects including the fantastic voiceovers of the radios that continuously warn us of the evolution of the mission and the current state of things. The rescue mode which provides a limited number of restore points depending on the level of difficulty is very pleasant and extremely apt. This leads to two consequences, both positive. The first is that under these rules it is more natural to weigh every single action carried out (making things more fun and exciting), the second is that the habit of saving every killed enemy is soon lost, diverting the nature of the game itself which requires a good dose of courage. Magnifying glass The possibility of choosing which group of special forces to join, on the other hand, is a bit useless and trivial, given that the characters do not change at all; however, it is a simple aesthetic choice that will essentially change only the skins of the characters. Speaking of the AI we must not forget to underline the good realization of the behavior of the enemy soldiers (in addition to that already mentioned of the computer-controlled comrades). Although many criticize the games of the genre for the decompensation caused by the behavior of the enemies, which do not seem to suffer from any penalty due to the combat environment, in CDSII the computer, just like the human player simulates different battle performances depending on what happens around the characters. So an enemy sniper, forced to shoot on characters wrapped in desert dust, will have the same difficulties in making a targeted shot as a human being in the same situation. The graphics, thanks to an advanced engine, are pleasant and very detailed. The game certainly does not lack fluidity and the characters move in a realistic way. The implementation of real ~intelligent~ and reactive animations to the surrounding environment for the death of the characters makes everything even more interesting: at the moment of killing, for example, you can see the corpse of an enemy placed on a roof falling meters until it crashes to the ground, instead of collapsing unnaturally. Just to remove the doubt, the programmers themselves are keen to underline that although it is possible to get rid of the enemies in infinite ways it is not possible to give Saddam Hussein the sack wow, he is alive now, in 2003, with the war at home, imagine if they made you kill him in '91!", "date": "2003-09-25", "grade": null}
