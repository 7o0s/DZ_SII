{"name": "Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/supreme-commander-forged-alliance-recensione.html", "text": "Expansion or standalone game? As mentioned above, what should have initially been a normal expansion has seen Forged Alliance become a completely separate product from its predecessor, as if to mark Gas Powered's intention to offer an improved product in what were the defects found throughout 'interior of SC, identified above all in a poor differentiation of the three alignments available in the game and in the interface, too uncomfortable and invasive for the excited phases of an RTS. To deal with the first of the two problems, in addition to the introduction of the Seraphim, the development team has well thought of inserting new units for all three existing armies, to which a more than satisfactory balancing work has also been applied, although someone may turn up their noses at the decision to put nuclear attacks in the background, making them always powerful but excessively long to prepare: nevertheless, we can still say that an excellent job has been done in general, placing emphasis on the possibility of diversifying one's own battalions present on the map, in order to better face the various types of those fielded by the enemy, who for his part will give a hard time thanks to an improved AI that can also adapt to our style of play and to the situations that arise they will check on the map. To prevent novices from quickly yielding under the incessant blows of the CPU, the developers have well thought of giving a wide choice on the level of difficulty in matches against the computer, to which it will be possible to associate a simple level AI, as well as one of the ~rush~ type that will immediately begin to break the eggs in the player's basket, or, in a diametrically opposite way, a type of artificial intelligence that is more attentive to defenses and reluctant to expand: therefore everyone has their own bread for their own teeth, including hardcore gamers. Mode If multiplayer has already been one of the most appreciated aspects by SC enthusiasts in the past, thanks also to the excellent online service GPG.net, with the release of FA comes one more reason to play games via the network or even in skirmish mode against the computer: the Seraphim are in fact not selectable within the single campaign, but only in games against other players and/or the CPU, within which it is therefore possible to count on four selectable alignments instead of three, provided however whether you have the base game, without which the new aliens represent the only selectable race: this is probably the only real flaw that makes FA incomplete compared to SC. Be that as it may, the Seraphim also offer the possibility of trying a different type of strategy, given that in general their units are more powerful than those of the allied enemies, but with a longer construction time, so it is necessary to slightly change the own style of play to meet the type of army made available. The introduction of the new race is not the only change that involves multiplayer games, given that the development team has taken the opportunity to add further, very large maps, within which it is possible to engage in multiple battlefronts for give rise to war scenes with even more epic tones than seen in the first game. For new and old Comment Gas Powered does not fail this time either, proposing what is indeed an expansion, but so wide and deep that it would have been a shame to allow its usability only to owners of the first SC: therefore the decision to create a stand-alone version is welcome, to which a first applause goes. Secondly, as we have already seen in the body of the review, the changes made by the programmers definitely hit the mark, reviewing practically all the aspects criticized in the original title for the better, not to mention the introduction of a completely new breed zero. Even the graphic upgrade is appreciated both in terms of pure visual detail and looking at it from the point of view of playability, given that in the past it was a bit difficult to adequately distinguish the units on the map with the minimum zoom. In summary, FA is a happy novelty both for those who have already spent hours and hours playing the first SC, and for those who have not yet had the opportunity to try the effort of Gas Powered, which has been able to carve out a first-rate place in the inside the RTS.Pro landscape Improved graphics and UI Lots of new units and a new race Fun online Cons Some balance choices you might not like To play over the network with the old races you need the first Supreme Commander PC - Requirementsystem ites Minimum Requirements Processor: CPU 1.8 GHz RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 128 MB RAM with Vertex Shader / Pixel Shader 2.0 support (GeForce 6x00/Radeon 9600 or higher) Sound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible Hard Disk: 8 GB space DVD: 8x DVD Drive Recommended Requirements Processor: Intel or AMD 3.0 GHz RAM: 1 GB Video Card: 256 MB RAM (GeForce 6800 or higher) Test Configuration Processor: AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ RAM: 2 GB Video Card: GeForce 7900GT Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is available for PC. At the time of its release, Supreme Commander was awaited by the gaming population with sufficient anxiety, even if probably few within this population expected a pasta game of which the effort of Gas Powered then proved to be made, revealing itself as a very pleasant element in the RTS panorama, so much so that it deserves the nickname of strategic of the year from someone and, not surprisingly, bringing more than welcome innovations in the genre, albeit with some small defects in the realization. Since perfection does not exist, but there are those who at least try to get close to it, Gas Powered subsequently decides to release an expansion, which we are dealing with in this article, initially foreseen as a classic add-on to the original game and then moving on later to be a real stand-alone title, given the considerable number of innovations and improvements introduced by the programmers for the occasion. The story of Forged Alliance begins where SC saw its epilogue: after the war between UEF, Cybrans and Aeon, in which all three sides have reported huge losses, a new race, the Seraphim, threatens to destroy the old contenders, who are therefore forced to ally with each other to try to defeat the mysterious common enemy. While the three races already present in the old game had a human genetic basis, on which mutations had been made for different causes, the new units introduced with the Seraphim belong to a real alien race, which we will therefore learn about during the new campaign of FA, which does not include that of the first title of the series.", "date": "2007-11-26", "grade": null}
