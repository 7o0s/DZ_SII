{"name": "Delta Force: Black Hawk Down", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/delta-force-black-hawk-down-2.html", "text": "Reality In 1991, the dictator Mohamed Siad assassinated President Shermarke, who had ruled Somalia since 1969. The country plunged into chaos and civil war, the resulting famine causing about 350,000 victims. The USA and the UN then organize the ~Restore Hope~ operation, to bring food and medicine to the population. The aid brings relief to the population but the columns become the target of local warlords. In 1993 Mohamed Farah Aidid, head of the Habr Gedir clan, occupied the capital Mogadishu and became the main target of the US special forces. On June 13, four journalists die in an attack on Aidid's headquarters. On October 3, during another US raid, two helicopters crash and 18 American soldiers are killed. The humanitarian program was closed in March 1995, in June of the same year Aidid proclaimed himself president of Somalia. On August 1, Aidid died of a wound sustained in battle. Rambo against the skinny Although with a certain degree of realism, the game setting is arcade oriented. It is important to plan one's moves but also to execute them with a certain speed and to always be on the move. The aim of the militiamen is bad, in line with what you see in the film and probably also with reality. It follows that you will rarely be hit from a distance, almost never with the first burst. What you need to beware of most are ambushes at close range, in the alleys of the city or from behind a shack, since a burst of AK-47 at point-blank range leaves no way out. The enemies, although low in terms of skills, make up for the low quality with quantity, and in many game circumstances the numerical superiority is overwhelming. As if that weren't enough, in some missions the guerrillas are mixed with the civilian population, and you have to be careful not to do too much ~collateral damage~, otherwise the mission will fail (After all, it should be a humanitarian mission... N.d. Kappa). Although the scenario remains the same throughout the campaign, the diversification of missions and objectives is excellent. They range from the banal ~kill them all~ to missions with cover roles, escort of military and humanitarian convoys. Sometimes you need to secure an area to allow more troops and helicopters to arrive. There is also a ~stealth~ type night mission, where you will have to infiltrate the city with the help of the night vision goggles, stealthy footing and above all silenced MP5. There are frequent missions with demolition objectives: everything has to be blown up: bridges, vehicles, radio stations, armory crates, mortars and even a ship! At the beginning of the missions, entering the hot zone is always spectacular and fun, often you will have to make your way by shooting from the machine gun of a hummer, knocking out as many enemies as possible; other times the area must be cleared from the helicopter, paying particular attention to the militiamen armed with RPGs who can make you fall with a single shot. However, you will not be alone, on average your team is made up of you plus two or three other raiders, but this is not always an advantage. Friendly fire is inaccurate even if better than that of the guerrillas, more than anything else it will give you cover and will indicate the position of the enemies, this is probably desired, the real work must be done by you. The downside is that you will have to protect your companions, a few fallen too many and the mission fails. Generally this is not a problem because you usually ~lead the way~. Sometimes, however, your companions will be seized by strange attacks of courage that will only lead to them being riddled with a machine gun. In these cases, the only solution will be to precede them by running as fast as they can to clean up the area. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is not the best but they will often try to take you from behind or from the sides, while that of the companions is decidedly limited: they limit themselves to following you always and everywhere, sometimes ending up stuck behind a vehicle or a metal mesh: a pity not being able to give them some order, at least to help them overcome the most critical situations. As I said before, the action is arcade-like, generally our character dies with three or four hits, but there is a reasonable availability of medikits during the missions. The bailouts are limited but generally enough and progress to complete the mission, sometimes you will even have 9 slots available! The realism is only ~fair~ also because the recoil of the weapons is completely missing, and also the loss of precision when shooting on the move or when you have just turned around. Sure, four years ago only Rainbow Six did, but now these things have become the standard. Theredifficulty is medium-low apart from the last three missions which see you retrace the events of October 3, 1993, the mission that inspired the film, above all for the greater precision of the enemy snipers. A look at the armory Our Delta soldier has three ~slots~ available: one for the primary weapon (rifles and assault weapons), one for the secondary (pistol or shotgun) and one for plastic-type gadgets and hand grenades. You will almost always also have binoculars and night vision goggles with you. For rifles you can choose from MP5, CAR15, M16, M21, M24, Barrett, SAW, M60 and M240. I personally used the CAR15 for most of the missions, especially for the convenience of the ~red dot~, i.e. a tiny laser pointer. Sometimes, especially in ~destroy everything~ missions, you will be able to choose the model equipped with a grenade launcher. Conversely, in stealth missions, you will be forced to equip yourself with silenced weapons such as an MP5. Some missions should be tackled with the sniper rifle (the best in my opinion is the M21), but in this case you will absolutely have to avoid that the enemies become too many or too close. Machine guns (M60, M240, SAW) are a great choice when you have to take out many enemies quickly, and you don't have time to change magazines (the machine gun belt holds 200 rounds); however, this is paid for with less precision (the shots don't end up exactly in the center of the viewfinder) and with the impossibility of zooming. The choice of secondary weapon isn't particularly important, I only resorted to it when I ran out of primary ammunition. The engine of a helicopter The previous episodes of the Delta Force series were characterized by the use of Voxel technology for the creation of large landscapes, even if mixed with polygonal and accelerated 3D graphics. With Black Hawk Dawn we are witnessing for the first time the total abandonment of voxels and the adoption of the graphics engine of Comanche 4. This has led to the creation of truly enormous locations, all of which can be traveled without interruptions or loading. Arriving in Mogadishu by helicopter and seeing ALL the city below makes a great effect, then without any interruption you descend and you are immediately in the middle of the battle. The water, sky and grass are well done and realistic. The buildings are less cared for, especially the textures and interiors, but what the heck are we going to war, not to a painting exhibition! The models of the people and weapons are excellently made, some touches of class such as the landscape reflected in the viewfinder lens and the dust raised by the rotor of the helicopters are worth noting. The interface is functional and well done, the ~radar~ at the bottom right is particularly useful, it always shows the route to the next waypoint and represents a small portion of the aerial map, which can also be viewed in full screen. It is essential to keep an eye on it also to understand the direction of enemy attacks, which it signals by illuminating its directions in yellow. The film Ridley Scott's masterpiece, released in theaters in 2001, tells us the events of that fateful October 3, 1993 in Somalia. The mission was to take Aidid's officials prisoner; the objective is achieved but the mission turns into a bloodbath due to the crash of two Black Hawk helicopters. The film highlights the code of honor of the Special Forces, according to which ~no one can be abandoned~ dead or alive, even if this may mean the sacrifice of other human lives. Radio aidid The music that accompanies the game is very beautiful and engaging, almost always in an oriental style. Small arms noise is not particularly convincing; the effects of explosions, heavy weapons, the noise of vehicles and helicopters are much better. The effects of the crowd and the radio messages are also good, which increase the feeling of involvement. It has nothing to do with the professionalism of Raven Shield's audio samples, but still conveys the right idea and atmosphere. Multiplayer and surroundings Also in this title the now classic multiplayer mode is not missing. The guys from Novalogic have seen fit to create a classic mode but at the same time a bearer of novelties. First of all, it bears a particular resemblance to great titles such as Counter Strikeand Project IGI, although it does not have all the precision and completeness present in these titles. To be able to enjoy this mode you will need to register at NovaWorld, a system already adopted with Raven Shield and its Ubi.com. After registering, you can enter a special area where you can create games or participate directly. There are 7 game modes, very different from each other and well characterized including: DeathMatch, classic ~all against all~ mode.Team DeathMatch, identical to the first mode with the only difference being divided into teams.The King off the Hill , team mode where you have to take turns defending a location for a while. Attack and Defend, very similar to IGI 2, depending on the team you will have to attack or defend an area. Search and Destroy, interesting mode where there will be targets to destroy, whoever destroys them first will win the game. Capture the Flag, classic ~capture the flag~ mode, where you have to capture the enemy flag and bring it to your base, and finally Flag Ball, similar to the same mode in UT2003, where you have to bring the ~ball~ to the enemy base to score. As you have seen there are several modes, all points in favor for this new title. Another point in favor is given by the size and immensity of the various maps, which, in the long run, could be a disadvantage depending on the type of mission. Indeed, in some particularly large maps, you will find yourself under enemy fire without understanding where it is coming from due to the field of view. All in all it is good from this point of view too and we just have to proceed to the conclusions Conclusions Goal achieved? In my opinion yes, despite its flaws Black Hawk Down will be able to give hours and hours of fun, even if it is not suitable for those looking for a simulation or a game about special operations. Otherwise, for all fans of the various more classic Fps, all you have to do is make it yours and you won't regret it. Be careful, however, to have sufficiently ~pumped~ hardware, the graphics engine gets heavier especially in the phases of approaching urban centers. We recommend at least 256MB of ram, a 1200 Mhz processor and a video card of at least the power of a GeForce3. Pros Engaging fun Large locations Variety of missions and objectives Cons Lack of control over companions Can't drive vehicles Unrealistic weapon accuracy A humanitarian war Black Hawk Down is the latest title produced by Novalogic concerning the special teams called Delta Force. ~Black Hawk Down~ is the American code used to indicate the fall of a helicopter during a fight, the game is inspired by the film of the same name released two years ago. The scenario is that of Somalia in '93, you play a soldier of the Delta Force, the spearhead of the US army. The purpose of the American intervention is mainly to protect the humanitarian aid columns of the United Nations. In fact, in the game there are several convoy escort missions, alternating however with real raids to destroy the guerrillas' posts and vehicles, or kill or kidnap their leaders. Everything turns into a real war against the militias of the Habr Gedir clan, led by General Aidid.", "date": "2003-04-15", "grade": null}
