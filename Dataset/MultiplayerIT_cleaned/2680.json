{"name": "Hidden & Dangerous", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hidden-dangerous.html", "text": "Playability is actually a bit of an enigma. Unfortunately, many will raise the white flag in the face of the amount of commands that must be mastered, even those who own a mouse and keyboard, let alone those who use a normal pad with only six keys, alas. The basic actions apart from moving and shooting are: stand up, crouch, lie down, inventory, change weapon, change soldier, map, reload, first and third person view., and all this is done by pressing the left back button, which assumes the function of a sort of shift, effectively doubling the commands already assigned. The learning curve is really high. It will take a lot of perseverance and patience before obtaining decent results, very satisfying though! With the keyboard you don't run the risk of getting tangled up, since the many commands are better distributed here. Each soldier has parameters that define his specialization: the sniper is the one he will most willingly use, and for this reason the game is a bit easy and not entirely balanced. Collecting weapons and ammunition from the corpses of dead soldiers, we will go on to the bitter end sniping everyone from afar, leaving out the concerted maneuvers with the other fellow soldiers who are the heart of the title. It won't always be that easy, but this is the quickest way to get to the end of the game, also avoiding the cumbersome keystrokes that in the middle of a firefight almost always lead to certain death. The artificial intelligence of the enemies works on and off, like that of the teammates anyway: for example, it happens that the fellow soldiers are now the shooting gold medal, and the next moment they don't see a Kraut at 5 meters. In this case, the speech recommended for enthusiasts cannot apply, H&D either loves it or hates it, in no uncertain terms: if you go beyond the wall of a thousand keys, the game manages to give you a lot of satisfaction, also thanks to the excellent balance of difficulty level. Completed it will be put back on the shelf and dusted every now and then, but given the genre this is perfectly plausible. I repeat: either you drop it after 5 minutes, or you play it in one go until the end, enjoying the stakeouts and encirclement maneuvers. Ultimately we are faced with a good title, however undermined by some basic ambiguities, and by too many keys to master perfectly. PROS: Atmosphere Great sound CONS: Control method Graphics a bit dated Hidden & Dangerous is a difficult title to evaluate. The porting of the Take2 title re-proposes, without changing anything, what was already seen on the PC a couple of years ago. You must lead four men of the British special forces in missions deep behind enemy lines in the scenarios of the 2nd world war. The purpose of the missions is very varied, ranging from reuniting with the partisans, taking strongholds, sabotage or freeing prisoners. All of this has as a common denominator not the indiscriminate gutting of enemy soldiers, German in this case, but that of a good stealth game, of making as little noise as possible, or at least shooting, falling back and hiding, in short, striking in the shadows. This is the concept that underlies the title, and H&D realizes it quite well, even if some good flaws undermine the overall success of the title. Graphically, nothing has changed since the first version. The 3D engine is certainly not the best, it can be said that it is functional, but nothing more. No lavish graphics like those seen in recent games like Vtennis or Ecco: the soldier models appear well drawn and well coated, but are extremely wooden and poor in animations. It is very striking to aim through the sniper rifle, to lurk in the dark waiting for the sound of footsteps, and when you start seeing a black silhouette shoot mercilessly between the eyes, in the only instant in which it is still. Truly rewarding and exhilarating. Buildings and vehicles are well defined, even if they complain about a low number of available polygons. The bugs that heavily afflicted the PC version have been partially removed: the collision between polygons is certainly not very precise, and sometimes our alter egos will crouch and lie down while remaining sensationally in mid-air. The audio part, on the other hand, is exceptional: the military musical themes are impeccable, each weapon has its own sound and the ambient noises, including shouted orders, are truly immersive and reproduced with extreme fidelity. In the first mission we are on the banks of the Po at night, it's raining and there is fog, the river rushes by, the Germans shout and rant in their positions: it seems to really live in a war film, other than dolby digital and soldier Ryan !", "date": "2000-10-04", "grade": null}
