How upset we were when, as soon as we received the new console, we rushed to the store to download the game Rare, except to discover that backwards compatibility didn't send it beyond a handful of frames per second, effectively making it unplayable. But with the latest update, everything is as it should have been from day one: ultra quality settings and extreme fluidity, for a gaming experience now comparable in fact to that offered by the best PCs out there. A growing success For Sea of Thieves, the arrival of the new Microsoft consoles and the consequent increase in Game Pass subscribers is equivalent to an inevitable injection of new players, to which must be added those who decide to buy it on Steam every week and all those who appreciate the originals mechanics since the days of Xbox One. A success that instead of decreasing, as usually happens to games with several years behind them, is increasing exponentially, together with the contents offered with perfect cadence by the prestigious English development team. Thanks to this new incarnation for next-gen consoles capable of making it more beautiful than ever, the time has come not only to go back to talking about it also on the Multiplayer pages, but above all to review its rating still stuck at the unflattering 7.6 initially attributed to it. Not that it was wrong, we're ready to counter that verdict, but today Sea of Thieves is a totally different beast, while remaining extremely faithful to the original vision PVE & PVP It's not a game for everyone (but which one really is?) but with Sea of Thieves Rare has managed to get one of the most original and courageous multiplayer titles of recent years out of its workshops, where the sea water is saltier of the salt itself thanks to the bitter tears of the players. Here, contrary to what happens in other online experiences, PVE and PVP come together in a unique experience, able to go from the relaxation guaranteed by the Caribbean nothingness to a hell of tropical storms, fireballs shooting in the air and blasphemies in all the languages of the world. There are many outstanding results achieved by this game, but perhaps the most important remains that of having fully understood and embraced the nature of the purest game as a service. Rare understood earlier than other software houses that no content, however complex, can survive in the presence of bulimia players. To solve this age-old problem capable of tripping up many software houses, the novelties introduced cyclically in Sea of Thieves are mostly composed of new gameplay elements, instead of shreds of adventures destined to always end too soon, to leave room again for the waiting for more content. Maximum interaction In the three years that separate us from its debut, which took place in April 2017, enormous amounts of content have been added to Sea of Thieves, and among these it is also possible to find nine adventures that in fact constitute the story mode that many have dreamed of ever since. from the beginning. Adventures that also don't treat you like a fool, but put puzzles of a certain level on the plate, really challenging fights and platform segments that require a certain amount of commitment and precision. Each story must be completed in a context where the other players can always intervene, to put a spoke in our wheels or to help us, to steal all our possessions or for an alliance as precious as it is shaky and dangerous. Sea of Thieves is also a rarity for the simple fact of allowing us to interact with others using a tool of rare power and effectiveness: our own voice. Thanks to the proximity voice chat, which the shyest ones can disable, it is possible to negotiate peace with the French by shouting into the megaphone in the waves of the stormy sea, coordinate with novice Spaniards in order to hit a particularly aggressive crew hard, help each other to solve an enigma that will allow us to escape from a room that is slowly filling up with water... and these are just three examples of the thousand possible situations that can dynamically arise in this game. Because every Sea of Thieves session is different from the previous one, and every time you go out to sea you don't know what will happen, or who you will meet. You and your friends could end up together on a server populated only by aggressive pirates one night, and the next you might build new friendships by spending hours playing music, drinking grog and consequently vomiting grog inside a tavern. A game, uno pub Another courageous aspect to implement, and which has proved to be absolutely successful over time, is the totally horizontal progression of the game. Sea of Thieves is in fact one of the very few online experiences in history where the strongest are the skilled and cunning, not those who have more free time available, and can afford to farm days and months in order to get their hands on equipment that normal people could not even imagine. In Sea of Thieves, there are ships and weapons that are more beautiful, rarer, never more powerful than others. However, not even the most experienced players can delude themselves that they have everything under control because here things can go wrong in an instant: lightning could start a devastating fire on the ship, another pirate could hide in the hold to communicate your movements to his companions , a huge kraken could suddenly emerge from the waves to envelop you in its tentacles, a ghost galleon could emerge from the thickest mists to attack you with cursed cannon fire. Or everything can go well, guaranteeing you and your friends an hour or more of pure relaxation, to fish on the placid shores of a silent islet, where you can tell stories and play songs with the various musical instruments available, or to chase finally in peace some treasure particularly difficult to find. There's no doubt that Sea of Thives is a game made by an English team: whatever happens, it's always a bit like hanging out in the company of friends among the tables of a pub, where there's light-heartedness, sometimes a few fights, but everyone is always ready to raise their glasses to the sky for another toast. And this atmosphere, you will understand, can only create one of the closest communities around. Always more beautiful On Xbox Series X, Sea of Thieves raises the bar even further, finally reaching absolute parity with the PC version. In the Xbox One X version the details already responded almost to their maximum, with 4K resolution in addition, but everything remained anchored on the classic and sometimes insufficient 30 fps; on the new console we find better lighting effects, a much less visible update of the polygons and above all the wonderful 60fps which only rarely present some very brief hiccups. Even on Xbox One S the game reaches the same speed, but limited to 1080p. Thus enhanced, Sea of Thieves can be said to be graphically absolutely up to what one would expect from the new generation consoles, standing out more and more forcefully as one of the most valuable and characterizing exclusives of all those offered by the Microsoft ecosystem. Having it available on Game Pass then reduces the excuses to zero: call your friends and download it all together. It may not be the game that suits you best, but it could also turn out to be the game you've been waiting for a lifetime.", "date": "2020-11-05", "grade": "9.0"}
