And the enemies thrown against Luffy and his crew are really funny for the paroxysmal levels reached by their number; the screen is literally crammed with soldiers and total chaos dominates. Needless to add, however, that forces of devastating power are opposed to this wonderful group of opponents: in the front row the iconic protagonist of the Eiichiro Oda series, but not only. The roster of characters exceeds sixty units, over forty of these are controllable by the player, to be unlocked in the main campaign and also usable in other modes. Each fighter has his own unique style and represents a joy for manga lovers, a festival where no one is really missing, from Rob Lucci to Smoker, from Zoro to Nami, passing by Usopp, Sanji and Tashigi. In addition to this, the Omega Force product is based on a new system called Kizuna Rush. Basically, after filling a special bar, you have the opportunity to unleash a technique in combination with other characters, capable of causing a truly sensational amount of damage. As if that weren't enough, the union of forces can generate a terrible special blow capable of largely breaking through the thousand kill count. Each character under direct control has a personal special strike, which he can use again by filling a gauge. In short, you can't really say that adrenaline doesn't flow freely! If you love chaos, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 is a daydream The birth of the Straw Hat One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 is the first chapter of the franchise to also come out on PlayStation 4, the version in question, an occasion that has stimulated Omega Force to give an almost encyclopedic character to its production. In this perspective, not only the high number of controllable characters is explained, but also that the main mode is practically linked to the beginning of the manga, or when Luffy receives the mythological straw hat from Shanks the Red. The first mission sees our rubber hero engaged in freeing Zoro from the clutches of the Navy and Captain Morgan, in effect the creation of the Straw Hat pirate crew. From here on we experience the most significant episodes of the manga up to the Dressrosa saga, told not only by the events involved, but above all by a curious mix of cut scenes and illustrations that often interrupt the action. Despite the good intentions of making the narration understandable even to those who are not accustomed to Oda's work, it remains difficult for new followers to understand the events and relationships, also due to the great chorus that characterizes it. It is always a production with a high fan service rate, designed especially for enthusiasts. From this point of view it is difficult to be disappointed, especially reliving crucial scenes such as the clash between Roronoa Zoro and Mihawk, just to name one. The presence of audio in Japanese and subtitles in Italian helps to immerse yourself even more in the universe of the game. The levels always follow the well-established musou structure: large-scale clashes structured in missions, which require a pinch of strategy. The characters move in a dynamic map/maze with variable objectives, but which always culminates in a spectacular final showdown with the boss on duty. In any case, these can also appear during some missions, so it is necessary to carefully follow the instructions on the screen to understand the current objective and understand exactly where to go, not to mention that some timed sessions can lead to instant game over. To fight, Luffy and his friends rely on a series of combos that can be activated through specific key combinations, as in the best tradition of fighting games. The characters in the saga move between opposing factions, so it may happen that some tasks require you to free an opposing territory, a prisoner, carry out supplies or defend your allies from some assault. This feature gives a certain variety and makes the clashes even more spectacular, but unfortunately also extremely chaotic. It is clear that we are not dealing with particularly technical action mechanics, also because the artificial intelligence fluctuates between non-existent and mediocre, while the boss fights actually represent a separate matter, requiring a more reasoned approach. Playstation 4 trophies One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 features two Gold Trophies, ofone silver, twenty-three bronze, and three hidden. To earn your first ten Trophies you won't have to work too hard, just play the main mode for a few hours to make them yours. Others, however, are more challenging, such as those that require an S-type completion rank, obtainable only at higher difficulty levels. In the case of the gold ones, instead, be prepared to sweat profusely, as they require the collection of each object and 100% completion in legendary mode. I'll give you the musou One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 also has some slight role-playing elements, such as a system of coins, awarded at the end of a level, functional to increase the characters' abilities. Similarly, advancing in the adventure you earn an internal currency, the Berry, which allows you to win various items to unlock in the gallery, but also to help the progression of the skill level. By advancing in the various chapters, the player has the possibility to choose from a predefined set of characters, while in a special fantasy mode, called Diary of Dreams, the choice becomes much wider. In this case, your protagonist - freely chosen by the crews - must conquer a set of islands, facing increasingly stronger opponents who, once defeated, join the group of playable characters. Also present is the ability to replay any chapter at will once completed. The main mode offers around 15 hours of gameplay across the various chapters. Technically, the title takes advantage of a functional cel shading realization consistent with the style of the manga, which makes you turn a blind eye to the not very detailed scenarios. On the other hand, the frame rate at sixty frames per second leaves us pleasantly surprised, which suffers some drops in moments when the screen is invaded by enemies, but never enough to distract attention too much. On the other hand, we have already anticipated that the chaos set up on video is often overwhelming, so much so that it is even difficult to locate the key characters. The structure is, as mentioned, that of the classic musou, without particular upheavals, but it is in line with Oda's work and it is undoubtedly fun to massacre enemy soldiers by discovering the various techniques of our heroes, despite an inevitable underlying monotony. The sound accompaniment is absolutely stupendous, with a sparkling jazz-funk soundtrack that is absolutely adequate and which gives the right energy. Some pieces really wowed us. Among the less successful sides, however, we must include the relative lack of introduction for the commands, useful for helping newbies get used to the mechanics, and some sporadic uncertainty in the assignment of mission objectives which can lead to frustrating game over, especially considering that the missions are on average long and must be restarted from the beginning in case of defeat.", "date": "2015-08-31", "grade": "8.0"}
