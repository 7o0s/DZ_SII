On that occasion we hadn't particularly focused on what were neat but still marginal mini-games; now, however, we can dedicate a little more space to them since Nintendo has well thought of offering them in a stand-alone version on its eShop. Will he have enriched them enough? Kirby Fighters Deluxe is a nice brawler, but not particularly rich in content The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect retains the quality of Kirby: Triple Deluxe, but is a little less impactful as it doesn't frame the gameplay as it did in the original title. Kirby or Alive Today we will deal with Kirby Fighters Deluxe, the minigame that certainly arouses the most attention since it has Kirby himself as the protagonist... although perhaps we should use the plural, since in this kind of Super Smash Bros. clone we can control multiple variations del Batuffolo Rosa, each with particular abilities. They are, of course, the various forms Kirby could assume in Kirby: Triple Deluxe after inhaling and swallowing certain enemies, temporarily learning their powers. Unfortunately, just like in the original minigame, Kirby Fighters Deluxe does not bring back all the ~costumes~, but only a handful of them, to which the Bell and Beetle costumes are added if you also own Kirby: Triple Deluxe. Each costume is sufficiently different from the others in terms of special skills and attacks, and if in Kirby: Triple Deluxe the adventure could be tackled using just a handful, in a fighting game like this the variety of offensive and defensive techniques is certainly an added value not indifferent which makes the clashes more dynamic and less predictable. Too bad, therefore, that Nintendo has not taken advantage of it to implement a greater number of costumes than in the original edition of the minigame, considering that some of them would have lent themselves very well to the gameplay of a fighting game. It must be said, however, that Kirby Fighters Deluxe is more similar to Smash Bros. than to a traditional fighting game: along the lines of the Nintendo brawler, in fact, it is possible to face up to three opponents, individually or in teams, and obviously wins the last one standing. However, there is a small twist that pleasantly surprised us: if one of the opponents is defeated, he is not completely excluded from the match and will reappear as a kind of ghost who can attack the remaining fighters in the lead. If he manages to hit them, he will come back to life and can resume the fight. In this sense, in short, even the defeated can continue to participate without feeling excluded. The sparkling dynamics of the clashes is supported by an excellent and reactive control system that offers many opportunities for attack and defense, to be that of a minigame borrowed from a platformer. Kirby can parry, dodge and jump, and the design of the various stages lends itself particularly well to this gameplay that is the result of a fighting game and a platformer, also because Kirby Fighters Deluxe uses the same excellent and colorful graphics engine of Kirby: Triple Deluxe, together with a well-implemented and never annoying stereoscopy, but also not very significant. Unfortunately, the nature of a mini-game transformed into a stand-alone is felt as soon as the single player mode is completed, consisting simply of a sequence of very normal battles interspersed with a couple of simple bosses. The single player mode serves more than anything to unlock alternative costumes for the various fighters and little else: it is clear that the juice of the game lies in the multiplayer sector, which in fact does not disappoint thanks also to the Download Play, but which would certainly have benefited from a online mode. In fact, as it stands, Kirby Fighters Deluxe lends itself to quick games of local wireless harp, and the chances of playing it like this, frankly, are quite rare.", "date": "2015-02-20", "grade": "7.0"}
