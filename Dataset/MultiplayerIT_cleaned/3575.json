{"name": "Horace", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/horace-recensione.html", "text": "The list of titles that pay homage to the era of 8 and 16-bit video games is already particularly rich, but those who adore the category always experience the prospect of trying out some new adventure with a nostalgic flavor with a certain enthusiasm. Even more so if we are talking about a historically popular genre such as that of platformers. This is precisely the case of Horace, an interesting 2D adventure created by the developers Paul Helman and Sean Scaplehorn with the support of the publisher 505 Games. At the end of a seven-year gestation, the game has finally landed on Steam and after being able to try it thoroughly we can immediately tell you that we were positively impressed. You just have to continue reading our review to discover all the qualities of this little indie gem. Horace, sentient robot with a mission (or rather two) While drawing from a vast tradition, Horace manages to offer his own personal reading of the platform genre, curiously also trying to follow the paths of narration. A feature hardly taken into consideration by the other exponents of the category, but which in this specific case represents a peculiarity of the work. In fact, in the game you take on the role of a small sentient robot, assembled and initially placed at the service of a wealthy British family. The little android does its best to comply with all the requests of the ~Old Man~, or rather of the man who has strongly wanted him with him. It is precisely the latter that provides him with the basics on how to move and what functions to perform. While living peacefully with his owners, Horace also receives the task of collecting at least one million waste; an objective that will remain well etched in his virtual memory, although the course of events leads him to deal mainly with other matters. The tranquility of home life plummets when a sudden tragedy strikes the family that has hosted him for over a year. Following the unexpected events, the little robot deactivates and when he wakes up, nothing seems to be as he remembered it. Years have now passed, the villa of his loving master is in ruins and what's more, no one seems to have survived or been around to explain to him what happened. Yet the protagonist does not lose heart, deciding to travel, reconstruct the events and start again, while the specter of a great war between robots and humans stands out in the background, which has literally ruined the country. Precisely in the light of the narrative incipit, the early stages of the game act as an extensive tutorial during which the player can deepen some details of the main characters of the story. Only after the completion of the first two acts does the game begin to come alive and test the player's patience and reflexes. Horace therefore starts rather quietly, proposing very linear levels and offering a very limited pace of play at first sight. It is precisely the limitations of the gameplay that initially leave you a little lost: considering the genre to which it belongs and the origin of the work, one would immediately expect a completely different level of challenge. Continuing the game, however, the eyes are opened on the real essence of the game. Yes, because in reality Horace turns out to be a platformer, full of many goodies capable of appealing to the long-standing public. The desire to pay homage to the past is also expressed through some simple mini-games that alternate with the more traditional sequences. From Pong to Track and Field, even passing through Guitar Hero, the surprises that Horace has in store for his players are not lacking at all. However, these references constitute only a small part of the quotations and ideas created by the authors. In fact, on a narrative level, the work clearly draws inspiration from the film Oltre il Giardino (1980) by Peter Sellers, while also offering a pleasant vein of humor combined with an emotional component that takes its cue from video games such as Mother and Earthbound. Careful gameplay and quality level design The work of Helman and Scaplehorn proves to be able to mix pixel art graphics with the solidity of the gameplay with particular sagacity, while also guaranteeing a level design which, in spite of the somewhat interlocutory early stages of the game, proves to be perfectly up to par of the task. Little Horace's journey is marked by a multitude of levels that coherently accompany the plot. To tell us how things went is the protagonist himself: through his uncertain metallic voice (supported by Italian subtitles) he makes us partakers of his memories, but also of the feelingsiments experienced during the arduous journey in which he undertook. A path destined to become increasingly complex to manage, not only due to the presence of progressively more intricate situations, but also due to the introduction of some objects which contribute to making the robot progressively stronger. Initially you only have the jump button and the run button available, but as the events start to get more interesting you have to start and manage a series of functional upgrades to improve the depth and variety of the interaction. The first object you receive are special anti-gravity shoes which, once worn, allow you to walk at will on walls and ceilings, albeit with some small motion sickness problems that you have to deal with when the screen rotates repeatedly by changing the perspective. By activating the Atlas gloves, it becomes possible to collect objects or throw them in the direction of the enemies to facilitate the advance. From a certain moment on, a protective shield will also be available, useful for protecting the player from possible errors and for allowing him to successfully reach the conclusion of the portion of the level that he is going through. Each stage is in fact composed of various sections that require you to head from an entry point to an exit point, sometimes even returning back to areas already covered previously. Along the way it is necessary not to make mistakes, accessing the next section after passing through one of the numerous doors that one comes across along the way. The level of challenge offered by the game proved to be well balanced, thanks to a constant progression that encourages the player to stay in the game.", "date": "2019-07-29", "grade": "8.5"}
