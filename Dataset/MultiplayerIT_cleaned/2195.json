{"name": "ICO", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ico-5.html", "text": "Ode to the video game <br> The characters There are two characters that you have to lead during the games of ICO: the cursed boy that I have already spoken about and a mysterious princess that you will meet almost immediately during your exploration. The princess is imprisoned in a cage, and you will free her to discover that you are facing an enigmatic and fascinating creature who speaks an unknown language. The princess belongs to a different lineage than yours, and she is not allowed to follow you in your escape. Spirits from another dimension will try to take her back with them and you will have to try to prevent it. It is not evident for a certain period of the game whether these spirits are evil or whether they are known to the princess and want to bring her back to where she came from. Surely however the girl has chosen her own destiny differently and follows you in your escape. The player cannot personally lead this character, but must call him to himself using special commands which I will talk about later. The princess then actively participates in the exploration of the locations by looking for exits on her own and often showing you where to go when you are wandering at random. This creates a fascinating dichotomy: rarely has a computer-driven character appeared so independent and so influential on your actions at the same time. Somehow this pair of virtual adventurers makes me think of the tragic and romantic story of Romeo and Juliet. Control The control system can be simplified and original at the same time. Basically it is a question of guiding the main character with the left stick or the cross in the direction in which you want to move, essentially in a platform style, rather than in pure Resident Evil style (forward to proceed, to the sides to rotate) now standardized in adventures. The dualshock back buttons allow you to perform actions (for example, open doors) and use the weapon in your possession. The R1 key is used to recall the princess, and as soon as you use it, the camera will move to frame the place where she is, near or far. This can even be evocative in some cases, it is as if you yourself were on the spot observing the expanse of the landscape. If the princess is next to you, the same button allows you to take her by the hand and accompany her, or rather drag her when she is reluctant or frightened. This union of the hands of the two characters is in my opinion one of the highest moments of ICO, and one of the most original, because it really manages to convey a sense of tenderness and emotion to which we gamers are not used to. The sense of protection that inspires this scene is immensely romantic, congratulations to the programmers. A last note on the right stick, which instead of the character allows you to pilot the camera shot. Unfortunately it doesn't seem successful to me due to the inertia of the camera and the automatic re-centering that needs to be tamed with a little practice. It is also impossible to observe in every direction, because the angle of rotation is limited by the presumed view of the player from the position in which he is, as if he were moving his head without moving his body if I can make myself understood. Nothing unbearable anyway, I just don't understand this unprecedented and perhaps bizarre choice. In part I tried to justify it with the idea that the shots were forced to focus on the most beautiful and panoramic views, which was also confirmed in some interviews by the development team, but I remain perplexed. The puzzles The player must find the way out of the various areas of the castle which he manages to get to each time. Basically it is a question of opening doors or freeing the access routes from ruins or other obstacles that have closed them. To do this, you need to place objects in the right place to be able to operate special gears such as winches or gates or drawbridges. Your path is complicated by the need to lead the girl to safety, who is often unable to follow your movements or more simply is scared and therefore will not repeat your jumps or climb where you ventured. It is then necessary to find an alternative access and help her to reach it. The last problem is represented by the shadow spirits, who will take advantage of your every departure to try to capture the girl, or will attack you directly in a group in some cases. If the girl is kidnapped you will be petrified and the game will end. The sensations ICO manages to convey tenderness through faces and movements dand the two protagonists, a sense of vertigo when you find yourself balancing on the highest walls that rise above the sea, anxiety when you flee from spirits and much more. In reality it is not fair to speak of isolated sensations, but I feel like saying that if you know how to get in tune with ICO and its history, you will connect directly with the soul of the virtual protagonist (if he has one, which I have the passion to hypothesize) that you are driving, you will feel that you are him, you will be one. The graphics: comic book inspiration First of all, a round of applause to Sony for the 50/60 Hz option that introduces you to the first loading of the game (and which will then be stored on the memory card so as not to disturb you again). This technical sophistication allows televisions set up for the NTSC signal (by now the majority of economic models as well) to take advantage of a better refresh and therefore better fluidity. Fortunately, this is an increasingly popular option, but it is still the exception, and it is important that the parent company takes a stand on it. At the end of this digression, I'll go on to praise the graphics of the game. The characters are well done and dressed in intricate and richly embroidered garments. The faces are splendid, perhaps I have not yet seen more beautiful and expressive ones, and you can admire them better by zooming the scene with a special key (probably introduced for this precise purpose, having no valid operational utility). The rooms are huge and covered with excellent textures. The impression I got was that of being in front of certain views of Myst, for those who remember them, with the difference that here we are dealing with a real 3D environment! That is to say that everything you see is not CG but true 3D that can be freely explored. To understand the difference, compare it to Onimusha, which benefits from the better-crafted environments seen on PS2 today; well the splendid and complex scenes of the Capcom masterpiece are however pre-rendered locations, where objects cannot be moved and one cannot cling to them etc. I must confess that I was even enthusiastic at some point, for example in front of the small lake in front of the windmill, capable of spectacular refractions of the images reflected by the moving wheels of the mill while you ripple the water and observe everything by moving the camera at will ! Animation: inside the incipient movement Every environment in ICO is crossed by life, even if it is not immediately evident. Approach a window in a closed environment and observe the rays of light: you will discover the movement of the dust that travels through them. Look at the sea from the castle walls and you will notice the waves breaking. Walk through the garden and you will see birds and leaves making trajectories in the sky. These and others are the hints of class that are encountered in the game almost everywhere. Even the main characters are enriched by attitudes and reflexes that distinguish them even when you don't move them. The princess is particularly graceful, whose gait, whose face and arms seem to be those of a spirit suspended in the air. The boy, on the other hand, is funny and energetic: try to notice how he walks when he has to carry weights. Sound: widespread and indifferent environments Why indifferent? Because the whole landscape in which you move seems to have a life of its own, and if you stop and listen you will distinguish the blowing of the wind, the chirping of birds, the sound of the sea. All sounds of nature, which follows its careless course and which do not change according to your destiny. The music, which appears to underline some moments of pathos, is generally few and unobtrusive. The voices of the characters have not been dubbed as they speak an unknown language; instead we find the subtitles in Italian, very welcome. The gameplay: something new? ICO cannot be considered a revolution in the gaming scene in terms of user interface and game mechanics. It is a dynamic adventure and as such it follows its functional canons with the express intention of being immediate and easy to master. The game is aimed at as wide a range of users as possible and does not intend to engage the player with innovative and complex interfaces, on the contrary you will not find anything on the screen that leads back to energy bars or indicators of any kind. It is precisely this immediacy and linearity that forces the player to focus on actions and exploration. This approach earned ICO a nomination at the San Jose Artistic Innovation Awards, and I believe this comments better than any of my words. Longevity: Will you replay it? Completed the adventureyou will have the opportunity to replay it using a more powerful weapon than before. With this stratagem introduced for the PAL version, SCEI has tried to prolong the life of the game, a choice perhaps taken for granted perhaps not so effective. However, the important thing is not once so much the length of the adventure, which will keep you busy for a certain time, as much as the intensity of the experience itself, which represents something new. A few defects I certainly didn't like the framing system of the camera: it is very annoying having to fight with the knobs to keep the framing stable as it tries to center itself without you wanting it. The loading system takes up the Capcom style, so you will have to find locations where you can save rather than being able to do it at any time. This choice, unwelcome and a little anachronistic in my opinion, risks giving the wrong impression, because it often makes the user believe that they want to mask a limited longevity of the game by forcing you to repeat the exploration sections. Conclusion Buy it, otherwise you are not real hard core gamers. Buy it even if you don't know anything about video games: it's the best way to start. 17 Ode to the video game <br> Introducing ICO: The story A mysterious people has been condemned for generations to a macabre and cruel rite: some members are born with a congenital malformation that forces them to live with animal horns. These unfortunates, once they reach fifteen years of age (at least this is what I feel like giving to the characters) are imprisoned and taken to an ancient castle that stands in the forest. Here they will meet a tragic fate: for the good of the community they must disappear forever and are therefore locked up in a casing and abandoned. The ICO introduction scene that narrates these events, as well as being well done in CG, is intense and almost painful, capable of preserving the mystery (nothing is known about the origins of this people and the reasons for this curse) and conveying the sense of resignation of the executors of the rite, who appear to be submissive to a higher will in spite of themselves. When the executors leave, an unexpected event begins your adventure: a shock shakes the castle and the casing in which you have been imprisoned falls and shatters, freeing you. The player is called to take the place of the boy doomed by bad luck. Now it's up to you to search your way back and find out what is hidden in the seemingly abandoned fortress.", "date": "2002-03-14", "grade": null}
