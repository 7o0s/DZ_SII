{"name": "Che buffo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/75560-alice-in-wonderland-che-buffo-che-buffissimo.html", "text": "There were so many ways to bring Alice in Wonderland to Nintendo DS, and apparently Etranges Libellules picked the best one. Not a reduced version of what was done (however well) for Wii and PC, but a completely different product, characterized by truly spot-on artistic choices as well as excellent use of the touch screen. The similarities with the tie-in that we reviewed a few days ago are basically limited to the role of the supporting characters (the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat), who in the game play the protagonist role in defense of Alice, and to their peculiar abilities: the power to control time and the force of gravity, to overturn the scenario and to make part of it disappear or appear. The adventure continues in crescendo, the characters available to us increase and it is possible to switch from one to another simply by tapping on the screen. It's the puzzles that require it: to solve them you have to use sometimes one skill, sometimes another, sometimes a combination of both. If we have to cross a bridge which, however, is reduced to rubble, the White Rabbit can make it go back to how it was some time ago, that is, perfectly intact. Likewise, a hidden door can be made visible by the Cheshire Cat and lead us to our destination. We can view the map of the Underworld at any time, check the areas we need to visit and possibly draw signs at the points where we should return later, once we have acquired new powers. Think of six impossible things The control system of Alice in Wonderland for Nintendo DS is based exclusively on the touch screen, offering solutions very similar to those seen in Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. The character moves following our directions, moving in the direction we touch with the stylus, and automatically jumps when necessary. The fact of having to escort Alice in her mission to rebuild the ~World of Wonders~ and kill the Ciciarampa also means helping her when she can't overcome an obstacle (via a simple tap), but above all defending her from the Knave of Hearts troops send to catch her. The fights are anything but complex, just repeatedly tap the enemies with the stylus for deadly combinations of shots. These dynamics are enriched by the presence of more difficult than average opponents, as well as by skills that allow us to effectively stand up to them. The White Rabbit, for example, can freeze soldiers for a few moments thanks to his time control power. The gameplay therefore alternates puzzles and action, gradually increasing the difficulty of both but without guaranteeing an extraordinary duration: in the end, the game is rather linear and it will only take us a few hours to complete it. One of the strengths of this particular tie-in is undoubtedly the visual component: Alice and her unlikely friends boast a childish, stylized, really pleasant and particular design, supported by high quality animations. Also in this case the references to Zelda are clear, which seems to have inspired the work of Etranges Libellules even from an audio point of view, with ~monosyllable~ voices and jingles as simple as they are inspired.", "date": "2010-03-17", "grade": "7.6"}
