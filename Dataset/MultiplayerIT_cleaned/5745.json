The show on the track has always been the flagship of the queen category of motorsport. However, enthusiasts are not satisfied with following the race weekends and are dying to find out more about life inside the paddock. In fact, Formula 1 is not such an immediate sport, but it is a set of regulations, technical developments, driver preparation, strategies, driving styles, tire management, political influences, historical rivalries and so on and so forth. . The deeper you get into this world, the more you get to appreciate the running of a world championship and the action on the track. Nowadays it is incredibly easy to expand the media coverage of a particular sport. News, social networks, videos, insights, interviews are now the order of the day in the Formula 1 circus. Being able to enjoy all these communication channels, Formula 1 has managed to renew and modernize itself, thus once again attracting the attention of some longtime fans and new young enthusiasts who are discovering the world of Formula 1 at 360 degrees. And global ratings, despite the fact that we are experiencing an undisputed dominance of Red Bull in the 2023 championship, have returned to skyrocket, demonstrating that with the right communication, this sport can be truly fascinating. This small introduction is absolutely necessary to define the context in which the developers of Codemasters had to make F1 23. The new chapter of their very long series of official video games dedicated to the world of Formula 1 will debut on June 16, 2023 on all modern gaming platforms . Just like in its real counterpart, even the videogame Formula 1 has had to renew and modernize itself. In this sense, a mode with a strong emphasis on narrative was introduced, called Braking Point, which returns for its second season. In addition to it we will find new activities to carry out in the paddock, a series of challenges and events in the F1 World mode, the possibility of driving luxurious supercars and many accessibility options for novice players. F1 23 therefore continues to follow the arduous path defined for some years already, in which it aims to achieve an optimal balance between sport and entertainment, between simulation and arcade driving, between challenge and fun. Making a game ~for everyone~ requires a lot of effort and the ability to organize the various elements well with the right options and balance so as not to disappoint anyone. Will the Codemasters guys have managed to further innovate their flagship series, bringing us back into the Formula 1 circus? Find out in our F1 23 review! braking point A still from the Braking Point cutscenes of F1 23, made in computer graphics The events narrated in the first season of Braking Point, which debuted in F1 2021, continue in this new title of the Codemasters series. The career of pilots Aiden Jackson, Devon Butler and Casper Ackermann will therefore continue with numerous twists, plot twists and the introduction of new well-characterized figures. As we have already been able to discover from the first trailers, there is also a female character, a real driving talent, capable of attracting the attention of the Formula 1 teams. We have already told you what Braking Point is and how it was born, when we tried the first chapters of this narrative mode. Now that we have completed the entire section we can give a more complete judgment on the work done by the developers. Let's start immediately by saying that the story has captured our interest for several original ideas, while remaining within the limits of a plot belonging to a sport such as Formula 1. Initially we will relive the events that happened in F1 2021, so that everyone can enjoy this second season of Braking Point despite not having played the previous chapters. Later we will discover the history of the various characters, each with their own background, goals to achieve, talent to demonstrate and weaknesses to hide. The beauty of this second season of Braking Point is the fact of being able to continue with the main plot by playing the role of different protagonists. In this way we will have the opportunity to better understand their choices and their actions, allowing us to sympathize not only with the old protagonist, but also with the other riders and the figures who surround him in the paddock. In Braking Point 2 we will take on the role of different characters with different roles within the stable The facts narrated follow one another at a good pace through two seasonsni of Formula 1 and Formula 2, where we will mainly race for the fictitious team Konnersport Racing Team. The events have fascinated us to the point of having completed this modality in one go, so as to discover the fate of the protagonists, strongly linked to the success of their team and the main sponsor, with a little ~family drama~ to emphasize the All. We finished the story in about 8 hours, which seemed really enough to not unnecessarily water down the plot and make the present challenges too repetitive. The conclusion was not exactly exceptional, since it left the doors open for a future chapter, but the journey was definitely appreciated. This is Callie, one of the protagonists of the second season of Braking Point in F1 23 We don't want to go further into the narrative of Braking Point so as not to spoil the story for you. Given its limited duration, comparable to a season of the Netflix Drive to Survive TV series from which it is inspired, we advise you to experience it firsthand, especially if you love this kind of content with greater emphasis on the events in the paddock and the characters who populate it . In addition to the interlude scenes, created with great care in computer graphics and enriched with the voice of Italian commentators such as Carlo Vanzini and Davide Valsecchi, there is clearly the part linked to the gameplay. The challenges on the track, even if they are slightly repetitive, immediately threw us into the heart of the action to complete one or more objectives set by the team. Tackling different race situations, without the need to prepare a single weekend in detail is certainly a lot of fun and easily accessible. Unfortunately, the only three difficulties present fail to offer an adequate balance for the different levels of driving skill. For example, we found the Hard mode quite satisfying. However, those who are unable to run at this level, but are slightly lower, will have to lower the difficulty, probably finding themselves in a situation where they will dominate over their opponents due to the large gap between the two settings. Another fragment of Braking Point from F1 23 The Braking Point mode has been seasoned with sections of interlude gameplay and special menus that are spaced between one chapter and the next. These parts did not convince us at all, resulting in simple fillers that have little or no effect on the continuation of the plot and do not provide particularly interesting additional information. In general, the unfolding of the story is not influenced by the outcome of our actions, whether they are responses to the press or the results on the track. As a result we may find ourselves having dominated a Grand Prix, but in interviews or after-race footage this could be completely ignored. F1 World This is the menu of activities to do in F1 World The second surprise of F1 23 was the introduction of a central hub called F1 World. This is not a game mode itself, but more of a cauldron of activities to be carried out within the video game. At the beginning we will be asked to create our virtual alter ego complete with a personalized single-seater and an apartment furnished as desired. The car can be used to race in a series of events, timed challenges, particular race situations and other occasions around the most coveted destinations on the Formula 1 calendar. At each event we will earn various resources and unlock upgrades for our single seater. In this way we will increase our technical level, to be able to compete in increasingly difficult events, which require a performing car to be able to be completed. Among the upgrades for the car we also find the possibility of hiring managers, engineers, strategists or other members of the team. Thanks to them we will be able to unlock particular skills and bonuses, such as a reduction in fuel consumption for a limited period of time, or a temporary enhancement of the DRS. It is therefore a much more playful and varied mode than the rest of the package, far from the simulation of a grand prix, even if the action on the track is always at the center. F1 World is particularly well suited to those who do not have much time on their hands, but still want to play and enjoy some high-speed adrenaline on the Formula 1 tracks. The various challenges can be tackled both solo and in online multiplayer for create more competition with the involvement of other real racers. For every kilometer traveled on the track, your driving style will be constantly evaluated by the video game, taking into account any infringements, risky moves and dangerous manoeuvres.A clean conduct will allow you to gradually unlock new driving licenses, which will give you access to increasingly competitive events reserved for truly high-level drivers. These are the customization elements of our car in F1 World In addition to the elements just mentioned, Codemasters has also added the classic Quick Race and Time Trial modes to F1 World. The goal therefore seems to be to group everything in a single hub, so as to reward the gamer for every meter traveled on the track. There are also events related to Formula 1, therefore with the official single-seaters to be played exclusively in solitary. These have the aim of making us discover the various tracks around the world, catapulting us into particular racing situations that can happen in competitions of this sport. The classic multiplayer mode present in the previous chapters of the F1 series has also been integrated into all of this. Therefore, the classic ranked matches return, this time with an interesting novelty, inspired by EA Sport FIFA. We're talking about divisions, a new ranking system for ranked matches that will allow us to climb various ranks. Once we reach the top, we will be promoted to a new division, which will put us in contact with even better drivers, while allowing us to earn more experience points. There are already dozens of events in F1 World, more will be added with new updates in the future F1 World therefore has a very broad and articulated skeleton, which lays a rather solid foundation for offering an experience that is always fresh and capable of keeping interaction with gamers high. We couldn't fully test its complexity due to the lack of other players online before the game's release. In addition, the question of how often developers will insert new content in the future still remains open. In our interview, Codemasters revealed to us that they plan to bring new daily, weekly, and seasonal challenges. Furthermore, the possibility of bringing new content will allow you to stay in tune with the real Formula 1, gradually bringing new things to keep up with the real sport. For example, if it rains at the next race in Canada, the developers could include a rain challenge at this circuit. Guide model Cockpit view puts you in the shoes of a real Formula 1 driver, especially when using the VR headset This year more than ever the developers at Codemasters have been working closely with the drivers to get feedback on the driving model present in the game. One of the most criticized aspects in recent years has been the behavior of the single-seater in traction. Developers at Codemasters told us that British driver Anthony Davidson played F1 22 with the traction control set to 'Medium'. According to him, in fact, the behavior of the single-seater with this active help was more realistic. Based on this feedback, the steering system has been completely overhauled, creating a feeling of increased downforce in every racing situation, corner and weather condition. Having a more stable rear often results in understeer when approaching the corner. It was therefore not easy to find the right balance. Especially during acceleration, when we unload all the thousand horsepower on the rear axle, oversteer is now much more manageable and can be controlled with appropriate countersteering corrections. The driving model also needed to be revised as regards the single-seater rotation phase, which now takes place more easily, even when using high gears. In the past, in fact, we were almost forced to downshift to rotate the car in tight corners. Now however, just like in reality, we will be able to tackle them with higher gears, giving the car greater fluidity when cornering. On the other hand, the difficulty increases during deceleration, where the simulation of the brakes has changed quite clearly. Still trying to emulate the behavior of real Formula 1 cars, the brake balance now has to be shifted more towards the front axle. This is because the rear wheels tend to lock up very easily in sudden braking, especially on circuits where there is less grip with the asphalt. And then, like a cat chasing its tail, demonstrating how everything in Formula 1 is closely connected, we go back to talking about understeer, this time due to front brake balancing.
