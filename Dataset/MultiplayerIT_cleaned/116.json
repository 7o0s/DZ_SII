{"name": "Sam &amp; Max Episode 3: The Mole", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sam-amp-max-episode-3-the-mole-the-mob-and-the-meatball.html", "text": "Nothing new under the sun As usual, this too The mole, the mob and the meatball kicks off in the office of the two freelance policemen, on the usual sunny day and in the same neighborhood as always, even if, as per tradition, the main events will take place in another location, created for the occasion, which in this case will be nothing less than the Toy Mafia's hideout itself, a sort of more or less clandestine gambling den. Card games, slot machines and anything else that can be expected in such a place will keep us occupied through puzzles which, unfortunately, only partially benefit from the connection with the aforementioned, making the times seem distant when, with a Ingenious intuition, the television setting of Sam & Max Episode 2: Situation Comedy was exploited to create puzzles that reproduced its peculiarities, times and paradoxes. Better devised are the three tests to become part of the local underworld, which will lead us, always in absolutely hilarious tones, to experience the thrill of carrying out intimidations, imposing our products on local traders and lavishing ourselves in interrogations bordering on the insane . If the puzzle solving part is less brilliant than in the past - while being fun and immediate; pixel hunting is left to other titles - an attempt has been made to give more weight to the few features in which a certain use of one's reflexes is required, implementing a good driving session, greater use of the gun and a reinterpretation of the classic arcade pastime games in which with a hammer hit the moles that appear from the holes from time to time. Longevity is always around 3 hours, net of any problems related to puzzles that cannot be solved, resulting adequate to the sale price. The hard work of the (second) comic shoulders In addition to Max, Sam's inseparable companion and inexhaustible source of jokes and sarcastic comments, there are a couple of characters present in all the episodes of Season 1, each time characterized in a different way but always characterized by a precise behavioral line. Bosco is the owner of the general store on the street corner where the two detectives have their office and, with each new appointment, shows great interest in a particular culture, the French one in this last chapter, adopting its accent and exalting it commonplaces; it will also be indispensable for buying high-tech items at exorbitant prices. Another character of absolute (in)utility is Sybil, a young woman who, based on the fashion of the moment, improvises her shop as a study for psychology sessions, editorial staff for a tabloid specializing in the sighting of aliens and much more. Fantasy to the nth degree Graphics and sound reach the same, discrete levels that Telltale has accustomed us to, nothing more and nothing less, perhaps only there has been more attention to optimizing loading and eliminating some annoying slowdown that occurred when playing in a window . On the other hand, the quality of the design of settings and characters grows from time to time: the casino proposed by The mole, the mob and the meatball is characterized by attractions that never cease to remind us of the criminal origin of the money that supports it  unforgettable is the slot machine in which the lever is the arm, complete with a pistol, of a robber  while the mafiosi themselves present themselves as elegant gentle men in double-breasted suits, with the only oddity of having a funny mask in the shape of a head of teddy bear.

In any case, the fun never fails thanks to ingenious and sarcastic jokes, just as the feeling of playing an interactive cartoon is always greater. If you bought the other two chapters, don't miss it, otherwise it won't be The mole, the mob and the meatball that will change your mind. Pros Beautiful script Gives a lot of laughs The puzzles never become frustrating Cons More linear than the other chapters Remains a game for about three hours The often demented tone, you may not like it Also 2007 was finally christened by a new episodeor of Sam & Max, the third of the Season 1 series, the last to compose the first half of the work. After incredible adventures aimed at stopping a dangerous self-improvement guru and a zealous presenter, the detective dog and his trusty psychotic rabbit will this time have to contend with none other than the Toy Mafia, a dangerous organization that, not content to control a casinos and several rackets, he uses nothing less than hypnosis for his shady plans, a recurring theme of the entire series. The mole, the mob and the meatball, therefore, offers all the clichs relating to gambling and organized crime, without missing illustrious references to some films and with the usual ~chutzpah~ that we have now learned to appreciate. The best aspect of this episode is certainly the screenplay, thanks to an increasingly witty comedy punctuated by perfect timing, so much so that it manages to elicit a smile not only thanks to the texts, but also through the gestures and facial expressions of the characters.", "date": "2007-02-05", "grade": null}
