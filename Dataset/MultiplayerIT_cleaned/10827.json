{"name": "MySims", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mysims.html", "text": "Already available for Nintendo DS, MySims basically represents a ~simplified~ version of the life simulator par excellence by Electronic Arts, designed for a very young user. In fact, the protagonists of the game have a childish appearance and their adventures develop through exploration and dialogue, without placing the emphasis on economic needs or on purely physical ones. In short, unlike the various episodes of The Sims, we won't have to worry about the health of our alter ego or his job, while social relationships and minigames to try with the other characters will acquire great importance. We are therefore faced with a reinterpretation of the most popular video game series in the world, which owners of Nintendo consoles seem to appreciate and which now also arrives on mobile thanks to EA's mobile division. The conversion is immediately faithful to the spirit of the original. Our character returns to live in the city of MySims a few years after his family moved, and he does so above all out of a sort of sense of duty: he wants at all costs to restore its former glory to that place, first of all by collaborating to the restoration of a beautiful fountain which forms the heart of the town but which is currently in poor condition. The game control system is very simple and straightforward, with the d-pad used to move the character within the city and the 5 key to interact with the environment. Our alter ego must interact with the other inhabitants to unlock new ~quests~ to complete, and this is how the action develops until the end of the story. Some characters allow us to access various types of minigames, for example the mayor's nephew will make us play tennis against a wall while a sort of hermit will offer us a rod with which to fish both in clear waters and in murky ones, fish or objects . The movement between the districts is quite rapid and the game does not require additional loading: the city is immediately available for our exploratory ambitions, and we will only have to find out how to reach all the areas to be able to visit it in its entirety. Sometimes the dialogues require an initial skill test which is based on the speed of reflexes, after which we can access the information that interests us and obtain the details to start a new mission. The ultimate goal is to find all the emeralds that will restore the city's beauty to its fountain... The graphics of the game are very simple and without frills, characterized by a perhaps not exceptional but effective design. A choice of this type was evidently made to make the environment lighter to manage, given that the city can be viewed in its entirety from the outset and scrolling appears quite fluid and free of particular uncertainties. The result is a visual sector that is anything but spectacular, sometimes even coarse, but which takes up the style of what was seen on the Nintendo DS and that is enough for this kind of product. The sound consists of some MIDI music which, as usual, does not enrich or make the action more engaging: you can decide to deactivate it without hesitation. PRO Great conversion from Nintendo DS Simple and carefree Nice graphics... AGAINST ...but far from exceptional Thicknessless gameplay Intended for a very young user", "date": "2009-03-11", "grade": "S.V."}
