On the other hand, the English investigator is the genius of the clue, the master of puzzles and above all he is not afraid of anything, which places him in dark, dangerous but above all engaging situations. Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles is a casual, simple and user friendly seek and find adventure. Esotericism, logic and a mysterious truth to unravel are the main ingredients of a skein that must be resolved by turning every room of the Baskerville manor house, the cursed family whose members have mysteriously disappeared or been mauled by what appears to be a huge hound. Each room of the family villa bears the signs of who occupied it, contains his personal effects and hides a partial truth, a piece of an obscure puzzle that must be completed to reach its conclusion. The story is intriguing, even if given the source of inspiration it is minimal, and can be followed with short dialogues but quite faithful to the atmospheres of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel. Nothing transcendental, this is obvious, but suitable for the spirit of Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles which seeks to entertain lightly while requiring a mental commitment. Everything takes place in more or less fixed screens, except for some animations of a few frames that show changes and lighting effects. The atmosphere is rendered quite well even if the animations are reduced to the bone and not all the rooms are designed with the same care. Furthermore, many environments are too full of elements thrown in bulk to be pleasing to the eye, but this is a necessity given that one of the main objectives is precisely to rummage through the objects in search of important elements. Search, find, repair, solve The aim of the game is to collect seven heraldic symbols connected to as many members of the Baskerville family, to complete a medallion that should lead us to the final solution. To do this it will be necessary to explore the thirty-five locations of the villa, observe every corner and use the skills that are acquired after completing each symbol. The primary objective is to recover the components necessary to complete some mechanisms that divide us from some fundamental elements of the adventure and at this juncture it is necessary to remember in which enigma the piece just found is needed or in which room is the object that it can help us recover a component. Once the missing fragments have been collected, one of the numerous mechanisms is completed and an enigma is activated which must obviously be solved. And these are the heart of the title, the most intriguing part, and there are many. It starts from the classic list of objects to be identified in a room to get to more intricate puzzles even if never too difficult given the intuitive and simple nature of the title. In fact, the puzzles are often too short or too simple or both but nevertheless some are sufficiently amusing and properly articulate the search for the seven symbols of the Baskervilles massacred by the mastiff or whoever for him. Unfortunately, even in this case there is a magic key that allows you to skip the puzzle completely and which we strongly advise against using. These things are like cherries, click once and here you are at the end of the game with a bad taste in your mouth because the adventure would end in a few moments. All help possible The aids are an integral part of the casual identity of this kind of game, but they are also one of those elements that risk cutting off its full enjoyment. With the help button it is possible to instantly know the next move to make and even if the option has a recharging period, this is really too fast and the aids are infinite. In addition, there are also automatic shortcuts that instantly take us to a room although they are only activated at certain times and finally there is the strategic guide button in plain sight on the game interface, tempting even the most hardened. Therefore it is recommended to resist the temptation to fully enjoy Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles and feel satisfaction by finding a hidden clue or solving a puzzle; but even in this case the facilities are often excessive even for a casual title. There are also some forced elements, such as the need to have the superpower of force to break a vase, but the esoteric elements amplify the possibilities of interaction with the rooms in the house. Indeed, it becomes possible to observe the environments in the past, just after the attack of the mastiff, and yes ampthey clarify the possibilities of interaction with the environments which therefore become richer. Everything is underlined by a good audio sector and the dialogues, which if it is true that they are strictly in English - but this is not necessarily a bad thing given the British nature of the character - it must be said that they are subtitled in Italian and can be read comfortably and without losing any detail given the static nature of the interlude scenes.", "date": "2011-04-21", "grade": "7.0"}
