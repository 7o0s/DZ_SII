Then the presence of some bonus blocks adds that pinch of strategy that never hurts in a puzzle game. The colored series of blocks that we are going to create will not disappear immediately, as happened in Tetris, but only with the passage of a time bar which will inexorably mark the progress of our game from left to right. The game has remained practically unchanged from the Sony counterpart and presents the user with different modes in the 'Single Play Mode': arcade, challenge, vs cpu, single skin, time attack, and puzzle. In Arcade mode we'll be confronted with increasingly difficult levels where we'll even have to face real Bosses who will be nothing more than adversaries controlled directly by the CPU of our mobile phone. There are only two difficulty levels available but they manage to keep the challenge level and longevity high as, in order to be able to say that you have finished the game 100%, both must be completed. Challenge mode is nothing more than a single player game with the aim of getting the best possible score within some predefined levels. Vs CPU will allow us to take the field and collide directly against an opponent controlled by the artificial intelligence of our mobile phone. Single Skin is, however, a variant of the Challenge mode where we can select the background of the playing field on which to compete. Time Attack is a real time challenge in which we will have to try to score as many points as possible in 90, 180, 300 and 600 seconds respectively. Puzzle Mode, last but not least, completes the picture of the available modes, we will have to recreate the shape that is proposed to us with the colored blocks that are gradually offered to us. Obviously, as the levels progress, the shapes to be reproduced will be increasingly complex and the challenge proposed will increase accordingly.
